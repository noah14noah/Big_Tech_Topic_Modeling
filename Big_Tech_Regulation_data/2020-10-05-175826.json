That report is expected to be released next week.    Republican Representative Ken Buck of Colorado, who has worked closely with Cicilline on the probe, told Bloomberg TV on Thursday that he expects the committee\u2019s report next week.    \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure that we keep high tech competitive so that smaller, innovative companies can compete,\u201d said Buck, noting that that the report could be bipartisan but he had not yet read it.    Sundar Pichai, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg testified voluntarily in July before the subcommittee. Cicilline criticized their testimony as being evasive and non-responsive and said \u201cthey raised new questions about whether they believe their companies are beyond oversight.\u201d    Representatives from Apple, Facebook and Google didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment on Cicilline\u2019s remarks. Amazon declined to comment.    Among the recommendations that Cicilline has floated is a prohibition against running a platform and competing on it at the same time. That would potentially bar Google from bidding in the online ad exchanges it operates or stop Amazon from providing a marketplace for independent merchants while selling its own products.    Cicilline has said he wants bipartisan support for his ideas, but hasn\u2019t revealed whether he has Republican support for his proposals.    The GOP typically views changes to antitrust law skeptically. Although some of the committee\u2019s Republicans have been critical of some of the technology companies\u2019 practices, not all agree that new legislation is necessary.    \u201cWe ultimately disagree on the future of antitrust laws,\u201d said Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, who is the top Republican on the subcommittee. He suggested he wants to see improved enforcement of existing laws, but is opposed to changes that would prompt break-ups of the companies.    For decades, the internet giants have enjoyed laissez-faire regulation in the U.S., including scant antitrust enforcement of mergers. Still, they are coming under increasing attack in Washington over a range of issues including misinformation, hate speech, election meddling, and what Republicans decry as anti-conservative bias.    In addition to Cicilline\u2019s investigation, federal and state antitrust enforcers are poised to file a historic monopolization lawsuit against Google, and additional cases could be in the pipeline, Bloomberg has reported. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is also preparing a possible case against Facebook. Amazon and Apple are also facing inquiries by federal antitrust authorities.    Witnesses at the hearing included Bill Baer, a former Justice Department antitrust chief under President Obama; Zephyr Teachout, a law professor at Fordham University known for progressive views on antitrust; and Rachel Bovard of the conservative-allied Internet Accountability Project.    Baer called for Congress to pass legislation to make it easier for enforcers to stop mergers because past court rulings have made it too hard for the government to win cases. It\u2019s \u201cnearly impossible\u201d to stop dominant companies from buying smaller rivals that could become future competitors, like Facebook\u2019s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, he said.    \u201cWhen you look at Instagram or WhatsApp and you look at some of the documents that were revealed in this subcommittee\u2019s most recent hearing, these were companies that potentially either on their own or in combination with other companies had potential to be rivals,\u201d he said. \u201cCurrent law does not allow the FTC or my old place the antitrust division to challenge those transactions.\u201d    During the hearing, Representative Jim Jordan, a close ally of President Donald Trump who is the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee that includes the antitrust panel, sidestepped competition and reiterated his allegations that the companies systematically silence against conservatives.    He outlined a bill that would remove liability protections for the tech companies as an effort to curb the alleged political bias, which the companies deny. Conservatives have ramped up their attacks on the legal shield, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which allows the companies to avoid lawsuits over users\u2019 content.    Jordan\u2019s bill seeks to narrow the broad discretion digital platoforms have to remove content under the law -- a provision that conservatives say enables the companies to silence them. The bill would let companies remove only content defined as violent extremism, harassment, self-harm, obscenity and other categories.    Tech allies have said that similar measures would further pollute the online environment by making it more difficult to take down content. The bill has overlaps with a Senate bill led by Commerce Committee Chairman Roger Wicker and Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham.    \u201cUnder the new law, platforms would be required to have publicly available terms of service that state plainly how content moderation decisions are being made,\u201d Jordan said during his remarks. He said if a platform does take down content, it has to give the user notice to explain why it is removing the content and give the user an opportunity to respond.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

That report is expected to be released as early as next week, according to people familiar with the matter.   Sundar Pichai, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg testified voluntarily in July before the subcommittee. Cicilline criticized their testimony as being evasive and non-responsive and said \u201cthey raised new questions about whether they believe their companies are beyond oversight.\u201d   Among the recommendations that Cicilline has floated is a prohibition against running a platform and competing on it at the same time. That would potentially bar Google from bidding in the online ad exchanges it operates or stop Amazon from providing a marketplace for independent merchants while selling its own products.   Cicilline has said he wants bipartisan support for his ideas, but hasn\u2019t revealed whether he has Republican support for his proposals.   The GOP typically views changes to antitrust law skeptically. Although some of the committee\u2019s Republicans have been critical of some of the technology companies\u2019 practices, not all agree that new legislation is necessary.   \u201cWe ultimately disagree on the future of antitrust laws,\u201d said Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, who is the top Republican on the subcommittee. He suggested he wants to see improved enforcement of existing laws, but is opposed to changes that would prompt break-ups of the companies.   For decades, the internet giants have enjoyed laissez-faire regulation in the U.S., including scant antitrust enforcement of mergers. Still, they are coming under increasing attack in Washington over a range of issues including misinformation, hate speech, election meddling, and what Republicans decry as anti-conservative bias.   In addition to Cicilline\u2019s investigation, federal and state antitrust enforcers are poised to file a historic monopolization lawsuit against Google, and additional cases could be in the pipeline, Bloomberg has reported. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is also preparing a possible case against Facebook. Amazon and Apple are also facing inquiries by federal antitrust authorities.   \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

On T...</p><p>Congress' more than year-long investigation into four of the world's most valuable tech companies is nearing its final stages, paving the way for new legal proposals that could drastically alter antitrust enforcement in the U.S. for the years to come. On Thursday, the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust held its seventh and final hearing in a series examining the state of competition in digital markets and the business practices of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. A report on the investigation is expected to include findings from the investigation and broad legislative proposals.  Congress' more than year-long investigation into four of the world's most valuable tech companies is nearing its final stages, paving the way for new legal proposals that could drastically alter antitrust enforcement in the U.S. for the years to come.   On Thursday, the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust held its seventh and final hearing in a series examining the health of competition in digital markets and the business practices of Amazon , Apple , Facebook and Google . The event was not as splashy as the subcommittee's July hearing featuring the four tech CEOs and it also took about half the time.   But the nitty-gritty legal questions at this latest hearing displayed a group of lawmakers nearing the final stage of a long-awaited conclusion to their tech probe.   Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., summarized the recurring themes from the expert witnesses at the end of the hearing for how to reform the laws. Those themes included:  Shifting the burden to dominant companies to prove their mergers will not harm competition, rather than forcing investigators to prove that a merger will harm competition. Separating different lines of business to weed out conflicts of interest. Beefing up resources at enforcement agencies. Prohibiting companies from \"discriminatory behavior.\" (He didn't expand on this point, but could have been talking about how companies promote and price their own products.) Reversing court decisions that have \"changed the intention of Congress\" on antitrust law.   A congressional aide for a Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the process, told CNBC that committee members anticipate reviewing the report in the coming days before releasing it publicly.   So far, it seems the subcommittee staff has held the report closely. But Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., said in an interview Wednesday that, based on conversations with Cicilline and staff, he expects it will include an overview of the investigation's findings as well as broad legislative recommendations. Buck had not yet seen the report as of Wednesday.   Subcommittee Ranking Member Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., who does not support updates to the antitrust laws, said in his opening testimony that enforcement of existing laws needs to step up. But he also noted reports that the Justice Department may soon bring an antitrust case against Google as evidence that change is already underway.  What experts want  Thursday's hearing featured a panel of antitrust experts who offered advice and feedback to lawmakers on what they should consider in their reforms.   For example, Bill Baer, a former antitrust chief at both the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice, told lawmakers it had become \"nearly impossible\" for enforcers to challenge mergers of potentially competitive nascent players. He and others on the panel suggested shifting the burden from the government to dominant firms to prove their deals would not harm competition.   Fordham Law Professor Zephyr Teachout discussed the need for a structural separation of businesses that pose a potential conflict of interest. Cicilline recently discussed a similar idea of a \"Glass-Steagall\" type of reform, referring to the legislation that separated banks' commercial and investing arms. That could mean separating Amazon's marketplace for third-party vendors from its private label business, where it sells Amazon-branded products, or limiting Apple's ability to include and promote its own apps on its App Store, for instance. Enforcement advocates, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have argued that dominant firms can favor their own businesses when they are allowed to both own a platform and participate on it.  'Bipartisan sweet spot'  As the investigation reaches this late stage, several committee members have publicly praised the continued bipartisan nature of the investigation. Buck told CNBC that such bipartisanship is important to send a strong message to the tech companies.   \"I think the next stage is to issue a report and to make it as bipartisan as possible and make sure that we are not sending a message to the tech companies that there is a division on Capitol Hill,\" Buck said. \"We need to be united in this and make sure that we do not go off into tangents on either side.\"   Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., focused their questions at Thursday's hearing on alleged conservative bias by the tech platforms, spending more time discussing potential reforms to tech's legal liability shield, Section 230, than the antitrust laws. But Buck and Rep. Kelly Armstrong, R-N.D., kept their questioning more narrow to competition policy and displayed their support for reform and adding resources for enforcers.   Buck said in the interview that while he is a \"small government Republican\" and \"fiscal conservative,\" he believes the budgets of the FTC and DOJ don't allow sufficient staff for investigations of resource-rich firms. However, he does not support the creation of a new agency to regulate the tech industry like some Democrats do.   Formal bills, if they are even introduced in the coming months, will likely not make it far until the next Congress, during which there will be many priorities jostling for attention. But Thursday's hearing shows sustained interest from members of both political parties over the long investigation.   To pass legislation, Buck told CNBC, it will be important for lawmakers to focus on the areas on which they can agree.   \"I think we really need to find this bipartisan sweet spot and recommend fixing some targeted areas that would enhance the role of the government in promoting competition,\" he said.

That has the potential of damaging the brands\u2019 reputations.</p><p>The companies, once held up as beacons of American ingenuity and business acumen, have been under siege about spreading disinformation, failing to respect users\u2019 privacy and maneuvering to minimize their taxes.

Douglas Melamed, a former antitrust official in Justice Department. \u201cAnd that frightens people.\u201d</p><p>House lawmakers were expected to demand internal corporate documents and communications as part of their antitrust investigation. But such demands are often made to a company\u2019s top lawyer. And the committee asked for all communications related to a long list of corporate actions, like Google\u2019s purchase of ad companies, Facebook\u2019s acquisitions of other social networks and Amazon\u2019s handling of its private-label products.</p><p>By releasing its requests, the House committee offered a glimpse of the depth of the scrutiny that the companies will face and laid out the lines of investigation. The lawmakers are looking for signs of executives\u2019 intent when they made decisions that harmed competitors, according to a person close to the congressional investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the lawmakers\u2019 plans were private.</p><p>The information the committee collects can also feed the other investigations, and help lawmakers more sharply question witnesses under oath in hearings, said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University.</p><p>\u201cThose interrogations take on an entirely different tone,\u201d said Mr. Kovacic, a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cThis is a significant escalation of the process.\u201d</p><p>The inquiries into individual companies are complex; the tech giants span a range of digital markets, including internet search, advertising, e-commerce and social media. And the companies are likely to resist some of the requests, contending they could reveal trade secrets.</p><p>The companies will almost certainly try to narrow the scope and reduce the volume of the documents they deliver. But the House investigators have leverage. These are document \u201crequests\u201d but backed by the threat of subpoenas if the companies do not comply.</p><p>The communications habits of the individual companies will also play a role in determining how much evidence there is and in what form.</p><p>At Amazon, for example, Mr. Bezos writes brief emails to make announcements or delegate, but largely gives feedback and discusses issues in person. He is well known internally for forwarding customer complaints to staffers with just a \u201c?,\u201d leaving teams scrambling to resolve the issue.</p><p>He has developed a rigid process for making decisions at Amazon that heavily relies on paper documents \u2014 called six-pagers for their length \u2014 that lay out the plan and reasoning for a proposed strategy. They often include hefty appendices and are presented to executives in long meetings where they are read and discussed.</p><p>But there are numerous examples of tech executives\u2019 correspondence turning up as evidence in legal cases. Emails from Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder, were key evidence in the Justice Department\u2019s successful lawsuit against Apple for conspiring to raise the prices of e-books.</p><p>\u201cWow, we have really lit the fuse on a powder keg,\u201d Mr. Jobs <url normalizedValue=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/story-type/letter/competition-digital-markets-document-request-91319\">wrote in a 2010 email</url> to a colleague after Apple opened an e-bookstore that prompted Amazon to change how it sold e-books.</p><p>In response to the committee\u2019s requests, representatives of the companies mainly pointed to their previous public statements: They have consistently said they would cooperate with the federal and state investigations, and would seek to demonstrate that they operate in dynamic, highly competitive markets.</p><p>In a statement, Representative David Cicilline, the chairman of the subcommittee on antitrust, which is leading the Judiciary Committee\u2019s investigation, called the document requests \u201can important milestone\u201d in the fact-gathering stage.</p><p>Mr. Cicilline also emphasized the effort\u2019s bipartisan nature. The letters to chief executives are signed by Mr. Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat; Representative Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee; and the ranking Republicans on the committee and the subcommittee, Representatives Doug Collins of Georgia and Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.</p><p>The formal requests for information begin with cover letters to the chief executives, saying the investigators are examining competition in online markets and \u201cwhether dominant firms are engaging in anticompetitive conduct.\u201d The letters are accompanied by detailed lists of the requested documents and communications.</p><p>It is unclear how much investigative work will become public as the various inquiries progress. At later stages, when investigators are trying to lay the groundwork for a suit, they won\u2019t want to show their hand to a potential corporate defendant.</p><p>Such work \u2014 collecting more documents, taking depositions, assembling evidence and building the narrative of corporate misbehavior \u2014 is best done in secrecy. Major antitrust investigations typically last many months or years.</p><p>Sometimes, companies themselves make disclosures about an investigation. Google, for example, said last week that its parent company, Alphabet, had received a mandatory request for information from the Justice Department about previous antitrust investigations.</p><p>The House\u2019s document requests indicate that its staff has closely studied the companies.</p><p>The request sent to Google, for example, seeks communications to or from senior executives on a series of company moves including Google\u2019s purchase of DoubleClick in 2008 and AdMob in 2011. Those acquisitions helped build up Google\u2019s huge and lucrative ad business.</p><p>House investigators also want to see the executives\u2019 communications on Google practices: One request is for communications on its policy on \u201cwhether non-Google companies can provide competing ad networks\u201d and other services.</p><p>That part of the House inquiry echoes that of the states\u2019 investigation of Google. The Texas attorney general\u2019s office, which is leading that effort, sent Google a lengthy demand this week for information on its ad business, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.</p><p>But the House investigation is broader. Its request touches other businesses, including smartphone software, seeking information on Google\u2019s purchase of Android in 2005.</p><p>The House requests for the other companies are similarly detailed. From Amazon, the investigators asked for information on fees charged to sellers on its online marketplace, algorithms for ranking products for sale, favored treatment for Amazon-branded products and bundling of marketing benefits for vendors that also use the company\u2019s distribution service, Fulfillment by Amazon.</p><p>The House committee asked Apple about its technology for <url normalizedValue=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/story-type/letter/competition-digital-markets-document-request-91319\">ranking apps in its App Store</url>, its policy on links to non-Apple payment systems and whether iPhone users can choose non-Apple services by default.</p><p>The document sent to Facebook asks for extensive internal information about its acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, which were potentially emerging competitors until they were bought.</p><p>The House committee asks for company documents related to the \u201cstrategic value\u201d and \u201cany antitrust risks associated with acquiring\u201d those companies.</p><p>The House document also requests information on any Facebook decisions that limit third-party apps\u2019 access, including a version of the company\u2019s \u201cplatform policy,\u201d which it withdrew last year and could be read as a policy intended to keep competing technology off Facebook.</p><p>According to the House document, the policy said apps should \u201cadd something unique to the community\u201d and continued, \u201cDon\u2019t replicate core functionality that Facebook already provides.\u201d</p><p>Karen Weise contributed reporting from Seattle, and Jack Nicas from San Francisco. </p><p>PHOTO: The Manhattan offices of Google, which is among the four big tech companies that received a House panel\u2019s requests for documents.

That has the potential of damaging the brands' reputations.</p><p>The companies, once held up as beacons of American ingenuity and business acumen, have been under siege about spreading disinformation, failing to respect users' privacy and maneuvering to minimize their taxes. In addition, President Trump and other Republicans accuse some of the companies of censoring conservative voices.</p><p>Similar inquiries are underway at the Justice Department, at the Federal Trade Commission and by attorneys general of dozens of states. The investigations are just beginning in earnest. How far they will go, what they will uncover and whether any allegations will stand up in court are all uncertain.</p><p>But the investigations show the growing angst about the power of the tech companies, which for decades faced little regulation. Now Silicon Valley's influence on everything from how we vote to how we shop is readily apparent - and yet the technology driving it remains largely mysterious.</p><p>\"There is this great and growing dependence on technology that we don't really understand,\" said A. Douglas Melamed, a former antitrust official in Justice Department. \"And that frightens people.\"</p><p>House lawmakers were expected to demand internal corporate documents and communications as part of their antitrust investigation. But such demands are often made to a company's top lawyer. And the committee asked for all communications related to a long list of corporate actions, like Google's purchase of ad companies, Facebook's acquisitions of other social networks and Amazon's handling of its private-label products.</p><p>By releasing its requests, the House committee offered a glimpse of the depth of the scrutiny that the companies will face and laid out the lines of investigation. The lawmakers are looking for signs of executives' intent when they made decisions that harmed competitors, according to a person close to the congressional investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the lawmakers' plans were private.</p><p>The information the committee collects can also feed the other investigations, and help lawmakers more sharply question witnesses under oath in hearings, said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University.</p><p>\"Those interrogations take on an entirely different tone,\" said Mr. Kovacic, a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. \"This is a significant escalation of the process.\"</p><p>The inquiries into individual companies are complex; the tech giants span a range of digital markets, including internet search, advertising, e-commerce and social media. And the companies are likely to resist some of the requests, contending they could reveal trade secrets.</p><p>The companies will almost certainly try to narrow the scope and reduce the volume of the documents they deliver. But the House investigators have leverage. These are document \"requests\" but backed by the threat of subpoenas if the companies do not comply.</p><p>The communications habits of the individual companies will also play a role in determining how much evidence there is and in what form.</p><p>At Amazon, for example, Mr. Bezos writes brief emails to make announcements or delegate, but largely gives feedback and discusses issues in person. He is well known internally for forwarding customer complaints to staffers with just a \"?,\" leaving teams scrambling to resolve the issue.</p><p>He has developed a rigid process for making decisions at Amazon that heavily relies on paper documents - called six-pagers for their length - that lay out the plan and reasoning for a proposed strategy. They often include hefty appendices and are presented to executives in long meetings where they are read and discussed.</p><p>But there are numerous examples of tech executives' correspondence turning up as evidence in legal cases. Emails from Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder, were key evidence in the Justice Department's successful lawsuit against Apple for conspiring to raise the prices of e-books.</p><p>\"Wow, we have really lit the fuse on a powder keg,\" Mr. Jobs wrote in a 2010 email to a colleague after Apple opened an e-bookstore that prompted Amazon to change how it sold e-books.</p><p>In response to the committee's requests, representatives of the companies mainly pointed to their previous public statements: They have consistently said they would cooperate with the federal and state investigations, and would seek to demonstrate that they operate in dynamic, highly competitive markets.</p><p>In a statement, Representative David Cicilline, the chairman of the subcommittee on antitrust, which is leading the Judiciary Committee's investigation, called the document requests \"an important milestone\" in the fact-gathering stage.</p><p>Mr. Cicilline also emphasized the effort's bipartisan nature. The letters to chief executives are signed by Mr. Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat; Representative Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee; and the ranking Republicans on the committee and the subcommittee, Representatives Doug Collins of Georgia and Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.</p><p>The formal requests for information begin with cover letters to the chief executives, saying the investigators are examining competition in online markets and \"whether dominant firms are engaging in anticompetitive conduct.\" The letters are accompanied by detailed lists of the requested documents and communications.</p><p>It is unclear how much investigative work will become public as the various inquiries progress. At later stages, when investigators are trying to lay the groundwork for a suit, they won't want to show their hand to a potential corporate defendant.</p><p>Such work - collecting more documents, taking depositions, assembling evidence and building the narrative of corporate misbehavior - is best done in secrecy. Major antitrust investigations typically last many months or years.</p><p>Sometimes, companies themselves make disclosures about an investigation. Google, for example, said last week that its parent company, Alphabet, had received a mandatory request for information from the Justice Department about previous antitrust investigations.</p><p>The House's document requests indicate that its staff has closely studied the companies.</p><p>The request sent to Google, for example, seeks communications to or from senior executives on a series of company moves including Google's purchase of DoubleClick in 2008 and AdMob in 2011. Those acquisitions helped build up Google's huge and lucrative ad business.</p><p>House investigators also want to see the executives' communications on Google practices: One request is for communications on its policy on \"whether non-Google companies can provide competing ad networks\" and other services.</p><p>That part of the House inquiry echoes that of the states' investigation of Google. The Texas attorney general's office, which is leading that effort, sent Google a lengthy demand this week for information on its ad business, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.</p><p>But the House investigation is broader. Its request touches other businesses, including smartphone software, seeking information on Google's purchase of Android in 2005.</p><p>The House requests for the other companies are similarly detailed. From Amazon, the investigators asked for information on fees charged to sellers on its online marketplace, algorithms for ranking products for sale, favored treatment for Amazon-branded products and bundling of marketing benefits for vendors that also use the company's distribution service, Fulfillment by Amazon.</p><p>The House committee asked Apple about its technology for ranking apps in its App Store, its policy on links to non-Apple payment systems and whether iPhone users can choose non-Apple services by default.</p><p>The document sent to Facebook asks for extensive internal information about its acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, which were potentially emerging competitors until they were bought.</p><p>The House committee asks for company documents related to the \"strategic value\" and \"any antitrust risks associated with acquiring\" those companies.</p><p>The House document also requests information on any Facebook decisions that limit third-party apps' access, including a version of the company's \"platform policy,\" which it withdrew last year and could be read as a policy intended to keep competing technology off Facebook.</p><p>According to the House document, the policy said apps should \"add something unique to the community\" and continued, \"Don't replicate core functionality that Facebook already provides.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Karen Weise contributed reporting from Seattle, and Jack Nicas from San Francisco. </emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006715818</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X29-GF71-DYR7-C000-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1602\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 16, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That has the potential of damaging  the brands' reputation. They are already dealing with questions  about spreading disinformation, failing to respect users' privacy  and maneuvering to minimize their taxes.</p><p> The requests come as similar inquiries are underway at the  Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and by attorneys  general of dozens of states. The investigations are just beginning  in earnest. How far the inquiries will go, what they will uncover  and if any allegations will stand up in court are all uncertain.</p><p> But the investigations show the growing angst about the tech  companies' power. For decades, the industry has been held up as a  beacon of American ingenuity and business acumen, and it faced  little regulation. Now, though, Silicon Valley's influence on  everything from how we vote to how we shop is readily apparent --  and yet the technology driving it remains largely mysterious.</p><p> 'GROWING DEPENDENCE'</p><p> \"There is this great and growing dependence on technology that  we don't really understand,\" said A. Douglas Melamed, a former  antitrust official in Justice Department. \"And that frightens  people.\"</p><p> House lawmakers were expected to demand internal corporate  documents and communications as part of their antitrust  investigations. But such demands are often made to a company's top  lawyer. And the committee asked for all communications related to a  long list of corporate actions, from companies acquired to the  treatment of potential rivals.</p><p> By releasing its requests, the House committee offered a  glimpse of the depth of the scrutiny that the companies will face  and laid out the lines of investigation being pursued. The  lawmakers are looking for signs of tech executives' intent when  they made decisions that harmed competitors, according to a person  close to the congressional investigation who spoke on the condition  of anonymity because the lawmakers' plans were private.</p><p> The information the committee collects can also feed the other  investigations and help lawmakers more sharply question witnesses  under oath in hearings, said William Kovacic, a law professor at  George Washington University.</p><p> \"Those interrogations take on an entirely different tone,\" said  Kovacic, a former chairman of the FTC. \"This is a significant  escalation of the process.\"</p><p> The inquiries into individual companies are complex; the tech  giants span a range of digital markets, including internet search,  advertising, e-commerce and social media. And the companies are  likely to resist some of the requests, contending they could reveal  trade secrets.</p><p> The companies will almost certainly try to narrow the scope and  reduce the volume of the documents they deliver. But the House  investigators have leverage. These are document \"requests\" but  backed by the threat of subpoenas if the companies do not comply.</p><p> COMMUNICATION HABITS</p><p> The communications habits of the individual companies will also  play a role in determining how much evidence there is and in what  form.</p><p> At Amazon, for example, Bezos writes brief emails to make  announcements or delegate, but largely gives feedback and discusses  issues in person. He is well known internally for forwarding  customer complaints to staffers with just a \"?,\" leaving teams  scrambling to resolve the issue.</p><p> He has developed a rigid process for making decisions at Amazon  that heavily relies on paper documents -- called six-pagers for  their length -- that lay out the plan and reasoning for a proposed  strategy. They often include hefty appendices and are presented to  executives in long meetings where they are read and discussed.</p><p> But there are numerous examples of tech executives'  correspondence turning up as evidence in legal cases. Emails from  Steve Jobs, the late Apple co-founder, were key evidence in the  Justice Department's successful lawsuit against Apple for  conspiring to raise the prices of e-books.</p><p> \"Wow, we have really lit the fuse on a powder keg,\" Jobs wrote  in a 2010 email to a colleague after Apple opened an e-bookstore  that prompted Amazon to change how it sold e-books.</p><p> In response to the committee's requests, representatives of the  companies mainly pointed to their previous statements: They have  consistently said that they would cooperate with the federal and  state investigations and would seek to demonstrate that they  operate in dynamic, highly competitive markets.</p><p> In a statement, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who leads the  subcommittee on antitrust, which is conducting the House  investigation, called the document requests \"an important  milestone\" in the fact-gathering stage.</p><p> Cicilline also emphasized the effort's bipartisan nature. The  letters to chief executives are signed by Cicilline and Jerrold  Nadler, D-N.Y., chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and also the  ranking Republican members of the Judiciary Committee and the  antitrust subcommittee, Doug Collins of Georgia and James  Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYGAZ-DLYGAZ20190914Ar00400</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYGAZ2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X22-P5S1-DXVP-V2F2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388131</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"973\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Daily Gazette Co.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The committee has received tens of thousands of documents from Facebook Inc, Alphabet's Google , Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc and is expecting more material in the coming weeks, Representative David Cicilline told reporters. \"Our hope is to conclude our evidence collection end of this year, beginning of next year with the idea that we will have a final report, instead of recommendations in the first part of next year,\" said Cicilline, a Democrat. He made the comments at a hearing to discuss the effect of consumer data collection by big technology platforms on online competition. </p><p>Rohit Chopra, Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, as well as experts from Harvard Kennedy School and the American Enterprise Institute participated in the hearing. Vast troves of consumer data collected by big technology companies allow them to gain a competitive edge and pose a threat to competition by creating entry barriers, Chopra said. Personal data is powering the dominance of tech companies that offer basic services for free, which are ultimately not free, he added. Chopra also said small fines and financial penalties will not be enough to address concerns about the power of big tech firms, adding that regulators will need to take a closer look at that. For example, earlier this year the FTC fined Facebook Inc US$5 billion (\u00a33.9 billion) over online privacy. Chopra voted against that decision. There are several probes at the federal, state and congressional level aimed at determining if big technology companies use their considerable clout in the online market illegally to hurt rivals or otherwise break competition law. Once lauded as engines of economic growth, these companies have increasingly been on the defensive over their outsized market influence. Politicians including President Donald Trump, consumers, other firms and regulators have criticized that power. - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12015262</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X9F-GVC1-JCDN-11X4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"361\"/><timeReceived>8:06 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

The fear is that these companies have gotten too big. This antitrust investigation has gathered 1.3 million documents as evidence. And this week, it all came to a head as the leaders of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google testified before a House committee over video chat, of course. All four of those companies are NPR sponsors. The chair, Democrat David Cicilline of Rhode Island, said these companies have too much power.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>DAVID CICILLINE:                 This investigation also goes to the heart of whether we as a people govern ourselves or whether we let ourselves be governed by private monopolies.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 Congressman Cicilline has been leading the investigation and joins us now. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.             </p><p>DAVID CICILLINE:                 Thank you. It's great to be with you.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 So after a year-plus of this investigation, what did you learn from this hearing that you didn't know before?             </p><p>DAVID CICILLINE:                 I think what we mostly heard was the things that we have been very focused on in terms of the market dominance of these platforms. And using that market dominance to favor their own products and services, to bully competitors, to weaponize data, to harm consumer privacy and a variety of other anti-competitive behaviors were really acknowledged by these four witnesses. They really didn't have any defense to many of the business practices that were the subject of the questions.             </p><p>                And so, you know, we will now complete the process of writing a report that will describe this digital marketplace broadly and then make some recommendations in terms of legislation and regulatory action to get competition back into the digital marketplace.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 What you're saying sounds very damning. But after the hearing ended, stocks went up for most of these companies. Does that suggest that the punches failed to land?             </p><p>DAVID CICILLINE:                 Oh, no, not at all. I mean, look - I think that's further evidence that these four companies have monopoly power. So it doesn't surprise me that, in the middle of a global health pandemic, they are, you know, growing their market power.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 You say Congress needs to take action to infuse competition into the marketplace. Do you know what that looks like?             </p><p>DAVID CICILLINE:                 Well, I mean, there's a number of things we can do. I mean, one is obviously structural remedies. One is breaking up companies. You know, Facebook - I think it's clear from the hearing - should have never been permitted to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp. You know, putting in place a set of prohibitions against favoring your own products and services - you know, Amazon is an example. Mr. Bezos could not assure us that the information that they collect from third-party sellers was not being used to guide Amazon's development of its own product line and marketing.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 So socks are selling well, and Amazon says, it sounds like we should be manufacturing socks.             </p><p>DAVID CICILLINE:                 Right. We've heard from a number of small businesses about the bullying of Amazon, but they feel like they have no choice. You know, they control a vast majority of online sales. And frankly, most small businesses say, if you're not on Amazon, you can't survive. So they're using their market power, their dominance, to bully competitors, to give unfair advantage to them. And that can only happen because of the size and the power they have in the marketplace.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 Your Republican counterpart, Jim Sensenbrenner, had a different perspective, and I want to listen to part of what he had to say at this hearing.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>JIM SENSENBRENNER:                 I have reached the conclusion that we do not need to change our antitrust laws. They have been working just fine. The question here is the question of enforcement of those antitrust laws.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 So do you think that the Democrats and the Republicans are on the same page here?             </p><p>DAVID CICILLINE:                 You know, the investigation has been very bipartisan all throughout. And I think that everyone recognizes the very serious challenges in the digital marketplace. I disagree a little bit with Mr. Sensenbrenner in that I don't think the antitrust laws have been working fine. I agree with him that there hasn't been good enforcement.             </p><p>                And so the question is, do the existing antitrust laws provide enough assistance to antitrust enforcers to actually get the job done? Do we need folks that are creative and sufficiently enthusiastic about this work? Do the antitrust agencies have the resources they need? That's one of the things we're going to look at. My sense is that we're going to have to modernize and update our antitrust statutes in some way to more accurately reflect the kind of competition challenges we face in the digital marketplace.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 These companies are still very popular with the American people. Do you worry that you're on the wrong side of public opinion here?             </p><p>DAVID CICILLINE:                 No, this isn't about popularity. I think people are beginning to understand that these platforms have monopoly power and that monopolies are not good for our democracy. They've never been. We've always been in this battle between democracy and private monopolies. And I think we have a responsibility to make that case to the American people, and I think part of our report will be dedicated to why this matters to folks.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 That's Congressman David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, chair of the House antitrust subcommittee. Thank you for speaking with us today.             </p><p>DAVID CICILLINE:                 My pleasure. Thank you for having me.             </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRATC-2020073106</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRATC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GP-GGT1-DY2S-N03P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1058\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR All Things Considered</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

If members could take seats and we're going to begin.   </p><p>      Again, the chair recognizes the gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Palazzo...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALAZZO</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  ... for the purpose of an amendment. You have an amendment at the desk. Would you consider it read? Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALAZZO</emphasis>:  Yes, I ask that it be considered read.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Good. And you're recognized to present your amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALAZZO</emphasis>:  All right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Please give Mr. Palazzo your attention.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALAZZO</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, this is a simple amendment that would increase funding for community development financial institutions, otherwise known as CDFIs. Unfortunately, the committee mark proposed a $59 million reduction in funding from fiscal year 2018 levels.  </p><p>      But with the help of the chairman of the subcommittee and his wonderful staff, we've been able to find a path forward. My amendment would take the first step towards returning these essential funds by reallocating $25 million to make up a part of the shortfall.  </p><p>      For those of you who aren't familiar, CDFI banks take a small amount of public money to leverage private investment in communities that are traditionally underserved with historically high poverty rates.  </p><p>      For every $1 of public investments in CDFIs over $12 of private investment are used to support for small businesses, create jobs and revitalize the most impoverished communities in America.  </p><p>      In addition, they help put millions on the road to buying homes and establishing personal financial security. They also provide essential financial literacy education to their customers. I know many of you on this committee represent areas with high poverty rates.  </p><p>      CDFIs are active in your communities and are essential sources of banking for many of our most underserved. I ask my colleagues to support the amendment and I yield back the balance of my time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROGERS</emphasis>:  Will the gentleman yield before you...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  The gentleman yield to the chairman, Mr. Rogers.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROGERS</emphasis>:  Will the gentleman yield?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALAZZO</emphasis>:  Yield to the chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROGERS</emphasis>:  I'd like to identify myself with the gentleman's remarks. It's a great amendment. The CDFIs are vitally important in poor areas like mine and perhaps yours. And I would urge that we pass the gentleman's amendment. I yield.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thanks the gentleman.  </p><p>      Mr. Graves is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to thank, Mr. Palazzo and Chairman Rogers for their positive comments. I rise to accept the amendment. These increases -- as he referenced, the CDFI funds financial and technical assistance grants by $25 million, taking it to a total level of $216 million.  </p><p>      And let me remind the committee that is $202 million above the president's request. The administration initially requested $14 million. I know this committee's commitment is to rural communities throughout our country. And this will assist in that way. So I want to thank, Mr. Palazzo and his commitment here and I look forward to accepting the amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion? Mr. Palazzo, you have an -- a minute. You don't have to take it to close.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALAZZO</emphasis>:  Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. In the interest of time I will keep it brief. Please support my amendment. I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK. The question is on the Palazzo amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.   </p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it.  </p><p>      Ms. Pingree is recognized, gentlewoman from Maine.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PINGREE</emphasis>:  Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I have an amendment at the desk, Pingree Number 1.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Yes. Let me say that last amendment was adopted. I apologize. And your amendment is considered read and you're recognized. Excuse me.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PINGREE</emphasis>:  Thank you. First, I want to thank the chair and the subcommittee for recognizing the importance of giving the executive branch authorities to combat corruption and to punish human rights abusers around the world.  </p><p>      I'm pleased that the Bill adds $2 million to the Treasury Department's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, which handles sanctions investigation and enforcement. I'm also pleased that the report language stresses the need for resources to be directed towards Africa, including to address protracted conflicts in Sudan, South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  </p><p>      It also calls for robust implementation of the Global Magnitsky Act sanctions on corruption in human rights. Currently, there are only five sanctions investigators assigned to the team, responsible for designations and delistings for all Africa sanctions programs as well as Global Magnitsky in Venezuela.  </p><p>      Too often these staffers are pulled away to deal with emerging issues like Iran. My amendment would add an additional $2.9 million to create nine new positions with the relevant offices at Treasury to accomplish this goal. Recognizing that the bill already includes an increase, I'm willing to withdraw my amendment and happy to work with the chair going forward.  </p><p>      Will the chair attempt to increase -- support this increase as we move toward conference to ensure that additional resources for Treasury go to the needs identified in the report such as nations in conflict in Central and East Africa and for the global Magnitsky Act?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  We'll -- Chairman Graves.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Maine for raising this issue. It's an issue I think we're all committed to. Government sanctions, abuses of human rights around the world is on the rise.  </p><p>      I look forward to working with you in the days ahead and also with Chairman Rogers and his subcommittee as well. But thank you, again, for your interest in this issue and your commitment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PINGREE</emphasis>:  Thank you. And thank you for being willing to work on this. Just to make sure it's clear. I have people from the Sudan, South Sudan, Burundi in my state. And often those smaller countries are the ones that never get these enforced and there just aren't enough people to do it.  </p><p>      So I know you understand that. I just wanted to help make that point clear. And I hope that there is potential for additional funding if we can find a way to work in it together. And I withdraw my amendment and thank you for your consideration.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you. The amendment has been withdrawn.  </p><p>      Recognize Dr. Harris for the purpose of an amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. I have an administration at the desk.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Would you consider it read?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  And yes, I move to dispense with the reading.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  So ordered and the gentleman is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, this amendment follows up on what you talked about in your opening statement, that one important program funded by this bill is the OSP, what is the school program, the school choice program in Washington, D.C.</p><p>      And it's tremendously successful. Has a waiting list. They could actually move some students into that program from D.C. public school, D.C. charter schools if they had more funding, so what my amendment does is it adds an additional $5 million into their funding, offsetting that by decreasing funding into the public school and charter school part of that program -- of that program spending.  </p><p>      And that way leaves actually more per pupil expenditures for both the public school and the public charter schools while fulfilling an increase in the ability of students to engage in the OSP.  </p><p>      So I offer the amendment and I will -- I've spoken to the chairman of the subcommittee. He's agreed to work on getting that funding increased, so I will intend to withdraw the amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, doctor.  </p><p>      Mr. Graves.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate Dr. Harris's commitment to children and providing the best education. You're absolutely right, I agree with you on the impact this has had in the past and look forward to working with you in the days ahead to make sure we're impacting lives in a positive way as children are being educated in this area. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  So I withdraw the amendment, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK. Thank you both.  </p><p>      Mr. Joyce, amendment number 2. You have two amendments.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Yes, I do. And I appreciate this opportunity to speak, Mr. Chairman. I have that amendment at the desk. And I ask...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Would you consider it read?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  ... consider as read. Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  And you are recognized on your second amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. My amendment would reverse the 2015 decision by the United States Postal Service to its lower delivery service standards for first class mail and periodicals.  </p><p>      Since these standards are lower, timely processing and delivery of the mail has been significantly degraded across the country. Mail delays are dragging down our business and I'm sure I'm not alone in saying that my constituents have noticed the effects of late mail.  </p><p>      I hear it all the time. Medications aren't arriving in a timely fashion. (inaudible) pay your bill on time, if the bills arrive late, so in turn they receive a late fee payment. Invitations get lost, especially to my house.  </p><p>      And weekly newspapers arrive a week late. And importantly, absentee balances are arriving late and at this point it's unlikely the United States Postal Service can guarantee a timely delivery for elections this spring and next November.  </p><p>      So, although, the Postal Service reduction of standards was intended to save money, the consolidation plan actually cost money for fiscal year 2015. The Postal Service spent $130 million on increased transportation costs as a result of the closures and lost a total of $66 million due to the consolidation plan.  </p><p>      I therefore urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment to restore the postal standards to those that were in effect in July 1st, 2012, so all of our constituents may receive the service they depend on.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Joyce.  </p><p>      Mr. Graves?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, unfortunately, I have to raise an opposition to the amendment, but not to my good friend, Mr. Joyce personally. But the amendment -- and he and I have had a discussion about this. His intentions are well, but clearly this has a direct impact on the Postal Service. I think it's a $1.5 billion negative impact on the Postal Service. I truly respect and understand the gentleman's concern about the service standards.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  And look forward to working with you in the days ahead, hopefully along with OGR, the committee of jurisdiction. But because of the high cost of this one amendment, it's a tremendous cost I would have to oppose, the amendment only but not the gentleman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Ms. Kaptur, I understand is recognized to talk on this amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAPTUR</emphasis>:  I would like to rise in support of the gentleman's amendment and implore the chair and the ranking member to try to really look at this. I don't think that the -- whoever did this for the Postal Service was really thinking.  </p><p>      And their decision to eliminate overnight service for first-class mail and even the manner in which our mail arrives now, this has never happened before but an envelope will be in an envelope. Something was ripped because it was sent up to Pontiac, Michigan out of Ohio, let's say.  </p><p>      And really there have been a lot of delays. What Congressman Joyce talks about medicine that is true. And there is something really wrong with the way this routing is going and degrading our mail standards has impacted the timely delivery of everything from medicines to greeting cards, bill payments to business mail, personal letters to government correspondence, not to mention local election mail.  </p><p>      The timely processing delivery of mail is really critical. And the Postal Service delivers 154 billion pieces of mail annually to 155 million delivery points, accounting for 47 percent of the world's mail.  </p><p>      It's an enormous undertaking that equals over 2000 percent more in terms of business than either the UPS or FedEx. The Postal Service serves everyone and they have admitted that their decision to reduce delivery standards has cost the agency $66 million in losses due to added transportation cost, in 2015, $130 million alone.  </p><p>      So this isn't even a very wise business decision. So, I would really implore the chair to keep working with us. I think we should exercise our authority. They've had trouble appointing people to the board of the Postal Service, whoever heard of that.  </p><p>      And the future of our public Postal Service is threatened by delayed mail and it harms small business. It harms people in rural America. And we really have to exercise our authority here. So, I urge my colleagues to support our Postal Service, Mr. Joyce's amendment.  </p><p>      And I would really urge the chairman somehow to work with us as we move toward the floor, if he can't accept this now and would urge my colleagues to vote for the Joyce amendment. And I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Mr. Quigley on the Joyce amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUIGLEY</emphasis>:  Sure. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan amendment to restore mail delivery service standards to 2012 levels. Every year millions of Americans rely on the USPS to provide affordable, efficient mail delivery service. And in many communities USPS is the only affordable option to send and receive mail. Over the last year, I've received countless Postal Service complaints on slow and inconsistent mail service in my district.  </p><p>      This includes delayed mail, sometimes taking weeks to arrive due to bad weather or unscheduled employee absences, wrongly delivered mail, and severely damaged mail. Americans have come to expect timey and dependable mail service. And we need to make sure that the Post Office is maintaining its high standards, therefore I support this amendment and urge my colleagues to vote in favor.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion on the Joyce amendment? If (ph) -- hearing none, Mr. Joyce has a minute to close.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Why, thank you, Mr. Chairman. U.S. mail system is an important part of our nation's infrastructure, connecting people of all communities with the institutions that serve them. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. And I thank you, again, Mr. Chairman. And yield back the balance of my time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK. The question is on the Joyce amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.  </p><p>      Got you. You find this humorous. I think the ayes got it. The amendment is approved. At least you got one approved today.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  I know it's much to your chagrin, sir.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Mr. Price?  </p><p>      Mr. Price is recognized for the purpose of an amendment.  </p><p>      Mr. Price has an amendment at the desk.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>:  I have an amendment at the desk. I ask that its reading be dispensed with.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Considered it done. The gentleman is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment offered in partnership with Mr. Serrano that would restore net neutrality protections that entrepreneurs, small businesses, and the public rely on over the use of internet.  </p><p>      I am sure all of us here know that net neutrality is a term used to describe the principle that all content travelling over the internet should be treated equally by the owners of the networks providing internet service to customers.  </p><p>      Since its inception, the internet has allowed anyone with an internet connection to access or to provide information, goods or services on a relatively equal footing. This open design has been largely responsible for the revolutionary impact that the internet has had on global commerce, innovation and information sharing in so many other aspects of our daily lives.  </p><p>      Yet, in recent years, some companies have openly defied these bedrock open internet principles. There are well-documented examples of internet service providers deliberately throttling broadband speed when consumers try to connect to certain applications, blocking content from competitors and providing preferential treatment to their own content.  </p><p>      So in 2015, after several years of legal battles and careful deliberation, the FCC issued its revised open internet order. These rules enshrined in federal regulation the basic principle of net neutrality, that the companies that provide internet service to consumers to offer that service in an open and nondiscriminatory manner.  </p><p>      This principle is supported by the major tech companies, entrepreneurs, small businesses, research universities, librarians, local governments, a large majority of Americans, nearly everybody, in fact except the companies that provide these commercial internet services.  </p><p>      And yet, despite receiving millions of consumer comments supporting net neutrality, the FCC suddenly voted last year to overturn net neutrality, eroding the principles of openness, innovation and fairness that are the cornerstone of the internet.  </p><p>      Citizens are paying attention to this issue. I expect all of us can attest to that. I received 14,000 letters and e-mails on this subject in this Congress alone. On Monday, these FCC net neutrality protections officially lapsed. The Senate has already voted to overturn the FCC's net neutrality repeal. And this amendment presents us with the opportunity to do the same. So let's put our constituents, small businesses and entrepreneurs first by restoring net neutrality. I urge support for this amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Price.  </p><p>      Mr. Graves?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would have to rise in opposition to the amendment. I think we can all agree on the desire for a free and open internet. And we all do, in fact, it is. I just heard that the gentleman received 14,000 e-mails in opposition to the rule. Apparently, the internet is open and it's free. And people are expressing their opinions. That's what we want and that's what we desire.  </p><p>      But this amendment will just restore things back to the old rule and prohibit FCC from issuing any other rules. In fact, it's circumventing the whole process of public comments and the openness and transparency that we all desire.  </p><p>      The Senate has taken up this issue. I suspect the House may take it up as well. This is not the right committee or jurisdiction in which to do that. The Internet has been the biggest driving force for innovation in our lifetimes.  </p><p>      This is no time to mess with it in a hearing such as this. It's doing well. Just check your e-mails. You're getting them. So, Mr. Chairman, with that, I'd have to rise in opposition to the amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Ms. Lowey?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOWEY</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of my friend's amendment. This week despite overwhelming public support, the FCC's repeal of net neutrality protection officially went into effect.  </p><p>      It's an unfortunate step as we know net neutrality protects small businesses, entrepreneurs, students and consumers by ensuring a level playing field online. Paid prioritization means the end of a free and open internet.  </p><p>      Today, we have an opportunity to protect net neutrality, ensure that our constituents choose what websites and apps they can access online. We owe it to our constituents to do everything in our power to fight for their open access.  </p><p>      Please, vote for the amendment. I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentlewoman.  </p><p>      Mr. Serrano, a cosponsor of the amendment, is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SERRANO</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      I want to thank my good friend from North Carolina, Mr. Price, for working on this issue for so many years. On the net neutrality, we do not see a stifling of creativity in innovation like we were told by the opposition.  </p><p>      In fact, it did the opposite, ushering in a spirit and wave of innovation because more people were able to access an internet that treated all content and data the same. This amendment would simply reinstate the 2015 net neutrality rules that have kept the internet open and fair for all Americans.  </p><p>      It would prevent our constituents from having to pay more to access their favorite websites and streaming services. It will prevent students from having educational content blocked by their ISPs, therefore jeopardizing their learning experience.  </p><p>      And it would prevent small businesses from having their websites throttled and face delays in trying to showcase their products for consumers. While major service providers like Comcast and AT&amp;T have recently announced that they have no plans to prioritize certain web traffic or create paid fast lanes, what is to stop them from changing their minds in the future and raising prices on consumers? Let us not forget that the first priority of any cooperation is to make money. But it should be the responsibility of Congress and the federal government to protect all Americans' ability to access a resource that has become so engrained in our culture and economy.  </p><p>      That is why the principles enshrined in the 2015 net neutrality rules are so important and why tens of millions of Americans strongly support these principles. This is a matter of fairness and equality.  </p><p>      I ask my colleagues to put the interests of families, students, rural and urban Americans and small businesses ahead of corporate interest. I urge a yes vote on the Price Serrano amendment. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentleman for his comments.  </p><p>      I see Mr. Kilmer and then Mr. Cartwright, Mr. -- OK.  </p><p>      Mr. Taylor, I guess you...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAYLOR</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just a couple of things. Number one:  obviously, net neutrality in the way it's been framed is inaccurate and deceiving in many ways. And it's kind of embarrassing in some respects as well.  </p><p>      When you look at -- talk about corporate interests and one of the issues here is blocking and throttling, the only folks doing blocking and throttling now are the big tech companies and, of course, they support net neutrality, which would put the ISPs who are not just your Verizons and Cox and stuff like that but 3,000 of them across the nation that provide low cost internet to rural areas, like some in my own district.  </p><p>      And they, of course, would support pushing them to be regulated under a 1930s scheme. So think about that for a second. Companies that are in the internet being regulated under a 1930 scheme, does that really make any sense? I don't think so.  </p><p>      So, of course, the tech companies would support that because they don't want them to get into the data business, which is highly profitable. Look, I think everyone here there's an equality of desire not to have -- to have a level playing field, to not have blocking, to not have throttling. But also to regulate the internet under the same ecosphere, so -- ecosystem, excuse me, so under the FCC, everyone being regulated under the same rules.  </p><p>      And having that opt -- the opt-in -- and our people would have the ability to opt in, and then perhaps look at potential soft regulations on data, on who owns your data. So this is a larger discussion that has to happen, but not here in this committee. So I would oppose it. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Kilmer is recognized and then Mr. Cartwright.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KILMER</emphasis>:  Thanks. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I support this amendment; I support a free and open internet. But we had a debate on the -- on the last bill about the inability of Congress to step in in an area where it ought to use some of its authority. That was with regard to authorization for use of military force.  </p><p>      But I think this is another example where Congress has sort of dropped the ball. You know, this is larger than just one issue. Congress should look at holistically reforming our telecom laws because the last major piece of telecom policy that passed out of Congress was in 1996.  </p><p>      You know, 1996, less than a quarter of Americans were online. The ones that were used Netscape and a dial-up modem. When they got their e-mail, it said, \"You've Got Mail.\" You know, that was seven years before, MySpace, a PalmPilot was thought to be cutting-edge technology at that time.  </p><p>      Someone who used the term smart phone at that time was describing something that weighed more than a pound and was the size of a brick. You know, but because Congress hasn't acted on this, agencies have tried to pick up the slack and that's not the way to go. Rather than seeing this issue decided by agency action, I'd like to see Congress step up and set some rules of the road and pass legislation that comprehensively reforms our telecom and technology policy. To me, it's a competitiveness issue. I think you've heard folks on both sides of the aisle with different perspectives on this, but make the same point that this is important to our businesses, this is about jobs...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAYLOR</emphasis>:  Will the gentleman yield?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KILMER</emphasis>:  Yes. Sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAYLOR</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate the sentiment and I agree with the gentleman that we should -- that Congress should take this up and look at it holistically. But the gentleman mentioned the antiquated action that was taken -- you know, 1996 I guess prior to MySpace. But does the gentleman believe that we should look at regulating a -- you know, the ISPs under a 1930 scheme?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KILMER</emphasis>:  So just reclaiming my time. In my view, the issue needs to be decided by Congress rather than just yielding to the executive. I think it's time for Congress to catch up with the rest of the country, bring our laws up to speed with our technology. And I support the amendment but I also support the Congress stepping in and doing something about it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK. Further discussion? Mr. Culberson's recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CULBERSON</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, support net neutrality. I want to prevent the internet service providers from throttling access to services for any customer, but I have a real concern this amendment as chairman Graves said, particularly the way it's drafted, that the amendment would prevent the Federal Communications Commission from reissuing a rule in substantially the same form. I'm not sure what substantially means. What -- how is that defined?  </p><p>      So I'm afraid that the -- while we are in agreement I believe with the spirit of what Mr. Price is doing, the amendment itself is not effective, unenforceable, undefinable, and I'm not sure how you'd ever make any sense out of what this amendment proposes to do. So I hope we'll find another opportunity to restore that neutrality but not do it here and do it in a more thoughtful, careful fashion.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentleman from Texas for his remarks. Mr. Cartwright from Pennsylvania is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARTWRIGHT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I speak in support of this amendment and I do thank Representatives Price and Serrano for their hard work on this matter. I also wish to associate myself with remarks of Mr. Kilmer. I think the free exchange of information and ideas is an essential principle in this country.  </p><p>      Every single one of our constituents wants net neutrality because they want to be assured they have access, choice, and freedom to get the internet content that they want. As such, I think the American people and the companies affected by this issue deserve some certainty on the matter.  </p><p>      That's why I hope, as Congressman Kilmer said, that, as a Congress, we can soon work in a bipartisan fashion to address this issue legislatively to let our voters know we are listening to their concerns and we are actively engaged on this issue. I urge support of the amendment. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion on the amendment? Mr. Pocan and then Ms. Lee.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">POCAN</emphasis>:  Sure. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I think the argument by the subcommittee chairman on this was that so many contacts -- 14,000 contacts proves it works. Well, the rule change just took effect this week so it did work, you're right.  </p><p>      The previous system worked very well. In fact, I had 12,983 contacts as of a month ago that were against the ruling and zero, zero for it. Now, to be fair, I did have a telecommunications lobbyist from my district stop by the other day, and he asked to be counted, so I am now up to 12,983 to 1.  </p><p>      But I think this is very similar in many of our districts. My small business owners don't want us to throttle the internet, my farmers don't want to have fast lanes, and the consumers don't want to. So this is something that the Senate took care of. Now it's in the hands of the House.  </p><p>      We could do a discharge petition, which I hope many of you will sign on to, but I think this is one where people are way, way, way ahead of us on this, and I strongly support this amendment. I thank the gentleman who introduced this and I hope we'll pass it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank the gentleman for his comments. Further discussion? Ms. Lee is recognized for some comments on the amendment, the Price amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me just associate myself with all the remarks that have been made and say a couple things about our democracy, really, in terms of the blow it's taken as it relates to the FCC rules mandating net neutrality.  </p><p>      This really is equal treatment of all content on the internet, and it was overturned by this new rule imposed by the chairman. Mr. Price's amendment is extremely important because it nullifies this new rule. Internet providers will be able to provide websites from loading or slow them down simply because they disagree with what the website says.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAYLOR</emphasis>:  Will the gentlelady?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Yes, I'll yield.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Gentleman's -- gentlelady's yielded.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAYLOR</emphasis>:  (inaudible). Will the gentlelady agree -- I think everybody agrees about the blocking and throttling and not stopping websites just because you don't agree with the content from up. Will the gentlelady -- that a lot of that -- some of the content you're speaking of is also from not ISPs, but on social media platforms. Will the gentlelady agree that those should also be regulated in the same ways so as to have that information come out and not be blocked or throttled, which does not -- does not address this amendment?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Let me reclaim my time please. This is really about freedom of speech and freedom of expression. OK? From entrepreneurs to advocates for social justice, the internet has been a powerful tool for everyone, especially communities of color, to revitalize our neighborhoods and draw attention really to the injustices in our society in order to change them.  </p><p>      And so this new repeal of the open internet rule -- it really kills this free expression and innovation and it kills it online. And it shouldn't be a partisan issue. It's opposed by 86 percent of the public, Democrats and Republicans understand what's at stake. So I urge a yes vote on this amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Ms. Lee. Mr. Ruppersberger has been very patient.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUPPERSBERGER</emphasis>:  Thank you. First, I support this amendment but the one thing that's become very clear to me is this whole process in what we're dealing with now needs to be dealt with with our Congress. The American people clearly feel passionately about this issue and we need to come up with a bipartisan legislative solution, so there is no ambiguity on the regulatory side, and future administrations continue to ping pong back and forth. Democrat and Republican, this issue is not good for American consumers or American businesses. Yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank the gentleman for his comments. A minute to close, Mr. Price is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's interesting to see members raise the bugaboo of regulation and as though there was any option here. We're talking about one FCC regulation versus another. OK? So make your choice.  </p><p>      It's the FCC regulation enacted after great care -- with great care in 2015 that, in fact, protected that level playing field that we all want to see. And I agree with the chairman, it's no time to mess with the internet.  </p><p>      The messing with the internet with this new regulation that overturns that carefully arrived at rule. Many members in this room have embraced the Congressional Review Act in dealing with regulations that they find objectionable over this last year. This takes the form of exactly that.  </p><p>      This is a -- this is a Congressional Review Act type amendment. It reflects what was done on a bipartisan basis in the Senate. It is something where the House needs to step up to the plate. And, for that reason, I urge the support of this amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Price. The question is on the Price amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.  </p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not agreed.

The amendment is not adopted.  </p><p>      Mr. Joyce, amendment number 1, you're recognized to present your amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have an amendment at the desk and ask that it be considered as read.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  It's considered read and the gentleman's recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My amendment -- my amendment simply put prohibits penalization of financial institutions solely because the institution provides financial services to an entity that involves a properly-registered state-compliant marijuana-related company.  </p><p>      To be clear, the business or entity must be operating within the laws of the state to avoid penalization. This is not about whether or not one approves of marijuana. This is about public safety and financial transparency.  </p><p>      While 46 states, 3 territories and the district now allow cannabis-related businesses to operate, our banks and credit unions cannot provide financial services to them. Strangely enough, ATMs are allowed inside dispensaries so one may withdraw funds from their bank to make a purchase in cash.  </p><p>      The situation is untenable. No industry can operate safely and transparently without access to banks or other financial institutions. To ensure these legitimate going concerns are safe, legitimate, and operating completely within the laws of the licensing state, we must allow them access to the financial system. I urge support of my amendment in the interests of financial transparency and public safety and reserve the balance of my time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentleman. Chairman Graves.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think I'll just leave it at this. I look forward to watching the committee hash this out for a little while.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Mr. Quigley.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUIGLEY</emphasis>:  I was tempted to say the opponents of this are dazed and confused, but I'll hold back. I do rise in support of the Joyce amendment. It is ridiculous that at a time when the majority of states allow some form of recreational or medical use that these businesses are forced to operate as all-cash operations, having no choice but to pay their taxes, employees' salaries, and rent with bags of cash.  </p><p>      When I think of an all-cash operation, I think of the mob or a cartel, not a legal, regulated business. We are effectively telling these businesses that they should operate like the black market, encouraging obscurity rather than transparency.  </p><p>      Additionally, by denying legal businesses access to banking services such as credit card processing and deposit revenues, a public safety risk is created. Recent headlines demonstrate this risk, reporting of robberies, home invasions, and other threats associated with possessing large sums of cash.  </p><p>      Regardless how each of us may view the legalization of marijuana, I think we all agree that financial institutions should be allowed to serve businesses that are operating legitimately. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, which respects states' rights and prioritizes public safety.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion on the Joyce amendment? I'm seeing a number of hands. Mr. Stewart is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEWART</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I do look forward to this, as the subcommittee chairman said a robust debate on this, but I'll be very brief. First, I'd like to point out there's some confusion and it's brought into this debate, there is a meaningful difference between medicinal marijuana and recreational use of marijuana.  </p><p>      That's not apples and oranges. That's apples and dinosaurs. These are very, very different issues. And don't conflate the two by saying, \"Well, some of these are used by those who are supporting the medicinal use.\"  </p><p>      I'm talking about the recreational use, which is, by the way, the vast majority of the use and the revenue generated by this. So ask yourself these very simple questions. Do you think it's a good idea generally to promote the use of -- recreational use of marijuana in our society? If you think that's a good thing, then support this.   </p><p>      Do you think it's good for our society generally to have more and more marijuana use, or less? If you think the answer is, \"More is better,\" then go ahead and support this amendment. If you think it's -- you want to legitimize the use of marijuana to our kids -- if you think that's a good idea, then support this amendment.  </p><p>      If you think it's a good idea to signal to the business community that having a marijuana dispensary is on par with having a car dealership or selling tires or any other business, then go ahead and support this amendment.  </p><p>      I, on the other, think we should discourage that type of use and one of the ways we discourage that is making it harder for these businesses to carry out their business. And if they're using all cash, then I say, \"You know what? They knew that going into this. Let them deal with it. Let's not help them and make it easier for them.\" And I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion? Ms. Lee is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Thank you very much. I rise in support of Mr. Joyce's amendment. This is a bipartisan proposal. It would prohibit federal agencies from unduly penalizing financial institutions for providing basic banking services to legitimate cannabis businesses in states where it's legal.  </p><p>      This amendment would ensure that legitimate business owners can comply with state regulations and help ensure that regulator and law enforcement officers can hold businesses accountable. And for the 46 states and jurisdictions that have passed cannabis reform laws, this amendment would provide important financial certainty to business owners, employees, government agencies, and financial institutions.  </p><p>      Now, regardless of how you feel about the legalization or decriminalization of cannabis, I think we all can agree that the state has made their own decisions to take action and to pass a range for various laws pertaining to medical or adult use cannabis.  </p><p>      It's become increasingly apparent that there is a need to align federal and state laws when it comes to addressing the banking crisis, which it is. Last year, the legal cannabis industry was worth around $10 billion but is largely forced to operate exclusively in cash.  </p><p>      These outdated and predatory policies are a major obstacle to these small businesses and only serve to undermine their financial security. Enforcing small businesses to operate as all-cash businesses, these policies make the jobs of state regulators and tax collectors unnecessarily difficult.  </p><p>      And it leaves these entrepreneurs, their employees, and the business itself vulnerable to dangerous criminal targeting. It's a matter of public safety and economic necessity. In fact, in California, a state treasurer has called for action to on the cannabis banking industry saying we all have an obligation to take reasonable and necessary steps to protect our citizens and ensure businesses operating legally within California are engaged fully in our banking and commerce -- excuse me, system.  </p><p>      And I've visited small businesses like these in my home district in Oakland, California and I know how that impacts these acts -- excuse me, I know how it impacts the lack of access to financial services.  </p><p>      Using these services will allow entrepreneurs and small businesses to ensure their financial security, grow their business, and better serve their communities. So I urge my colleagues to listen to legal and job creating businesses in your own districts where these laws have been passed and support this amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Ms. Lee. Dr. Harris is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  Thank you very much. You know, I'm going to speak in opposition to this amendment. You know, the last amendment we had dealt with medical marijuana. This is the incrementalism we're seeing. You know, when we -- when we restrained the Department of Justice a few weeks ago from enforcing federal law, it was medical marijuana.  </p><p>      This amendment is not about medical marijuana. It's about big marijuana businesses. You know, there's a reason why there are big dollars involved and lots of cash, because drug dealing makes a lot of money and it involves a lot of cash.  </p><p>      And no matter what we want -- no matter what other name we can call it, marijuana is a controlled substance, it's schedule one, it's drug dealing under federal law. And the gentleman from Utah is absolutely right, what we're doing, we pass this amendment so we're condoning drug dealing for recreational use.  </p><p>      And there may be small businesses involved, some of them maybe, but as soon as you the remove the financial obstacles, this is going to be big, big business. There are going to be big growers involved, big distributors involved. Pharma, move over, because now you've got a whole other industry dealing with drugs.  </p><p>      But this is just not my opinion. The other thing, by the way, is, you know, where do we stop with schedule one substances allowing banks to do it. What if, you know, some states -- I understand Oregon is considering legalizing heroin. So we're going to remove -- we're going to allow the banks to participate in that as well?  </p><p>      It's a slippery slope we don't want to go to. We really should have the argument about legalization first. But you don't have to take my opinion. I've got two letters here -- and I'll read briefly from them and then I'll ask they be entered into the record -- from the National Fraternal Order of Police -- represents 355,000 police officers in the United States.   </p><p>      Asking this committee -- and, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, you know because you got this letter today, asking this committee to please not pass this legislation. They say, quote, \"Public safety is threatened by the growing use of marijuana nationwide, with the greatest negative impact in states that no longer comport with existing federal law.\"  </p><p>      It's exactly what this -- who this amendment addresses. So this is from the National Fraternal Order of Police, but, if you don't believe National Fraternal Order (ph) of Police, the Major Cities Chiefs Association (sic) -- these are the police chiefs of major cities -- they say the facts are undeniable. The legalization of marijuana has only hindered local law enforcement's efforts to keep communities safe.   </p><p>      These are the people that our -- that men and women and families in this country trust to keep our community safe. Mr. Chairman, they plead with this committee not to pass this -- not to pass this amendment. Look, at some point, we might get to the point where this -- where this is in order. I think it's way premature. I will oppose the amendment. Thank you. I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Harris. And Ms. Pingree from Maine is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PINGREE</emphasis>:  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to speak in support of this bipartisan amendment. I disagree with my colleagues. I don't think this is how you -- this is not related to how you feel about legalizing marijuana.  </p><p>      In my state in 2016 with referendum, our voters voted to legalize marijuana. We already had medical marijuana. Then last month our legislature passed and even overrode a governor's veto statutory and regulatory framework.  </p><p>      So soon in our state, we're going to have businesses official operating selling marijuana as a business just as you would sell any legal product, because it is legal in our state. But these entrepreneurs are going to end up with one hand tied behind their back, unsure where they can get access to capital to start or expand their business and use the banking system.  </p><p>      I just had a visit from the Maine credit unions and they told me they are eager to help but they're worried about the risks of lending if federal regulators interfere based on federal law. The Joyce amendment would eliminate this risk, provide protection both for lenders and the businesses who need capital to serve their customers.  </p><p>      I agree with many of my colleagues who mentioned that this will help law enforcement. Without being able to use the banking system, you have businesses who are storing enormous amounts of cash from marijuana transactions and this is already happening with medical marijuana. It's unsafe. It's a recipe for abuse.   </p><p>      Access to regulated financial services will provide some peace of mind to businesses customers and the public. I just want to say further, I think one of the reasons that many of us are making basically exactly the same argument is because it is ludicrous to have a legal business that cannot use the banking system.  </p><p>      It promotes crime, it makes it difficult for these businesses and I wholeheartedly support this amendment for the benefit of my states and other states where this is legalized and hope my colleagues will do the same and I yield.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentleman -- gentlewoman for her remarks. Mr. Rogers, former Chairman Rogers, is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROGERS</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Might I ask, Mr. Joyce, what is the significance of the states that are mentioned in your amendment?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  I'm sorry, sir.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROGERS</emphasis>:  What is the significance of mentioning the states that you have in your amendment?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Because each one of the states...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Could you just repeat his question? Because I'm not sure everybody heard it. The significance of the states...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  The fine chairman asked what's the significance of the states that are listed in the amendment, and that is because only the states that have this -- some form of either medicinal or medicinal and recreational use -- are the ones that are listed there.  </p><p>      There are other states that have made this choice not to be involved and so therefore, you're trying to -- you're not bringing them into the system because they're not part of it. Only those states in which the state either legislature or the vote of the people has enacted the laws to allow a cannabis industry into their state.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROGERS</emphasis>:  Well, for states that do not want to legalize recreational marijuana, the involvement of the financial community, the banks, is one of the last remaining things that a state has to keep from legalizing marijuana in their state if that's what they want to do, because the bank by handling the cash from an illegal act in many states is an aider and an abettor. And can be and could be charged and convicted of conspiracy to violate the state law or the federal law. Always bear in mind, the federal law even today does not legalize recreational marijuana.  </p><p>      States, many states, some states have done the same. If they're not able to use the financial institution feature they were talking about, the states lose the last -- one of the last possible ways to keep from being legalized over their objection. And I don't think we should be telling a state what they should do about this matter.  </p><p>      The -- I'll close with this. All of the polls and all of the information and research that we've seen says that marijuana is the stepping stone particularly for young people toward opioid abuse, which boils my blood. I yield.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  The gentlewoman from Kentucky, Ms. McCollum is recognized. Thank you for your patience.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCOLLUM</emphasis>:  Thank you. I support the Joyce amendment which prevents funds from being used to penalize financial institutions that provide banking services to state legal marijuana businesses.  </p><p>      Now, you have the 46 states that have reformed their marijuana laws to allow for some form of medical or adult use. My home state of Minnesota for the gentleman from Utah recently legalized some forms of medical marijuana for use under certain circumstance, under a doctor's use.  </p><p>      And I'm going to read from the Minnesota Department of Health. For patients to receive medical cannabis, the law requires a licensed health care provider to certify that the patient has one or more of the qualifying conditions. A qualifying condition that your health care practitioner must certify that you have one of the qualifying conditions -- conditions.  </p><p>      And it's all spelled out here. The most compelling people to testify in Minnesota, we have very strict controls on how the medical marijuana is used, were parents of children with epilepsy. And what a game-changer it was for these children. And their parents were going to give up their jobs and sell their houses and go to states where they could have access to this transformational change for these young adults.  </p><p>      And there's other medical conditions in Minnesota in which it is prescribed and used too. So denying a state-sanctioned business that's operating entirely within the laws of their state and to keep them from banking is just irresponsible and it's a threat to public safety.  </p><p>      Why would we want a doctor who is legally prescribing under certain circumstances which is heavily regulated in Minnesota to be forced into a cash-only environment? We should be encouraging law-abiding citizens running small businesses to work with inner banking systems, not putting them at risk, not putting communities, not putting families that they serve in danger. This amendment for Minnesota and for many of us is not about legalizing marijuana. It is about safe banking. With that, I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks.   </p><p>      So Sheriff Rutherford is recognized and then, Mr. Amodei and any others, please do indicate. Yes, Mr. Ryan. Sheriff, you're recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUTHERFORD</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, thank you. I rise to speak in opposition to this bill even though I think it's well-known that I support investigating and research for determining the efficacy of marijuana for medical purposes.  </p><p>      In fact, I was very involved in the state legislature in Florida a few years back when we actually had Charlotte's Web, which is a marijuana extract that was actually passed by a very conservative quite frankly Republican House and Senate in the state legislature. So I'm very much in favor of looking at marijuana from its medical use.  </p><p>      However, I also understand that from my time as sheriff that national -- transnational organizations, these cartels face two problems. Number one is bringing drugs into the country across our border. And the second is moving large amounts of cash back across the border.  </p><p>      And that is an opportunity as well to intervene in the drug trade affecting our country. And so one of the things those in the Justice Department have begun to see is a lot more attempts by drug cartels to actually move their money through wire transfers and banking operations, which is why DEA and others have begun to really focus on that as an element. And I'm really concerned about marrying together through these banking processes illicit and legal marijuana funds. So, for that reason, Mr. Chairman, I oppose the bill.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I think the gentleman for his remarks. Mr. Ryan is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYAN</emphasis>:  (inaudible) banks, credit unions looking to Congress for reassurance that if the state can do business (inaudible).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Ryan. Mr. Amodei is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AMODEI</emphasis>:  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  And then I see Mr. Aderholt and...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AMODEI</emphasis>:  Briefly and I want to thank my colleague from Ohio who's taken the first step but by coming from a state which regulates a few vices -- the record should reflect that nobody laughed when that last statement was -- there are some things that we should talk about here. It's like, OK, you want them to bank, great. That's fine with me. I get the public safety stuff, I get all that stuff.  </p><p>      But guess what, there's that regulatory piece and that law enforcement piece which if you're a regulated vice, guess what, those regulators and those law enforcement people get to come in and see your accounts any time they want.  </p><p>      They don't need to play hopscotch, they don't need a warrant. They want to make sure that you're doing business as that legally state licensed deal and that you haven't got folks from other countries in the hemisphere doing things. That's missing. That's very important.  </p><p>      And let me just tell you one other thing and I know it's not within this committee's jurisdiction, but if you're going to let these folks access that banking system, which is regulated state and federally, I can assure you that whether it's the Buckeye State or the whodunit state on the list, they're getting tax revenue from it.  </p><p>      And so to just give it away for no tax revenue, if we've learned anything in terms of alcohol and other vices, tobacco as an instance, then guess what, alcohol is taxed federally and tobacco is taxed federally.  </p><p>      Why would this be exempt? And this bill, this amendment, which I want to support but I ain't giving it away for nothing. So with all due respect, if we really want to do it and I want to do it, we ought to get some tax revenue out of it, learn those lessons with tobacco and alcohol. And, by the way, we ought to be able to check on the records any time we want so all this sanctity and virginity in the state stuff is confirmed by the feds. Thank you. Good evening. And God bless vices.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Oh, boy. Mr. Aderholt I believe wishes to be recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ADERHOLT</emphasis>:  Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  In the wake of Mr. Amodei's remarks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ADERHOLT</emphasis>:  yes, I just -- well, I'll be brief. I just wanted to say certainly we don't oppose the person bringing the amendment but we do have -- there are some concerns that I think many of us have about the amendment itself.  </p><p>      I just received a note from the sheriffs from Alabama and they had indicated to me they're very much concerned about the amendment. And so I would say that the timing on this is definitely not right and we need to hold off on this amendment, in all due respect to its sponsor. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK. Anything -- yes, Ms. Kaptur is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAPTUR</emphasis>:  Yes, I just wanted to say -- put a couple facts out there. Former Speaker of the House John Boehner, according to press reports. who was from the state of Ohio as some people might be -- remember -- he's changed and now serves on the board of a company called Acreage Holdings -- a company that cultivates, processes, and dispenses cannabis, OK?   </p><p>      So it's just interesting some of the things that happen around here. I don't know what that means. That's what I read in the newspaper. I haven't had a chance to ask him about that.  </p><p>      The other thing I just want to mention -- and I know Congressman Joyce is very careful is his wording, but, you know, in my district, they're cutting marijuana with black tar heroin and fentanyl now. People are dying of it. And I don't know how you separate this.  </p><p>      I don't know how you -- I voted for medical marijuana, thinking it would be tightly regulated, and I'm not sure what we have right now in our country. All I know is, in Ohio, we have such an epidemic. I just left another sheriff in one of our counties and he needed money for more officers and all of the deputy chiefs, everybody that's worked in -- I'll tell you the county, Lorain County, Ohio, they were asking me for help from the federal government to hire more officers just to deal with the -- what is occurring in that one location, and that's only one of 88 counties in deep trouble because of addiction and deaths related to these substances.  </p><p>      So I just -- I'm uncomfortable -- I want to support my colleague from Ohio and he's probably very well-intentioned. I just think that some of this has implications beyond what maybe some of us even completely understand and with some states having some laws and other states not having those laws, pretty soon we're going to get an amendment up here to have state reciprocity just like we do with guns. If you can, you know, conceal and carry in Indiana, then can you walk it into Ohio or vice versa, well, what's the difference with this?  </p><p>      So I'm just -- I am -- we have an epidemic in this country and I want to trace the money. I want -- I want to do that, but I am very -- and you want it to be in sunshine, right? You want to do what's right. I just am not sure this amendment at this time, maybe, and it doesn't say medical marijuana in the -- in the amendment. And for me, that is a -- that is a troubling factor. So I just wanted to put that on the record and I thank you and I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Ms. Kaptur. Mr. Jenkins would like to be recognized. You are recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JENKINS</emphasis>:  Would the sponsor of the amendment yield?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Absolutely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JENKINS</emphasis>:  Thank you. I'm really struggling with this because I'm a states right guy, but I'm also concerned about the slippery slope and I know West Virginia is listed on this and West Virginia has legalized medical marijuana non-combustible, so very narrow sliver, but already since that's passed there's been legislative efforts at the state level to expand that and I think every state wherever you are in the spectrum, your state is probably going to be pushing for expansion at some point in time, number one.  </p><p>      I assume once your state is named here and it says whatever the state laws, as the state law expands, so too would, obviously, the financial institution's ability to service that, so you're not locked in to whatever the state of the law is in your state at the point of passage of this.  </p><p>      So if you went from medical marijuana to full recreational, this would still give carte blanche ability for financial institutions without concern of penalty service the recreational even though you maybe medical today only  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Correct.  </p><p>      OK, secondly, are there other regulatory aspects we know just as Dr. Harris referenced a week or two ago DHA in the limited area of medical marijuana. While, this is not limited to medical marijuana, this is dealing with financial institutions, are there other regulatory entities at the federal level that the marijuana industry is concerned about and we're going to be -- we're taking care of financial institutions today, are there other folks on down the pike that are going to be given labors potentially if we should so choose.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  I can't answer that with specificity because I have not looked through every single regulatory agency to figure all that out.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JENKINS</emphasis>:  We're taking care of law enforcement, we're taking care of financial institutions of this in the past, are there others in the queue potentially?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  One thing that was brought up at the last hearing we had in which we talked about the law enforcement aspects in the CJS hearing and I fully agree with my friend from Maryland, Dr. Harris, there needs to be research. We need to know in states where you have -- where now it is legal, what is the amount that someone can operate machinery under? At what point they come to work? You're going to have other going concerns that have people employed by them, at what point do they have to worry that this person shouldn't be operating machinery, this person shouldn't be behind the desk, shouldn't be operating a computer?  </p><p>      We need to have the research. As we've talked about before, it's sort of a chicken and egg thing because right now we're denying state universities and others the ability to do the research until we pass something. And obviously, as an institution, we don't have the guts to get this done and this absolutely changed my mind similar to my dear friend John Boehner who has said his thinking has evolved as well as others here that it was Sam Farr, a member of this committee that was telling me that in California he had a fine V.A. hospital. The V.A. hospital was not allowed to give medicine that would treat PTSD for our soldiers and had found to be effective, was not allowed to do it in his hospital. And the more I think about it, and the more I've watched, we continue to grow the industry, but we continue to act like it doesn't exist.  </p><p>      Well, you know, we talk about illegal drug dealers. This takes them off the street. This -- this takes it -- yes, it does legitimize it, but we have to think of prohibition. How did that work? I know we have a thing and I agree completely with Mr. Amodei with the fact that we should have these financial institutions, everything should be above board, everything should be transparent, every member of the 40-16th that has voted for his should know exactly how much is being sold and track it like they do right now from seed to sale and be able to know exactly what this is, and so deal with it accordingly.  </p><p>      And we consider the -- we consider the...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Mr. Jenkins, this is your time. Are you yielding? Did you yield?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JENKINS</emphasis>:  I yield back. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Ms. Herrera Beutler is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HERRERA BEUTLER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I think the sponsor of this amendment is touching on just how difficult -- I shouldn't say that, just how complex this issue is. There are so many far reaching facets. I -- I, you know, I'm from a state that has legalized recreational marijuana, and I wish we hadn't. I did a call with my school superintendents, my police chiefs and my sheriffs, I wanted to talk about the state of our schools and our kids and what they thought would help.  </p><p>      And I fully expected them to start the whole conversation off talking about guns and they spent the first 10 or 15 minutes talking about the harm that the use of recreational marijuana has done in our schools with our kids. I was flabbergasted. And now, I recognize this is with regards to medical or medicinal marijuana, and that's a subject, I can't remember who said it, you know, it's one I support. You know, I -- I have talked to parents who have very young children who suffered major seizure disorders who have found types or use for medical marijuana and obviously not smoking it, but there's a way to extract and they've seen a benefit. And boy, if I was that mom, I'd do everything possible, right?  </p><p>      So I get that and I support that. But my concern with this amendment is we're doing it here and now, at this hour, with this short amount of time, without the input of all of our colleagues when this is an issue that is so much bigger than -- we had a one-year appropriations bill. There are so many valid points on this.   </p><p>      And I just -- I -- the reason I am not going to be able to support it is because I'm too -- until you've sat next to a drug addict at a roundtable who has looked at you and says (ph), \"The biggest mistake you folks ever made was legalizing recreational marijuana,\" and I'm sitting there going, \"First of all, I didn't do it\" -- but when his heart is breaking, he's telling you that -- it just causes me to want to pause this effort here.  </p><p>      Now, there are good people on all sides of this. I've talked with my credit unions too, but I don't think that this is the place to do it. And I'm not saying that as a punt. I'm saying I want to get this right. So with that, I unfortunately oppose the gentleman's amendment and I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentlelady for yielding. Judge Carter of Texas is recognized for time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARTER</emphasis>:  I apologize for my voice today, but I want to say if there's $900,000 in cash in a marijuana shop, garage some place because they can't get in the banking system, then there's $900 million worth of marijuana cash somewhere in the cartel system. The cartels run the marijuana in Mexico in a gigantic way and Mr. Harris is right, the second problem they have is what to do with cash?  </p><p>      They have the same problem with that marijuana shop guy's got. Now, if we make it legal for people to do it in the United States, then they're either going to offer some major incentives to get illegal marijuana trade into our banking system or they're going to do what they do down on the border, they'll cut somebody's hand or leg off to convince them to put marijuana in their system. And dollars don't look any different -- $900,000 don't look any different whether it's legal or illegal. I think this is something we need to think out.  </p><p>      There's a reason we have laws to restrict cash deposits, it's so we can find illicit drug trade. That's why we have that law. If we are waiving it, we're running into a problem, and law enforcement will not like it. I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Yield. The chairman has asked for time. I yield some of my time to you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And first, let me just commend the committee, this is one -- been one of the most respectful in-depth debates I think we've -- we've had as a committee and it's -- it's really compelling and amazing arguments on both sides. The one clarity that I pulled out of all of these is that there is not lack of support for the concept of -- of bringing what is known as a gray area in the financial market to something of a little bit better understanding, nor is there a lack of desire to help those who truly need and desire to have assistance through medicinal purposes.  </p><p>      But I do sense that this committee is not ready to take the leap to the next step. And I -- I respect that. I know we've debated the previous amendment and the -- and the other bill, I think it was Mr. Culberson's bill, that was medicinal only and I think we've embraced that in a different -- different fashion.  </p><p>      So Mr. Chairman, as I -- as I look at this, I think this -- this committee has done remarkable here. I'd point out a couple of things, if these were to be adopted, this would be a one-year solution potentially if it is enacted into law and that could create some more disparity and uncertainty as we look ahead. But let it be known that this committee really cares about our constituents and if we could provide assistance medicinally, I think I've heard that here.  </p><p>      And Mr. Joyce said if this were not to prevail today, I hope you'll continue the effort and maybe in incremental steps, but we have recognized a tremendous class and that's the states versus the federal government. And they're out there on this. And we must come together and sort through this and work through this together.  </p><p>      But let me just thank each and every committee member who chose to voice your opinions. This has been a fantastic debate and discussion. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Reclaiming my time. I am -- basically I think at times a facilitator and mediator as chairman of this committee, but I have definite opinions about the legalization of marijuana. In New Jersey, we have medicinal marijuana and certainly we understand this as it described the plight of sometimes children and adults in the most excruciating pain that have been -- that should have access whether they're veterans or non-veterans, I think they basically should have access.  </p><p>      But I visit about 90 schools a year, juniors and seniors in high school, some elementary schools, and the question is always, they say what are we going to ask this dinosaur? Do you believe in the legalization of marijuana? And I say, you know, I know in this room that you are often in middle school, eighth grade, and juniors and seniors in high school, you're adult enough we hope to make the right decisions.  </p><p>      But what worries me and I say to them quite blankly, I worry about the availability of your younger brothers and sisters and I'm sympathetic to the plight of the banking industry and people who have large cash, you know, sitting in some safe or under the counter and I understand that this is -- this is the outgrowth of this legalization movement and maybe I'm on the wrong side of history.  </p><p>      But I feel extremely uncomfortable without moving ahead with this amendment. I think it's just that the tone of the discussion here, I feel that some of you share those same concerns and I think it's about time we call for a vote and I don't think there's any further, I get the last word. You have the last word, a minute to close, Mr. Joyce.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  I thank you very much Mr. Chairman. And I certainly appreciate the -- the debate we had here. I certainly wish we could have a debate like this on the floor. The sad part about it is that sometimes we conflate the different issues, and, if you would take the opportunity to see how these agencies and dispensaries are working, one has to show their license. They have to be over 21.   </p><p>      It eliminates this black-market trade. It keeps it from getting to kids which is important for all law enforcement. I certainly spent 25 years making that happen. I know you have your ideas, but, you know, we got to talk about reality. Kids are going to find marijuana just like they find alcohol and other things.  </p><p>      But the only way we can do it is bring the -- the -- bring this money into the system so we know what we're dealing with and be able to talk apples to apples why we're doing this. And just so I may provide a little bit of insight here, the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, said just this afternoon -- said marijuana use is permitted in (ph) some states, but not by federal law. He said the disparity puts federal regulators in a very difficult position and the Fed would love to see this hazy issue clarified.  </p><p>      The idea of putting this out today was to try to remove this cloud, was to try to bring the transparency that my friend, Mr. Amodei, has talked about and tried to put it out there in those states which this has been legislated or voted on by the will of the people. We represent the people, I may not be in favor of some things, but, you know, when the people want it, we should represent their interest.  </p><p>      With that, I would ask each and every member here, I would urge them to support my amendment and I surrender the balance of my time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK, the question is on the Joyce amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those who oppose, say nay.  </p><p>      In the opinion of the chair -- thank you so much. Yes, the opinion of the chair -- I -- I think the nays have it.   </p><p>      Any further amendments? Yes. Mr. Cartwright?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARTWRIGHT</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, amendment number 1. I ask that it be considered read.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Considered read. The gentleman is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARTWRIGHT</emphasis>:  Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Quigley and all the committee staff for your hard work on this bill. I offer this amendment that would simply strike a harmful provision from the bill that limits investment transparency. The provision would, if enacted, ban the Securities and Exchange Commission from enacting a rule requiring publicly traded companies to disclose how they spend shareholder funds on political contributions.  </p><p>      I think such a prohibition on SEC's rulemaking ability goes against the idea of free markets. Free open markets work because of disclosures. Disclosures are the foundation of our financial system. Disclosures keep the market transparent. Disclosures separate us from rigged stock exchanges where the government picks where you get to invest the way they do in China. Disclosures ensure investors know where their money goes.  </p><p>      And this is not unwarranted or unwanted rulemaking. More than 1.2 million investors and citizens have called for the SEC to go forward with this disclosure requirement, banning the SEC from doing its job to regulate the stock market and protect investors' interests has no place in the appropriations bill or any bill for that matter. Without this amendment, investors will be kept in the dark as to where their money is being spent and as to what policies it ends up supporting.  </p><p>      The great American marketplace of ideas demands more transparency, not less. For these reasons, I urge everyone to support my amendment. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the -- the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his remarks. Chairman Graves?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Unfortunately, I have to rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. The SEC is certainly not an expert at all in this area of campaign finance nor is it set up to be an expert in campaign finance or disclosure whatsoever. We have a commission for that at the FEC. They do -- they do a great job. They're very zealous I might add and they've got exclusive jurisdiction over all the campaign finance laws.  </p><p>      Now, I'd point out for the committee, the bill does not preclude, prohibit any public company from reporting their political spending if their shareholders choose. So an opt-in is certainly available. I appreciate the gentleman's concerns in this area. We've had discussions in the past, but with that, I'd have to oppose the amendment. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Mr. Quigley is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUIGLEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of this amendment. As Justice Brandeis said, the sunlight is the best of disinfectants. In recent years, the Supreme Court decisions like Citizens United and McCutcheon have cast a dark shadow over democracy allowing the voices of every day Americans to be easily drowned out by corporations, shadowy front groups and a handful of billionaires. Just look at the language embedded every year since 2016 in this bill.  </p><p>      The ability of corporate executives to spend company resources for political purposes raises significant concerns. Without transparency or disclosures, corporations are free to spend funds invested by shareholders without accountability. Reducing the role of corporate influence in our electoral process requires a comprehensive approach and that includes reinstating the SEC role to require publicly traded companies to disclose their political spending. I urge the adoption of this amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion? If not, I look to the gentleman, for a minute to close, from Pennsylvania.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARTWRIGHT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's true, under Citizens United for better or worse, the Supreme Court of the United States has told us that money is speech. And if we're going to give the megaphone to corporations, shouldn't we also give investors the right to know what they're lending their voices to when they invest in their corporations?  </p><p>      Keeping this provision in the bill is simply a handout to corporate interests at the expense of investors and open markets. We owe our constituents open, transparent markets and the protection that inherently follows with them. Please join me in supporting transparency by voting yes on this amendment. I yield back, and thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentleman. The question is on the Cartwright amendment. All of those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.  </p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not agreed to.   </p><p>      Further amendment? Ms. Lee is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  I have an amendment at the desk. This is Lee amendment number 1.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Would you consider it read?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Unanimous consent to dispense with the reading.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  We're pleased to recognize you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Thank you. Mr. Chairman, this is very simple. It would strike Section 810 of the bill which is yet another Republican ideological rider. This policy rider which bans federal funds appropriated for the District of Columbia to pay for abortion services is a clear violation of the District's home rule and is dangerous to the health of the women in the District of Columbia.  </p><p>      Year after year, I have stood in this committee along with our ranking member to highlight just how detrimental this policy rider really is. No other jurisdiction or state is told how to use its own locally raised revenue, yet this committee is prepared to once again vote to force Congress's view on the District of Columbia. We should never be in the business of denying a woman's reproductive health coverage because of her race, her ethnicity, her source of insurance, income or where she lives, yet that's exactly what this policy rider does.  </p><p>      It specifically targets women of color and low-income women in the District. In fact, 93 percent of the Washingtonians whose access to abortion care is restricted by this ban are women of color and we know that a woman who seeks an abortion but is denied is more likely to fall into poverty than one who has access to their full range of reproductive choices including abortions.  </p><p>      We already know that since 1973, the very terrible Hyde amendment has prohibited use of federal funds to provide or promote abortion services. Now, my personal view is that the Hyde amendment should be overturned, but the unfortunate fact of the matter is that the removal of the D.C. abortion ban would not alter the current prohibition against federal funding of abortion services. And of course, this rider is just another example of members of Congress trampling over the rights of D.C. residents and denying D.C. taxpayers the freedom to make their own decisions, their own decisions about how local funds should be used.  </p><p>      So for many reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Ms. Lee. Chairman Graves.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I'd rise in opposition to the amendment. I know the gentlelady raises this issue each year, but D.C. local funds limitation has been in place every year, every year since 1996 with the exception of one year. And I would I guess commend to the committee here that we should make it two years. Let's -- let's keep this streak going, let's keep it going and I'd oppose the amendment and ask the committee to continue with the current position of the bill.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentleman. Mr. Quigley is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUIGLEY</emphasis>:  Having a right and being able to access that right are two very different things. The sad truth is that women with resources can choose whether or not to grow their families while women without resources are left with no choice or they struggle to make ends meet.  </p><p>      Choice is the heart of this issue, but it's not a choice for us to make. It's the choice for women and their families, a choice between women and their doctors. I never understood this contradiction in my mind with being a conservative. I always felt that we are being told that it's not for government to tell people what to do, how to handle their own situations and their personal situations.  </p><p>      This is as intimate a decision as there is and you're intruding upon that. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentleman. Ms. DeLauro is recognized. And then I see some additional hands. Mr. Price and Ms. Clark and others.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELAURO</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I speak in support of the amendment put forward by our colleague, Congresswoman Lee. It strikes the language. It bans the use of the District of Columbia funded abortions. In 2011, the majority successfully prohibited the District of Columbia from using its own locally raised revenues to cover abortions for women living in the city.  </p><p>      According to the family, the Kaiser Family Foundation, the ban impacted the health care choices of almost 60,000 women in 2013 alone. The residents and government of Washington, D.C. should be able to determine how they want to use their local resources without congressional interference just like any other state. In fact, it strikes me as ironic that while this majority continually claims to support the sovereignty of local governments in health care, they seek to restrict the District of Columbia's ability to make its own decisions about its own funds.  </p><p>      To this end, this is about a right for women to make their own decisions with their family and with their doctors, with clergy. It is also about trusting women to make these decisions. I share this belief with the majority of the American people who support Roe v. Wade and the right to a safe and legal abortion in this country, but the majority would rather take us back to a time when women could not make their own health care decisions.  </p><p>      We must promote and protect the rights of every woman, every family, every American to make their own family planning decisions. Congresswoman Lee's amendment would do so. It would help reverse the majority's attack on women's rights and the -- the autonomy of the District of Columbia. I urge my colleagues to support it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you Ms. DeLauro. Ms. Lowey is recognized, the ranking member.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOWEY</emphasis>:  I rise in strong support of this amendment. Yet again, the majority is wasting time in an attempt to prevent the District of Columbia from using its own funds to safe legal health services. If you want to dictate what should be done with local dollars, you ought to run for the D.C. council, but for now, none of us were elected to force a hyper-partisan ideologically driven agenda on the residents of Washington.  </p><p>      Let me be very clear, lack of public funding for health services creates a grave financial burden for already struggling families. It forces women to make an impossible choice between paying out of pocket for reproductive health care services or for basic necessities like groceries for their families. This restriction frankly is a slap in the face to all District residents, many of whom are sitting in this room as members of our staff.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Ms. Clark is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARK</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yet again, here we are talking about attacking women's rights instead of listening to what women and families actually need. Women in my district need safe and respectful work environments where they're paid equally for equal work. Women in my district need affordable child care so they can make decisions about their work-life balance that's what -- that's what is about what's right for their families, not what they have to do out of necessity.  </p><p>      Women in my district need affordable quality health care, but what we're talking about today is a bill that tells women they don't have a right to plan their own families and that politicians should have more of a say in their health care decisions than they do. Women in my district deserve to make their own medical decisions and so do the women of Washington, D.C. You should not be telling women that being a D.C. resident means you sign away your right to make private choices about your own health care. Congress should not be placing itself between women and their doctors.  </p><p>      The District of Columbia has the right to use its own locally raised funds to offer necessary health coverage to its citizens. I adamantly support the gentlewoman from California's amendment to strike this regressive and inappropriate restriction. I urge my colleagues to get back to work for women and families and support this amendment. I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Ms. Clark. Mr. Price and then Ms. Wasserman Schultz will be recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm happy to join with Ms. Lee in sponsoring this amendment. It would remove the poison bill rider that denies coverage for the full range of reproductive health services including abortion care for women enrolled in D.C. Medicaid.  </p><p>      Federal insurance coverage of abortion care is already restricted, except in limited circumstances. I personally take issue with that policy, but our amendment addresses an even more prescriptive rider, because currently all 50 states have the autonomy to determine how to spend their own money, their locally raised Medicaid dollars, including whether or not this non-federal funding could be used for abortion coverage.  </p><p>      Frustratingly, Congress routinely denies that option for Medicaid beneficiaries in Washington, D.C. This restriction overrides the will of D.C.'s own elected officials, withholds comprehensive health care coverage for women in the capital. The D.C. abortion ban disproportionately affects women and families of color, immigrants, youth and low-income individuals many of whom already have a hard time accessing equitable and competent care.  </p><p>      So we need to end this policy that treats Washingtonians differently than all other Americans. The members of the House Appropriations Committee were not elected to represent D.C. residents and we shouldn't be in the business of legislating their health care. Every woman deserves to make their own health care decisions without congressional interferences and that should be regardless of her ZIP Code or her insurance coverage. I urge the adoption of the amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Price. Ms. Wasserman Schultz is recognized for time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WASSERMAN SCHULTZ</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Study after study shows that placing strict limits on abortion coverage can have a profound impact on those who already face significant barriers to care, such as low income individuals, immigrants, youth, women of color and transgender and gender non-conforming individuals.  </p><p>      According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 59,800 non-elderly Medicaid enrolled women whose access is affected by this ban resided in D.C. in 2013. In 2011, of the Washingtonians whose access to abortion care is restricted by the local funds ban, the vast majority, 93 percent, were people of color. To make matters worse, these studies have also shown that poor women are often forced to use money that would have been spent for rent, utility bills, food and clothing for themselves and their families in order to be able to pay for abortion services. In fact, almost 60 percent of Medicaid-eligible women reported that paying for an abortion presented serious burdens compared with only 26 percent of women not eligible for Medicaid.  </p><p>      Forcing those who already face obstacles in accessing health care to make choices like whether to pay rent or obtain medically necessary reproductive health care is not only wrong, it is shameful. Sadly, the D.C. ban is not only bad policy, but it also violates the spirit of the Supreme Court's decisions in Harris versus McRae which clearly asserted that state funds used to provide abortion services for low income women is a state, not federal decision.  </p><p>      For a party that prides itself on support for strong and local governments, my Republican colleagues sure have a funny way of showing it. The District of Columbia should have the same ability to control its own tax powers as the 50 states including having the option to support -- to provide support to low income women with its local tax dollars. Consistently we hear a states' right argument from republicans, unless it's inconvenient to their -- their alternative points of view.  </p><p>      There's no consistency here on the part of the party and this damaging language in this bill that's carried every year except one should be dropped because it shouldn't have ever been carried in the first place. I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentlewoman. Ms. Lee, a minute to close.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, let me just say since it's been offered in place since 1996 really doesn't make it right, and it is discrimination against women in the District. D.C. is the only area in the country with this federally mandated prohibition, why should we force this on the District of Columbia?   </p><p>      I have to ask you, my colleagues, do you want us to interfere in your local districts and legislate what they can use their local money for? It's their own money. It's not federal tax dollars. Their duly elected representative who is here with this, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton -- she has spoken out strongly against the imposition of nonresident members of Congress' ideology -- placing your ideology on her district, even when some of those same members attempted to silence her voice.  </p><p>      A woman in the District of Columbia struggling in to make ends meet must have the ability to make important personal decisions with her own physician based on what is best for her family and her circumstances. It's time that Congress stopped playing politics with D.C.'s home rule and with the health of its women in residence and in this ideological posturing, you really wouldn't want me coming into your district advocating a policy to get your districts to stop using their own funds for what they want to use them to, this is downright wrong.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentlewoman.

The ayes are 22, the nays are 29, 29, the amendment is not agreed to. We have six more amendments to do. Mr. Ryan is recognized to -- for his amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYAN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  It's considered read?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYAN</emphasis>:  You can read it, because it's only a line.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLERK</emphasis>:  \"An amendment offered Mr. Ryan. In section 818, strike 'none of the funds' and insert 'none of the federal funds.'\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Gentleman is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYAN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Section 818 is a new provision prohibiting federal and local funds from being used to carry out the Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act or RHNDA, a law passed by the D.C. Council in 2014. RHNDA protects employees working in the District of Columbia from workplace discrimination based on their reproductive health decisions and those of their spouses and dependents.  </p><p>      Under this law, an employer cannot fire a woman for having an abortion after a rape or for using in vitro fertilization to address infertility. It prohibits an employer from reducing the salary of a man who uses condoms for family planning or a parent who buys birth control for a son or daughter in college.  </p><p>      As written, section 818 prohibits the District of Columbia from using any funds including local funds consisting solely of local taxes and fees to carry out RHNDA. This provision represents the sixth attempt by Congress to undermine this nondiscrimination law since 2015, but the first time this RHNDA rider has been included in the underlying financial services appropriations bill.  </p><p>      Unlike the D.C. Council, no member of this committee or this Congress was elected to legislate on local D.C. issues. The inclusion of section 818 is undemocratic, a violation of the majority stated belief, and local control, and autonomy, and yet another insult to D.C. residents, some of whom are staffers, their spouses, and their children. To remedy this, my amendment inserts federal before funds, restoring the District of Columbia's ability to spend its local funds to carry out RHNDA's mission.  </p><p>      In anticipation of possible objections to my amendment, let me be clear about what RHNDA does not do. It does not discriminate against churches or religious organizations. It applies to all employers, and the law protects religious liberty by ensuring every employee in D.C. can follow his or her religious or moral beliefs when making health care decisions without fear of retaliation.   </p><p>      It does not force employers to cover elective abortions in their health insurance plans. RHNDA is clear on this. The law states this section shall not be construed to require an employer to provide insurance coverage related to a reproductive health decision.  </p><p>      There's absolutely no ambiguity here, it does not require pro-life organizations to hire individuals who advocate for abortion, it protects employees decisions regarding their own reproductive health, their beliefs about reproductive health are outside the scope of the law, organizations can still make employment decisions based on religion and political views, and employees must be willing to carry out employers' missions and directives.  </p><p>      In short, RHNDA is not about religious liberty, it's about basic workplace fairness, employees should be judged by their employers solely on job performance, not on the reproductive health decisions they make outside of work. I strongly urge my colleagues to support my amendment and allow the District of Columbia to spend its local funds protecting employees from workplaces.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentleman for his comments. Mr. Graves is recognized, the chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, the majority opposes the amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Mr. Quigley is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUIGLEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I've spent nine and a half years in this city for some period of time, it's not Chicago, but it's is a place I would live, I think the only reservation I would have is that it's a jurisdiction largely controlled by an outside government, and that's us.  </p><p>      Every year we mark up this bill, we discover how many of our colleagues aspire to a seat on the District of Columbia City Council by asking not to carry out that urge at the expense of the right of the people of the District to govern themselves as they see fit and to spend their tax dollars as they see fit. I urge the support of this amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion on the Ryan amendment? Otherwise, the gentleman has a minute to close. It's on, Ms. Lee. Excuse me. Apologies.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Ms. Lee is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Once again, I rise in strong support of Congressman Ryan's amendment, once again, another anti-D.C. rider, another anti-woman rider. This is a new rider that prohibits the District of Columbia from implementing a law, the Reproductive Health Nondiscrimination Amendment Act of 2014, that the D.C. Council passed unanimously. This rider is about violating D.C. Home Rule and protecting women's access to care. All women, regardless of their ZIP Code, their income, or their employer, should have the ability to make private decisions regarding their health care. D.C.'s bill simply ensures that employees can make their own reproductive health decisions without interference or fear of retribution from their employers.  </p><p>      Unfortunately, my colleagues will stop at nothing -- short of nothing to limit women's access to reproductive health care and to trample on D.C.'s autonomy. Members of Congress who are not accountable to the residents of the District of Columbia should not interfere with D.C. local laws.  </p><p>      Once again, it's hard for me to imagine why in the world you continue to do this. These are ideological attacks on women's health. We have no business getting into the business of the District of Columbia. They passed their legislation unanimously. Again, you don't want me coming to your districts, advocating for something to -- you know, that you may not like, that they're trying to do with their own local funds.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Ms. Lee. And Mr. Serrano is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SERRANO</emphasis>:  Very briefly. For years I've said this and I haven't said it recently. Washington, D.C. has become the playground for so many members of Congress to do whatever they want to do.   </p><p>      In other words, when they go back home to get asked, \"How do you feel about school vouchers?\" \"Well, I'm for them.\" \"You are?\" \"Yes, in Washington D.C.\" \"How do you feel about marijuana?\" \"I'm against it.\" \"You are?\" \"Yes, in Washington D.C.\" \"Abortions?\" \"Well, I'm against them.\" \"Where?\" \"In D.C.\"  </p><p>      And D.C. becomes the place that gives you people cover for saying they are for or against certain issues and they use it as if there was no respect for human beings that work and live in that community called Washington, D.C. And I think it's time that we realize that we have to treat people with dignity and respect, but it will fall on deaf ears and we will continue to do this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  No further discussion. Mr. Ryan has a minute to close.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYAN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to remind my colleagues what this amendment is about. It's not about religious liberty. It is not about abortion. It's about basic workplace fairness. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support my amendment and allow the District of Columbia to spend local funds protecting employees from workplace discrimination. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you. I thank the gentleman. The question's on the Ryan amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.  </p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not agreed to.   </p><p>      Further amendments? Ms. Kaptur has an amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAPTUR</emphasis>:  Yes, I have an amendment at the desk, please.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Would you consider it read?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAPTUR</emphasis>:  I would ask it be considered as read.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  The gentlewoman is recognized to speak on her amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAPTUR</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAPTUR</emphasis>:  My amendment essentially would strike Titles 9, 10 and 11 in our bill, which comprise about a good 30 percent or more of the bill itself, starting on page 168. And what this comprises is the -- what's called The Choice Act, I would like to call it the Wrong Choice Act, and it involves financial institution regulation.  </p><p>      The last time I looked, the financial institutions, especially the Wall Street based ones are doing quite well in our country. All their profits are up and just coincidentally, they happen to be the largest contributors both to presidential and congressional elections. Isn't that something? So, what this section that I'm seeking to eliminate does, it authorizes on an appropriation bill at a very egregious level. Unbelievable.  </p><p>      I like to call it the Wrong Choice Act, has been passed on the floor of Congress several times, so why do we need to stick it in an appropriation bill? And I would really ask the majority, you think you're really going to sneak this past the Senate? So, it must be being put in here for some other reason, and I can only imagine what that might be. This bill keeps coming back from the dead.  </p><p>      So, I just have to say this for the record because I have served here for a while, and had to bear in my state the cost of Wall Street egregiousness, and I go back to the financial crisis of 2008, when Wall Street gambled away the individual fortunes of millions and millions of Americans amounting to well over $12 trillion, and I think only one fellow went to jail up there. His initials were B.M. But the rest of them didn't, and our people are still digging out of what happened.  </p><p>      Now, this Wrong Choice Act functionally kills the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which I know a lot of people don't like. Let me just put it in perspective. So, they took away $12 trillion from the American people and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau got back $12 billion, $12 billion. And people make a big deal out of that, it is nothing compared to what was taken away from people in my state and other places. Now, just let me read a couple words, I can't give you every page, but what this actually does, it changes the law regarding angel investors. I hope everybody knows what those are:  registration exemptions for mergers and acquisition brokers. How interesting. This is also -- shell companies, a shell company that is formed by an entity that is not a shell company, you define that for me.  </p><p>      How about truth in lending, changes in that? Exemptions -- really interesting use of words in several sections. And I just would say to my colleagues, you may not remember what collateralized debt obligations were or derivatives, but I sure do. And you'll give them an inch, and they will take not just a mile.  </p><p>      And so, I would urge my colleagues to take this authorizing language, and it's just not two words. Mr. Joyce's amendment was fairly concise. But they throw out the emergency mechanism that prevents future taxpayer bailouts throughout the emergency mechanism, why is that a good thing? Let me just put on the record also that the individuals who are pushing these kinds of changes are doing very well. Jamie Dimon, the CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, just in his salary, earns $28 million a year.  </p><p>      James Gorman of Morgan Stanley makes $23 million. Now this doesn't include all their holdings, this is just the raw salary. Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs makes $22 million a year. Brian Moynihan of Bank of America makes $20 million a year. All these folks who are involved in what went wrong in 2008, they still got their jobs and they're doing even better.  </p><p>      Meanwhile, the median household income of our country is up 5.3 percent since 2008, barely above the 2008 inflation level after adjusting for inflation and inequality in our country continues to grow. In 2007, the top 1 percent of people in our country owned 34 percent of wealth, they now own 39 percent.  </p><p>      In 2007, the bottom 90 percent owned 29 percent of this country's wealth, now they all under -- they own under a quarter, 23 percent. So, Mr. Chairman, I ask that Titles 9, 10 and 11 be struck from this bill, I think it's the right thing to do, especially because it is massive authorizing on an appropriation bill. It is inappropriate in an appropriation bill. And I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Ms. Kaptur. And Chairman Graves.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I, you know, I, you know, rise an opposition, and at first I have to say, I'm really surprised that Ms. Kaptur wants to strike these sections. This is truly the heart of this bill with a bipartisan heartbeat, what's unique about these sections is that the majority of all the provisions were bipartisan through the House, either passed with 250 or more votes many at 270, 80, and 90, and a lot of them were just suspensions that were overwhelmingly supported by the House. So, while the talking points that recited there might not match completely with what we have here, this is the most bipartisan section that I would ask this committee to keep intact in object this -- object to this amendment. So with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Graves. Mr. Quigley, do you seek time or...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUIGLEY</emphasis>:  No.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Mr. Yoder, excuse me. Mr. Yoder is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YODER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Chairman Yoder.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YODER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Frankly, Mr. Chairman, I'm stunned and out outraged that my colleague from Ohio would bring this amendment. What -- one of things she's striking here is the E-mail Privacy Act, which has passed the House unanimously in the last Congress and this Congress. And striking that amendment would allow the government to have unwarranted warrantless searches of Americans' e-mails without their permission, without their knowledge, and continue this horrible practice from a 1986 law that allows the government to spy on American citizens without their knowledge or permission.  </p><p>      The House has spoken on this twice, and spoken on it in the last Congress unanimously, it spoke on it this Congress unanimously. And so, it's the kind of bipartisan legislation that Americans want us to pursue, and allowing agencies to continue to violate our Fourth Amendment rights to me is unconscionable.  </p><p>      And so, voting for Ms. Kaptur's amendment would be a vote against the -- voting for Ms. Kaptur's amendment would be a vote against the Fourth Amendment, a vote against the civil liberties or constituents, a vote against technology, a vote to support the Senate's practice of sitting on our House bills and never moving them, and worst of all, it's a vote against bipartisanship on this unifying legislation. I'd like to think Chairman Graves for his working with us to get this in the legislation and his team, and I would strongly oppose the Kaptur amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion on the Kaptur -- and Ms. Lowey is recognized, the ranking member.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOWEY</emphasis>:  I just rise in strong support of my friend's amendment. Just Title 10 alone -- Title 9 alone is nearly half of this bill. It is filled with a garden variety of financial services authorizing language. Its inclusion highlights real friction simmering within the majority. With two chambers of Congress and the White House under Republican control, why does the majority feel compelled to push so much authorizing language through this committee?  </p><p>      Let me be clear, I voted for some of the bills included in Title 9, several have even passed the House on a voice vote. But last time I checked, this is the Appropriations Committee, not the Financial Services committee, this language along with Titles 10, and 11 -- and 11 simply have no place in our bills, so let's do the right thing, leave it to the authorizers, strike this language for the -- for the amendment. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentlewoman for her comments. Any further comments? If not, Ms. Kaptur has a minute to close.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAPTUR</emphasis>:  Just remember 2008. Remember collateralized debt obligations, and remember derivatives. And there were little words put in bills like this that ended up being time bombs that practically brought the country down.   </p><p>      So I would say for the gentleman that is -- would like to bring up the e-mail issue, bring it up to the floor in an authorizing capacity, don't put it in an appropriation bill. It's amazing to me that this entire -- that's why I say there must be other motivation for this in an election year, that this would be stuck in an appropriation bill that we want to pass in order to make sure that the government of the United States operates. I yield back. Please vote for the Kaptur amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Ms. Kaptur. The question's on the Kaptur amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.  </p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not adopted.   </p><p>      Further amendments? Ms. Wasserman Schultz and then Mr. Serrano after that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WASSERMAN SCHULTZ</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have an amendment at the desk and I ask that it considered as read.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  It's considered read. We're pleased to recognize you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WASSERMAN SCHULTZ</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I offer this amendment with Ms. Lee to strike section 112 of the bill. As it would diminish the vitality of our nation's religious organizations and violate our First Amendment rights. Section 112 which my amendment strikes would water down a provision in the tax code, sometimes referred to as the Johnson amendment, which protects the integrity and independence of charities and houses of worship by ensuring that they do not endorse or oppose political candidates.  </p><p>      One of the characteristics of American religious institutions that has made them so sacred is that they are separate from governments and separate from campaign politics. If Americans want to get involved in partisan elections, we know how to do that, but what we are seeking when we attend church, synagogue, mosque, temple, or any other house of worship is quite different.  </p><p>      This distinction has long been reflected in how our law treats religious institutions differently than political institutions. To preserve their sacred place in American society, houses of worship must stay above the political fray and refrain from endorsing candidates for political office. Current law strikes a careful balance, and it's important to emphasize what houses of worship with tax exempt status can do, they are permitted to advocate for policies that are consistent with their values, and they can help their members become engaged in the political process.  </p><p>      They can organize public debates on any issue, organize candidate forums, conduct voter registration drives, get out the vote, and help transport people to the polls. They just can't tell people who to vote for. It's no surprise that a wide array of religious organizations and faith leaders support the Johnson amendment and oppose section 112, out of an understandable concern that political parties and candidates seeking power would be empowered to use their congregations as tools and pressure them for endorsements.  </p><p>      And I ask, Mr. Chairman, that letters signed by thousands of these concerned and respected organizations, which I know I brought to the committee with me -- so I want to actually, visibly show you how many we have received, that these thousands of concerned and respected organizations have sent letters to the Congress, urging that this action be dropped from the bill.  </p><p>      Make no mistake:  Weakening existing law would have the unintended consequence of dividing congregations and opening them up to political wheeling and dealing. I think we can all agree that Americans have had enough of political partisanship, they don't want more of it, and they certainly don't want it in their houses of worship where so many seek refuge from the tumult and chaos of their day to day life. As if gutting these protections for houses of worship weren't bad enough, this provision also likely violates our First Amendment rights.  </p><p>      While current law applies to all tax exempt nonprofit organizations, section 112 would only applied to houses of worship. Specifically, section 112 makes it nearly impossible for the IRS to investigate claims that houses of worship have violated the law. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was designed to prevent exactly this kind of religious favoritism.  </p><p>      Regardless of our political stripes and colors, and regardless of our religion, no one wants our houses of worship to be torn apart by partisan campaign politics. And no one wants their First Amendment rights torn away from them. As people of faith, we cannot allow this effort to politicize our sanctuaries of worship to move forward. And as federal lawmakers, we have a responsibility to ensure equal justice, liberty, and protection for all people. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on my amendment. And I yield to my colleague, Ms. Lee.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK. Ms. Lee, you...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Thank you very much. And as a co-sponsor of this amendment, I wanted...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  You have -- you have about a minute or so, because if you're -- you can claim your own time in a few minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Would you rather claim your own time?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  I'll claim my own time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for her comments.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WASSERMAN SCHULTZ</emphasis>:  Thanks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Thank you. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Chairman Graves.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The majority...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Of course.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  ... opposes the amendment from the gentlelady from Florida.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK. Mr. Quigley.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUIGLEY</emphasis>:  (inaudible)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Would you yield to...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUIGLEY</emphasis>:  (inaudible)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Ms. Lee and then we're going to go to Mr. Culberson, so.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  OK. But thank you very much. Let me just associate myself with the remarks of my colleague Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz, and thank her very much for introducing this amendment again. As she mentioned, section 112 of this bill is designed to give religious organizations in violation of the First Amendment special tax benefits and privileges that are unavailable to other nonreligious organizations. Sadly, this provision would make it very difficult for the IRS to investigate religious organizations if they are in violation of the law. Now, as a person of faith I can attest that I do not want my place of worship to become overly politicized. And other Americans agree as you have just seen.  </p><p>      According to public opinion polling, more than seven in 10 Americans oppose allowing places of worship to endorse political candidates. Americans and our Constitution are on the right side of this issue, our committee should follow suit and support this amendment. In order to protect the integrity and independence of houses of worship and faith based charities, and the separation of church and state, we need to ensure that they do not endorse or oppose political candidates. So, I hope my colleagues will support this important amendment. Thank you and I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentlewoman for her comments. Mr. Culberson from Houston, Texas is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CULBERSON</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, the language which Chairman Graves has included in this bill. My request is very narrowly drawn to ensure that the First Amendment rights of pastors are protected consistent with the First Amendment, which directs that Congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise of religion or abridging the freedom of speech.  </p><p>      Now, this amendment is very, this section that Chairman Graves included is very narrowly drawn, so that only the commissioner of the IRS can remove the nonprofit status of a church or place of worship if the commissioner determines that they've engaged in political speech.  </p><p>      The -- one of the largest -- I represent the two largest churches, in the country, Lakewood and Second Baptist Church, and Second Baptist had their tax exempt status threatened several years ago when they simply handed out voter registration cards. Now, that's absurd. We want everyone who can vote in America to vote, and we want -- I think should we -- should we encourage people to in -- to register people to vote, and the amendment, the section that it -- this amendment would strike, is again, very nearly drawn and designed to protect the free speech rights of our pastors and churches while preserving the ability of the IRS to revoke the nonprofit status of a place of worship that does engage in political conduct. So I urge members to vote against the amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Culberson. Mr. Price is recognized and then Ms. Clark.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I rise this in support of the amendment and suggest to colleagues that we really better be careful about this one. We really better be careful. I suggest that you think about it very carefully. The Johnson amendment is a valuable safeguard that protects our religious institutions and our political process. Our guideposts in this should be the twin constitutional pillars, the free exercise clause and the Establishment Clause that serve not only to ensure that houses of worship do not become entangled with the state, but also that houses of worship are protected from the state. The core value is religious liberty. It's entirely appropriate that the Establishment Clause is part of the Bill of Rights.  </p><p>Congress -- congregations currently have ample freedom to speak out on political and social issues. They can host candidate forums. They can organize \"souls to the polls\" trips (ph). They can hold voter registration drives. These activities are protected, and they should be. As long as the activity is about promoting conscientious citizenship and related faith to the issues of the day, we want to encourage more of this activity, not less.   </p><p>      There's plenty of evidence that this kind of advocacy, religious concern for good citizenship on the common good is alive and well in our religious institutions. But what is not permissible under current law is the endorsement of specific candidates or direct intervention in political campaigns. That's really what's at stake in the Johnson amendment.  </p><p>      We should think very carefully before we legitimate (ph) using religious institutions as a conduit for political contributions or for candidate or party-centered political advocacy. That would threaten, rather than enhance the freedom of these institutions. And I think it would lead to great cynicism about the activities of these institutions.  </p><p>      At present, our houses of worship are by and large greatly respected. They have great moral force. People pay attention when the faith community speaks out. If these voices are seen as a front for campaigns or as institutions that are being exploited by campaigns, that undermines that moral force, something we would all live to regret. Let's be careful. Let's maintain the safeguards that are in place and have served our congregations and our constituents well. I urge the adoption of this amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Mr. Graves, any comment on Mr. Price's amendment?  </p><p>      OK. What?  </p><p>      Ms. Clark, you're recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARK</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, speak in strong support of my colleague's amendment to remove the language in this bill that would seriously undermine the Johnson amendment. Section 112 of this bill would make it virtually impossible for the IRS to enforce the Johnson amendment as it applies to religious institutions, allowing them to actively endorse or oppose political candidates.  </p><p>      As Congressman Price just stated, we encourage lots of activity in our houses of worship, but this is going too far and putting us on a dangerous path. Allowing this section to become law would put at risk the ability of churches and other places of worship to continue to serve as nonpartisan places for worship, reflection, and community, rather than as another political battleground.  </p><p>      Further, by singling out houses of worship among all 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations, this section raises a serious question about its constitutionality. The First Amendment prohibits the government from creating a legal preference for religious over non-religious entities. Hundreds of religious organizations and thousands of faith leaders agree that being pulled apart by divisive political campaigns would be a harmful step for their institutions and their communities.  </p><p>      On constitutional grounds, on the grounds of common sense and decency, we should all be able to agree that keeping politics separate from our centers of worship makes sense and it's the right thing to do. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. And I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion? Ms. Roybal-Allard is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROYBAL-ALLARD</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I am in strong support of this amendment. And I yield the balance of my time to Mr. Quigley.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUIGLEY</emphasis>:  I thank my colleague -- thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Mr. Quigley, you could claim your own time but you're recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUIGLEY</emphasis>:  Thank you. Look, places of worship are intended to be just that. They inspire belief, and they build community. By repealing this amendment, divisive themes, the Johnson amendment, divisive themes are introduced into the unified environments that religious organizations strive to build, thereby, undermining their core objectives.  </p><p>      Now, you know what we've lived through under this law for some time, nothing in the law prevents pastors from speaking out from the pulpit on issues no matter how controversial. But beyond the ideological argument lies a constitutional one. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment calls for the separation of church and state, but by repealing this amendment, we are facilitating a direct transaction between the two.  </p><p>      Let's look at what our colleagues did over on the authorizing side, they rejected recent attempts to include a repeal of the Johnson amendment in the new tax law. Furthermore, this subverts campaign disclosure laws, finance disclosure laws, and lends itself to the creation of new \"religious organizations,\" quote, as instruments of campaign cash. In short, this repeal overtly link state and church and greases the wheel for dark money. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. And I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  That worries me.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion? Ms. Wasserman Schultz has a minute to close.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WASSERMAN SCHULTZ</emphasis>:  Thank you. Sorry. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to close really by issuing a single plea to my colleagues. This really is as Mr. Price said, a \"Be careful what you wish for\" moment. Partisan politics has infiltrated so many aspects of our lives already. I know all of us regret this state of affairs even though we have chosen to engage in it on a daily basis.   </p><p>      Now, imagine how our constituents feel. I think it's safe to say that the vast majority of them who are members of religious congregations treasure their houses of worship as spaces far removed from the literally profane political discourse that is all around us. Let us not turn our pews into pits of partisan conflict.  </p><p>      No house of worship should be pressured to turn its pulpit into a super PAC, where millions of dollars in donations could be washed across its collection plates with little transparency and all while handing deep pocketed donors massive tax write-offs. Do we want to elected officials and candidates to go to houses of worship speaking out spiritual guidance but political endorsements? Do we congregations to grapple not with the Divine Word of God, but with the poll tested words of politicians? I think not.  </p><p>      I hope that the members of this committee recognize and agree with me that we should make sure that our houses of worship continue to be the respite that they were intended to be and have been for thousands of years, and remove this badly misguided section of the bill. I yield back the balance of my time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Now the question is on the Wasserman Schultz amendment. All of those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.  </p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not agreed to.

Mr. Serrano's recognized...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SERRANO</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  ... for the purpose of amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SERRANO</emphasis>:  Yes, and I ask it to be waived -- reading.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Considered read and waived, and the gentleman is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SERRANO</emphasis>:  Done. Done with it. You want the Spanish version or the English version?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Well, you can do both if you want, but let's keep it short.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SERRANO</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, last week acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Mike Mulvaney, fired all 25 members of the bureau's consumer advisory board on a conference call.  </p><p>      To this day members have not received the dignity of a clear explanation for their terminations even after Mr. Mulvaney's political appointee told the members that, \"Nothing is wrong with the present group.\" To make matters worse, they also -- they have also been barred from reapplying to serve on the board in the future. The move has been met with a wave of criticism and concern about Mr. Mulvaney's motivations. There's also no discussion in the law allowing these actions.  </p><p>      This board was established under Dodd Frank and statutorily mandated to meet with the director at least two times per year. Members of the consumer advisory board are a broad and geographically diverse set of stakeholders, including consumer advocates, and lawyers, financial service industry representatives, CDFIs, academics, and more.  </p><p>      These members serve in a voluntary capacity and they have sacrificed their time, money, and energy to provide their best insights and experiences with the bureau to help develop rules and policies that will protect consumers and businesses alike. My amendment would simply revoke the acting director is termination and reinstate all members of the consumer advisory board.  </p><p>      It would also remove the director's ability to terminate members of the board without cause and require a written notification to the board member in question and to Congress. This amendment is pretty straightforward, and would right the petty terminations of these board members, which was completely unnecessary.  </p><p>      Now, my Republican colleagues will argue that this amendment is authorizing language and should be opposed. But I would like to point out to those same colleagues that this 312 page bill we're working on now has 142 pages of authorizing language. This amendment is a drop in the bucket. And I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentleman for his remarks. So, Chairman Graves recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the amendment, but I also rise to applaud the gentleman from New York, he's one of the lone voices on the other side that wants to see CFPB under our jurisdiction. And Mr. Serrano, thank you, thank you for offering this amendment because you're expressing -- I think everyone's concern that is we want to have oversight, we want to offer direction, and while I oppose the amendment here, because I know that the director is going to reappoint the board later this year with new members, he's going to populate the board, I do -- I do appreciate though you're willing to step out there in provide appropriating oversight over this bureau. With that though, I oppose the amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion on the amendment? Ms. Lowey is recognized, the ranking member.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOWEY</emphasis>:  I rise in -- I rise in strong support of my friend's amendment. The Trump administration's dismantling of the CFPB is underway. It is a direct and unacceptable attack on consumer financial protections that prioritizes special interests over our constituents. Earlier this month at Mick Mulvaney's direction, the CFPB disbanded its advisory board and councils. The advisory board is mandated by Dodd Frank to advise and consult the CFPB, convening twice a year. Since Mulvaney took over last year, it hasn't met once.  </p><p>      This isn't surprising, but it is concerning. We must ensure that the CFPB is permitted to carry out its mission, protecting consumers from predatory lending, and other loan practices. So, I ask you to vote for the amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion on the amendment? Mr. Serrano has a minute to close.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SERRANO</emphasis>:  Thank you. Simple amendment -- I think that this is an overreach. I think it's an ability of Mr. Mulvaney to do away with people he didn't want on the board; eventually, to try to do away with the board itself. And, lastly, the chairman is correct. I am a lone voice in saying that there should be oversight by this committee of that whole provision in the law.  </p><p>      And the reason I do it is for two reasons:  one, because it's the right thing to do, and secondly, because I'm a big fan of this committee. I didn't come on this committee to see it dwindle away. I think we should reach the days -- in the old days where our oversight meant a lot in this Congress and in this country. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Serrano. The question is on the Serrano amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.  </p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not agreed to.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SERRANO</emphasis>:  What?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  What?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SERRANO</emphasis>:  I didn't hear that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Want to get back to the old days? OK.  </p><p>      Further amendments, Mr. Pocan has a...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SERRANO</emphasis>:  (inaudible).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  The amendment is not agreed to. Who do we have next?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SERRANO</emphasis>:  I thought my amendment would pass.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Ms. McCollum. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Pocan, you'll be next. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCOLLUM</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chair. I have an amendment at the desk. And I would like it to consider to be read.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  The gentlewoman is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCOLLUM</emphasis>:  Thank you. My amendment restores a provision that prevents automatic pay raises for the vice president and other high-level political appointees in the executive branch. And you might ask why I'm doing this and the executive schedule is index for raises, but it appears that they cannot get an increase if there is no general schedule increase. And to my knowledge, there is no general scheduled pay increase.  </p><p>      So, it's my understanding that Mr. Trump has in fact proposed a civilian pay freeze for 2019. So, with the civilian pay raises freezes in effect, I believe at a time when American families are seeing stagnant wages, it is just unacceptable that the majority would want to abandon past years of precedent and give pay raises to senior officials in the Trump administration only. I find this politically motivated that it goes to political appointees.  </p><p>      And I'm -- I personally find it rather hypocritical, when we're -- when it's not pay raises for everyone in the federal government that would be instituted. Because, if it was, these political appointees would be taken care of.   </p><p>      I would very much like to see -- in the past, we've had Democratic administrations exercise financial restraint on their appointees' salaries. But to allow political appointees right now and allies of the Trump administration to be able to reward themselves with taxpayers' dollars is just unacceptable.  </p><p>      I would ask my Republican colleagues, do they have any other justification other than partisanship, why they would drop their insistence on salary caps now that the benefits would only be to the Trump administration political appointees?  </p><p>      Do they believe that these administration political appointees have been such responsible stewards of our tax dollars? We're faced with daily stories about the Cabinet members, for example, like EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt treating himself to taxpayers' perks, first-class flights, hundred-thousand-dollar trips to Italy and Morocco and a ridiculous $43,000 sound booth, the use of aides to procure a mattress from the Trump Hotel, the official -- on an official trip that Secretary Mnuchin so he could contently (ph) watch the solar eclipse from Fort Knox, a $30,000 dining room set purchased by Secretary Carson for his office -- just to name a few.   </p><p>Congress should be cracking down on these abuses of taxpayers, not giving the executive branch salary raises. So I urge adoption of my amendment. I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Ms. McCollum. Chairman Graves.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The majority opposes the amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion on the amendment? Ms. Lowey is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOWEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of my friend's amendment. There is no reason why the Trump administration which boasts the wealthiest cabinet in modern history should be held to a different standard than the previous administration when it comes to pay increases. This is just another case of Jekyll and Hyde games played by the majority. On the one hand, they claim to be focused on the wellbeing of our kids and our grandkids, and on the other hand, they want to give pay increases to political appointees, all while passing a tax bill that will dramatically increase the deficit. Vote for the amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion? Mr. Quigley is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUIGLEY</emphasis>:  The provision in question has been included in the final version of this bill since fiscal year 2014, and it has only then during the Trump administration that it has been left out of the House version, we shouldn't have a different standard for the Trump administration than we have the Obama administration, I support this amendment, and urge my colleagues to support it as well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYAN</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Mr. Ryan is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYAN</emphasis>:  I appreciate and I thank all the points have been made. Let me briefly add that this Congress through our legislative branch appropriations bill that Mr. Yoder and I and our teams crafted do not have a pay raise for members of Congress. So, here we are saying to ourselves, no pay raise, but yet one of the wealthiest cabinets we've ever seen is going to be eligible. I think that flies in the face of what we want to do here and I wanted to make that point and support this amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion on the gentlewoman's amendment? Ms. McCollum has a minute to close.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCOLLUM</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I think the points have been made. And I just urge adoption of this amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK. The question is on the McCollum amendment. All of those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.  </p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not agreed to. Further -- requisite number of hands, the clerk will call the roll.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLERK</emphasis>:  Mr. Aderholt?

I'm (ph) seeing no one. The clerk will tally.  </p><p>      On this vote, the ayes are 21; the nays are 27. The amendment is not adopted.  </p><p>      Mr. Pocan's recognized for his amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">POCAN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask it to be considered read.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Considered read. The gentleman's recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">POCAN</emphasis>:  Thank you very much. This is an amendment I am going to withdraw, but I do want to just put this out there for the committee and especially the subcommittee. In section 922 of the bill there are provisions for some banks that take them away from some regulation, and the reality is many of these bigger banks are cutting jobs here in the United States and sending them overseas, especially in customer service call centers.  </p><p>      You know, we know that the president has been very aggressive, having a trade war over the loss of manufacturing jobs and not that I exactly understand what he's doing in his trade war, but I know there is a trade war over manufacturing jobs, these are now service jobs that we're also seeing leave. If you lose your manufacturing jobs, you lose your service jobs, pretty soon you don't have any jobs.  </p><p>      Last year, Wells Fargo announced it was building a new 7,000-person call center in the Philippines. And just last week, Wells Fargo announced it was closing a call center in Reno, Nevada eliminating hundreds of jobs. The CEO at Wells Fargo admitted at a Senate hearing last year that many of the thousands of the jobs being cut in call centers were due to their jobs being shipped overseas. And it's not just Wells Fargo. It's Capital One, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase, Citibank and others -- have recently offshored significant numbers of call center jobs.  </p><p>      What this amendment was trying to do, and I just hope that this is something that the committee can look at perhaps more in the future, is that the provisions that allow some banks to have less regulation would not be in place for people who have outsourced more than 50 jobs.  </p><p>      I think at some point, we need to be able to address this, this amendment would do that, but given that people did not support the amendment that Marcy Kaptur had which I think would have solved some of these problems, I expect that that vote would go down and I want to be courteous of time, although I do have to get to 7:30 to win the pool, I will say that...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Just keep on talking and...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">POCAN</emphasis>:  And with that, I will withdraw my amendment, but I appreciate the time to...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Pocan for your patience. And Mr. Graves is recognized -- Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, the majority opposes Mr. Pocan's amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion on the Pocan amendment? Anyone? Withdrawing -- it's being withdrawn. Thank you for withdrawing. Any further amendments?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I was thinking that was coming back up.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I don't know.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Any further amendments?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I really appreciate you working with us.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Seeing none, I'm going to recognize -- are you rising? The gentleman has an amendment at the desk. Mr. Joyce.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLERK</emphasis>:  An amendment offered...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Considered read.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I'd like, you'll give a full explanation of what -- if you would. We won't read it, but if you could give us a full explanation. The chair asks that courtesy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Sure. Thank you.  </p><p>      Well, I understand from some they would like -- I got it. I appreciate that. What this would amount to is a bill that -- Joyce number 3 that's in front of you, the last paragraph being, after line 20 of medical marijuana, \"Any entity that engages in any activity involving marijuana that is not exclusively for medical purposes shall not be covered by this provision.\"  </p><p>      I know we've had a long and engaged debate about this. I know we're in the process of putting those together at the moment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  If you would suspend -- are there copies?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  We need five official copies.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  The minority doesn't have copies.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Again, we're in the process of handwriting...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Just suspend for just a minute. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Thank you very much for inquiring, ma'am, and I apologize for this but it's in the process of being made right now.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  So, we're going to wait until something is printed.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  They're being hand-printed as we speak, some of the language that was added there. I read the one part that was in addition to what was handed out to everyone is Joyce number 3.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  There's some difference in what we have than what you've mentioned. Our document does not say solely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  I read the last paragraph, sir, before, and I know we're in the process of getting your copy right now, ma'am. I have people down here handwriting them for you to make sure they have it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOWEY</emphasis>:  I have no idea. In fact, I was just told there are a few copies here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  If you could just use your microphone, Ms. Lowey.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOWEY</emphasis>:  Just give us a final copy.  </p><p>      OK. Take you a minute.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK. When we get the final copy, we'll give you a couple of minutes to look it over, I guess.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  In the meantime, I'd like to add, Mr. Chairman, that in listening to fellow members of the committee and trying to address your concerns, that's what we've tried to craft here is something that takes into consideration the 46 states, the three territories and the district that have engaged in or voted for or -- and legislated for the medical marijuana, that this amendment would cover medical marijuana only and that the production and sale would all be for medical marijuana only and leave out what those states, I tried to encompass everybody to be fair in the first time around. But I found some issue there. So, therefore, we've left out those states that have or -- and included that have medical that we don't use it for the recreation.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOWEY</emphasis>:  Yes. Will the gentleman yield?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  If the gentleman has the time and I guess we'll use the time until we have recovered the documents.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOWEY</emphasis>:  I'd like to clarify a question on this is that states that have only medical marijuana laws in place or medical and/or, because some states have both and I wouldn't want to preclude states that have both. Understanding this would only cover medical.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I'm going to ask the gentleman to suspend until we have a final copy which can be looked over.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOWEY</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  The meeting will come to order. I believe we have a final copy of the draft and I'm going to ask the clerk to read it, then I'll recognize the sponsor once again to explain it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLERK</emphasis>:  An amendment offered by...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Please give your attention to the clerk.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLERK</emphasis>:  \"An amendment offered by Mr. Joyce, Number 3. At the end of the bill, before the spending reduction account, insert the following section:  blank, 'None of the funds made available by this Act may be used with respect to the states of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming, or with respect to the District of Colombia, Puerto Rico or Guam.  </p><p>      \"'To penalize a financial institution solely because the institution provides financial services to an entity that is a manufacturer, producer, or a person that participates in any business or organized activity that involves handling medical marijuana or medical marijuana products and engages in such activity pursuant to a law established by a state or a unit of local government as it pertains to medical marijuana. Any entity that engages in any activity involving marijuana that is not exclusively for medical purposes shall not be covered by this provision.'\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  The gentleman from Ohio is recognized to explain his amendment and obviously we'd welcome any additional comments from members and certainly from the chair and the ranking member.  </p><p>      Mr. Joyce is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Thank you. Somewhat to say we've debated this ad nauseam and I can appreciate that. What I tried to do is listen to the concerns with my brothers and sisters here. I wish and I beg your indulgence for keeping you beyond the time we should have been out of here. And I could tell you as a fellow appropriator that if every committee in this building worked as hard as we do, we'd get a lot more done.  </p><p>      But I certainly appreciate your staying by. We tried to engage since we passed -- it was brought to our attention that when we passed in CGIS, a criminal or the part of the withholding funds for the criminal aspect was for medical then this would be in line with the medical marijuana purposes that were being served in those states that have it, and I urge you to consider and vote for it because I believe it's appropriate for those states that have legitimately brought state medical marijuana to the forefront.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Chairman Graves is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      And I want to thank the gentleman. I know he's been working on this issue for a long time. He's heard the concerns of the committee. And this is a complicated issue, but there's clearly a gray area and there's room for improvement. This is a good first step. I think he has narrowed it to a point of which he heard the consensus of this committee in a bipartisan sense. But with that, certainly it's up to the committee and your decision whether or not we include this in our final bill, but I thank the gentleman for his good work and hard work on this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Graves.  </p><p>      Mr. Quigley?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUIGLEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      I want to congratulate the gentleman for his persistence, creativity. It's been an interesting process in this last amendment. I just want you to know as a 10-year veteran of the Cook County Board and a staffer for 10 years at the Chicago City Council, I am home.  </p><p>      All that being said, I support the amendment.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Mr. Chair?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  The gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Cole.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COLE</emphasis>:  Thank you and I thank my friend. It's actually been a good discussion. It had been helpful to some of us that are not as involved in this issue.  </p><p>      I would ask the gentleman, I know Oklahoma is listed here, we've not made the decision yet as a state to adopt medical marijuana. That's actually on the ballot in Oklahoma on June the 26th. And so, I don't want anything that would presuppose how that election will go. Literally the voters of the state have not made a decision on this yet.  </p><p>      So, I would ask if the gentleman would, if he could just withdraw us from his amendment and if that's appropriate, just a little second because I don't want to be voting on something that presumes my state is for something that I don't know yet how they're going to vote.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  If I'm not mistaken, at the moment...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  You'll yield to Mr. Joyce, my friend.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COLE</emphasis>:  Certainly.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  And CBD oil, which is part of this, that -- it treats...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COLE</emphasis>:  That -- OK, that would apply.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COLE</emphasis>:  OK. Well, then, I'll withdraw my concern. It was not clear to me. I thank my friend.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion? Ms. McCollum and then Mr. Moolenaar.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCOLLUM</emphasis>:  Mr. Chair, members of the committee, I want to compliment Mr. Joyce. I want to compliment all of us. This is very rare in Congress where we see an opportunity to come together, move something forward and address everybody's concerns and considerations, and I want to thank Mr. Joyce for working with me and the members on our side of the aisle.  </p><p>      Mr. Chair, I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Mr. Moolenaar, you didn't say anything about going home, did you? That was Mr. Simpson.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MOOLENAAR</emphasis>:  No. That was Mr. Simpson.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p>      Mr. Moolenaar?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MOOLENAAR</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      And I guess my concern with this amendment is I don't -- it's not clear to me what definition we're using of medical marijuana. Are we using a federal definition? If so, what is the definition of medical marijuana in the federal law? And if not, is each state determining their own definition of medical marijuana? It seems to me very unclear.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  You're making just general comments. You're not addressing them to...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MOOLENAAR</emphasis>:  Well, if the sponsor of the amendment and I appreciate the work he's done on this would answer that question, it would help me, because I cannot support something where it's referring to medical marijuana if we don't have a consistent definition in federal law what medical marijuana is.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Would you want the sponsor to yield to you?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MOOLENAAR</emphasis>:  Yes, please.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  The federal treatment of marijuana is always consistent. That hasn't changed. What we've allowed to do is the states to exercise their rights and make their judgment as to what they deem to be medical marijuana. As you can see in the case that was just brought up my dear friend, Mr. Cole, that CBD oil which helps children with seizures is considered part of what Oklahoma already determines to be medicinal marijuana.  </p><p>      Yet, further aspects or use of that will be voted on by his people, just like I'm not sure what happened in your state, but in Ohio, the legislature did it and other states have passed it as an amendment or as somehow passed it through state referendums.  </p><p>      `So, each state is defining what and again, it goes back to Mr. Moolenaar, the idea that we to do the research as to what it's good for and what it's bad for. Obviously, we've heard that it's been effective in some states where it's been found to be illegal from ladies and gentlemen who served in the service for PTSD. The full effects of it are yet to be found and that's what we're trying to get accomplished here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion? Former Chairman Mr. Rogers.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROGERS</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, there is a reason why we have a division between authorization and appropriations. And this is one of the best examples that I can think of where we need to let the authorizers with their expertise and their experience and their time to sort through the questions that we have about this matter. This is a complicated matter, obviously. It's also significant. But this would be a very significant change in the law which I think should be done by the authorizers, not us.  </p><p>      Number two, I don't know how a bank would be able to tell whether or not a sack of money that comes in, whether or not that's from medical marijuana or recreational. I don't know how they would be able to decide that. And if they can't, they're subjecting themselves to possible heavy liability and I don't think it's fair for us to foist on to the banks to determine and examine whether or not the sack of cash is legal or not.  </p><p>      So, I would hope we would let the authorizers handle this matter and we would have a lot more confidence in the answers to the questions that people like my friend has just raised. I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion?  </p><p>      I have some comments. I admire the fact that Mr. Joyce is going back to the drawing board. He's drawing on some of the knowledge of some of the people in the room here who are more professionally involved in these issues.  </p><p>      I am extremely uncomfortable about quite honestly moving forward on this. It is complicated and there is a gray area. Obviously, if there's a desire to have a vote, I personally think that this needs far more attention. I'm very uncomfortable about moving ahead on this. Just from listening to the members, I'm concerned about it and I'm sort of inclined quite honestly to ask you to withdraw your amendment and take it on for another day. But I want to be respectful obviously of the work and thought that's gone into this.  </p><p>      I think it's extremely complicated and I somewhat want to associate myself with Mr. Rogers. We are moving right into the -- in the area of authorization, the very type of authorization that many people criticize us on other parts of our bills. So, I'd like -- I'd ask that you consider withdrawing your amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  I've had the opportunity to -- been working on this since -- especially since Ohio has gotten involved into it. The answers to the questions that you raised are legitimate -- legitimate answers that we're going to find out.  </p><p>      I agree if Congress was doing their job. The authorized committees were doing their job. Maybe we do something. But that just hasn't occurred. And so, what we're trying to do is we're not changing the law. We're just asking for those who are trying to do what they find to be the wishes of their constituents since we are a body of representatives allowing that to take place in the -- what we would call the laboratories of our states both for medical marijuana and for democracy. They have chosen this route.  </p><p>      46 states have voted it in. We're just asking for them to have the opportunity if they see fit. Banks and credit unions don't have to do this. But those who want to engage in it will provide the buffer between us and the illegal remedies or the illegal dealers out there because they would have to verify that the funds coming in are coming from medical, medicinal facilities. They at least have the opportunity to engage if they want to and if they don't want to, fine. But that's what I'm asking for. That's why I think we'd like to move this one step forward and I would ask for a recorded vote -- or, no, not a recorded vote, excuse me, a voice vote because I know you want to get going, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Ms. Kaptur?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAPTUR</emphasis>:  Yes. I just wanted to state something, because I'm not a doctor and I'm not a medical professional but obviously Ohio is like the number one state in deaths per capita related to opioid abuse and fentanyl, black tar heroin, all of it. And every...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Will the lady yield for a moment?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAPTUR</emphasis>:  I'll yield to the gentleman in a second. Every law enforcement officer I talk to, I ask about the pathway toward use. And to a person, as they have examined people who have died, there's an entry level experience and it begins with an M and it's not methamphetamine.  </p><p>      And so, I had the head of NIH to come in and see me because I said \"I want you to give me the best information NIH has on what happens to the brain, to the patient, and inter-generationally to their children.\" And I said, \"So, show me for long-term use of marijuana\" and I'm not disagreeing with medical use of marijuana. I voted for that in the past. But, I said, \"I want to know what happens to the brain where it happens. I want to know what happens with black tar heroin. I want to know what happens with cocaine. Every single addictive substance, I want to know what happens.\"  </p><p>      And thy began to show me maps of the brain and some of what they don't know which was shocking to me and they could not answer my questions definitively on long-term use of marijuana and increased amounts of use and then the pathway to something else and to look at what -- and they showed me what it takes to try to get someone off of an addictive substance like that and the numbers we have, we have approximately eight readmissions per patient that is heavily addicted, right, I'm not saying to marijuana, but other drugs that follow on and how difficult it is to try to unwind it in the brain and why. And they showed me MRIs of the brain.  </p><p>      What was shocking to me was after all these years, why can't medical science tell us exactly what happens to the brain and to the children of users? They can't answer that. So, it creates uncertainty in members who are not medical professionals who are trying to do the right thing for their constituents and for their country. But I just wanted to put that set of facts on the table because it made me very uncomfortable.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion on the Joyce amendment, Mr. Ryan?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYAN</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I'd just like to add. I guess we could probably have this discussion in Ohio and leave everybody else out of it at this point. But, I just want to make the point that one of the concerns that I think a lot of us have is that we do have marijuana getting laced with all of these other drugs in them.  </p><p>      And where 30 years ago someone experimenting marijuana could now face -- laced with all of this horrible stuff that we're seeing in Ohio. I believe that the process here of moving towards both medical and overall legalization will provide safer, more controlled substances just like in alcohol. There are limited levels. It's controlled. As the gentleman from Nevada suggested, it's eventually taxed.  </p><p>      So, I just want to support this amendment, my friend from Ohio, and say that this is complicated. But I support him because this is the kind of thing that needs to get done. These things are helping save lives, improving the quality of life, and I just -- I wanted to add my support.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Ryan.  </p><p>      Ms. Herrera Beutler is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HERRERA BEUTLER</emphasis>:  I thank the chairman and the sponsor for working diligently on this. And like I said before, I think there are good people on both sides of this issue. This is not a cut and dry issue and I associate myself with the remarks of the former chairman and the current chairman in which, hey, surprise, surprise, guys, come on.  </p><p>      I really strongly believe that we're making -- it seems like a small thing and it was tailored and it was crafted tightly and I know that the staff and the teams working on this did everything they could. But the reality is, we are stepping into a place that we have no business stepping into. We have not done the hearings. We have not heard the testimony. We do not have the science. We do not have the background. Good or bad, we're appropriators. And in Labor H, we've had some of these conversations and I welcome more. Let's have more. Let's do it. Let's take it on.  </p><p>      But at 7:45 and we got this new amendment 10 minutes ago and we're debating a major change to federal policy here and now. I'm just saying it is, because when you open this door, the way this amendment was originally crafted was including recreational use, and that was not an accident, and I'm not saying that against the gentleman who offered it. I'm saying it against the people in the industry who is behind it.  </p><p>      The reason it was crafted that way is to allow banking -- federal banking for recreational use. And if we don't believe that, then, shoot, we fell off the turnip truck yesterday and I love that the chairman -- or the sponsor re-crafted it because I don't think that was his intent and the lady.  </p><p>      I don't think they're trying to do that. But the reality is, if we open this piece and we don't have all the background behind it, man, the litigation and the gray area that we're stepping into as appropriators, not as authorizers, is too much for this hour -- at this time and hour. And again, I just plead that we hit pause.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  The gentleman from Texas, Judge Carter?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARTER</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I very much admire...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Please give Judge Carter your attention. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARTER</emphasis>:  This is going to be very brief. I very much admire his tenacity, but I want to go on record to say I'm voting no.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion? Let me say -- I ask the sponsor -- I would like you to withdraw your amendment. I'm asking you again to withdraw your amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Well, I appreciate my former chairman and my chairman putting their foot down, I guess, and trying to make sure that I don't have enough votes to carry this forward. I appreciate the fact that you don't want to vote, but just for giggles maybe we might try a voice vote if the chairman would allow that and be satisfied with the results of said voice vote.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I'm asking you to withdraw your amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  I withdraw the amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Any further amendments? If not -- the amendment is withdrawn.  </p><p>      If not, the gentleman from Kentucky is recognized for a motion.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROGERS</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I move to favorably report to the House the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2019.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  The question is on the motion. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.   </p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. The motion is agreed to.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROGERS</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I request a recorded vote.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  A recorded vote -- there's been sufficient hands.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLERK</emphasis>:  Mr. Aderholt?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  The clerk will call the roll.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLERK</emphasis>:  Mr. Aderholt?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ADERHOLT</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLERK</emphasis>:  Mr. Aderholt, yes.  </p><p>      Mr. Aguilar?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AGUILAR</emphasis>:  No.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLERK</emphasis>:  Mr. Aguilar, no.  </p><p>      Mr. Amodei?

If members could take seats and we're going to begin. </p><p>Again, the chair recognizes the gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Palazzo...</p><p>PALAZZO:  Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  ... for the purpose of an amendment. You have an amendment at the desk. Would you consider it read? Yes.</p><p>PALAZZO:  Yes, I ask that it be considered read.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Good. And you're recognized to present your amendment.</p><p>PALAZZO:  All right.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Please give Mr. Palazzo your attention.</p><p>PALAZZO:  Mr. Chairman, this is a simple amendment that would increase funding for community development financial institutions, otherwise known as CDFIs. Unfortunately, the committee mark proposed a $59 million reduction in funding from fiscal year 2018 levels.</p><p>But with the help of the chairman of the subcommittee and his wonderful staff, we've been able to find a path forward. My amendment would take the first step towards returning these essential funds by reallocating $25 million to make up a part of the shortfall.</p><p>For those of you who aren't familiar, CDFI banks take a small amount of public money to leverage private investment in communities that are traditionally underserved with historically high poverty rates.</p><p>For every $1 of public investments in CDFIs over $12 of private investment are used to support for small businesses, create jobs and revitalize the most impoverished communities in America.</p><p>In addition, they help put millions on the road to buying homes and establishing personal financial security. They also provide essential financial literacy education to their customers. I know many of you on this committee represent areas with high poverty rates.</p><p>CDFIs are active in your communities and are essential sources of banking for many of our most underserved. I ask my colleagues to support the amendment and I yield back the balance of my time.</p><p>ROGERS:  Will the gentleman yield before you...</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  The gentleman yield to the chairman, Mr. Rogers.</p><p>ROGERS:  Will the gentleman yield?</p><p>PALAZZO:  Yield to the chairman.</p><p>ROGERS:  I'd like to identify myself with the gentleman's remarks. It's a great amendment. The CDFIs are vitally important in poor areas like mine and perhaps yours. And I would urge that we pass the gentleman's amendment. I yield.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thanks the gentleman.</p><p>Mr. Graves is recognized.</p><p>GRAVES:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to thank, Mr. Palazzo and Chairman Rogers for their positive comments. I rise to accept the amendment. These increases -- as he referenced, the CDFI funds financial and technical assistance grants by $25 million, taking it to a total level of $216 million.</p><p>And let me remind the committee that is $202 million above the president's request. The administration initially requested $14 million. I know this committee's commitment is to rural communities throughout our country. And this will assist in that way. So I want to thank, Mr. Palazzo and his commitment here and I look forward to accepting the amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion? Mr. Palazzo, you have an -- a minute. You don't have to take it to close.</p><p>PALAZZO:  Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. In the interest of time I will keep it brief. Please support my amendment. I yield back.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK. The question is on the Palazzo amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay. </p><p>In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it.</p><p>Ms. Pingree is recognized, gentlewoman from Maine.</p><p>PINGREE:  Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I have an amendment at the desk, Pingree Number 1.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Yes. Let me say that last amendment was adopted. I apologize. And your amendment is considered read and you're recognized. Excuse me.</p><p>PINGREE:  Thank you. First, I want to thank the chair and the subcommittee for recognizing the importance of giving the executive branch authorities to combat corruption and to punish human rights abusers around the world.</p><p>I'm pleased that the Bill adds $2 million to the Treasury Department's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, which handles sanctions investigation and enforcement. I'm also pleased that the report language stresses the need for resources to be directed towards Africa, including to address protracted conflicts in Sudan, South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p><p>It also calls for robust implementation of the Global Magnitsky Act sanctions on corruption in human rights. Currently, there are only five sanctions investigators assigned to the team, responsible for designations and delistings for all Africa sanctions programs as well as Global Magnitsky in Venezuela.</p><p>Too often these staffers are pulled away to deal with emerging issues like Iran. My amendment would add an additional $2.9 million to create nine new positions with the relevant offices at Treasury to accomplish this goal. Recognizing that the bill already includes an increase, I'm willing to withdraw my amendment and happy to work with the chair going forward.</p><p>Will the chair attempt to increase -- support this increase as we move toward conference to ensure that additional resources for Treasury go to the needs identified in the report such as nations in conflict in Central and East Africa and for the global Magnitsky Act?</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  We'll -- Chairman Graves.</p><p>GRAVES:  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Maine for raising this issue. It's an issue I think we're all committed to. Government sanctions, abuses of human rights around the world is on the rise.</p><p>I look forward to working with you in the days ahead and also with Chairman Rogers and his subcommittee as well. But thank you, again, for your interest in this issue and your commitment.</p><p>PINGREE:  Thank you. And thank you for being willing to work on this. Just to make sure it's clear. I have people from the Sudan, South Sudan, Burundi in my state. And often those smaller countries are the ones that never get these enforced and there just aren't enough people to do it.</p><p>So I know you understand that. I just wanted to help make that point clear. And I hope that there is potential for additional funding if we can find a way to work in it together. And I withdraw my amendment and thank you for your consideration.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you. The amendment has been withdrawn.</p><p>Recognize Dr. Harris for the purpose of an amendment.</p><p>HARRIS:  Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. I have an administration at the desk.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Would you consider it read?</p><p>HARRIS:  And yes, I move to dispense with the reading.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  So ordered and the gentleman is recognized.</p><p>HARRIS:  Mr. Chairman, this amendment follows up on what you talked about in your opening statement, that one important program funded by this bill is the OSP, what is the school program, the school choice program in Washington, D.C.</p><p>And it's tremendously successful. Has a waiting list. They could actually move some students into that program from D.C. public school, D.C. charter schools if they had more funding, so what my amendment does is it adds an additional $5 million into their funding, offsetting that by decreasing funding into the public school and charter school part of that program -- of that program spending.</p><p>And that way leaves actually more per pupil expenditures for both the public school and the public charter schools while fulfilling an increase in the ability of students to engage in the OSP.</p><p>So I offer the amendment and I will -- I've spoken to the chairman of the subcommittee. He's agreed to work on getting that funding increased, so I will intend to withdraw the amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, doctor.</p><p>Mr. Graves.</p><p>GRAVES:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate Dr. Harris's commitment to children and providing the best education. You're absolutely right, I agree with you on the impact this has had in the past and look forward to working with you in the days ahead to make sure we're impacting lives in a positive way as children are being educated in this area. Thank you.</p><p>HARRIS:  So I withdraw the amendment, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK. Thank you both.</p><p>Mr. Joyce, amendment number 2. You have two amendments.</p><p>JOYCE:  Yes, I do. And I appreciate this opportunity to speak, Mr. Chairman. I have that amendment at the desk. And I ask...</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Would you consider it read?</p><p>JOYCE:  ... consider as read. Yes.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  And you are recognized on your second amendment.</p><p>JOYCE:  I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. My amendment would reverse the 2015 decision by the United States Postal Service to its lower delivery service standards for first class mail and periodicals.</p><p>Since these standards are lower, timely processing and delivery of the mail has been significantly degraded across the country. Mail delays are dragging down our business and I'm sure I'm not alone in saying that my constituents have noticed the effects of late mail.</p><p>I hear it all the time. Medications aren't arriving in a timely fashion. (inaudible) pay your bill on time, if the bills arrive late, so in turn they receive a late fee payment. Invitations get lost, especially to my house.</p><p>And weekly newspapers arrive a week late. And importantly, absentee balances are arriving late and at this point it's unlikely the United States Postal Service can guarantee a timely delivery for elections this spring and next November.</p><p>So, although, the Postal Service reduction of standards was intended to save money, the consolidation plan actually cost money for fiscal year 2015. The Postal Service spent $130 million on increased transportation costs as a result of the closures and lost a total of $66 million due to the consolidation plan.</p><p>I therefore urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment to restore the postal standards to those that were in effect in July 1st, 2012, so all of our constituents may receive the service they depend on.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Joyce.</p><p>Mr. Graves?</p><p>GRAVES:  Mr. Chairman, unfortunately, I have to raise an opposition to the amendment, but not to my good friend, Mr. Joyce personally. But the amendment -- and he and I have had a discussion about this. His intentions are well, but clearly this has a direct impact on the Postal Service. I think it's a $1.5 billion negative impact on the Postal Service. I truly respect and understand the gentleman's concern about the service standards.</p><p>JOYCE:  Thank you.</p><p>GRAVES:  And look forward to working with you in the days ahead, hopefully along with OGR, the committee of jurisdiction. But because of the high cost of this one amendment, it's a tremendous cost I would have to oppose, the amendment only but not the gentleman.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Ms. Kaptur, I understand is recognized to talk on this amendment.</p><p>KAPTUR:  I would like to rise in support of the gentleman's amendment and implore the chair and the ranking member to try to really look at this. I don't think that the -- whoever did this for the Postal Service was really thinking.</p><p>And their decision to eliminate overnight service for first-class mail and even the manner in which our mail arrives now, this has never happened before but an envelope will be in an envelope. Something was ripped because it was sent up to Pontiac, Michigan out of Ohio, let's say.</p><p>And really there have been a lot of delays. What Congressman Joyce talks about medicine that is true. And there is something really wrong with the way this routing is going and degrading our mail standards has impacted the timely delivery of everything from medicines to greeting cards, bill payments to business mail, personal letters to government correspondence, not to mention local election mail.</p><p>The timely processing delivery of mail is really critical. And the Postal Service delivers 154 billion pieces of mail annually to 155 million delivery points, accounting for 47 percent of the world's mail.</p><p>It's an enormous undertaking that equals over 2000 percent more in terms of business than either the UPS or FedEx. The Postal Service serves everyone and they have admitted that their decision to reduce delivery standards has cost the agency $66 million in losses due to added transportation cost, in 2015, $130 million alone.</p><p>So this isn't even a very wise business decision. So, I would really implore the chair to keep working with us. I think we should exercise our authority. They've had trouble appointing people to the board of the Postal Service, whoever heard of that.</p><p>And the future of our public Postal Service is threatened by delayed mail and it harms small business. It harms people in rural America. And we really have to exercise our authority here. So, I urge my colleagues to support our Postal Service, Mr. Joyce's amendment.</p><p>And I would really urge the chairman somehow to work with us as we move toward the floor, if he can't accept this now and would urge my colleagues to vote for the Joyce amendment. And I yield back.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Mr. Quigley on the Joyce amendment.</p><p>QUIGLEY:  Sure. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan amendment to restore mail delivery service standards to 2012 levels. Every year millions of Americans rely on the USPS to provide affordable, efficient mail delivery service. And in many communities USPS is the only affordable option to send and receive mail. Over the last year, I've received countless Postal Service complaints on slow and inconsistent mail service in my district.</p><p>This includes delayed mail, sometimes taking weeks to arrive due to bad weather or unscheduled employee absences, wrongly delivered mail, and severely damaged mail. Americans have come to expect timey and dependable mail service. And we need to make sure that the Post Office is maintaining its high standards, therefore I support this amendment and urge my colleagues to vote in favor.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion on the Joyce amendment? If (ph) -- hearing none, Mr. Joyce has a minute to close.</p><p>JOYCE:  Why, thank you, Mr. Chairman. U.S. mail system is an important part of our nation's infrastructure, connecting people of all communities with the institutions that serve them. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. And I thank you, again, Mr. Chairman. And yield back the balance of my time.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK. The question is on the Joyce amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.</p><p>Got you. You find this humorous. I think the ayes got it. The amendment is approved. At least you got one approved today.</p><p>JOYCE:  I know it's much to your chagrin, sir.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Mr. Price?</p><p>Mr. Price is recognized for the purpose of an amendment.</p><p>Mr. Price has an amendment at the desk.</p><p>PRICE:  I have an amendment at the desk. I ask that its reading be dispensed with.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Considered it done. The gentleman is recognized.</p><p>PRICE:  Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment offered in partnership with Mr. Serrano that would restore net neutrality protections that entrepreneurs, small businesses, and the public rely on over the use of internet.</p><p>I am sure all of us here know that net neutrality is a term used to describe the principle that all content travelling over the internet should be treated equally by the owners of the networks providing internet service to customers.</p><p>Since its inception, the internet has allowed anyone with an internet connection to access or to provide information, goods or services on a relatively equal footing. This open design has been largely responsible for the revolutionary impact that the internet has had on global commerce, innovation and information sharing in so many other aspects of our daily lives.</p><p>Yet, in recent years, some companies have openly defied these bedrock open internet principles. There are well-documented examples of internet service providers deliberately throttling broadband speed when consumers try to connect to certain applications, blocking content from competitors and providing preferential treatment to their own content.</p><p>So in 2015, after several years of legal battles and careful deliberation, the FCC issued its revised open internet order. These rules enshrined in federal regulation the basic principle of net neutrality, that the companies that provide internet service to consumers to offer that service in an open and nondiscriminatory manner.</p><p>This principle is supported by the major tech companies, entrepreneurs, small businesses, research universities, librarians, local governments, a large majority of Americans, nearly everybody, in fact except the companies that provide these commercial internet services.</p><p>And yet, despite receiving millions of consumer comments supporting net neutrality, the FCC suddenly voted last year to overturn net neutrality, eroding the principles of openness, innovation and fairness that are the cornerstone of the internet.</p><p>Citizens are paying attention to this issue. I expect all of us can attest to that. I received 14,000 letters and e-mails on this subject in this Congress alone. On Monday, these FCC net neutrality protections officially lapsed. The Senate has already voted to overturn the FCC's net neutrality repeal. And this amendment presents us with the opportunity to do the same. So let's put our constituents, small businesses and entrepreneurs first by restoring net neutrality. I urge support for this amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Price.</p><p>Mr. Graves?</p><p>GRAVES:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would have to rise in opposition to the amendment. I think we can all agree on the desire for a free and open internet. And we all do, in fact, it is. I just heard that the gentleman received 14,000 e-mails in opposition to the rule. Apparently, the internet is open and it's free. And people are expressing their opinions. That's what we want and that's what we desire.</p><p>But this amendment will just restore things back to the old rule and prohibit FCC from issuing any other rules. In fact, it's circumventing the whole process of public comments and the openness and transparency that we all desire.</p><p>The Senate has taken up this issue. I suspect the House may take it up as well. This is not the right committee or jurisdiction in which to do that. The Internet has been the biggest driving force for innovation in our lifetimes.</p><p>This is no time to mess with it in a hearing such as this. It's doing well. Just check your e-mails. You're getting them. So, Mr. Chairman, with that, I'd have to rise in opposition to the amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Ms. Lowey?</p><p>LOWEY:  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of my friend's amendment. This week despite overwhelming public support, the FCC's repeal of net neutrality protection officially went into effect.</p><p>It's an unfortunate step as we know net neutrality protects small businesses, entrepreneurs, students and consumers by ensuring a level playing field online. Paid prioritization means the end of a free and open internet.</p><p>Today, we have an opportunity to protect net neutrality, ensure that our constituents choose what websites and apps they can access online. We owe it to our constituents to do everything in our power to fight for their open access.</p><p>Please, vote for the amendment. I yield back.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentlewoman.</p><p>Mr. Serrano, a cosponsor of the amendment, is recognized.</p><p>SERRANO:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>I want to thank my good friend from North Carolina, Mr. Price, for working on this issue for so many years. On the net neutrality, we do not see a stifling of creativity in innovation like we were told by the opposition.</p><p>In fact, it did the opposite, ushering in a spirit and wave of innovation because more people were able to access an internet that treated all content and data the same. This amendment would simply reinstate the 2015 net neutrality rules that have kept the internet open and fair for all Americans.</p><p>It would prevent our constituents from having to pay more to access their favorite websites and streaming services. It will prevent students from having educational content blocked by their ISPs, therefore jeopardizing their learning experience.</p><p>And it would prevent small businesses from having their websites throttled and face delays in trying to showcase their products for consumers. While major service providers like Comcast and AT&amp;T have recently announced that they have no plans to prioritize certain web traffic or create paid fast lanes, what is to stop them from changing their minds in the future and raising prices on consumers? Let us not forget that the first priority of any cooperation is to make money. But it should be the responsibility of Congress and the federal government to protect all Americans' ability to access a resource that has become so engrained in our culture and economy.</p><p>That is why the principles enshrined in the 2015 net neutrality rules are so important and why tens of millions of Americans strongly support these principles. This is a matter of fairness and equality.</p><p>I ask my colleagues to put the interests of families, students, rural and urban Americans and small businesses ahead of corporate interest. I urge a yes vote on the Price Serrano amendment. Thank you.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentleman for his comments.</p><p>I see Mr. Kilmer and then Mr. Cartwright, Mr. -- OK.</p><p>Mr. Taylor, I guess you...</p><p>TAYLOR:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just a couple of things. Number one:  obviously, net neutrality in the way it's been framed is inaccurate and deceiving in many ways. And it's kind of embarrassing in some respects as well.</p><p>When you look at -- talk about corporate interests and one of the issues here is blocking and throttling, the only folks doing blocking and throttling now are the big tech companies and, of course, they support net neutrality, which would put the ISPs who are not just your Verizons and Cox and stuff like that but 3,000 of them across the nation that provide low cost internet to rural areas, like some in my own district.</p><p>And they, of course, would support pushing them to be regulated under a 1930s scheme. So think about that for a second. Companies that are in the internet being regulated under a 1930 scheme, does that really make any sense? I don't think so.</p><p>So, of course, the tech companies would support that because they don't want them to get into the data business, which is highly profitable. Look, I think everyone here there's an equality of desire not to have -- to have a level playing field, to not have blocking, to not have throttling. But also to regulate the internet under the same ecosphere, so -- ecosystem, excuse me, so under the FCC, everyone being regulated under the same rules.</p><p>And having that opt -- the opt-in -- and our people would have the ability to opt in, and then perhaps look at potential soft regulations on data, on who owns your data. So this is a larger discussion that has to happen, but not here in this committee. So I would oppose it. Thank you.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Kilmer is recognized and then Mr. Cartwright.</p><p>KILMER:  Thanks. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I support this amendment; I support a free and open internet. But we had a debate on the -- on the last bill about the inability of Congress to step in in an area where it ought to use some of its authority. That was with regard to authorization for use of military force.</p><p>But I think this is another example where Congress has sort of dropped the ball. You know, this is larger than just one issue. Congress should look at holistically reforming our telecom laws because the last major piece of telecom policy that passed out of Congress was in 1996.</p><p>You know, 1996, less than a quarter of Americans were online. The ones that were used Netscape and a dial-up modem. When they got their e-mail, it said, \"You've Got Mail.\" You know, that was seven years before, MySpace, a PalmPilot was thought to be cutting-edge technology at that time.</p><p>Someone who used the term smart phone at that time was describing something that weighed more than a pound and was the size of a brick. You know, but because Congress hasn't acted on this, agencies have tried to pick up the slack and that's not the way to go. Rather than seeing this issue decided by agency action, I'd like to see Congress step up and set some rules of the road and pass legislation that comprehensively reforms our telecom and technology policy. To me, it's a competitiveness issue. I think you've heard folks on both sides of the aisle with different perspectives on this, but make the same point that this is important to our businesses, this is about jobs...</p><p>TAYLOR:  Will the gentleman yield?</p><p>KILMER:  Yes. Sure.</p><p>TAYLOR:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate the sentiment and I agree with the gentleman that we should -- that Congress should take this up and look at it holistically. But the gentleman mentioned the antiquated action that was taken -- you know, 1996 I guess prior to MySpace. But does the gentleman believe that we should look at regulating a -- you know, the ISPs under a 1930 scheme?</p><p>KILMER:  So just reclaiming my time. In my view, the issue needs to be decided by Congress rather than just yielding to the executive. I think it's time for Congress to catch up with the rest of the country, bring our laws up to speed with our technology. And I support the amendment but I also support the Congress stepping in and doing something about it.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK. Further discussion? Mr. Culberson's recognized.</p><p>CULBERSON:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, support net neutrality. I want to prevent the internet service providers from throttling access to services for any customer, but I have a real concern this amendment as chairman Graves said, particularly the way it's drafted, that the amendment would prevent the Federal Communications Commission from reissuing a rule in substantially the same form. I'm not sure what substantially means. What -- how is that defined?</p><p>So I'm afraid that the -- while we are in agreement I believe with the spirit of what Mr. Price is doing, the amendment itself is not effective, unenforceable, undefinable, and I'm not sure how you'd ever make any sense out of what this amendment proposes to do. So I hope we'll find another opportunity to restore that neutrality but not do it here and do it in a more thoughtful, careful fashion.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentleman from Texas for his remarks. Mr. Cartwright from Pennsylvania is recognized.</p><p>CARTWRIGHT:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I speak in support of this amendment and I do thank Representatives Price and Serrano for their hard work on this matter. I also wish to associate myself with remarks of Mr. Kilmer. I think the free exchange of information and ideas is an essential principle in this country.</p><p>Every single one of our constituents wants net neutrality because they want to be assured they have access, choice, and freedom to get the internet content that they want. As such, I think the American people and the companies affected by this issue deserve some certainty on the matter.</p><p>That's why I hope, as Congressman Kilmer said, that, as a Congress, we can soon work in a bipartisan fashion to address this issue legislatively to let our voters know we are listening to their concerns and we are actively engaged on this issue. I urge support of the amendment. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion on the amendment? Mr. Pocan and then Ms. Lee.</p><p>POCAN:  Sure. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I think the argument by the subcommittee chairman on this was that so many contacts -- 14,000 contacts proves it works. Well, the rule change just took effect this week so it did work, you're right.</p><p>The previous system worked very well. In fact, I had 12,983 contacts as of a month ago that were against the ruling and zero, zero for it. Now, to be fair, I did have a telecommunications lobbyist from my district stop by the other day, and he asked to be counted, so I am now up to 12,983 to 1.</p><p>But I think this is very similar in many of our districts. My small business owners don't want us to throttle the internet, my farmers don't want to have fast lanes, and the consumers don't want to. So this is something that the Senate took care of. Now it's in the hands of the House.</p><p>We could do a discharge petition, which I hope many of you will sign on to, but I think this is one where people are way, way, way ahead of us on this, and I strongly support this amendment. I thank the gentleman who introduced this and I hope we'll pass it.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank the gentleman for his comments. Further discussion? Ms. Lee is recognized for some comments on the amendment, the Price amendment.</p><p>LEE:  Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me just associate myself with all the remarks that have been made and say a couple things about our democracy, really, in terms of the blow it's taken as it relates to the FCC rules mandating net neutrality.</p><p>This really is equal treatment of all content on the internet, and it was overturned by this new rule imposed by the chairman. Mr. Price's amendment is extremely important because it nullifies this new rule. Internet providers will be able to provide websites from loading or slow them down simply because they disagree with what the website says.</p><p>TAYLOR:  Will the gentlelady?</p><p>LEE:  Yes, I'll yield.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Gentleman's -- gentlelady's yielded.</p><p>LEE:  Yes.</p><p>TAYLOR:  (inaudible). Will the gentlelady agree -- I think everybody agrees about the blocking and throttling and not stopping websites just because you don't agree with the content from up. Will the gentlelady -- that a lot of that -- some of the content you're speaking of is also from not ISPs, but on social media platforms. Will the gentlelady agree that those should also be regulated in the same ways so as to have that information come out and not be blocked or throttled, which does not -- does not address this amendment?</p><p>LEE:  Let me reclaim my time please. This is really about freedom of speech and freedom of expression. OK? From entrepreneurs to advocates for social justice, the internet has been a powerful tool for everyone, especially communities of color, to revitalize our neighborhoods and draw attention really to the injustices in our society in order to change them.</p><p>And so this new repeal of the open internet rule -- it really kills this free expression and innovation and it kills it online. And it shouldn't be a partisan issue. It's opposed by 86 percent of the public, Democrats and Republicans understand what's at stake. So I urge a yes vote on this amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Ms. Lee. Mr. Ruppersberger has been very patient.</p><p>RUPPERSBERGER:  Thank you. First, I support this amendment but the one thing that's become very clear to me is this whole process in what we're dealing with now needs to be dealt with with our Congress. The American people clearly feel passionately about this issue and we need to come up with a bipartisan legislative solution, so there is no ambiguity on the regulatory side, and future administrations continue to ping pong back and forth. Democrat and Republican, this issue is not good for American consumers or American businesses. Yield back.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank the gentleman for his comments. A minute to close, Mr. Price is recognized.</p><p>PRICE:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's interesting to see members raise the bugaboo of regulation and as though there was any option here. We're talking about one FCC regulation versus another. OK? So make your choice.</p><p>It's the FCC regulation enacted after great care -- with great care in 2015 that, in fact, protected that level playing field that we all want to see. And I agree with the chairman, it's no time to mess with the internet.</p><p>The messing with the internet with this new regulation that overturns that carefully arrived at rule. Many members in this room have embraced the Congressional Review Act in dealing with regulations that they find objectionable over this last year. This takes the form of exactly that.</p><p>This is a -- this is a Congressional Review Act type amendment. It reflects what was done on a bipartisan basis in the Senate. It is something where the House needs to step up to the plate. And, for that reason, I urge the support of this amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Price. The question is on the Price amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.</p><p>In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not agreed.

The amendment is not adopted.</p><p>Mr. Joyce, amendment number 1, you're recognized to present your amendment.</p><p>JOYCE:  Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have an amendment at the desk and ask that it be considered as read.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  It's considered read and the gentleman's recognized.</p><p>JOYCE:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My amendment -- my amendment simply put prohibits penalization of financial institutions solely because the institution provides financial services to an entity that involves a properly-registered state-compliant marijuana-related company.</p><p>To be clear, the business or entity must be operating within the laws of the state to avoid penalization. This is not about whether or not one approves of marijuana. This is about public safety and financial transparency.</p><p>While 46 states, 3 territories and the district now allow cannabis-related businesses to operate, our banks and credit unions cannot provide financial services to them. Strangely enough, ATMs are allowed inside dispensaries so one may withdraw funds from their bank to make a purchase in cash.</p><p>The situation is untenable. No industry can operate safely and transparently without access to banks or other financial institutions. To ensure these legitimate going concerns are safe, legitimate, and operating completely within the laws of the licensing state, we must allow them access to the financial system. I urge support of my amendment in the interests of financial transparency and public safety and reserve the balance of my time.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentleman. Chairman Graves.</p><p>GRAVES:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think I'll just leave it at this. I look forward to watching the committee hash this out for a little while.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Mr. Quigley.</p><p>QUIGLEY:  I was tempted to say the opponents of this are dazed and confused, but I'll hold back. I do rise in support of the Joyce amendment. It is ridiculous that at a time when the majority of states allow some form of recreational or medical use that these businesses are forced to operate as all-cash operations, having no choice but to pay their taxes, employees' salaries, and rent with bags of cash.</p><p>When I think of an all-cash operation, I think of the mob or a cartel, not a legal, regulated business. We are effectively telling these businesses that they should operate like the black market, encouraging obscurity rather than transparency.</p><p>Additionally, by denying legal businesses access to banking services such as credit card processing and deposit revenues, a public safety risk is created. Recent headlines demonstrate this risk, reporting of robberies, home invasions, and other threats associated with possessing large sums of cash.</p><p>Regardless how each of us may view the legalization of marijuana, I think we all agree that financial institutions should be allowed to serve businesses that are operating legitimately. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, which respects states' rights and prioritizes public safety.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion on the Joyce amendment? I'm seeing a number of hands. Mr. Stewart is recognized.</p><p>STEWART:  Mr. Chairman, I do look forward to this, as the subcommittee chairman said a robust debate on this, but I'll be very brief. First, I'd like to point out there's some confusion and it's brought into this debate, there is a meaningful difference between medicinal marijuana and recreational use of marijuana.</p><p>That's not apples and oranges. That's apples and dinosaurs. These are very, very different issues. And don't conflate the two by saying, \"Well, some of these are used by those who are supporting the medicinal use.\"</p><p>I'm talking about the recreational use, which is, by the way, the vast majority of the use and the revenue generated by this. So ask yourself these very simple questions. Do you think it's a good idea generally to promote the use of -- recreational use of marijuana in our society? If you think that's a good thing, then support this. </p><p>Do you think it's good for our society generally to have more and more marijuana use, or less? If you think the answer is, \"More is better,\" then go ahead and support this amendment. If you think it's -- you want to legitimize the use of marijuana to our kids -- if you think that's a good idea, then support this amendment.</p><p>If you think it's a good idea to signal to the business community that having a marijuana dispensary is on par with having a car dealership or selling tires or any other business, then go ahead and support this amendment.</p><p>I, on the other, think we should discourage that type of use and one of the ways we discourage that is making it harder for these businesses to carry out their business. And if they're using all cash, then I say, \"You know what? They knew that going into this. Let them deal with it. Let's not help them and make it easier for them.\" And I yield back.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion? Ms. Lee is recognized.</p><p>LEE:  Thank you very much. I rise in support of Mr. Joyce's amendment. This is a bipartisan proposal. It would prohibit federal agencies from unduly penalizing financial institutions for providing basic banking services to legitimate cannabis businesses in states where it's legal.</p><p>This amendment would ensure that legitimate business owners can comply with state regulations and help ensure that regulator and law enforcement officers can hold businesses accountable. And for the 46 states and jurisdictions that have passed cannabis reform laws, this amendment would provide important financial certainty to business owners, employees, government agencies, and financial institutions.</p><p>Now, regardless of how you feel about the legalization or decriminalization of cannabis, I think we all can agree that the state has made their own decisions to take action and to pass a range for various laws pertaining to medical or adult use cannabis.</p><p>It's become increasingly apparent that there is a need to align federal and state laws when it comes to addressing the banking crisis, which it is. Last year, the legal cannabis industry was worth around $10 billion but is largely forced to operate exclusively in cash.</p><p>These outdated and predatory policies are a major obstacle to these small businesses and only serve to undermine their financial security. Enforcing small businesses to operate as all-cash businesses, these policies make the jobs of state regulators and tax collectors unnecessarily difficult.</p><p>And it leaves these entrepreneurs, their employees, and the business itself vulnerable to dangerous criminal targeting. It's a matter of public safety and economic necessity. In fact, in California, a state treasurer has called for action to on the cannabis banking industry saying we all have an obligation to take reasonable and necessary steps to protect our citizens and ensure businesses operating legally within California are engaged fully in our banking and commerce -- excuse me, system.</p><p>And I've visited small businesses like these in my home district in Oakland, California and I know how that impacts these acts -- excuse me, I know how it impacts the lack of access to financial services.</p><p>Using these services will allow entrepreneurs and small businesses to ensure their financial security, grow their business, and better serve their communities. So I urge my colleagues to listen to legal and job creating businesses in your own districts where these laws have been passed and support this amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Ms. Lee. Dr. Harris is recognized.</p><p>HARRIS:  Thank you very much. You know, I'm going to speak in opposition to this amendment. You know, the last amendment we had dealt with medical marijuana. This is the incrementalism we're seeing. You know, when we -- when we restrained the Department of Justice a few weeks ago from enforcing federal law, it was medical marijuana.</p><p>This amendment is not about medical marijuana. It's about big marijuana businesses. You know, there's a reason why there are big dollars involved and lots of cash, because drug dealing makes a lot of money and it involves a lot of cash.</p><p>And no matter what we want -- no matter what other name we can call it, marijuana is a controlled substance, it's schedule one, it's drug dealing under federal law. And the gentleman from Utah is absolutely right, what we're doing, we pass this amendment so we're condoning drug dealing for recreational use.</p><p>And there may be small businesses involved, some of them maybe, but as soon as you the remove the financial obstacles, this is going to be big, big business. There are going to be big growers involved, big distributors involved. Pharma, move over, because now you've got a whole other industry dealing with drugs.</p><p>But this is just not my opinion. The other thing, by the way, is, you know, where do we stop with schedule one substances allowing banks to do it. What if, you know, some states -- I understand Oregon is considering legalizing heroin. So we're going to remove -- we're going to allow the banks to participate in that as well?</p><p>It's a slippery slope we don't want to go to. We really should have the argument about legalization first. But you don't have to take my opinion. I've got two letters here -- and I'll read briefly from them and then I'll ask they be entered into the record -- from the National Fraternal Order of Police -- represents 355,000 police officers in the United States. </p><p>Asking this committee -- and, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, you know because you got this letter today, asking this committee to please not pass this legislation. They say, quote, \"Public safety is threatened by the growing use of marijuana nationwide, with the greatest negative impact in states that no longer comport with existing federal law.\"</p><p>It's exactly what this -- who this amendment addresses. So this is from the National Fraternal Order of Police, but, if you don't believe National Fraternal Order (ph) of Police, the Major Cities Chiefs Association (sic) -- these are the police chiefs of major cities -- they say the facts are undeniable. The legalization of marijuana has only hindered local law enforcement's efforts to keep communities safe. </p><p>These are the people that our -- that men and women and families in this country trust to keep our community safe. Mr. Chairman, they plead with this committee not to pass this -- not to pass this amendment. Look, at some point, we might get to the point where this -- where this is in order. I think it's way premature. I will oppose the amendment. Thank you. I yield back.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Harris. And Ms. Pingree from Maine is recognized.</p><p>PINGREE:  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to speak in support of this bipartisan amendment. I disagree with my colleagues. I don't think this is how you -- this is not related to how you feel about legalizing marijuana.</p><p>In my state in 2016 with referendum, our voters voted to legalize marijuana. We already had medical marijuana. Then last month our legislature passed and even overrode a governor's veto statutory and regulatory framework.</p><p>So soon in our state, we're going to have businesses official operating selling marijuana as a business just as you would sell any legal product, because it is legal in our state. But these entrepreneurs are going to end up with one hand tied behind their back, unsure where they can get access to capital to start or expand their business and use the banking system.</p><p>I just had a visit from the Maine credit unions and they told me they are eager to help but they're worried about the risks of lending if federal regulators interfere based on federal law. The Joyce amendment would eliminate this risk, provide protection both for lenders and the businesses who need capital to serve their customers.</p><p>I agree with many of my colleagues who mentioned that this will help law enforcement. Without being able to use the banking system, you have businesses who are storing enormous amounts of cash from marijuana transactions and this is already happening with medical marijuana. It's unsafe. It's a recipe for abuse. </p><p>Access to regulated financial services will provide some peace of mind to businesses customers and the public. I just want to say further, I think one of the reasons that many of us are making basically exactly the same argument is because it is ludicrous to have a legal business that cannot use the banking system.</p><p>It promotes crime, it makes it difficult for these businesses and I wholeheartedly support this amendment for the benefit of my states and other states where this is legalized and hope my colleagues will do the same and I yield.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentleman -- gentlewoman for her remarks. Mr. Rogers, former Chairman Rogers, is recognized.</p><p>ROGERS:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Might I ask, Mr. Joyce, what is the significance of the states that are mentioned in your amendment?</p><p>JOYCE:  I'm sorry, sir.</p><p>ROGERS:  What is the significance of mentioning the states that you have in your amendment?</p><p>JOYCE:  Because each one of the states...</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Could you just repeat his question? Because I'm not sure everybody heard it. The significance of the states...</p><p>JOYCE:  The fine chairman asked what's the significance of the states that are listed in the amendment, and that is because only the states that have this -- some form of either medicinal or medicinal and recreational use -- are the ones that are listed there.</p><p>There are other states that have made this choice not to be involved and so therefore, you're trying to -- you're not bringing them into the system because they're not part of it. Only those states in which the state either legislature or the vote of the people has enacted the laws to allow a cannabis industry into their state.</p><p>ROGERS:  Well, for states that do not want to legalize recreational marijuana, the involvement of the financial community, the banks, is one of the last remaining things that a state has to keep from legalizing marijuana in their state if that's what they want to do, because the bank by handling the cash from an illegal act in many states is an aider and an abettor. And can be and could be charged and convicted of conspiracy to violate the state law or the federal law. Always bear in mind, the federal law even today does not legalize recreational marijuana.</p><p>States, many states, some states have done the same. If they're not able to use the financial institution feature they were talking about, the states lose the last -- one of the last possible ways to keep from being legalized over their objection. And I don't think we should be telling a state what they should do about this matter.</p><p>The -- I'll close with this. All of the polls and all of the information and research that we've seen says that marijuana is the stepping stone particularly for young people toward opioid abuse, which boils my blood. I yield.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  The gentlewoman from Kentucky, Ms. McCollum is recognized. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>MCCOLLUM:  Thank you. I support the Joyce amendment which prevents funds from being used to penalize financial institutions that provide banking services to state legal marijuana businesses.</p><p>Now, you have the 46 states that have reformed their marijuana laws to allow for some form of medical or adult use. My home state of Minnesota for the gentleman from Utah recently legalized some forms of medical marijuana for use under certain circumstance, under a doctor's use.</p><p>And I'm going to read from the Minnesota Department of Health. For patients to receive medical cannabis, the law requires a licensed health care provider to certify that the patient has one or more of the qualifying conditions. A qualifying condition that your health care practitioner must certify that you have one of the qualifying conditions -- conditions.</p><p>And it's all spelled out here. The most compelling people to testify in Minnesota, we have very strict controls on how the medical marijuana is used, were parents of children with epilepsy. And what a game-changer it was for these children. And their parents were going to give up their jobs and sell their houses and go to states where they could have access to this transformational change for these young adults.</p><p>And there's other medical conditions in Minnesota in which it is prescribed and used too. So denying a state-sanctioned business that's operating entirely within the laws of their state and to keep them from banking is just irresponsible and it's a threat to public safety.</p><p>Why would we want a doctor who is legally prescribing under certain circumstances which is heavily regulated in Minnesota to be forced into a cash-only environment? We should be encouraging law-abiding citizens running small businesses to work with inner banking systems, not putting them at risk, not putting communities, not putting families that they serve in danger. This amendment for Minnesota and for many of us is not about legalizing marijuana. It is about safe banking. With that, I yield back.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks. </p><p>So Sheriff Rutherford is recognized and then, Mr. Amodei and any others, please do indicate. Yes, Mr. Ryan. Sheriff, you're recognized.</p><p>RUTHERFORD:  Mr. Chairman, thank you. I rise to speak in opposition to this bill even though I think it's well-known that I support investigating and research for determining the efficacy of marijuana for medical purposes.</p><p>In fact, I was very involved in the state legislature in Florida a few years back when we actually had Charlotte's Web, which is a marijuana extract that was actually passed by a very conservative quite frankly Republican House and Senate in the state legislature. So I'm very much in favor of looking at marijuana from its medical use.</p><p>However, I also understand that from my time as sheriff that national -- transnational organizations, these cartels face two problems. Number one is bringing drugs into the country across our border. And the second is moving large amounts of cash back across the border.</p><p>And that is an opportunity as well to intervene in the drug trade affecting our country. And so one of the things those in the Justice Department have begun to see is a lot more attempts by drug cartels to actually move their money through wire transfers and banking operations, which is why DEA and others have begun to really focus on that as an element. And I'm really concerned about marrying together through these banking processes illicit and legal marijuana funds. So, for that reason, Mr. Chairman, I oppose the bill.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  I think the gentleman for his remarks. Mr. Ryan is recognized.</p><p>RYAN:  (inaudible) banks, credit unions looking to Congress for reassurance that if the state can do business (inaudible).</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Ryan. Mr. Amodei is recognized.</p><p>AMODEI:  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  And then I see Mr. Aderholt and...</p><p>AMODEI:  Briefly and I want to thank my colleague from Ohio who's taken the first step but by coming from a state which regulates a few vices -- the record should reflect that nobody laughed when that last statement was -- there are some things that we should talk about here. It's like, OK, you want them to bank, great. That's fine with me. I get the public safety stuff, I get all that stuff.</p><p>But guess what, there's that regulatory piece and that law enforcement piece which if you're a regulated vice, guess what, those regulators and those law enforcement people get to come in and see your accounts any time they want.</p><p>They don't need to play hopscotch, they don't need a warrant. They want to make sure that you're doing business as that legally state licensed deal and that you haven't got folks from other countries in the hemisphere doing things. That's missing. That's very important.</p><p>And let me just tell you one other thing and I know it's not within this committee's jurisdiction, but if you're going to let these folks access that banking system, which is regulated state and federally, I can assure you that whether it's the Buckeye State or the whodunit state on the list, they're getting tax revenue from it.</p><p>And so to just give it away for no tax revenue, if we've learned anything in terms of alcohol and other vices, tobacco as an instance, then guess what, alcohol is taxed federally and tobacco is taxed federally.</p><p>Why would this be exempt? And this bill, this amendment, which I want to support but I ain't giving it away for nothing. So with all due respect, if we really want to do it and I want to do it, we ought to get some tax revenue out of it, learn those lessons with tobacco and alcohol. And, by the way, we ought to be able to check on the records any time we want so all this sanctity and virginity in the state stuff is confirmed by the feds. Thank you. Good evening. And God bless vices.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Oh, boy. Mr. Aderholt I believe wishes to be recognized.</p><p>ADERHOLT:  Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  In the wake of Mr. Amodei's remarks.</p><p>ADERHOLT:  yes, I just -- well, I'll be brief. I just wanted to say certainly we don't oppose the person bringing the amendment but we do have -- there are some concerns that I think many of us have about the amendment itself.</p><p>I just received a note from the sheriffs from Alabama and they had indicated to me they're very much concerned about the amendment. And so I would say that the timing on this is definitely not right and we need to hold off on this amendment, in all due respect to its sponsor. Thank you.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK. Anything -- yes, Ms. Kaptur is recognized.</p><p>KAPTUR:  Yes, I just wanted to say -- put a couple facts out there. Former Speaker of the House John Boehner, according to press reports. who was from the state of Ohio as some people might be -- remember -- he's changed and now serves on the board of a company called Acreage Holdings -- a company that cultivates, processes, and dispenses cannabis, OK? </p><p>So it's just interesting some of the things that happen around here. I don't know what that means. That's what I read in the newspaper. I haven't had a chance to ask him about that.</p><p>The other thing I just want to mention -- and I know Congressman Joyce is very careful is his wording, but, you know, in my district, they're cutting marijuana with black tar heroin and fentanyl now. People are dying of it. And I don't know how you separate this.</p><p>I don't know how you -- I voted for medical marijuana, thinking it would be tightly regulated, and I'm not sure what we have right now in our country. All I know is, in Ohio, we have such an epidemic. I just left another sheriff in one of our counties and he needed money for more officers and all of the deputy chiefs, everybody that's worked in -- I'll tell you the county, Lorain County, Ohio, they were asking me for help from the federal government to hire more officers just to deal with the -- what is occurring in that one location, and that's only one of 88 counties in deep trouble because of addiction and deaths related to these substances.</p><p>So I just -- I'm uncomfortable -- I want to support my colleague from Ohio and he's probably very well-intentioned. I just think that some of this has implications beyond what maybe some of us even completely understand and with some states having some laws and other states not having those laws, pretty soon we're going to get an amendment up here to have state reciprocity just like we do with guns. If you can, you know, conceal and carry in Indiana, then can you walk it into Ohio or vice versa, well, what's the difference with this?</p><p>So I'm just -- I am -- we have an epidemic in this country and I want to trace the money. I want -- I want to do that, but I am very -- and you want it to be in sunshine, right? You want to do what's right. I just am not sure this amendment at this time, maybe, and it doesn't say medical marijuana in the -- in the amendment. And for me, that is a -- that is a troubling factor. So I just wanted to put that on the record and I thank you and I yield back.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Ms. Kaptur. Mr. Jenkins would like to be recognized. You are recognized.</p><p>JENKINS:  Would the sponsor of the amendment yield?</p><p>JOYCE:  Absolutely.</p><p>JENKINS:  Thank you. I'm really struggling with this because I'm a states right guy, but I'm also concerned about the slippery slope and I know West Virginia is listed on this and West Virginia has legalized medical marijuana non-combustible, so very narrow sliver, but already since that's passed there's been legislative efforts at the state level to expand that and I think every state wherever you are in the spectrum, your state is probably going to be pushing for expansion at some point in time, number one.</p><p>I assume once your state is named here and it says whatever the state laws, as the state law expands, so too would, obviously, the financial institution's ability to service that, so you're not locked in to whatever the state of the law is in your state at the point of passage of this.</p><p>So if you went from medical marijuana to full recreational, this would still give carte blanche ability for financial institutions without concern of penalty service the recreational even though you maybe medical today only</p><p>JOYCE:  Correct.</p><p>OK, secondly, are there other regulatory aspects we know just as Dr. Harris referenced a week or two ago DHA in the limited area of medical marijuana. While, this is not limited to medical marijuana, this is dealing with financial institutions, are there other regulatory entities at the federal level that the marijuana industry is concerned about and we're going to be -- we're taking care of financial institutions today, are there other folks on down the pike that are going to be given labors potentially if we should so choose.</p><p>JOYCE:  I can't answer that with specificity because I have not looked through every single regulatory agency to figure all that out.</p><p>JENKINS:  We're taking care of law enforcement, we're taking care of financial institutions of this in the past, are there others in the queue potentially?</p><p>JOYCE:  One thing that was brought up at the last hearing we had in which we talked about the law enforcement aspects in the CJS hearing and I fully agree with my friend from Maryland, Dr. Harris, there needs to be research. We need to know in states where you have -- where now it is legal, what is the amount that someone can operate machinery under? At what point they come to work? You're going to have other going concerns that have people employed by them, at what point do they have to worry that this person shouldn't be operating machinery, this person shouldn't be behind the desk, shouldn't be operating a computer?</p><p>We need to have the research. As we've talked about before, it's sort of a chicken and egg thing because right now we're denying state universities and others the ability to do the research until we pass something. And obviously, as an institution, we don't have the guts to get this done and this absolutely changed my mind similar to my dear friend John Boehner who has said his thinking has evolved as well as others here that it was Sam Farr, a member of this committee that was telling me that in California he had a fine V.A. hospital. The V.A. hospital was not allowed to give medicine that would treat PTSD for our soldiers and had found to be effective, was not allowed to do it in his hospital. And the more I think about it, and the more I've watched, we continue to grow the industry, but we continue to act like it doesn't exist.</p><p>Well, you know, we talk about illegal drug dealers. This takes them off the street. This -- this takes it -- yes, it does legitimize it, but we have to think of prohibition. How did that work? I know we have a thing and I agree completely with Mr. Amodei with the fact that we should have these financial institutions, everything should be above board, everything should be transparent, every member of the 40-16th that has voted for his should know exactly how much is being sold and track it like they do right now from seed to sale and be able to know exactly what this is, and so deal with it accordingly.</p><p>And we consider the -- we consider the...</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Mr. Jenkins, this is your time. Are you yielding? Did you yield?</p><p>JENKINS:  I yield back. Thank you.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Ms. Herrera Beutler is recognized.</p><p>HERRERA BEUTLER:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I think the sponsor of this amendment is touching on just how difficult -- I shouldn't say that, just how complex this issue is. There are so many far reaching facets. I -- I, you know, I'm from a state that has legalized recreational marijuana, and I wish we hadn't. I did a call with my school superintendents, my police chiefs and my sheriffs, I wanted to talk about the state of our schools and our kids and what they thought would help.</p><p>And I fully expected them to start the whole conversation off talking about guns and they spent the first 10 or 15 minutes talking about the harm that the use of recreational marijuana has done in our schools with our kids. I was flabbergasted. And now, I recognize this is with regards to medical or medicinal marijuana, and that's a subject, I can't remember who said it, you know, it's one I support. You know, I -- I have talked to parents who have very young children who suffered major seizure disorders who have found types or use for medical marijuana and obviously not smoking it, but there's a way to extract and they've seen a benefit. And boy, if I was that mom, I'd do everything possible, right?</p><p>So I get that and I support that. But my concern with this amendment is we're doing it here and now, at this hour, with this short amount of time, without the input of all of our colleagues when this is an issue that is so much bigger than -- we had a one-year appropriations bill. There are so many valid points on this. </p><p>And I just -- I -- the reason I am not going to be able to support it is because I'm too -- until you've sat next to a drug addict at a roundtable who has looked at you and says (ph), \"The biggest mistake you folks ever made was legalizing recreational marijuana,\" and I'm sitting there going, \"First of all, I didn't do it\" -- but when his heart is breaking, he's telling you that -- it just causes me to want to pause this effort here.</p><p>Now, there are good people on all sides of this. I've talked with my credit unions too, but I don't think that this is the place to do it. And I'm not saying that as a punt. I'm saying I want to get this right. So with that, I unfortunately oppose the gentleman's amendment and I yield back.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentlelady for yielding. Judge Carter of Texas is recognized for time.</p><p>CARTER:  I apologize for my voice today, but I want to say if there's $900,000 in cash in a marijuana shop, garage some place because they can't get in the banking system, then there's $900 million worth of marijuana cash somewhere in the cartel system. The cartels run the marijuana in Mexico in a gigantic way and Mr. Harris is right, the second problem they have is what to do with cash?</p><p>They have the same problem with that marijuana shop guy's got. Now, if we make it legal for people to do it in the United States, then they're either going to offer some major incentives to get illegal marijuana trade into our banking system or they're going to do what they do down on the border, they'll cut somebody's hand or leg off to convince them to put marijuana in their system. And dollars don't look any different -- $900,000 don't look any different whether it's legal or illegal. I think this is something we need to think out.</p><p>There's a reason we have laws to restrict cash deposits, it's so we can find illicit drug trade. That's why we have that law. If we are waiving it, we're running into a problem, and law enforcement will not like it. I yield back.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Yield. The chairman has asked for time. I yield some of my time to you.</p><p>GRAVES:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And first, let me just commend the committee, this is one -- been one of the most respectful in-depth debates I think we've -- we've had as a committee and it's -- it's really compelling and amazing arguments on both sides. The one clarity that I pulled out of all of these is that there is not lack of support for the concept of -- of bringing what is known as a gray area in the financial market to something of a little bit better understanding, nor is there a lack of desire to help those who truly need and desire to have assistance through medicinal purposes.</p><p>But I do sense that this committee is not ready to take the leap to the next step. And I -- I respect that. I know we've debated the previous amendment and the -- and the other bill, I think it was Mr. Culberson's bill, that was medicinal only and I think we've embraced that in a different -- different fashion.</p><p>So Mr. Chairman, as I -- as I look at this, I think this -- this committee has done remarkable here. I'd point out a couple of things, if these were to be adopted, this would be a one-year solution potentially if it is enacted into law and that could create some more disparity and uncertainty as we look ahead. But let it be known that this committee really cares about our constituents and if we could provide assistance medicinally, I think I've heard that here.</p><p>And Mr. Joyce said if this were not to prevail today, I hope you'll continue the effort and maybe in incremental steps, but we have recognized a tremendous class and that's the states versus the federal government. And they're out there on this. And we must come together and sort through this and work through this together.</p><p>But let me just thank each and every committee member who chose to voice your opinions. This has been a fantastic debate and discussion. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Reclaiming my time. I am -- basically I think at times a facilitator and mediator as chairman of this committee, but I have definite opinions about the legalization of marijuana. In New Jersey, we have medicinal marijuana and certainly we understand this as it described the plight of sometimes children and adults in the most excruciating pain that have been -- that should have access whether they're veterans or non-veterans, I think they basically should have access.</p><p>But I visit about 90 schools a year, juniors and seniors in high school, some elementary schools, and the question is always, they say what are we going to ask this dinosaur? Do you believe in the legalization of marijuana? And I say, you know, I know in this room that you are often in middle school, eighth grade, and juniors and seniors in high school, you're adult enough we hope to make the right decisions.</p><p>But what worries me and I say to them quite blankly, I worry about the availability of your younger brothers and sisters and I'm sympathetic to the plight of the banking industry and people who have large cash, you know, sitting in some safe or under the counter and I understand that this is -- this is the outgrowth of this legalization movement and maybe I'm on the wrong side of history.</p><p>But I feel extremely uncomfortable without moving ahead with this amendment. I think it's just that the tone of the discussion here, I feel that some of you share those same concerns and I think it's about time we call for a vote and I don't think there's any further, I get the last word. You have the last word, a minute to close, Mr. Joyce.</p><p>JOYCE:  I thank you very much Mr. Chairman. And I certainly appreciate the -- the debate we had here. I certainly wish we could have a debate like this on the floor. The sad part about it is that sometimes we conflate the different issues, and, if you would take the opportunity to see how these agencies and dispensaries are working, one has to show their license. They have to be over 21. </p><p>It eliminates this black-market trade. It keeps it from getting to kids which is important for all law enforcement. I certainly spent 25 years making that happen. I know you have your ideas, but, you know, we got to talk about reality. Kids are going to find marijuana just like they find alcohol and other things.</p><p>But the only way we can do it is bring the -- the -- bring this money into the system so we know what we're dealing with and be able to talk apples to apples why we're doing this. And just so I may provide a little bit of insight here, the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, said just this afternoon -- said marijuana use is permitted in (ph) some states, but not by federal law. He said the disparity puts federal regulators in a very difficult position and the Fed would love to see this hazy issue clarified.</p><p>The idea of putting this out today was to try to remove this cloud, was to try to bring the transparency that my friend, Mr. Amodei, has talked about and tried to put it out there in those states which this has been legislated or voted on by the will of the people. We represent the people, I may not be in favor of some things, but, you know, when the people want it, we should represent their interest.</p><p>With that, I would ask each and every member here, I would urge them to support my amendment and I surrender the balance of my time.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK, the question is on the Joyce amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those who oppose, say nay.</p><p>In the opinion of the chair -- thank you so much. Yes, the opinion of the chair -- I -- I think the nays have it. </p><p>Any further amendments? Yes. Mr. Cartwright?</p><p>CARTWRIGHT:  Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, amendment number 1. I ask that it be considered read.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Considered read. The gentleman is recognized.</p><p>CARTWRIGHT:  Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Quigley and all the committee staff for your hard work on this bill. I offer this amendment that would simply strike a harmful provision from the bill that limits investment transparency. The provision would, if enacted, ban the Securities and Exchange Commission from enacting a rule requiring publicly traded companies to disclose how they spend shareholder funds on political contributions.</p><p>I think such a prohibition on SEC's rulemaking ability goes against the idea of free markets. Free open markets work because of disclosures. Disclosures are the foundation of our financial system. Disclosures keep the market transparent. Disclosures separate us from rigged stock exchanges where the government picks where you get to invest the way they do in China. Disclosures ensure investors know where their money goes.</p><p>And this is not unwarranted or unwanted rulemaking. More than 1.2 million investors and citizens have called for the SEC to go forward with this disclosure requirement, banning the SEC from doing its job to regulate the stock market and protect investors' interests has no place in the appropriations bill or any bill for that matter. Without this amendment, investors will be kept in the dark as to where their money is being spent and as to what policies it ends up supporting.</p><p>The great American marketplace of ideas demands more transparency, not less. For these reasons, I urge everyone to support my amendment. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the -- the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his remarks. Chairman Graves?</p><p>GRAVES:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Unfortunately, I have to rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. The SEC is certainly not an expert at all in this area of campaign finance nor is it set up to be an expert in campaign finance or disclosure whatsoever. We have a commission for that at the FEC. They do -- they do a great job. They're very zealous I might add and they've got exclusive jurisdiction over all the campaign finance laws.</p><p>Now, I'd point out for the committee, the bill does not preclude, prohibit any public company from reporting their political spending if their shareholders choose. So an opt-in is certainly available. I appreciate the gentleman's concerns in this area. We've had discussions in the past, but with that, I'd have to oppose the amendment. Thank you.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Mr. Quigley is recognized.</p><p>QUIGLEY:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of this amendment. As Justice Brandeis said, the sunlight is the best of disinfectants. In recent years, the Supreme Court decisions like Citizens United and McCutcheon have cast a dark shadow over democracy allowing the voices of every day Americans to be easily drowned out by corporations, shadowy front groups and a handful of billionaires. Just look at the language embedded every year since 2016 in this bill.</p><p>The ability of corporate executives to spend company resources for political purposes raises significant concerns. Without transparency or disclosures, corporations are free to spend funds invested by shareholders without accountability. Reducing the role of corporate influence in our electoral process requires a comprehensive approach and that includes reinstating the SEC role to require publicly traded companies to disclose their political spending. I urge the adoption of this amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion? If not, I look to the gentleman, for a minute to close, from Pennsylvania.</p><p>CARTWRIGHT:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's true, under Citizens United for better or worse, the Supreme Court of the United States has told us that money is speech. And if we're going to give the megaphone to corporations, shouldn't we also give investors the right to know what they're lending their voices to when they invest in their corporations?</p><p>Keeping this provision in the bill is simply a handout to corporate interests at the expense of investors and open markets. We owe our constituents open, transparent markets and the protection that inherently follows with them. Please join me in supporting transparency by voting yes on this amendment. I yield back, and thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentleman. The question is on the Cartwright amendment. All of those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.</p><p>In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not agreed to. </p><p>Further amendment? Ms. Lee is recognized.</p><p>LEE:  I have an amendment at the desk. This is Lee amendment number 1.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Would you consider it read?</p><p>LEE:  Unanimous consent to dispense with the reading.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  We're pleased to recognize you.</p><p>LEE:  Thank you. Mr. Chairman, this is very simple. It would strike Section 810 of the bill which is yet another Republican ideological rider. This policy rider which bans federal funds appropriated for the District of Columbia to pay for abortion services is a clear violation of the District's home rule and is dangerous to the health of the women in the District of Columbia.</p><p>Year after year, I have stood in this committee along with our ranking member to highlight just how detrimental this policy rider really is. No other jurisdiction or state is told how to use its own locally raised revenue, yet this committee is prepared to once again vote to force Congress's view on the District of Columbia. We should never be in the business of denying a woman's reproductive health coverage because of her race, her ethnicity, her source of insurance, income or where she lives, yet that's exactly what this policy rider does.</p><p>It specifically targets women of color and low-income women in the District. In fact, 93 percent of the Washingtonians whose access to abortion care is restricted by this ban are women of color and we know that a woman who seeks an abortion but is denied is more likely to fall into poverty than one who has access to their full range of reproductive choices including abortions.</p><p>We already know that since 1973, the very terrible Hyde amendment has prohibited use of federal funds to provide or promote abortion services. Now, my personal view is that the Hyde amendment should be overturned, but the unfortunate fact of the matter is that the removal of the D.C. abortion ban would not alter the current prohibition against federal funding of abortion services. And of course, this rider is just another example of members of Congress trampling over the rights of D.C. residents and denying D.C. taxpayers the freedom to make their own decisions, their own decisions about how local funds should be used.</p><p>So for many reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Ms. Lee. Chairman Graves.</p><p>GRAVES:  Mr. Chairman, I'd rise in opposition to the amendment. I know the gentlelady raises this issue each year, but D.C. local funds limitation has been in place every year, every year since 1996 with the exception of one year. And I would I guess commend to the committee here that we should make it two years. Let's -- let's keep this streak going, let's keep it going and I'd oppose the amendment and ask the committee to continue with the current position of the bill.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentleman. Mr. Quigley is recognized.</p><p>QUIGLEY:  Having a right and being able to access that right are two very different things. The sad truth is that women with resources can choose whether or not to grow their families while women without resources are left with no choice or they struggle to make ends meet.</p><p>Choice is the heart of this issue, but it's not a choice for us to make. It's the choice for women and their families, a choice between women and their doctors. I never understood this contradiction in my mind with being a conservative. I always felt that we are being told that it's not for government to tell people what to do, how to handle their own situations and their personal situations.</p><p>This is as intimate a decision as there is and you're intruding upon that. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentleman. Ms. DeLauro is recognized. And then I see some additional hands. Mr. Price and Ms. Clark and others.</p><p>DELAURO:  Mr. Chairman, I speak in support of the amendment put forward by our colleague, Congresswoman Lee. It strikes the language. It bans the use of the District of Columbia funded abortions. In 2011, the majority successfully prohibited the District of Columbia from using its own locally raised revenues to cover abortions for women living in the city.</p><p>According to the family, the Kaiser Family Foundation, the ban impacted the health care choices of almost 60,000 women in 2013 alone. The residents and government of Washington, D.C. should be able to determine how they want to use their local resources without congressional interference just like any other state. In fact, it strikes me as ironic that while this majority continually claims to support the sovereignty of local governments in health care, they seek to restrict the District of Columbia's ability to make its own decisions about its own funds.</p><p>To this end, this is about a right for women to make their own decisions with their family and with their doctors, with clergy. It is also about trusting women to make these decisions. I share this belief with the majority of the American people who support Roe v. Wade and the right to a safe and legal abortion in this country, but the majority would rather take us back to a time when women could not make their own health care decisions.</p><p>We must promote and protect the rights of every woman, every family, every American to make their own family planning decisions. Congresswoman Lee's amendment would do so. It would help reverse the majority's attack on women's rights and the -- the autonomy of the District of Columbia. I urge my colleagues to support it.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you Ms. DeLauro. Ms. Lowey is recognized, the ranking member.</p><p>LOWEY:  I rise in strong support of this amendment. Yet again, the majority is wasting time in an attempt to prevent the District of Columbia from using its own funds to safe legal health services. If you want to dictate what should be done with local dollars, you ought to run for the D.C. council, but for now, none of us were elected to force a hyper-partisan ideologically driven agenda on the residents of Washington.</p><p>Let me be very clear, lack of public funding for health services creates a grave financial burden for already struggling families. It forces women to make an impossible choice between paying out of pocket for reproductive health care services or for basic necessities like groceries for their families. This restriction frankly is a slap in the face to all District residents, many of whom are sitting in this room as members of our staff.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Ms. Clark is recognized.</p><p>CLARK:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yet again, here we are talking about attacking women's rights instead of listening to what women and families actually need. Women in my district need safe and respectful work environments where they're paid equally for equal work. Women in my district need affordable child care so they can make decisions about their work-life balance that's what -- that's what is about what's right for their families, not what they have to do out of necessity.</p><p>Women in my district need affordable quality health care, but what we're talking about today is a bill that tells women they don't have a right to plan their own families and that politicians should have more of a say in their health care decisions than they do. Women in my district deserve to make their own medical decisions and so do the women of Washington, D.C. You should not be telling women that being a D.C. resident means you sign away your right to make private choices about your own health care. Congress should not be placing itself between women and their doctors.</p><p>The District of Columbia has the right to use its own locally raised funds to offer necessary health coverage to its citizens. I adamantly support the gentlewoman from California's amendment to strike this regressive and inappropriate restriction. I urge my colleagues to get back to work for women and families and support this amendment. I yield back.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Ms. Clark. Mr. Price and then Ms. Wasserman Schultz will be recognized.</p><p>PRICE:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm happy to join with Ms. Lee in sponsoring this amendment. It would remove the poison bill rider that denies coverage for the full range of reproductive health services including abortion care for women enrolled in D.C. Medicaid.</p><p>Federal insurance coverage of abortion care is already restricted, except in limited circumstances. I personally take issue with that policy, but our amendment addresses an even more prescriptive rider, because currently all 50 states have the autonomy to determine how to spend their own money, their locally raised Medicaid dollars, including whether or not this non-federal funding could be used for abortion coverage.</p><p>Frustratingly, Congress routinely denies that option for Medicaid beneficiaries in Washington, D.C. This restriction overrides the will of D.C.'s own elected officials, withholds comprehensive health care coverage for women in the capital. The D.C. abortion ban disproportionately affects women and families of color, immigrants, youth and low-income individuals many of whom already have a hard time accessing equitable and competent care.</p><p>So we need to end this policy that treats Washingtonians differently than all other Americans. The members of the House Appropriations Committee were not elected to represent D.C. residents and we shouldn't be in the business of legislating their health care. Every woman deserves to make their own health care decisions without congressional interferences and that should be regardless of her ZIP Code or her insurance coverage. I urge the adoption of the amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Price. Ms. Wasserman Schultz is recognized for time.</p><p>WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Study after study shows that placing strict limits on abortion coverage can have a profound impact on those who already face significant barriers to care, such as low income individuals, immigrants, youth, women of color and transgender and gender non-conforming individuals.</p><p>According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 59,800 non-elderly Medicaid enrolled women whose access is affected by this ban resided in D.C. in 2013. In 2011, of the Washingtonians whose access to abortion care is restricted by the local funds ban, the vast majority, 93 percent, were people of color. To make matters worse, these studies have also shown that poor women are often forced to use money that would have been spent for rent, utility bills, food and clothing for themselves and their families in order to be able to pay for abortion services. In fact, almost 60 percent of Medicaid-eligible women reported that paying for an abortion presented serious burdens compared with only 26 percent of women not eligible for Medicaid.</p><p>Forcing those who already face obstacles in accessing health care to make choices like whether to pay rent or obtain medically necessary reproductive health care is not only wrong, it is shameful. Sadly, the D.C. ban is not only bad policy, but it also violates the spirit of the Supreme Court's decisions in Harris versus McRae which clearly asserted that state funds used to provide abortion services for low income women is a state, not federal decision.</p><p>For a party that prides itself on support for strong and local governments, my Republican colleagues sure have a funny way of showing it. The District of Columbia should have the same ability to control its own tax powers as the 50 states including having the option to support -- to provide support to low income women with its local tax dollars. Consistently we hear a states' right argument from republicans, unless it's inconvenient to their -- their alternative points of view.</p><p>There's no consistency here on the part of the party and this damaging language in this bill that's carried every year except one should be dropped because it shouldn't have ever been carried in the first place. I yield back.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentlewoman. Ms. Lee, a minute to close.</p><p>LEE:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, let me just say since it's been offered in place since 1996 really doesn't make it right, and it is discrimination against women in the District. D.C. is the only area in the country with this federally mandated prohibition, why should we force this on the District of Columbia? </p><p>I have to ask you, my colleagues, do you want us to interfere in your local districts and legislate what they can use their local money for? It's their own money. It's not federal tax dollars. Their duly elected representative who is here with this, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton -- she has spoken out strongly against the imposition of nonresident members of Congress' ideology -- placing your ideology on her district, even when some of those same members attempted to silence her voice.</p><p>A woman in the District of Columbia struggling in to make ends meet must have the ability to make important personal decisions with her own physician based on what is best for her family and her circumstances. It's time that Congress stopped playing politics with D.C.'s home rule and with the health of its women in residence and in this ideological posturing, you really wouldn't want me coming into your district advocating a policy to get your districts to stop using their own funds for what they want to use them to, this is downright wrong.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentlewoman.

The ayes are 22, the nays are 29, 29, the amendment is not agreed to. We have six more amendments to do. Mr. Ryan is recognized to -- for his amendment.</p><p>RYAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  It's considered read?</p><p>RYAN:  You can read it, because it's only a line.</p><p>CLERK:  \"An amendment offered Mr. Ryan. In section 818, strike 'none of the funds' and insert 'none of the federal funds.'\"</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Gentleman is recognized.</p><p>RYAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Section 818 is a new provision prohibiting federal and local funds from being used to carry out the Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act or RHNDA, a law passed by the D.C. Council in 2014. RHNDA protects employees working in the District of Columbia from workplace discrimination based on their reproductive health decisions and those of their spouses and dependents.</p><p>Under this law, an employer cannot fire a woman for having an abortion after a rape or for using in vitro fertilization to address infertility. It prohibits an employer from reducing the salary of a man who uses condoms for family planning or a parent who buys birth control for a son or daughter in college.</p><p>As written, section 818 prohibits the District of Columbia from using any funds including local funds consisting solely of local taxes and fees to carry out RHNDA. This provision represents the sixth attempt by Congress to undermine this nondiscrimination law since 2015, but the first time this RHNDA rider has been included in the underlying financial services appropriations bill.</p><p>Unlike the D.C. Council, no member of this committee or this Congress was elected to legislate on local D.C. issues. The inclusion of section 818 is undemocratic, a violation of the majority stated belief, and local control, and autonomy, and yet another insult to D.C. residents, some of whom are staffers, their spouses, and their children. To remedy this, my amendment inserts federal before funds, restoring the District of Columbia's ability to spend its local funds to carry out RHNDA's mission.</p><p>In anticipation of possible objections to my amendment, let me be clear about what RHNDA does not do. It does not discriminate against churches or religious organizations. It applies to all employers, and the law protects religious liberty by ensuring every employee in D.C. can follow his or her religious or moral beliefs when making health care decisions without fear of retaliation. </p><p>It does not force employers to cover elective abortions in their health insurance plans. RHNDA is clear on this. The law states this section shall not be construed to require an employer to provide insurance coverage related to a reproductive health decision.</p><p>There's absolutely no ambiguity here, it does not require pro-life organizations to hire individuals who advocate for abortion, it protects employees decisions regarding their own reproductive health, their beliefs about reproductive health are outside the scope of the law, organizations can still make employment decisions based on religion and political views, and employees must be willing to carry out employers' missions and directives.</p><p>In short, RHNDA is not about religious liberty, it's about basic workplace fairness, employees should be judged by their employers solely on job performance, not on the reproductive health decisions they make outside of work. I strongly urge my colleagues to support my amendment and allow the District of Columbia to spend its local funds protecting employees from workplaces.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentleman for his comments. Mr. Graves is recognized, the chairman.</p><p>GRAVES:  Mr. Chairman, the majority opposes the amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Mr. Quigley is recognized.</p><p>QUIGLEY:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I've spent nine and a half years in this city for some period of time, it's not Chicago, but it's is a place I would live, I think the only reservation I would have is that it's a jurisdiction largely controlled by an outside government, and that's us.</p><p>Every year we mark up this bill, we discover how many of our colleagues aspire to a seat on the District of Columbia City Council by asking not to carry out that urge at the expense of the right of the people of the District to govern themselves as they see fit and to spend their tax dollars as they see fit. I urge the support of this amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion on the Ryan amendment? Otherwise, the gentleman has a minute to close. It's on, Ms. Lee. Excuse me. Apologies.</p><p>LEE:  Yes.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Ms. Lee is recognized.</p><p>LEE:  Once again, I rise in strong support of Congressman Ryan's amendment, once again, another anti-D.C. rider, another anti-woman rider. This is a new rider that prohibits the District of Columbia from implementing a law, the Reproductive Health Nondiscrimination Amendment Act of 2014, that the D.C. Council passed unanimously. This rider is about violating D.C. Home Rule and protecting women's access to care. All women, regardless of their ZIP Code, their income, or their employer, should have the ability to make private decisions regarding their health care. D.C.'s bill simply ensures that employees can make their own reproductive health decisions without interference or fear of retribution from their employers.</p><p>Unfortunately, my colleagues will stop at nothing -- short of nothing to limit women's access to reproductive health care and to trample on D.C.'s autonomy. Members of Congress who are not accountable to the residents of the District of Columbia should not interfere with D.C. local laws.</p><p>Once again, it's hard for me to imagine why in the world you continue to do this. These are ideological attacks on women's health. We have no business getting into the business of the District of Columbia. They passed their legislation unanimously. Again, you don't want me coming to your districts, advocating for something to -- you know, that you may not like, that they're trying to do with their own local funds.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Ms. Lee. And Mr. Serrano is recognized.</p><p>SERRANO:  Very briefly. For years I've said this and I haven't said it recently. Washington, D.C. has become the playground for so many members of Congress to do whatever they want to do. </p><p>In other words, when they go back home to get asked, \"How do you feel about school vouchers?\" \"Well, I'm for them.\" \"You are?\" \"Yes, in Washington D.C.\" \"How do you feel about marijuana?\" \"I'm against it.\" \"You are?\" \"Yes, in Washington D.C.\" \"Abortions?\" \"Well, I'm against them.\" \"Where?\" \"In D.C.\"</p><p>And D.C. becomes the place that gives you people cover for saying they are for or against certain issues and they use it as if there was no respect for human beings that work and live in that community called Washington, D.C. And I think it's time that we realize that we have to treat people with dignity and respect, but it will fall on deaf ears and we will continue to do this.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  No further discussion. Mr. Ryan has a minute to close.</p><p>RYAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to remind my colleagues what this amendment is about. It's not about religious liberty. It is not about abortion. It's about basic workplace fairness. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support my amendment and allow the District of Columbia to spend local funds protecting employees from workplace discrimination. Thank you.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you. I thank the gentleman. The question's on the Ryan amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.</p><p>In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not agreed to. </p><p>Further amendments? Ms. Kaptur has an amendment.</p><p>KAPTUR:  Yes, I have an amendment at the desk, please.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Would you consider it read?</p><p>KAPTUR:  I would ask it be considered as read.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  The gentlewoman is recognized to speak on her amendment.</p><p>KAPTUR:  Yes.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you.</p><p>KAPTUR:  My amendment essentially would strike Titles 9, 10 and 11 in our bill, which comprise about a good 30 percent or more of the bill itself, starting on page 168. And what this comprises is the -- what's called The Choice Act, I would like to call it the Wrong Choice Act, and it involves financial institution regulation.</p><p>The last time I looked, the financial institutions, especially the Wall Street based ones are doing quite well in our country. All their profits are up and just coincidentally, they happen to be the largest contributors both to presidential and congressional elections. Isn't that something? So, what this section that I'm seeking to eliminate does, it authorizes on an appropriation bill at a very egregious level. Unbelievable.</p><p>I like to call it the Wrong Choice Act, has been passed on the floor of Congress several times, so why do we need to stick it in an appropriation bill? And I would really ask the majority, you think you're really going to sneak this past the Senate? So, it must be being put in here for some other reason, and I can only imagine what that might be. This bill keeps coming back from the dead.</p><p>So, I just have to say this for the record because I have served here for a while, and had to bear in my state the cost of Wall Street egregiousness, and I go back to the financial crisis of 2008, when Wall Street gambled away the individual fortunes of millions and millions of Americans amounting to well over $12 trillion, and I think only one fellow went to jail up there. His initials were B.M. But the rest of them didn't, and our people are still digging out of what happened.</p><p>Now, this Wrong Choice Act functionally kills the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which I know a lot of people don't like. Let me just put it in perspective. So, they took away $12 trillion from the American people and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau got back $12 billion, $12 billion. And people make a big deal out of that, it is nothing compared to what was taken away from people in my state and other places. Now, just let me read a couple words, I can't give you every page, but what this actually does, it changes the law regarding angel investors. I hope everybody knows what those are:  registration exemptions for mergers and acquisition brokers. How interesting. This is also -- shell companies, a shell company that is formed by an entity that is not a shell company, you define that for me.</p><p>How about truth in lending, changes in that? Exemptions -- really interesting use of words in several sections. And I just would say to my colleagues, you may not remember what collateralized debt obligations were or derivatives, but I sure do. And you'll give them an inch, and they will take not just a mile.</p><p>And so, I would urge my colleagues to take this authorizing language, and it's just not two words. Mr. Joyce's amendment was fairly concise. But they throw out the emergency mechanism that prevents future taxpayer bailouts throughout the emergency mechanism, why is that a good thing? Let me just put on the record also that the individuals who are pushing these kinds of changes are doing very well. Jamie Dimon, the CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, just in his salary, earns $28 million a year.</p><p>James Gorman of Morgan Stanley makes $23 million. Now this doesn't include all their holdings, this is just the raw salary. Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs makes $22 million a year. Brian Moynihan of Bank of America makes $20 million a year. All these folks who are involved in what went wrong in 2008, they still got their jobs and they're doing even better.</p><p>Meanwhile, the median household income of our country is up 5.3 percent since 2008, barely above the 2008 inflation level after adjusting for inflation and inequality in our country continues to grow. In 2007, the top 1 percent of people in our country owned 34 percent of wealth, they now own 39 percent.</p><p>In 2007, the bottom 90 percent owned 29 percent of this country's wealth, now they all under -- they own under a quarter, 23 percent. So, Mr. Chairman, I ask that Titles 9, 10 and 11 be struck from this bill, I think it's the right thing to do, especially because it is massive authorizing on an appropriation bill. It is inappropriate in an appropriation bill. And I yield back.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Ms. Kaptur. And Chairman Graves.</p><p>GRAVES:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I, you know, I, you know, rise an opposition, and at first I have to say, I'm really surprised that Ms. Kaptur wants to strike these sections. This is truly the heart of this bill with a bipartisan heartbeat, what's unique about these sections is that the majority of all the provisions were bipartisan through the House, either passed with 250 or more votes many at 270, 80, and 90, and a lot of them were just suspensions that were overwhelmingly supported by the House. So, while the talking points that recited there might not match completely with what we have here, this is the most bipartisan section that I would ask this committee to keep intact in object this -- object to this amendment. So with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Graves. Mr. Quigley, do you seek time or...</p><p>QUIGLEY:  No.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Mr. Yoder, excuse me. Mr. Yoder is recognized.</p><p>YODER:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Chairman Yoder.</p><p>YODER:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Frankly, Mr. Chairman, I'm stunned and out outraged that my colleague from Ohio would bring this amendment. What -- one of things she's striking here is the E-mail Privacy Act, which has passed the House unanimously in the last Congress and this Congress. And striking that amendment would allow the government to have unwarranted warrantless searches of Americans' e-mails without their permission, without their knowledge, and continue this horrible practice from a 1986 law that allows the government to spy on American citizens without their knowledge or permission.</p><p>The House has spoken on this twice, and spoken on it in the last Congress unanimously, it spoke on it this Congress unanimously. And so, it's the kind of bipartisan legislation that Americans want us to pursue, and allowing agencies to continue to violate our Fourth Amendment rights to me is unconscionable.</p><p>And so, voting for Ms. Kaptur's amendment would be a vote against the -- voting for Ms. Kaptur's amendment would be a vote against the Fourth Amendment, a vote against the civil liberties or constituents, a vote against technology, a vote to support the Senate's practice of sitting on our House bills and never moving them, and worst of all, it's a vote against bipartisanship on this unifying legislation. I'd like to think Chairman Graves for his working with us to get this in the legislation and his team, and I would strongly oppose the Kaptur amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion on the Kaptur -- and Ms. Lowey is recognized, the ranking member.</p><p>LOWEY:  I just rise in strong support of my friend's amendment. Just Title 10 alone -- Title 9 alone is nearly half of this bill. It is filled with a garden variety of financial services authorizing language. Its inclusion highlights real friction simmering within the majority. With two chambers of Congress and the White House under Republican control, why does the majority feel compelled to push so much authorizing language through this committee?</p><p>Let me be clear, I voted for some of the bills included in Title 9, several have even passed the House on a voice vote. But last time I checked, this is the Appropriations Committee, not the Financial Services committee, this language along with Titles 10, and 11 -- and 11 simply have no place in our bills, so let's do the right thing, leave it to the authorizers, strike this language for the -- for the amendment. Thank you.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentlewoman for her comments. Any further comments? If not, Ms. Kaptur has a minute to close.</p><p>KAPTUR:  Just remember 2008. Remember collateralized debt obligations, and remember derivatives. And there were little words put in bills like this that ended up being time bombs that practically brought the country down. </p><p>So I would say for the gentleman that is -- would like to bring up the e-mail issue, bring it up to the floor in an authorizing capacity, don't put it in an appropriation bill. It's amazing to me that this entire -- that's why I say there must be other motivation for this in an election year, that this would be stuck in an appropriation bill that we want to pass in order to make sure that the government of the United States operates. I yield back. Please vote for the Kaptur amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Ms. Kaptur. The question's on the Kaptur amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.</p><p>In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not adopted. </p><p>Further amendments? Ms. Wasserman Schultz and then Mr. Serrano after that.</p><p>WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have an amendment at the desk and I ask that it considered as read.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  It's considered read. We're pleased to recognize you.</p><p>WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I offer this amendment with Ms. Lee to strike section 112 of the bill. As it would diminish the vitality of our nation's religious organizations and violate our First Amendment rights. Section 112 which my amendment strikes would water down a provision in the tax code, sometimes referred to as the Johnson amendment, which protects the integrity and independence of charities and houses of worship by ensuring that they do not endorse or oppose political candidates.</p><p>One of the characteristics of American religious institutions that has made them so sacred is that they are separate from governments and separate from campaign politics. If Americans want to get involved in partisan elections, we know how to do that, but what we are seeking when we attend church, synagogue, mosque, temple, or any other house of worship is quite different.</p><p>This distinction has long been reflected in how our law treats religious institutions differently than political institutions. To preserve their sacred place in American society, houses of worship must stay above the political fray and refrain from endorsing candidates for political office. Current law strikes a careful balance, and it's important to emphasize what houses of worship with tax exempt status can do, they are permitted to advocate for policies that are consistent with their values, and they can help their members become engaged in the political process.</p><p>They can organize public debates on any issue, organize candidate forums, conduct voter registration drives, get out the vote, and help transport people to the polls. They just can't tell people who to vote for. It's no surprise that a wide array of religious organizations and faith leaders support the Johnson amendment and oppose section 112, out of an understandable concern that political parties and candidates seeking power would be empowered to use their congregations as tools and pressure them for endorsements.</p><p>And I ask, Mr. Chairman, that letters signed by thousands of these concerned and respected organizations, which I know I brought to the committee with me -- so I want to actually, visibly show you how many we have received, that these thousands of concerned and respected organizations have sent letters to the Congress, urging that this action be dropped from the bill.</p><p>Make no mistake:  Weakening existing law would have the unintended consequence of dividing congregations and opening them up to political wheeling and dealing. I think we can all agree that Americans have had enough of political partisanship, they don't want more of it, and they certainly don't want it in their houses of worship where so many seek refuge from the tumult and chaos of their day to day life. As if gutting these protections for houses of worship weren't bad enough, this provision also likely violates our First Amendment rights.</p><p>While current law applies to all tax exempt nonprofit organizations, section 112 would only applied to houses of worship. Specifically, section 112 makes it nearly impossible for the IRS to investigate claims that houses of worship have violated the law. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was designed to prevent exactly this kind of religious favoritism.</p><p>Regardless of our political stripes and colors, and regardless of our religion, no one wants our houses of worship to be torn apart by partisan campaign politics. And no one wants their First Amendment rights torn away from them. As people of faith, we cannot allow this effort to politicize our sanctuaries of worship to move forward. And as federal lawmakers, we have a responsibility to ensure equal justice, liberty, and protection for all people. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on my amendment. And I yield to my colleague, Ms. Lee.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK. Ms. Lee, you...</p><p>LEE:  Thank you very much. And as a co-sponsor of this amendment, I wanted...</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  You have -- you have about a minute or so, because if you're -- you can claim your own time in a few minutes.</p><p>LEE:  OK.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Would you rather claim your own time?</p><p>LEE:  I'll claim my own time.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for her comments.</p><p>WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Thanks.</p><p>LEE:  Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Chairman Graves.</p><p>GRAVES:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The majority...</p><p>LEE:  Of course.</p><p>GRAVES:  ... opposes the amendment from the gentlelady from Florida.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK. Mr. Quigley.</p><p>QUIGLEY:  (inaudible)</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Would you yield to...</p><p>QUIGLEY:  (inaudible)</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Ms. Lee and then we're going to go to Mr. Culberson, so.</p><p>LEE:  OK. But thank you very much. Let me just associate myself with the remarks of my colleague Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz, and thank her very much for introducing this amendment again. As she mentioned, section 112 of this bill is designed to give religious organizations in violation of the First Amendment special tax benefits and privileges that are unavailable to other nonreligious organizations. Sadly, this provision would make it very difficult for the IRS to investigate religious organizations if they are in violation of the law. Now, as a person of faith I can attest that I do not want my place of worship to become overly politicized. And other Americans agree as you have just seen.</p><p>According to public opinion polling, more than seven in 10 Americans oppose allowing places of worship to endorse political candidates. Americans and our Constitution are on the right side of this issue, our committee should follow suit and support this amendment. In order to protect the integrity and independence of houses of worship and faith based charities, and the separation of church and state, we need to ensure that they do not endorse or oppose political candidates. So, I hope my colleagues will support this important amendment. Thank you and I yield back.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentlewoman for her comments. Mr. Culberson from Houston, Texas is recognized.</p><p>CULBERSON:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, the language which Chairman Graves has included in this bill. My request is very narrowly drawn to ensure that the First Amendment rights of pastors are protected consistent with the First Amendment, which directs that Congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise of religion or abridging the freedom of speech.</p><p>Now, this amendment is very, this section that Chairman Graves included is very narrowly drawn, so that only the commissioner of the IRS can remove the nonprofit status of a church or place of worship if the commissioner determines that they've engaged in political speech.</p><p>The -- one of the largest -- I represent the two largest churches, in the country, Lakewood and Second Baptist Church, and Second Baptist had their tax exempt status threatened several years ago when they simply handed out voter registration cards. Now, that's absurd. We want everyone who can vote in America to vote, and we want -- I think should we -- should we encourage people to in -- to register people to vote, and the amendment, the section that it -- this amendment would strike, is again, very nearly drawn and designed to protect the free speech rights of our pastors and churches while preserving the ability of the IRS to revoke the nonprofit status of a place of worship that does engage in political conduct. So I urge members to vote against the amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Culberson. Mr. Price is recognized and then Ms. Clark.</p><p>PRICE:  Mr. Chairman, I rise this in support of the amendment and suggest to colleagues that we really better be careful about this one. We really better be careful. I suggest that you think about it very carefully. The Johnson amendment is a valuable safeguard that protects our religious institutions and our political process. Our guideposts in this should be the twin constitutional pillars, the free exercise clause and the Establishment Clause that serve not only to ensure that houses of worship do not become entangled with the state, but also that houses of worship are protected from the state. The core value is religious liberty. It's entirely appropriate that the Establishment Clause is part of the Bill of Rights.</p><p>Congress -- congregations currently have ample freedom to speak out on political and social issues. They can host candidate forums. They can organize \"souls to the polls\" trips (ph). They can hold voter registration drives. These activities are protected, and they should be. As long as the activity is about promoting conscientious citizenship and related faith to the issues of the day, we want to encourage more of this activity, not less. </p><p>There's plenty of evidence that this kind of advocacy, religious concern for good citizenship on the common good is alive and well in our religious institutions. But what is not permissible under current law is the endorsement of specific candidates or direct intervention in political campaigns. That's really what's at stake in the Johnson amendment.</p><p>We should think very carefully before we legitimate (ph) using religious institutions as a conduit for political contributions or for candidate or party-centered political advocacy. That would threaten, rather than enhance the freedom of these institutions. And I think it would lead to great cynicism about the activities of these institutions.</p><p>At present, our houses of worship are by and large greatly respected. They have great moral force. People pay attention when the faith community speaks out. If these voices are seen as a front for campaigns or as institutions that are being exploited by campaigns, that undermines that moral force, something we would all live to regret. Let's be careful. Let's maintain the safeguards that are in place and have served our congregations and our constituents well. I urge the adoption of this amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Mr. Graves, any comment on Mr. Price's amendment?</p><p>OK. What?</p><p>Ms. Clark, you're recognized.</p><p>CLARK:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, speak in strong support of my colleague's amendment to remove the language in this bill that would seriously undermine the Johnson amendment. Section 112 of this bill would make it virtually impossible for the IRS to enforce the Johnson amendment as it applies to religious institutions, allowing them to actively endorse or oppose political candidates.</p><p>As Congressman Price just stated, we encourage lots of activity in our houses of worship, but this is going too far and putting us on a dangerous path. Allowing this section to become law would put at risk the ability of churches and other places of worship to continue to serve as nonpartisan places for worship, reflection, and community, rather than as another political battleground.</p><p>Further, by singling out houses of worship among all 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations, this section raises a serious question about its constitutionality. The First Amendment prohibits the government from creating a legal preference for religious over non-religious entities. Hundreds of religious organizations and thousands of faith leaders agree that being pulled apart by divisive political campaigns would be a harmful step for their institutions and their communities.</p><p>On constitutional grounds, on the grounds of common sense and decency, we should all be able to agree that keeping politics separate from our centers of worship makes sense and it's the right thing to do. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. And I yield back.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion? Ms. Roybal-Allard is recognized.</p><p>ROYBAL-ALLARD:  Mr. Chairman, I am in strong support of this amendment. And I yield the balance of my time to Mr. Quigley.</p><p>QUIGLEY:  I thank my colleague -- thank you.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Mr. Quigley, you could claim your own time but you're recognized.</p><p>QUIGLEY:  Thank you. Look, places of worship are intended to be just that. They inspire belief, and they build community. By repealing this amendment, divisive themes, the Johnson amendment, divisive themes are introduced into the unified environments that religious organizations strive to build, thereby, undermining their core objectives.</p><p>Now, you know what we've lived through under this law for some time, nothing in the law prevents pastors from speaking out from the pulpit on issues no matter how controversial. But beyond the ideological argument lies a constitutional one. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment calls for the separation of church and state, but by repealing this amendment, we are facilitating a direct transaction between the two.</p><p>Let's look at what our colleagues did over on the authorizing side, they rejected recent attempts to include a repeal of the Johnson amendment in the new tax law. Furthermore, this subverts campaign disclosure laws, finance disclosure laws, and lends itself to the creation of new \"religious organizations,\" quote, as instruments of campaign cash. In short, this repeal overtly link state and church and greases the wheel for dark money. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. And I yield back.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  That worries me.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion? Ms. Wasserman Schultz has a minute to close.</p><p>WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Thank you. Sorry. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to close really by issuing a single plea to my colleagues. This really is as Mr. Price said, a \"Be careful what you wish for\" moment. Partisan politics has infiltrated so many aspects of our lives already. I know all of us regret this state of affairs even though we have chosen to engage in it on a daily basis. </p><p>Now, imagine how our constituents feel. I think it's safe to say that the vast majority of them who are members of religious congregations treasure their houses of worship as spaces far removed from the literally profane political discourse that is all around us. Let us not turn our pews into pits of partisan conflict.</p><p>No house of worship should be pressured to turn its pulpit into a super PAC, where millions of dollars in donations could be washed across its collection plates with little transparency and all while handing deep pocketed donors massive tax write-offs. Do we want to elected officials and candidates to go to houses of worship speaking out spiritual guidance but political endorsements? Do we congregations to grapple not with the Divine Word of God, but with the poll tested words of politicians? I think not.</p><p>I hope that the members of this committee recognize and agree with me that we should make sure that our houses of worship continue to be the respite that they were intended to be and have been for thousands of years, and remove this badly misguided section of the bill. I yield back the balance of my time.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Now the question is on the Wasserman Schultz amendment. All of those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.</p><p>In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not agreed to.

The move has been met with a wave of criticism and concern about Mr. Mulvaney's motivations. There's also no discussion in the law allowing these actions.</p><p>This board was established under Dodd Frank and statutorily mandated to meet with the director at least two times per year. Members of the consumer advisory board are a broad and geographically diverse set of stakeholders, including consumer advocates, and lawyers, financial service industry representatives, CDFIs, academics, and more.</p><p>These members serve in a voluntary capacity and they have sacrificed their time, money, and energy to provide their best insights and experiences with the bureau to help develop rules and policies that will protect consumers and businesses alike. My amendment would simply revoke the acting director is termination and reinstate all members of the consumer advisory board.</p><p>It would also remove the director's ability to terminate members of the board without cause and require a written notification to the board member in question and to Congress. This amendment is pretty straightforward, and would right the petty terminations of these board members, which was completely unnecessary.</p><p>Now, my Republican colleagues will argue that this amendment is authorizing language and should be opposed. But I would like to point out to those same colleagues that this 312 page bill we're working on now has 142 pages of authorizing language. This amendment is a drop in the bucket. And I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentleman for his remarks. So, Chairman Graves recognized.</p><p>GRAVES:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the amendment, but I also rise to applaud the gentleman from New York, he's one of the lone voices on the other side that wants to see CFPB under our jurisdiction. And Mr. Serrano, thank you, thank you for offering this amendment because you're expressing -- I think everyone's concern that is we want to have oversight, we want to offer direction, and while I oppose the amendment here, because I know that the director is going to reappoint the board later this year with new members, he's going to populate the board, I do -- I do appreciate though you're willing to step out there in provide appropriating oversight over this bureau. With that though, I oppose the amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion on the amendment? Ms. Lowey is recognized, the ranking member.</p><p>LOWEY:  I rise in -- I rise in strong support of my friend's amendment. The Trump administration's dismantling of the CFPB is underway. It is a direct and unacceptable attack on consumer financial protections that prioritizes special interests over our constituents. Earlier this month at Mick Mulvaney's direction, the CFPB disbanded its advisory board and councils. The advisory board is mandated by Dodd Frank to advise and consult the CFPB, convening twice a year. Since Mulvaney took over last year, it hasn't met once.</p><p>This isn't surprising, but it is concerning. We must ensure that the CFPB is permitted to carry out its mission, protecting consumers from predatory lending, and other loan practices. So, I ask you to vote for the amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion on the amendment? Mr. Serrano has a minute to close.</p><p>SERRANO:  Thank you. Simple amendment -- I think that this is an overreach. I think it's an ability of Mr. Mulvaney to do away with people he didn't want on the board; eventually, to try to do away with the board itself. And, lastly, the chairman is correct. I am a lone voice in saying that there should be oversight by this committee of that whole provision in the law.</p><p>And the reason I do it is for two reasons:  one, because it's the right thing to do, and secondly, because I'm a big fan of this committee. I didn't come on this committee to see it dwindle away. I think we should reach the days -- in the old days where our oversight meant a lot in this Congress and in this country. Thank you.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Serrano. The question is on the Serrano amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.</p><p>In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not agreed to.</p><p>SERRANO:  What?</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  What?</p><p>SERRANO:  I didn't hear that.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Want to get back to the old days? OK.</p><p>Further amendments, Mr. Pocan has a...</p><p>SERRANO:  (inaudible).</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  The amendment is not agreed to. Who do we have next?</p><p>SERRANO:  I thought my amendment would pass.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Ms. McCollum. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Pocan, you'll be next. Thank you.</p><p>MCCOLLUM:  Thank you, Mr. Chair. I have an amendment at the desk. And I would like it to consider to be read.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  The gentlewoman is recognized.</p><p>MCCOLLUM:  Thank you. My amendment restores a provision that prevents automatic pay raises for the vice president and other high-level political appointees in the executive branch. And you might ask why I'm doing this and the executive schedule is index for raises, but it appears that they cannot get an increase if there is no general schedule increase. And to my knowledge, there is no general scheduled pay increase.</p><p>So, it's my understanding that Mr. Trump has in fact proposed a civilian pay freeze for 2019. So, with the civilian pay raises freezes in effect, I believe at a time when American families are seeing stagnant wages, it is just unacceptable that the majority would want to abandon past years of precedent and give pay raises to senior officials in the Trump administration only. I find this politically motivated that it goes to political appointees.</p><p>And I'm -- I personally find it rather hypocritical, when we're -- when it's not pay raises for everyone in the federal government that would be instituted. Because, if it was, these political appointees would be taken care of. </p><p>I would very much like to see -- in the past, we've had Democratic administrations exercise financial restraint on their appointees' salaries. But to allow political appointees right now and allies of the Trump administration to be able to reward themselves with taxpayers' dollars is just unacceptable.</p><p>I would ask my Republican colleagues, do they have any other justification other than partisanship, why they would drop their insistence on salary caps now that the benefits would only be to the Trump administration political appointees?</p><p>Do they believe that these administration political appointees have been such responsible stewards of our tax dollars? We're faced with daily stories about the Cabinet members, for example, like EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt treating himself to taxpayers' perks, first-class flights, hundred-thousand-dollar trips to Italy and Morocco and a ridiculous $43,000 sound booth, the use of aides to procure a mattress from the Trump Hotel, the official -- on an official trip that Secretary Mnuchin so he could contently (ph) watch the solar eclipse from Fort Knox, a $30,000 dining room set purchased by Secretary Carson for his office -- just to name a few. </p><p>Congress should be cracking down on these abuses of taxpayers, not giving the executive branch salary raises. So I urge adoption of my amendment. I yield back.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Ms. McCollum. Chairman Graves.</p><p>GRAVES:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The majority opposes the amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion on the amendment? Ms. Lowey is recognized.</p><p>LOWEY:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of my friend's amendment. There is no reason why the Trump administration which boasts the wealthiest cabinet in modern history should be held to a different standard than the previous administration when it comes to pay increases. This is just another case of Jekyll and Hyde games played by the majority. On the one hand, they claim to be focused on the wellbeing of our kids and our grandkids, and on the other hand, they want to give pay increases to political appointees, all while passing a tax bill that will dramatically increase the deficit. Vote for the amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion? Mr. Quigley is recognized.</p><p>QUIGLEY:  The provision in question has been included in the final version of this bill since fiscal year 2014, and it has only then during the Trump administration that it has been left out of the House version, we shouldn't have a different standard for the Trump administration than we have the Obama administration, I support this amendment, and urge my colleagues to support it as well.</p><p>RYAN:  Mr. Chairman.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Mr. Ryan is recognized.</p><p>RYAN:  I appreciate and I thank all the points have been made. Let me briefly add that this Congress through our legislative branch appropriations bill that Mr. Yoder and I and our teams crafted do not have a pay raise for members of Congress. So, here we are saying to ourselves, no pay raise, but yet one of the wealthiest cabinets we've ever seen is going to be eligible. I think that flies in the face of what we want to do here and I wanted to make that point and support this amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion on the gentlewoman's amendment? Ms. McCollum has a minute to close.</p><p>MCCOLLUM:  Mr. Chairman, I think the points have been made. And I just urge adoption of this amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK. The question is on the McCollum amendment. All of those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.</p><p>In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not agreed to.

The amendment is not adopted.</p><p>Mr. Pocan's recognized for his amendment.</p><p>POCAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask it to be considered read.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Considered read. The gentleman's recognized.</p><p>POCAN:  Thank you very much. This is an amendment I am going to withdraw, but I do want to just put this out there for the committee and especially the subcommittee. In section 922 of the bill there are provisions for some banks that take them away from some regulation, and the reality is many of these bigger banks are cutting jobs here in the United States and sending them overseas, especially in customer service call centers.</p><p>You know, we know that the president has been very aggressive, having a trade war over the loss of manufacturing jobs and not that I exactly understand what he's doing in his trade war, but I know there is a trade war over manufacturing jobs, these are now service jobs that we're also seeing leave. If you lose your manufacturing jobs, you lose your service jobs, pretty soon you don't have any jobs.</p><p>Last year, Wells Fargo announced it was building a new 7,000-person call center in the Philippines. And just last week, Wells Fargo announced it was closing a call center in Reno, Nevada eliminating hundreds of jobs. The CEO at Wells Fargo admitted at a Senate hearing last year that many of the thousands of the jobs being cut in call centers were due to their jobs being shipped overseas. And it's not just Wells Fargo. It's Capital One, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase, Citibank and others -- have recently offshored significant numbers of call center jobs.</p><p>What this amendment was trying to do, and I just hope that this is something that the committee can look at perhaps more in the future, is that the provisions that allow some banks to have less regulation would not be in place for people who have outsourced more than 50 jobs.</p><p>I think at some point, we need to be able to address this, this amendment would do that, but given that people did not support the amendment that Marcy Kaptur had which I think would have solved some of these problems, I expect that that vote would go down and I want to be courteous of time, although I do have to get to 7:30 to win the pool, I will say that...</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Just keep on talking and...</p><p>POCAN:  And with that, I will withdraw my amendment, but I appreciate the time to...</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Pocan for your patience. And Mr. Graves is recognized -- Chairman.</p><p>GRAVES:  Mr. Chairman, the majority opposes Mr. Pocan's amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion on the Pocan amendment? Anyone? Withdrawing -- it's being withdrawn. Thank you for withdrawing. Any further amendments?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I was thinking that was coming back up.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I don't know.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Any further amendments?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  I really appreciate you working with us.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Seeing none, I'm going to recognize -- are you rising? The gentleman has an amendment at the desk. Mr. Joyce.</p><p>CLERK:  An amendment offered...</p><p>JOYCE:  Considered read.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  I'd like, you'll give a full explanation of what -- if you would. We won't read it, but if you could give us a full explanation. The chair asks that courtesy.</p><p>JOYCE:  Sure. Thank you.</p><p>Well, I understand from some they would like -- I got it. I appreciate that. What this would amount to is a bill that -- Joyce number 3 that's in front of you, the last paragraph being, after line 20 of medical marijuana, \"Any entity that engages in any activity involving marijuana that is not exclusively for medical purposes shall not be covered by this provision.\"</p><p>I know we've had a long and engaged debate about this. I know we're in the process of putting those together at the moment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  If you would suspend -- are there copies?</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  We need five official copies.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  The minority doesn't have copies.</p><p>JOYCE:  Again, we're in the process of handwriting...</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Just suspend for just a minute. Thank you.</p><p>JOYCE:  Thank you very much for inquiring, ma'am, and I apologize for this but it's in the process of being made right now.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  So, we're going to wait until something is printed.</p><p>JOYCE:  They're being hand-printed as we speak, some of the language that was added there. I read the one part that was in addition to what was handed out to everyone is Joyce number 3.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  There's some difference in what we have than what you've mentioned. Our document does not say solely.</p><p>JOYCE:  I read the last paragraph, sir, before, and I know we're in the process of getting your copy right now, ma'am. I have people down here handwriting them for you to make sure they have it.</p><p>LOWEY:  I have no idea. In fact, I was just told there are a few copies here.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  If you could just use your microphone, Ms. Lowey.</p><p>LOWEY:  Just give us a final copy.</p><p>OK. Take you a minute.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK. When we get the final copy, we'll give you a couple of minutes to look it over, I guess.</p><p>JOYCE:  In the meantime, I'd like to add, Mr. Chairman, that in listening to fellow members of the committee and trying to address your concerns, that's what we've tried to craft here is something that takes into consideration the 46 states, the three territories and the district that have engaged in or voted for or -- and legislated for the medical marijuana, that this amendment would cover medical marijuana only and that the production and sale would all be for medical marijuana only and leave out what those states, I tried to encompass everybody to be fair in the first time around. But I found some issue there. So, therefore, we've left out those states that have or -- and included that have medical that we don't use it for the recreation.</p><p>LOWEY:  Yes. Will the gentleman yield?</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  If the gentleman has the time and I guess we'll use the time until we have recovered the documents.</p><p>LOWEY:  I'd like to clarify a question on this is that states that have only medical marijuana laws in place or medical and/or, because some states have both and I wouldn't want to preclude states that have both. Understanding this would only cover medical.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  I'm going to ask the gentleman to suspend until we have a final copy which can be looked over.</p><p>LOWEY:  Thank you.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  The meeting will come to order. I believe we have a final copy of the draft and I'm going to ask the clerk to read it, then I'll recognize the sponsor once again to explain it.</p><p>CLERK:  An amendment offered by...</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Please give your attention to the clerk.</p><p>CLERK:  \"An amendment offered by Mr. Joyce, Number 3. At the end of the bill, before the spending reduction account, insert the following section:  blank, 'None of the funds made available by this Act may be used with respect to the states of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming, or with respect to the District of Colombia, Puerto Rico or Guam.</p><p>\"'To penalize a financial institution solely because the institution provides financial services to an entity that is a manufacturer, producer, or a person that participates in any business or organized activity that involves handling medical marijuana or medical marijuana products and engages in such activity pursuant to a law established by a state or a unit of local government as it pertains to medical marijuana. Any entity that engages in any activity involving marijuana that is not exclusively for medical purposes shall not be covered by this provision.'\"</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  The gentleman from Ohio is recognized to explain his amendment and obviously we'd welcome any additional comments from members and certainly from the chair and the ranking member.</p><p>Mr. Joyce is recognized.</p><p>JOYCE:  Thank you. Somewhat to say we've debated this ad nauseam and I can appreciate that. What I tried to do is listen to the concerns with my brothers and sisters here. I wish and I beg your indulgence for keeping you beyond the time we should have been out of here. And I could tell you as a fellow appropriator that if every committee in this building worked as hard as we do, we'd get a lot more done.</p><p>But I certainly appreciate your staying by. We tried to engage since we passed -- it was brought to our attention that when we passed in CGIS, a criminal or the part of the withholding funds for the criminal aspect was for medical then this would be in line with the medical marijuana purposes that were being served in those states that have it, and I urge you to consider and vote for it because I believe it's appropriate for those states that have legitimately brought state medical marijuana to the forefront.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Chairman Graves is recognized.</p><p>GRAVES:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>And I want to thank the gentleman. I know he's been working on this issue for a long time. He's heard the concerns of the committee. And this is a complicated issue, but there's clearly a gray area and there's room for improvement. This is a good first step. I think he has narrowed it to a point of which he heard the consensus of this committee in a bipartisan sense. But with that, certainly it's up to the committee and your decision whether or not we include this in our final bill, but I thank the gentleman for his good work and hard work on this.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Graves.</p><p>Mr. Quigley?</p><p>QUIGLEY:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>I want to congratulate the gentleman for his persistence, creativity. It's been an interesting process in this last amendment. I just want you to know as a 10-year veteran of the Cook County Board and a staffer for 10 years at the Chicago City Council, I am home.</p><p>All that being said, I support the amendment.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Mr. Chair?</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  The gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Cole.</p><p>COLE:  Thank you and I thank my friend. It's actually been a good discussion. It had been helpful to some of us that are not as involved in this issue.</p><p>I would ask the gentleman, I know Oklahoma is listed here, we've not made the decision yet as a state to adopt medical marijuana. That's actually on the ballot in Oklahoma on June the 26th. And so, I don't want anything that would presuppose how that election will go. Literally the voters of the state have not made a decision on this yet.</p><p>So, I would ask if the gentleman would, if he could just withdraw us from his amendment and if that's appropriate, just a little second because I don't want to be voting on something that presumes my state is for something that I don't know yet how they're going to vote.</p><p>JOYCE:  If I'm not mistaken, at the moment...</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  You'll yield to Mr. Joyce, my friend.</p><p>COLE:  Certainly.</p><p>JOYCE:  And CBD oil, which is part of this, that -- it treats...</p><p>COLE:  That -- OK, that would apply.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Yes.</p><p>COLE:  OK. Well, then, I'll withdraw my concern. It was not clear to me. I thank my friend.</p><p>JOYCE:  Thank you.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion? Ms. McCollum and then Mr. Moolenaar.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  OK.</p><p>MCCOLLUM:  Mr. Chair, members of the committee, I want to compliment Mr. Joyce. I want to compliment all of us. This is very rare in Congress where we see an opportunity to come together, move something forward and address everybody's concerns and considerations, and I want to thank Mr. Joyce for working with me and the members on our side of the aisle.</p><p>Mr. Chair, I yield back.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Mr. Moolenaar, you didn't say anything about going home, did you? That was Mr. Simpson.</p><p>MOOLENAAR:  No. That was Mr. Simpson.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK.</p><p>Mr. Moolenaar?</p><p>MOOLENAAR:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>And I guess my concern with this amendment is I don't -- it's not clear to me what definition we're using of medical marijuana. Are we using a federal definition? If so, what is the definition of medical marijuana in the federal law? And if not, is each state determining their own definition of medical marijuana? It seems to me very unclear.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  You're making just general comments. You're not addressing them to...</p><p>MOOLENAAR:  Well, if the sponsor of the amendment and I appreciate the work he's done on this would answer that question, it would help me, because I cannot support something where it's referring to medical marijuana if we don't have a consistent definition in federal law what medical marijuana is.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Would you want the sponsor to yield to you?</p><p>MOOLENAAR:  Yes, please.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK.</p><p>JOYCE:  The federal treatment of marijuana is always consistent. That hasn't changed. What we've allowed to do is the states to exercise their rights and make their judgment as to what they deem to be medical marijuana. As you can see in the case that was just brought up my dear friend, Mr. Cole, that CBD oil which helps children with seizures is considered part of what Oklahoma already determines to be medicinal marijuana.</p><p>Yet, further aspects or use of that will be voted on by his people, just like I'm not sure what happened in your state, but in Ohio, the legislature did it and other states have passed it as an amendment or as somehow passed it through state referendums.</p><p>'So, each state is defining what and again, it goes back to Mr. Moolenaar, the idea that we to do the research as to what it's good for and what it's bad for. Obviously, we've heard that it's been effective in some states where it's been found to be illegal from ladies and gentlemen who served in the service for PTSD. The full effects of it are yet to be found and that's what we're trying to get accomplished here.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion? Former Chairman Mr. Rogers.</p><p>ROGERS:  Mr. Chairman, there is a reason why we have a division between authorization and appropriations. And this is one of the best examples that I can think of where we need to let the authorizers with their expertise and their experience and their time to sort through the questions that we have about this matter. This is a complicated matter, obviously. It's also significant. But this would be a very significant change in the law which I think should be done by the authorizers, not us.</p><p>Number two, I don't know how a bank would be able to tell whether or not a sack of money that comes in, whether or not that's from medical marijuana or recreational. I don't know how they would be able to decide that. And if they can't, they're subjecting themselves to possible heavy liability and I don't think it's fair for us to foist on to the banks to determine and examine whether or not the sack of cash is legal or not.</p><p>So, I would hope we would let the authorizers handle this matter and we would have a lot more confidence in the answers to the questions that people like my friend has just raised. I yield back.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion?</p><p>I have some comments. I admire the fact that Mr. Joyce is going back to the drawing board. He's drawing on some of the knowledge of some of the people in the room here who are more professionally involved in these issues.</p><p>I am extremely uncomfortable about quite honestly moving forward on this. It is complicated and there is a gray area. Obviously, if there's a desire to have a vote, I personally think that this needs far more attention. I'm very uncomfortable about moving ahead on this. Just from listening to the members, I'm concerned about it and I'm sort of inclined quite honestly to ask you to withdraw your amendment and take it on for another day. But I want to be respectful obviously of the work and thought that's gone into this.</p><p>I think it's extremely complicated and I somewhat want to associate myself with Mr. Rogers. We are moving right into the -- in the area of authorization, the very type of authorization that many people criticize us on other parts of our bills. So, I'd like -- I'd ask that you consider withdrawing your amendment.</p><p>JOYCE:  I've had the opportunity to -- been working on this since -- especially since Ohio has gotten involved into it. The answers to the questions that you raised are legitimate -- legitimate answers that we're going to find out.</p><p>I agree if Congress was doing their job. The authorized committees were doing their job. Maybe we do something. But that just hasn't occurred. And so, what we're trying to do is we're not changing the law. We're just asking for those who are trying to do what they find to be the wishes of their constituents since we are a body of representatives allowing that to take place in the -- what we would call the laboratories of our states both for medical marijuana and for democracy. They have chosen this route.</p><p>46 states have voted it in. We're just asking for them to have the opportunity if they see fit. Banks and credit unions don't have to do this. But those who want to engage in it will provide the buffer between us and the illegal remedies or the illegal dealers out there because they would have to verify that the funds coming in are coming from medical, medicinal facilities. They at least have the opportunity to engage if they want to and if they don't want to, fine. But that's what I'm asking for. That's why I think we'd like to move this one step forward and I would ask for a recorded vote -- or, no, not a recorded vote, excuse me, a voice vote because I know you want to get going, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Ms. Kaptur?</p><p>KAPTUR:  Yes. I just wanted to state something, because I'm not a doctor and I'm not a medical professional but obviously Ohio is like the number one state in deaths per capita related to opioid abuse and fentanyl, black tar heroin, all of it. And every...</p><p>JOYCE:  Will the lady yield for a moment?</p><p>KAPTUR:  I'll yield to the gentleman in a second. Every law enforcement officer I talk to, I ask about the pathway toward use. And to a person, as they have examined people who have died, there's an entry level experience and it begins with an M and it's not methamphetamine.</p><p>And so, I had the head of NIH to come in and see me because I said \"I want you to give me the best information NIH has on what happens to the brain, to the patient, and inter-generationally to their children.\" And I said, \"So, show me for long-term use of marijuana\" and I'm not disagreeing with medical use of marijuana. I voted for that in the past. But, I said, \"I want to know what happens to the brain where it happens. I want to know what happens with black tar heroin. I want to know what happens with cocaine. Every single addictive substance, I want to know what happens.\"</p><p>And thy began to show me maps of the brain and some of what they don't know which was shocking to me and they could not answer my questions definitively on long-term use of marijuana and increased amounts of use and then the pathway to something else and to look at what -- and they showed me what it takes to try to get someone off of an addictive substance like that and the numbers we have, we have approximately eight readmissions per patient that is heavily addicted, right, I'm not saying to marijuana, but other drugs that follow on and how difficult it is to try to unwind it in the brain and why. And they showed me MRIs of the brain.</p><p>What was shocking to me was after all these years, why can't medical science tell us exactly what happens to the brain and to the children of users? They can't answer that. So, it creates uncertainty in members who are not medical professionals who are trying to do the right thing for their constituents and for their country. But I just wanted to put that set of facts on the table because it made me very uncomfortable.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion on the Joyce amendment, Mr. Ryan?</p><p>RYAN:  Mr. Chairman, I'd just like to add. I guess we could probably have this discussion in Ohio and leave everybody else out of it at this point. But, I just want to make the point that one of the concerns that I think a lot of us have is that we do have marijuana getting laced with all of these other drugs in them.</p><p>And where 30 years ago someone experimenting marijuana could now face -- laced with all of this horrible stuff that we're seeing in Ohio. I believe that the process here of moving towards both medical and overall legalization will provide safer, more controlled substances just like in alcohol. There are limited levels. It's controlled. As the gentleman from Nevada suggested, it's eventually taxed.</p><p>So, I just want to support this amendment, my friend from Ohio, and say that this is complicated. But I support him because this is the kind of thing that needs to get done. These things are helping save lives, improving the quality of life, and I just -- I wanted to add my support.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Ryan.</p><p>Ms. Herrera Beutler is recognized.</p><p>HERRERA BEUTLER:  I thank the chairman and the sponsor for working diligently on this. And like I said before, I think there are good people on both sides of this issue. This is not a cut and dry issue and I associate myself with the remarks of the former chairman and the current chairman in which, hey, surprise, surprise, guys, come on.</p><p>I really strongly believe that we're making -- it seems like a small thing and it was tailored and it was crafted tightly and I know that the staff and the teams working on this did everything they could. But the reality is, we are stepping into a place that we have no business stepping into. We have not done the hearings. We have not heard the testimony. We do not have the science. We do not have the background. Good or bad, we're appropriators. And in Labor H, we've had some of these conversations and I welcome more. Let's have more. Let's do it. Let's take it on.</p><p>But at 7:45 and we got this new amendment 10 minutes ago and we're debating a major change to federal policy here and now. I'm just saying it is, because when you open this door, the way this amendment was originally crafted was including recreational use, and that was not an accident, and I'm not saying that against the gentleman who offered it. I'm saying it against the people in the industry who is behind it.</p><p>The reason it was crafted that way is to allow banking -- federal banking for recreational use. And if we don't believe that, then, shoot, we fell off the turnip truck yesterday and I love that the chairman -- or the sponsor re-crafted it because I don't think that was his intent and the lady.</p><p>I don't think they're trying to do that. But the reality is, if we open this piece and we don't have all the background behind it, man, the litigation and the gray area that we're stepping into as appropriators, not as authorizers, is too much for this hour -- at this time and hour. And again, I just plead that we hit pause.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  The gentleman from Texas, Judge Carter?</p><p>CARTER:  Mr. Chairman, I very much admire...</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Please give Judge Carter your attention. Thank you.</p><p>CARTER:  This is going to be very brief. I very much admire his tenacity, but I want to go on record to say I'm voting no.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion? Let me say -- I ask the sponsor -- I would like you to withdraw your amendment. I'm asking you again to withdraw your amendment.</p><p>JOYCE:  Well, I appreciate my former chairman and my chairman putting their foot down, I guess, and trying to make sure that I don't have enough votes to carry this forward. I appreciate the fact that you don't want to vote, but just for giggles maybe we might try a voice vote if the chairman would allow that and be satisfied with the results of said voice vote.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  I'm asking you to withdraw your amendment.</p><p>JOYCE:  I withdraw the amendment.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  Any further amendments? If not -- the amendment is withdrawn.</p><p>If not, the gentleman from Kentucky is recognized for a motion.</p><p>ROGERS:  Mr. Chairman, I move to favorably report to the House the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2019.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  The question is on the motion. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay. </p><p>In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. The motion is agreed to.</p><p>ROGERS:  Mr. Chairman, I request a recorded vote.</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  A recorded vote -- there's been sufficient hands.</p><p>CLERK:  Mr. Aderholt?</p><p>FRELINGHUYSEN:  The clerk will call the roll.</p><p>CLERK:  Mr. Aderholt?</p><p>ADERHOLT:  Yes.</p><p>CLERK:  Mr. Aderholt, yes.</p><p>Mr. Aguilar?</p><p>AGUILAR:  No.</p><p>CLERK:  Mr. Aguilar, no.</p><p>Mr. Amodei?

If members could take seats and we're going to begin. </p><p>      Again, the chair recognizes the gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Palazzo...</p><p>      PALAZZO:  Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  ... for the purpose of an amendment. You have an amendment at the desk. Would you consider it read? Yes.</p><p>      PALAZZO:  Yes, I ask that it be considered read.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Good. And you're recognized to present your amendment.</p><p>      PALAZZO:  All right.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Please give Mr. Palazzo your attention.</p><p>      PALAZZO:  Mr. Chairman, this is a simple amendment that would increase funding for community development financial institutions, otherwise known as CDFIs. Unfortunately, the committee mark proposed a $59 million reduction in funding from fiscal year 2018 levels.</p><p>      But with the help of the chairman of the subcommittee and his wonderful staff, we've been able to find a path forward. My amendment would take the first step towards returning these essential funds by reallocating $25 million to make up a part of the shortfall.</p><p>      For those of you who aren't familiar, CDFI banks take a small amount of public money to leverage private investment in communities that are traditionally underserved with historically high poverty rates.</p><p>      For every $1 of public investments in CDFIs over $12 of private investment are used to support for small businesses, create jobs and revitalize the most impoverished communities in America.</p><p>      In addition, they help put millions on the road to buying homes and establishing personal financial security. They also provide essential financial literacy education to their customers. I know many of you on this committee represent areas with high poverty rates.</p><p>      CDFIs are active in your communities and are essential sources of banking for many of our most underserved. I ask my colleagues to support the amendment and I yield back the balance of my time.</p><p>      ROGERS:  Will the gentleman yield before you...</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  The gentleman yield to the chairman, Mr. Rogers.</p><p>      ROGERS:  Will the gentleman yield?</p><p>      PALAZZO:  Yield to the chairman.</p><p>      ROGERS:  I'd like to identify myself with the gentleman's remarks. It's a great amendment. The CDFIs are vitally important in poor areas like mine and perhaps yours. And I would urge that we pass the gentleman's amendment. I yield.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thanks the gentleman.</p><p>      Mr. Graves is recognized.</p><p>      GRAVES:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to thank, Mr. Palazzo and Chairman Rogers for their positive comments. I rise to accept the amendment. These increases -- as he referenced, the CDFI funds financial and technical assistance grants by $25 million, taking it to a total level of $216 million.</p><p>      And let me remind the committee that is $202 million above the president's request. The administration initially requested $14 million. I know this committee's commitment is to rural communities throughout our country. And this will assist in that way. So I want to thank, Mr. Palazzo and his commitment here and I look forward to accepting the amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion? Mr. Palazzo, you have an -- a minute. You don't have to take it to close.</p><p>      PALAZZO:  Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. In the interest of time I will keep it brief. Please support my amendment. I yield back.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK. The question is on the Palazzo amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay. </p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it.</p><p>      Ms. Pingree is recognized, gentlewoman from Maine.</p><p>      PINGREE:  Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I have an amendment at the desk, Pingree Number 1.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Yes. Let me say that last amendment was adopted. I apologize. And your amendment is considered read and you're recognized. Excuse me.</p><p>      PINGREE:  Thank you. First, I want to thank the chair and the subcommittee for recognizing the importance of giving the executive branch authorities to combat corruption and to punish human rights abusers around the world.</p><p>      I'm pleased that the Bill adds $2 million to the Treasury Department's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, which handles sanctions investigation and enforcement. I'm also pleased that the report language stresses the need for resources to be directed towards Africa, including to address protracted conflicts in Sudan, South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p><p>      It also calls for robust implementation of the Global Magnitsky Act sanctions on corruption in human rights. Currently, there are only five sanctions investigators assigned to the team, responsible for designations and delistings for all Africa sanctions programs as well as Global Magnitsky in Venezuela.</p><p>      Too often these staffers are pulled away to deal with emerging issues like Iran. My amendment would add an additional $2.9 million to create nine new positions with the relevant offices at Treasury to accomplish this goal. Recognizing that the bill already includes an increase, I'm willing to withdraw my amendment and happy to work with the chair going forward.</p><p>      Will the chair attempt to increase -- support this increase as we move toward conference to ensure that additional resources for Treasury go to the needs identified in the report such as nations in conflict in Central and East Africa and for the global Magnitsky Act?</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  We'll -- Chairman Graves.</p><p>      GRAVES:  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Maine for raising this issue. It's an issue I think we're all committed to. Government sanctions, abuses of human rights around the world is on the rise.</p><p>      I look forward to working with you in the days ahead and also with Chairman Rogers and his subcommittee as well. But thank you, again, for your interest in this issue and your commitment.</p><p>      PINGREE:  Thank you. And thank you for being willing to work on this. Just to make sure it's clear. I have people from the Sudan, South Sudan, Burundi in my state. And often those smaller countries are the ones that never get these enforced and there just aren't enough people to do it.</p><p>      So I know you understand that. I just wanted to help make that point clear. And I hope that there is potential for additional funding if we can find a way to work in it together. And I withdraw my amendment and thank you for your consideration.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you. The amendment has been withdrawn.</p><p>      Recognize Dr. Harris for the purpose of an amendment.</p><p>      HARRIS:  Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. I have an administration at the desk.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Would you consider it read?</p><p>      HARRIS:  And yes, I move to dispense with the reading.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  So ordered and the gentleman is recognized.</p><p>      HARRIS:  Mr. Chairman, this amendment follows up on what you talked about in your opening statement, that one important program funded by this bill is the OSP, what is the school program, the school choice program in Washington, D.C.</p><p>      And it's tremendously successful. Has a waiting list. They could actually move some students into that program from D.C. public school, D.C. charter schools if they had more funding, so what my amendment does is it adds an additional $5 million into their funding, offsetting that by decreasing funding into the public school and charter school part of that program -- of that program spending.</p><p>      And that way leaves actually more per pupil expenditures for both the public school and the public charter schools while fulfilling an increase in the ability of students to engage in the OSP.</p><p>      So I offer the amendment and I will -- I've spoken to the chairman of the subcommittee. He's agreed to work on getting that funding increased, so I will intend to withdraw the amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, doctor.</p><p>      Mr. Graves.</p><p>      GRAVES:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate Dr. Harris's commitment to children and providing the best education. You're absolutely right, I agree with you on the impact this has had in the past and look forward to working with you in the days ahead to make sure we're impacting lives in a positive way as children are being educated in this area. Thank you.</p><p>      HARRIS:  So I withdraw the amendment, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK. Thank you both.</p><p>      Mr. Joyce, amendment number 2. You have two amendments.</p><p>      JOYCE:  Yes, I do. And I appreciate this opportunity to speak, Mr. Chairman. I have that amendment at the desk. And I ask...</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Would you consider it read?</p><p>      JOYCE:  ... consider as read. Yes.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  And you are recognized on your second amendment.</p><p>      JOYCE:  I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. My amendment would reverse the 2015 decision by the United States Postal Service to its lower delivery service standards for first class mail and periodicals.</p><p>      Since these standards are lower, timely processing and delivery of the mail has been significantly degraded across the country. Mail delays are dragging down our business and I'm sure I'm not alone in saying that my constituents have noticed the effects of late mail.</p><p>      I hear it all the time. Medications aren't arriving in a timely fashion. (inaudible) pay your bill on time, if the bills arrive late, so in turn they receive a late fee payment. Invitations get lost, especially to my house.</p><p>      And weekly newspapers arrive a week late. And importantly, absentee balances are arriving late and at this point it's unlikely the United States Postal Service can guarantee a timely delivery for elections this spring and next November.</p><p>      So, although, the Postal Service reduction of standards was intended to save money, the consolidation plan actually cost money for fiscal year 2015. The Postal Service spent $130 million on increased transportation costs as a result of the closures and lost a total of $66 million due to the consolidation plan.</p><p>      I therefore urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment to restore the postal standards to those that were in effect in July 1st, 2012, so all of our constituents may receive the service they depend on.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Joyce.</p><p>      Mr. Graves?</p><p>      GRAVES:  Mr. Chairman, unfortunately, I have to raise an opposition to the amendment, but not to my good friend, Mr. Joyce personally. But the amendment -- and he and I have had a discussion about this. His intentions are well, but clearly this has a direct impact on the Postal Service. I think it's a $1.5 billion negative impact on the Postal Service. I truly respect and understand the gentleman's concern about the service standards.</p><p>      JOYCE:  Thank you.</p><p>      GRAVES:  And look forward to working with you in the days ahead, hopefully along with OGR, the committee of jurisdiction. But because of the high cost of this one amendment, it's a tremendous cost I would have to oppose, the amendment only but not the gentleman.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Ms. Kaptur, I understand is recognized to talk on this amendment.</p><p>      KAPTUR:  I would like to rise in support of the gentleman's amendment and implore the chair and the ranking member to try to really look at this. I don't think that the -- whoever did this for the Postal Service was really thinking.</p><p>      And their decision to eliminate overnight service for first-class mail and even the manner in which our mail arrives now, this has never happened before but an envelope will be in an envelope. Something was ripped because it was sent up to Pontiac, Michigan out of Ohio, let's say.</p><p>      And really there have been a lot of delays. What Congressman Joyce talks about medicine that is true. And there is something really wrong with the way this routing is going and degrading our mail standards has impacted the timely delivery of everything from medicines to greeting cards, bill payments to business mail, personal letters to government correspondence, not to mention local election mail.</p><p>      The timely processing delivery of mail is really critical. And the Postal Service delivers 154 billion pieces of mail annually to 155 million delivery points, accounting for 47 percent of the world's mail.</p><p>      It's an enormous undertaking that equals over 2000 percent more in terms of business than either the UPS or FedEx. The Postal Service serves everyone and they have admitted that their decision to reduce delivery standards has cost the agency $66 million in losses due to added transportation cost, in 2015, $130 million alone.</p><p>      So this isn't even a very wise business decision. So, I would really implore the chair to keep working with us. I think we should exercise our authority. They've had trouble appointing people to the board of the Postal Service, whoever heard of that.</p><p>      And the future of our public Postal Service is threatened by delayed mail and it harms small business. It harms people in rural America. And we really have to exercise our authority here. So, I urge my colleagues to support our Postal Service, Mr. Joyce's amendment.</p><p>      And I would really urge the chairman somehow to work with us as we move toward the floor, if he can't accept this now and would urge my colleagues to vote for the Joyce amendment. And I yield back.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Mr. Quigley on the Joyce amendment.</p><p>      QUIGLEY:  Sure. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan amendment to restore mail delivery service standards to 2012 levels. Every year millions of Americans rely on the USPS to provide affordable, efficient mail delivery service. And in many communities USPS is the only affordable option to send and receive mail. Over the last year, I've received countless Postal Service complaints on slow and inconsistent mail service in my district.</p><p>      This includes delayed mail, sometimes taking weeks to arrive due to bad weather or unscheduled employee absences, wrongly delivered mail, and severely damaged mail. Americans have come to expect timey and dependable mail service. And we need to make sure that the Post Office is maintaining its high standards, therefore I support this amendment and urge my colleagues to vote in favor.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion on the Joyce amendment? If (ph) -- hearing none, Mr. Joyce has a minute to close.</p><p>      JOYCE:  Why, thank you, Mr. Chairman. U.S. mail system is an important part of our nation's infrastructure, connecting people of all communities with the institutions that serve them. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. And I thank you, again, Mr. Chairman. And yield back the balance of my time.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK. The question is on the Joyce amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.</p><p>      Got you. You find this humorous. I think the ayes got it. The amendment is approved. At least you got one approved today.</p><p>      JOYCE:  I know it's much to your chagrin, sir.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Mr. Price?</p><p>      Mr. Price is recognized for the purpose of an amendment.</p><p>      Mr. Price has an amendment at the desk.</p><p>      PRICE:  I have an amendment at the desk. I ask that its reading be dispensed with.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Considered it done. The gentleman is recognized.</p><p>      PRICE:  Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment offered in partnership with Mr. Serrano that would restore net neutrality protections that entrepreneurs, small businesses, and the public rely on over the use of internet.</p><p>      I am sure all of us here know that net neutrality is a term used to describe the principle that all content travelling over the internet should be treated equally by the owners of the networks providing internet service to customers.</p><p>      Since its inception, the internet has allowed anyone with an internet connection to access or to provide information, goods or services on a relatively equal footing. This open design has been largely responsible for the revolutionary impact that the internet has had on global commerce, innovation and information sharing in so many other aspects of our daily lives.</p><p>      Yet, in recent years, some companies have openly defied these bedrock open internet principles. There are well-documented examples of internet service providers deliberately throttling broadband speed when consumers try to connect to certain applications, blocking content from competitors and providing preferential treatment to their own content.</p><p>      So in 2015, after several years of legal battles and careful deliberation, the FCC issued its revised open internet order. These rules enshrined in federal regulation the basic principle of net neutrality, that the companies that provide internet service to consumers to offer that service in an open and nondiscriminatory manner.</p><p>      This principle is supported by the major tech companies, entrepreneurs, small businesses, research universities, librarians, local governments, a large majority of Americans, nearly everybody, in fact except the companies that provide these commercial internet services.</p><p>      And yet, despite receiving millions of consumer comments supporting net neutrality, the FCC suddenly voted last year to overturn net neutrality, eroding the principles of openness, innovation and fairness that are the cornerstone of the internet.</p><p>      Citizens are paying attention to this issue. I expect all of us can attest to that. I received 14,000 letters and e-mails on this subject in this Congress alone. On Monday, these FCC net neutrality protections officially lapsed. The Senate has already voted to overturn the FCC's net neutrality repeal. And this amendment presents us with the opportunity to do the same. So let's put our constituents, small businesses and entrepreneurs first by restoring net neutrality. I urge support for this amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Price.</p><p>      Mr. Graves?</p><p>      GRAVES:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would have to rise in opposition to the amendment. I think we can all agree on the desire for a free and open internet. And we all do, in fact, it is. I just heard that the gentleman received 14,000 e-mails in opposition to the rule. Apparently, the internet is open and it's free. And people are expressing their opinions. That's what we want and that's what we desire.</p><p>      But this amendment will just restore things back to the old rule and prohibit FCC from issuing any other rules. In fact, it's circumventing the whole process of public comments and the openness and transparency that we all desire.</p><p>      The Senate has taken up this issue. I suspect the House may take it up as well. This is not the right committee or jurisdiction in which to do that. The Internet has been the biggest driving force for innovation in our lifetimes.</p><p>      This is no time to mess with it in a hearing such as this. It's doing well. Just check your e-mails. You're getting them. So, Mr. Chairman, with that, I'd have to rise in opposition to the amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Ms. Lowey?</p><p>      LOWEY:  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of my friend's amendment. This week despite overwhelming public support, the FCC's repeal of net neutrality protection officially went into effect.</p><p>      It's an unfortunate step as we know net neutrality protects small businesses, entrepreneurs, students and consumers by ensuring a level playing field online. Paid prioritization means the end of a free and open internet.</p><p>      Today, we have an opportunity to protect net neutrality, ensure that our constituents choose what websites and apps they can access online. We owe it to our constituents to do everything in our power to fight for their open access.</p><p>      Please, vote for the amendment. I yield back.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentlewoman.</p><p>      Mr. Serrano, a cosponsor of the amendment, is recognized.</p><p>      SERRANO:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      I want to thank my good friend from North Carolina, Mr. Price, for working on this issue for so many years. On the net neutrality, we do not see a stifling of creativity in innovation like we were told by the opposition.</p><p>      In fact, it did the opposite, ushering in a spirit and wave of innovation because more people were able to access an internet that treated all content and data the same. This amendment would simply reinstate the 2015 net neutrality rules that have kept the internet open and fair for all Americans.</p><p>      It would prevent our constituents from having to pay more to access their favorite websites and streaming services. It will prevent students from having educational content blocked by their ISPs, therefore jeopardizing their learning experience.</p><p>      And it would prevent small businesses from having their websites throttled and face delays in trying to showcase their products for consumers. While major service providers like Comcast and AT&amp;T have recently announced that they have no plans to prioritize certain web traffic or create paid fast lanes, what is to stop them from changing their minds in the future and raising prices on consumers? Let us not forget that the first priority of any cooperation is to make money. But it should be the responsibility of Congress and the federal government to protect all Americans' ability to access a resource that has become so engrained in our culture and economy.</p><p>      That is why the principles enshrined in the 2015 net neutrality rules are so important and why tens of millions of Americans strongly support these principles. This is a matter of fairness and equality.</p><p>      I ask my colleagues to put the interests of families, students, rural and urban Americans and small businesses ahead of corporate interest. I urge a yes vote on the Price Serrano amendment. Thank you.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentleman for his comments.</p><p>      I see Mr. Kilmer and then Mr. Cartwright, Mr. -- OK.</p><p>      Mr. Taylor, I guess you...</p><p>      TAYLOR:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just a couple of things. Number one:  obviously, net neutrality in the way it's been framed is inaccurate and deceiving in many ways. And it's kind of embarrassing in some respects as well.</p><p>      When you look at -- talk about corporate interests and one of the issues here is blocking and throttling, the only folks doing blocking and throttling now are the big tech companies and, of course, they support net neutrality, which would put the ISPs who are not just your Verizons and Cox and stuff like that but 3,000 of them across the nation that provide low cost internet to rural areas, like some in my own district.</p><p>      And they, of course, would support pushing them to be regulated under a 1930s scheme. So think about that for a second. Companies that are in the internet being regulated under a 1930 scheme, does that really make any sense? I don't think so.</p><p>      So, of course, the tech companies would support that because they don't want them to get into the data business, which is highly profitable. Look, I think everyone here there's an equality of desire not to have -- to have a level playing field, to not have blocking, to not have throttling. But also to regulate the internet under the same ecosphere, so -- ecosystem, excuse me, so under the FCC, everyone being regulated under the same rules.</p><p>      And having that opt -- the opt-in -- and our people would have the ability to opt in, and then perhaps look at potential soft regulations on data, on who owns your data. So this is a larger discussion that has to happen, but not here in this committee. So I would oppose it. Thank you.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Kilmer is recognized and then Mr. Cartwright.</p><p>      KILMER:  Thanks. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I support this amendment; I support a free and open internet. But we had a debate on the -- on the last bill about the inability of Congress to step in in an area where it ought to use some of its authority. That was with regard to authorization for use of military force.</p><p>      But I think this is another example where Congress has sort of dropped the ball. You know, this is larger than just one issue. Congress should look at holistically reforming our telecom laws because the last major piece of telecom policy that passed out of Congress was in 1996.</p><p>      You know, 1996, less than a quarter of Americans were online. The ones that were used Netscape and a dial-up modem. When they got their e-mail, it said, \"You've Got Mail.\" You know, that was seven years before, MySpace, a PalmPilot was thought to be cutting-edge technology at that time.</p><p>      Someone who used the term smart phone at that time was describing something that weighed more than a pound and was the size of a brick. You know, but because Congress hasn't acted on this, agencies have tried to pick up the slack and that's not the way to go. Rather than seeing this issue decided by agency action, I'd like to see Congress step up and set some rules of the road and pass legislation that comprehensively reforms our telecom and technology policy. To me, it's a competitiveness issue. I think you've heard folks on both sides of the aisle with different perspectives on this, but make the same point that this is important to our businesses, this is about jobs...</p><p>      TAYLOR:  Will the gentleman yield?</p><p>      KILMER:  Yes. Sure.</p><p>      TAYLOR:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate the sentiment and I agree with the gentleman that we should -- that Congress should take this up and look at it holistically. But the gentleman mentioned the antiquated action that was taken -- you know, 1996 I guess prior to MySpace. But does the gentleman believe that we should look at regulating a -- you know, the ISPs under a 1930 scheme?</p><p>      KILMER:  So just reclaiming my time. In my view, the issue needs to be decided by Congress rather than just yielding to the executive. I think it's time for Congress to catch up with the rest of the country, bring our laws up to speed with our technology. And I support the amendment but I also support the Congress stepping in and doing something about it.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK. Further discussion? Mr. Culberson's recognized.</p><p>      CULBERSON:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, support net neutrality. I want to prevent the internet service providers from throttling access to services for any customer, but I have a real concern this amendment as chairman Graves said, particularly the way it's drafted, that the amendment would prevent the Federal Communications Commission from reissuing a rule in substantially the same form. I'm not sure what substantially means. What -- how is that defined?</p><p>      So I'm afraid that the -- while we are in agreement I believe with the spirit of what Mr. Price is doing, the amendment itself is not effective, unenforceable, undefinable, and I'm not sure how you'd ever make any sense out of what this amendment proposes to do. So I hope we'll find another opportunity to restore that neutrality but not do it here and do it in a more thoughtful, careful fashion.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentleman from Texas for his remarks. Mr. Cartwright from Pennsylvania is recognized.</p><p>      CARTWRIGHT:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I speak in support of this amendment and I do thank Representatives Price and Serrano for their hard work on this matter. I also wish to associate myself with remarks of Mr. Kilmer. I think the free exchange of information and ideas is an essential principle in this country.</p><p>      Every single one of our constituents wants net neutrality because they want to be assured they have access, choice, and freedom to get the internet content that they want. As such, I think the American people and the companies affected by this issue deserve some certainty on the matter.</p><p>      That's why I hope, as Congressman Kilmer said, that, as a Congress, we can soon work in a bipartisan fashion to address this issue legislatively to let our voters know we are listening to their concerns and we are actively engaged on this issue. I urge support of the amendment. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion on the amendment? Mr. Pocan and then Ms. Lee.</p><p>      POCAN:  Sure. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I think the argument by the subcommittee chairman on this was that so many contacts -- 14,000 contacts proves it works. Well, the rule change just took effect this week so it did work, you're right.</p><p>      The previous system worked very well. In fact, I had 12,983 contacts as of a month ago that were against the ruling and zero, zero for it. Now, to be fair, I did have a telecommunications lobbyist from my district stop by the other day, and he asked to be counted, so I am now up to 12,983 to 1.</p><p>      But I think this is very similar in many of our districts. My small business owners don't want us to throttle the internet, my farmers don't want to have fast lanes, and the consumers don't want to. So this is something that the Senate took care of. Now it's in the hands of the House.</p><p>      We could do a discharge petition, which I hope many of you will sign on to, but I think this is one where people are way, way, way ahead of us on this, and I strongly support this amendment. I thank the gentleman who introduced this and I hope we'll pass it.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank the gentleman for his comments. Further discussion? Ms. Lee is recognized for some comments on the amendment, the Price amendment.</p><p>      LEE:  Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me just associate myself with all the remarks that have been made and say a couple things about our democracy, really, in terms of the blow it's taken as it relates to the FCC rules mandating net neutrality.</p><p>      This really is equal treatment of all content on the internet, and it was overturned by this new rule imposed by the chairman. Mr. Price's amendment is extremely important because it nullifies this new rule. Internet providers will be able to provide websites from loading or slow them down simply because they disagree with what the website says.</p><p>      TAYLOR:  Will the gentlelady?</p><p>      LEE:  Yes, I'll yield.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Gentleman's -- gentlelady's yielded.</p><p>      LEE:  Yes.</p><p>      TAYLOR:  (inaudible). Will the gentlelady agree -- I think everybody agrees about the blocking and throttling and not stopping websites just because you don't agree with the content from up. Will the gentlelady -- that a lot of that -- some of the content you're speaking of is also from not ISPs, but on social media platforms. Will the gentlelady agree that those should also be regulated in the same ways so as to have that information come out and not be blocked or throttled, which does not -- does not address this amendment?</p><p>      LEE:  Let me reclaim my time please. This is really about freedom of speech and freedom of expression. OK? From entrepreneurs to advocates for social justice, the internet has been a powerful tool for everyone, especially communities of color, to revitalize our neighborhoods and draw attention really to the injustices in our society in order to change them.</p><p>      And so this new repeal of the open internet rule -- it really kills this free expression and innovation and it kills it online. And it shouldn't be a partisan issue. It's opposed by 86 percent of the public, Democrats and Republicans understand what's at stake. So I urge a yes vote on this amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Ms. Lee. Mr. Ruppersberger has been very patient.</p><p>      RUPPERSBERGER:  Thank you. First, I support this amendment but the one thing that's become very clear to me is this whole process in what we're dealing with now needs to be dealt with with our Congress. The American people clearly feel passionately about this issue and we need to come up with a bipartisan legislative solution, so there is no ambiguity on the regulatory side, and future administrations continue to ping pong back and forth. Democrat and Republican, this issue is not good for American consumers or American businesses. Yield back.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank the gentleman for his comments. A minute to close, Mr. Price is recognized.</p><p>      PRICE:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's interesting to see members raise the bugaboo of regulation and as though there was any option here. We're talking about one FCC regulation versus another. OK? So make your choice.</p><p>      It's the FCC regulation enacted after great care -- with great care in 2015 that, in fact, protected that level playing field that we all want to see. And I agree with the chairman, it's no time to mess with the internet.</p><p>      The messing with the internet with this new regulation that overturns that carefully arrived at rule. Many members in this room have embraced the Congressional Review Act in dealing with regulations that they find objectionable over this last year. This takes the form of exactly that.</p><p>      This is a -- this is a Congressional Review Act type amendment. It reflects what was done on a bipartisan basis in the Senate. It is something where the House needs to step up to the plate. And, for that reason, I urge the support of this amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Price. The question is on the Price amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.</p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not agreed.

If not, the clerk will tally.</p><p>      On this vote, the ayes are 22, the nays are 29. The amendment is not adopted.</p><p>      Mr. Joyce, amendment number 1, you're recognized to present your amendment.</p><p>      JOYCE:  Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have an amendment at the desk and ask that it be considered as read.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  It's considered read and the gentleman's recognized.</p><p>      JOYCE:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My amendment -- my amendment simply put prohibits penalization of financial institutions solely because the institution provides financial services to an entity that involves a properly-registered state-compliant marijuana-related company.</p><p>      To be clear, the business or entity must be operating within the laws of the state to avoid penalization. This is not about whether or not one approves of marijuana. This is about public safety and financial transparency.</p><p>      While 46 states, 3 territories and the district now allow cannabis-related businesses to operate, our banks and credit unions cannot provide financial services to them. Strangely enough, ATMs are allowed inside dispensaries so one may withdraw funds from their bank to make a purchase in cash.</p><p>      The situation is untenable. No industry can operate safely and transparently without access to banks or other financial institutions. To ensure these legitimate going concerns are safe, legitimate, and operating completely within the laws of the licensing state, we must allow them access to the financial system. I urge support of my amendment in the interests of financial transparency and public safety and reserve the balance of my time.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentleman. Chairman Graves.</p><p>      GRAVES:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think I'll just leave it at this. I look forward to watching the committee hash this out for a little while.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Mr. Quigley.</p><p>      QUIGLEY:  I was tempted to say the opponents of this are dazed and confused, but I'll hold back. I do rise in support of the Joyce amendment. It is ridiculous that at a time when the majority of states allow some form of recreational or medical use that these businesses are forced to operate as all-cash operations, having no choice but to pay their taxes, employees' salaries, and rent with bags of cash.</p><p>      When I think of an all-cash operation, I think of the mob or a cartel, not a legal, regulated business. We are effectively telling these businesses that they should operate like the black market, encouraging obscurity rather than transparency.</p><p>      Additionally, by denying legal businesses access to banking services such as credit card processing and deposit revenues, a public safety risk is created. Recent headlines demonstrate this risk, reporting of robberies, home invasions, and other threats associated with possessing large sums of cash.</p><p>      Regardless how each of us may view the legalization of marijuana, I think we all agree that financial institutions should be allowed to serve businesses that are operating legitimately. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, which respects states' rights and prioritizes public safety.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion on the Joyce amendment? I'm seeing a number of hands. Mr. Stewart is recognized.</p><p>      STEWART:  Mr. Chairman, I do look forward to this, as the subcommittee chairman said a robust debate on this, but I'll be very brief. First, I'd like to point out there's some confusion and it's brought into this debate, there is a meaningful difference between medicinal marijuana and recreational use of marijuana.</p><p>      That's not apples and oranges. That's apples and dinosaurs. These are very, very different issues. And don't conflate the two by saying, \"Well, some of these are used by those who are supporting the medicinal use.\"</p><p>      I'm talking about the recreational use, which is, by the way, the vast majority of the use and the revenue generated by this. So ask yourself these very simple questions. Do you think it's a good idea generally to promote the use of -- recreational use of marijuana in our society? If you think that's a good thing, then support this. </p><p>      Do you think it's good for our society generally to have more and more marijuana use, or less? If you think the answer is, \"More is better,\" then go ahead and support this amendment. If you think it's -- you want to legitimize the use of marijuana to our kids -- if you think that's a good idea, then support this amendment.</p><p>      If you think it's a good idea to signal to the business community that having a marijuana dispensary is on par with having a car dealership or selling tires or any other business, then go ahead and support this amendment.</p><p>      I, on the other, think we should discourage that type of use and one of the ways we discourage that is making it harder for these businesses to carry out their business. And if they're using all cash, then I say, \"You know what? They knew that going into this. Let them deal with it. Let's not help them and make it easier for them.\" And I yield back.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion? Ms. Lee is recognized.</p><p>      LEE:  Thank you very much. I rise in support of Mr. Joyce's amendment. This is a bipartisan proposal. It would prohibit federal agencies from unduly penalizing financial institutions for providing basic banking services to legitimate cannabis businesses in states where it's legal.</p><p>      This amendment would ensure that legitimate business owners can comply with state regulations and help ensure that regulator and law enforcement officers can hold businesses accountable. And for the 46 states and jurisdictions that have passed cannabis reform laws, this amendment would provide important financial certainty to business owners, employees, government agencies, and financial institutions.</p><p>      Now, regardless of how you feel about the legalization or decriminalization of cannabis, I think we all can agree that the state has made their own decisions to take action and to pass a range for various laws pertaining to medical or adult use cannabis.</p><p>      It's become increasingly apparent that there is a need to align federal and state laws when it comes to addressing the banking crisis, which it is. Last year, the legal cannabis industry was worth around $10 billion but is largely forced to operate exclusively in cash.</p><p>      These outdated and predatory policies are a major obstacle to these small businesses and only serve to undermine their financial security. Enforcing small businesses to operate as all-cash businesses, these policies make the jobs of state regulators and tax collectors unnecessarily difficult.</p><p>      And it leaves these entrepreneurs, their employees, and the business itself vulnerable to dangerous criminal targeting. It's a matter of public safety and economic necessity. In fact, in California, a state treasurer has called for action to on the cannabis banking industry saying we all have an obligation to take reasonable and necessary steps to protect our citizens and ensure businesses operating legally within California are engaged fully in our banking and commerce -- excuse me, system.</p><p>      And I've visited small businesses like these in my home district in Oakland, California and I know how that impacts these acts -- excuse me, I know how it impacts the lack of access to financial services.</p><p>      Using these services will allow entrepreneurs and small businesses to ensure their financial security, grow their business, and better serve their communities. So I urge my colleagues to listen to legal and job creating businesses in your own districts where these laws have been passed and support this amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Ms. Lee. Dr. Harris is recognized.</p><p>      HARRIS:  Thank you very much. You know, I'm going to speak in opposition to this amendment. You know, the last amendment we had dealt with medical marijuana. This is the incrementalism we're seeing. You know, when we -- when we restrained the Department of Justice a few weeks ago from enforcing federal law, it was medical marijuana.</p><p>      This amendment is not about medical marijuana. It's about big marijuana businesses. You know, there's a reason why there are big dollars involved and lots of cash, because drug dealing makes a lot of money and it involves a lot of cash.</p><p>      And no matter what we want -- no matter what other name we can call it, marijuana is a controlled substance, it's schedule one, it's drug dealing under federal law. And the gentleman from Utah is absolutely right, what we're doing, we pass this amendment so we're condoning drug dealing for recreational use.</p><p>      And there may be small businesses involved, some of them maybe, but as soon as you the remove the financial obstacles, this is going to be big, big business. There are going to be big growers involved, big distributors involved. Pharma, move over, because now you've got a whole other industry dealing with drugs.</p><p>      But this is just not my opinion. The other thing, by the way, is, you know, where do we stop with schedule one substances allowing banks to do it. What if, you know, some states -- I understand Oregon is considering legalizing heroin. So we're going to remove -- we're going to allow the banks to participate in that as well?</p><p>      It's a slippery slope we don't want to go to. We really should have the argument about legalization first. But you don't have to take my opinion. I've got two letters here -- and I'll read briefly from them and then I'll ask they be entered into the record -- from the National Fraternal Order of Police -- represents 355,000 police officers in the United States. </p><p>      Asking this committee -- and, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, you know because you got this letter today, asking this committee to please not pass this legislation. They say, quote, \"Public safety is threatened by the growing use of marijuana nationwide, with the greatest negative impact in states that no longer comport with existing federal law.\"</p><p>      It's exactly what this -- who this amendment addresses. So this is from the National Fraternal Order of Police, but, if you don't believe National Fraternal Order (ph) of Police, the Major Cities Chiefs Association (sic) -- these are the police chiefs of major cities -- they say the facts are undeniable. The legalization of marijuana has only hindered local law enforcement's efforts to keep communities safe. </p><p>      These are the people that our -- that men and women and families in this country trust to keep our community safe. Mr. Chairman, they plead with this committee not to pass this -- not to pass this amendment. Look, at some point, we might get to the point where this -- where this is in order. I think it's way premature. I will oppose the amendment. Thank you. I yield back.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Harris. And Ms. Pingree from Maine is recognized.</p><p>      PINGREE:  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to speak in support of this bipartisan amendment. I disagree with my colleagues. I don't think this is how you -- this is not related to how you feel about legalizing marijuana.</p><p>      In my state in 2016 with referendum, our voters voted to legalize marijuana. We already had medical marijuana. Then last month our legislature passed and even overrode a governor's veto statutory and regulatory framework.</p><p>      So soon in our state, we're going to have businesses official operating selling marijuana as a business just as you would sell any legal product, because it is legal in our state. But these entrepreneurs are going to end up with one hand tied behind their back, unsure where they can get access to capital to start or expand their business and use the banking system.</p><p>      I just had a visit from the Maine credit unions and they told me they are eager to help but they're worried about the risks of lending if federal regulators interfere based on federal law. The Joyce amendment would eliminate this risk, provide protection both for lenders and the businesses who need capital to serve their customers.</p><p>      I agree with many of my colleagues who mentioned that this will help law enforcement. Without being able to use the banking system, you have businesses who are storing enormous amounts of cash from marijuana transactions and this is already happening with medical marijuana. It's unsafe. It's a recipe for abuse. </p><p>      Access to regulated financial services will provide some peace of mind to businesses customers and the public. I just want to say further, I think one of the reasons that many of us are making basically exactly the same argument is because it is ludicrous to have a legal business that cannot use the banking system.</p><p>      It promotes crime, it makes it difficult for these businesses and I wholeheartedly support this amendment for the benefit of my states and other states where this is legalized and hope my colleagues will do the same and I yield.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentleman -- gentlewoman for her remarks. Mr. Rogers, former Chairman Rogers, is recognized.</p><p>      ROGERS:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Might I ask, Mr. Joyce, what is the significance of the states that are mentioned in your amendment?</p><p>      JOYCE:  I'm sorry, sir.</p><p>      ROGERS:  What is the significance of mentioning the states that you have in your amendment?</p><p>      JOYCE:  Because each one of the states...</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Could you just repeat his question? Because I'm not sure everybody heard it. The significance of the states...</p><p>      JOYCE:  The fine chairman asked what's the significance of the states that are listed in the amendment, and that is because only the states that have this -- some form of either medicinal or medicinal and recreational use -- are the ones that are listed there.</p><p>      There are other states that have made this choice not to be involved and so therefore, you're trying to -- you're not bringing them into the system because they're not part of it. Only those states in which the state either legislature or the vote of the people has enacted the laws to allow a cannabis industry into their state.</p><p>      ROGERS:  Well, for states that do not want to legalize recreational marijuana, the involvement of the financial community, the banks, is one of the last remaining things that a state has to keep from legalizing marijuana in their state if that's what they want to do, because the bank by handling the cash from an illegal act in many states is an aider and an abettor. And can be and could be charged and convicted of conspiracy to violate the state law or the federal law. Always bear in mind, the federal law even today does not legalize recreational marijuana.</p><p>      States, many states, some states have done the same. If they're not able to use the financial institution feature they were talking about, the states lose the last -- one of the last possible ways to keep from being legalized over their objection. And I don't think we should be telling a state what they should do about this matter.</p><p>      The -- I'll close with this. All of the polls and all of the information and research that we've seen says that marijuana is the stepping stone particularly for young people toward opioid abuse, which boils my blood. I yield.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  The gentlewoman from Kentucky, Ms. McCollum is recognized. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>      MCCOLLUM:  Thank you. I support the Joyce amendment which prevents funds from being used to penalize financial institutions that provide banking services to state legal marijuana businesses.</p><p>      Now, you have the 46 states that have reformed their marijuana laws to allow for some form of medical or adult use. My home state of Minnesota for the gentleman from Utah recently legalized some forms of medical marijuana for use under certain circumstance, under a doctor's use.</p><p>      And I'm going to read from the Minnesota Department of Health. For patients to receive medical cannabis, the law requires a licensed health care provider to certify that the patient has one or more of the qualifying conditions. A qualifying condition that your health care practitioner must certify that you have one of the qualifying conditions -- conditions.</p><p>      And it's all spelled out here. The most compelling people to testify in Minnesota, we have very strict controls on how the medical marijuana is used, were parents of children with epilepsy. And what a game-changer it was for these children. And their parents were going to give up their jobs and sell their houses and go to states where they could have access to this transformational change for these young adults.</p><p>      And there's other medical conditions in Minnesota in which it is prescribed and used too. So denying a state-sanctioned business that's operating entirely within the laws of their state and to keep them from banking is just irresponsible and it's a threat to public safety.</p><p>      Why would we want a doctor who is legally prescribing under certain circumstances which is heavily regulated in Minnesota to be forced into a cash-only environment? We should be encouraging law-abiding citizens running small businesses to work with inner banking systems, not putting them at risk, not putting communities, not putting families that they serve in danger. This amendment for Minnesota and for many of us is not about legalizing marijuana. It is about safe banking. With that, I yield back.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks. </p><p>      So Sheriff Rutherford is recognized and then, Mr. Amodei and any others, please do indicate. Yes, Mr. Ryan. Sheriff, you're recognized.</p><p>      RUTHERFORD:  Mr. Chairman, thank you. I rise to speak in opposition to this bill even though I think it's well-known that I support investigating and research for determining the efficacy of marijuana for medical purposes.</p><p>      In fact, I was very involved in the state legislature in Florida a few years back when we actually had Charlotte's Web, which is a marijuana extract that was actually passed by a very conservative quite frankly Republican House and Senate in the state legislature. So I'm very much in favor of looking at marijuana from its medical use.</p><p>      However, I also understand that from my time as sheriff that national -- transnational organizations, these cartels face two problems. Number one is bringing drugs into the country across our border. And the second is moving large amounts of cash back across the border.</p><p>      And that is an opportunity as well to intervene in the drug trade affecting our country. And so one of the things those in the Justice Department have begun to see is a lot more attempts by drug cartels to actually move their money through wire transfers and banking operations, which is why DEA and others have begun to really focus on that as an element. And I'm really concerned about marrying together through these banking processes illicit and legal marijuana funds. So, for that reason, Mr. Chairman, I oppose the bill.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  I think the gentleman for his remarks. Mr. Ryan is recognized.</p><p>      RYAN:  (inaudible) banks, credit unions looking to Congress for reassurance that if the state can do business (inaudible).</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Ryan. Mr. Amodei is recognized.</p><p>      AMODEI:  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  And then I see Mr. Aderholt and...</p><p>      AMODEI:  Briefly and I want to thank my colleague from Ohio who's taken the first step but by coming from a state which regulates a few vices -- the record should reflect that nobody laughed when that last statement was -- there are some things that we should talk about here. It's like, OK, you want them to bank, great. That's fine with me. I get the public safety stuff, I get all that stuff.</p><p>      But guess what, there's that regulatory piece and that law enforcement piece which if you're a regulated vice, guess what, those regulators and those law enforcement people get to come in and see your accounts any time they want.</p><p>      They don't need to play hopscotch, they don't need a warrant. They want to make sure that you're doing business as that legally state licensed deal and that you haven't got folks from other countries in the hemisphere doing things. That's missing. That's very important.</p><p>      And let me just tell you one other thing and I know it's not within this committee's jurisdiction, but if you're going to let these folks access that banking system, which is regulated state and federally, I can assure you that whether it's the Buckeye State or the whodunit state on the list, they're getting tax revenue from it.</p><p>      And so to just give it away for no tax revenue, if we've learned anything in terms of alcohol and other vices, tobacco as an instance, then guess what, alcohol is taxed federally and tobacco is taxed federally.</p><p>      Why would this be exempt? And this bill, this amendment, which I want to support but I ain't giving it away for nothing. So with all due respect, if we really want to do it and I want to do it, we ought to get some tax revenue out of it, learn those lessons with tobacco and alcohol. And, by the way, we ought to be able to check on the records any time we want so all this sanctity and virginity in the state stuff is confirmed by the feds. Thank you. Good evening. And God bless vices.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Oh, boy. Mr. Aderholt I believe wishes to be recognized.</p><p>      ADERHOLT:  Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  In the wake of Mr. Amodei's remarks.</p><p>      ADERHOLT:  yes, I just -- well, I'll be brief. I just wanted to say certainly we don't oppose the person bringing the amendment but we do have -- there are some concerns that I think many of us have about the amendment itself.</p><p>      I just received a note from the sheriffs from Alabama and they had indicated to me they're very much concerned about the amendment. And so I would say that the timing on this is definitely not right and we need to hold off on this amendment, in all due respect to its sponsor. Thank you.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK. Anything -- yes, Ms. Kaptur is recognized.</p><p>      KAPTUR:  Yes, I just wanted to say -- put a couple facts out there. Former Speaker of the House John Boehner, according to press reports. who was from the state of Ohio as some people might be -- remember -- he's changed and now serves on the board of a company called Acreage Holdings -- a company that cultivates, processes, and dispenses cannabis, OK? </p><p>      So it's just interesting some of the things that happen around here. I don't know what that means. That's what I read in the newspaper. I haven't had a chance to ask him about that.</p><p>      The other thing I just want to mention -- and I know Congressman Joyce is very careful is his wording, but, you know, in my district, they're cutting marijuana with black tar heroin and fentanyl now. People are dying of it. And I don't know how you separate this.</p><p>      I don't know how you -- I voted for medical marijuana, thinking it would be tightly regulated, and I'm not sure what we have right now in our country. All I know is, in Ohio, we have such an epidemic. I just left another sheriff in one of our counties and he needed money for more officers and all of the deputy chiefs, everybody that's worked in -- I'll tell you the county, Lorain County, Ohio, they were asking me for help from the federal government to hire more officers just to deal with the -- what is occurring in that one location, and that's only one of 88 counties in deep trouble because of addiction and deaths related to these substances.</p><p>      So I just -- I'm uncomfortable -- I want to support my colleague from Ohio and he's probably very well-intentioned. I just think that some of this has implications beyond what maybe some of us even completely understand and with some states having some laws and other states not having those laws, pretty soon we're going to get an amendment up here to have state reciprocity just like we do with guns. If you can, you know, conceal and carry in Indiana, then can you walk it into Ohio or vice versa, well, what's the difference with this?</p><p>      So I'm just -- I am -- we have an epidemic in this country and I want to trace the money. I want -- I want to do that, but I am very -- and you want it to be in sunshine, right? You want to do what's right. I just am not sure this amendment at this time, maybe, and it doesn't say medical marijuana in the -- in the amendment. And for me, that is a -- that is a troubling factor. So I just wanted to put that on the record and I thank you and I yield back.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Ms. Kaptur. Mr. Jenkins would like to be recognized. You are recognized.</p><p>      JENKINS:  Would the sponsor of the amendment yield?</p><p>      JOYCE:  Absolutely.</p><p>      JENKINS:  Thank you. I'm really struggling with this because I'm a states right guy, but I'm also concerned about the slippery slope and I know West Virginia is listed on this and West Virginia has legalized medical marijuana non-combustible, so very narrow sliver, but already since that's passed there's been legislative efforts at the state level to expand that and I think every state wherever you are in the spectrum, your state is probably going to be pushing for expansion at some point in time, number one.</p><p>      I assume once your state is named here and it says whatever the state laws, as the state law expands, so too would, obviously, the financial institution's ability to service that, so you're not locked in to whatever the state of the law is in your state at the point of passage of this.</p><p>      So if you went from medical marijuana to full recreational, this would still give carte blanche ability for financial institutions without concern of penalty service the recreational even though you maybe medical today only</p><p>      JOYCE:  Correct.</p><p>      OK, secondly, are there other regulatory aspects we know just as Dr. Harris referenced a week or two ago DHA in the limited area of medical marijuana. While, this is not limited to medical marijuana, this is dealing with financial institutions, are there other regulatory entities at the federal level that the marijuana industry is concerned about and we're going to be -- we're taking care of financial institutions today, are there other folks on down the pike that are going to be given labors potentially if we should so choose.</p><p>      JOYCE:  I can't answer that with specificity because I have not looked through every single regulatory agency to figure all that out.</p><p>      JENKINS:  We're taking care of law enforcement, we're taking care of financial institutions of this in the past, are there others in the queue potentially?</p><p>      JOYCE:  One thing that was brought up at the last hearing we had in which we talked about the law enforcement aspects in the CJS hearing and I fully agree with my friend from Maryland, Dr. Harris, there needs to be research. We need to know in states where you have -- where now it is legal, what is the amount that someone can operate machinery under? At what point they come to work? You're going to have other going concerns that have people employed by them, at what point do they have to worry that this person shouldn't be operating machinery, this person shouldn't be behind the desk, shouldn't be operating a computer?</p><p>      We need to have the research. As we've talked about before, it's sort of a chicken and egg thing because right now we're denying state universities and others the ability to do the research until we pass something. And obviously, as an institution, we don't have the guts to get this done and this absolutely changed my mind similar to my dear friend John Boehner who has said his thinking has evolved as well as others here that it was Sam Farr, a member of this committee that was telling me that in California he had a fine V.A. hospital. The V.A. hospital was not allowed to give medicine that would treat PTSD for our soldiers and had found to be effective, was not allowed to do it in his hospital. And the more I think about it, and the more I've watched, we continue to grow the industry, but we continue to act like it doesn't exist.</p><p>      Well, you know, we talk about illegal drug dealers. This takes them off the street. This -- this takes it -- yes, it does legitimize it, but we have to think of prohibition. How did that work? I know we have a thing and I agree completely with Mr. Amodei with the fact that we should have these financial institutions, everything should be above board, everything should be transparent, every member of the 40-16th that has voted for his should know exactly how much is being sold and track it like they do right now from seed to sale and be able to know exactly what this is, and so deal with it accordingly.</p><p>      And we consider the -- we consider the...</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Mr. Jenkins, this is your time. Are you yielding? Did you yield?</p><p>      JENKINS:  I yield back. Thank you.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Ms. Herrera Beutler is recognized.</p><p>      HERRERA BEUTLER:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I think the sponsor of this amendment is touching on just how difficult -- I shouldn't say that, just how complex this issue is. There are so many far reaching facets. I -- I, you know, I'm from a state that has legalized recreational marijuana, and I wish we hadn't. I did a call with my school superintendents, my police chiefs and my sheriffs, I wanted to talk about the state of our schools and our kids and what they thought would help.</p><p>      And I fully expected them to start the whole conversation off talking about guns and they spent the first 10 or 15 minutes talking about the harm that the use of recreational marijuana has done in our schools with our kids. I was flabbergasted. And now, I recognize this is with regards to medical or medicinal marijuana, and that's a subject, I can't remember who said it, you know, it's one I support. You know, I -- I have talked to parents who have very young children who suffered major seizure disorders who have found types or use for medical marijuana and obviously not smoking it, but there's a way to extract and they've seen a benefit. And boy, if I was that mom, I'd do everything possible, right?</p><p>      So I get that and I support that. But my concern with this amendment is we're doing it here and now, at this hour, with this short amount of time, without the input of all of our colleagues when this is an issue that is so much bigger than -- we had a one-year appropriations bill. There are so many valid points on this. </p><p>      And I just -- I -- the reason I am not going to be able to support it is because I'm too -- until you've sat next to a drug addict at a roundtable who has looked at you and says (ph), \"The biggest mistake you folks ever made was legalizing recreational marijuana,\" and I'm sitting there going, \"First of all, I didn't do it\" -- but when his heart is breaking, he's telling you that -- it just causes me to want to pause this effort here.</p><p>      Now, there are good people on all sides of this. I've talked with my credit unions too, but I don't think that this is the place to do it. And I'm not saying that as a punt. I'm saying I want to get this right. So with that, I unfortunately oppose the gentleman's amendment and I yield back.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentlelady for yielding. Judge Carter of Texas is recognized for time.</p><p>      CARTER:  I apologize for my voice today, but I want to say if there's $900,000 in cash in a marijuana shop, garage some place because they can't get in the banking system, then there's $900 million worth of marijuana cash somewhere in the cartel system. The cartels run the marijuana in Mexico in a gigantic way and Mr. Harris is right, the second problem they have is what to do with cash?</p><p>      They have the same problem with that marijuana shop guy's got. Now, if we make it legal for people to do it in the United States, then they're either going to offer some major incentives to get illegal marijuana trade into our banking system or they're going to do what they do down on the border, they'll cut somebody's hand or leg off to convince them to put marijuana in their system. And dollars don't look any different -- $900,000 don't look any different whether it's legal or illegal. I think this is something we need to think out.</p><p>      There's a reason we have laws to restrict cash deposits, it's so we can find illicit drug trade. That's why we have that law. If we are waiving it, we're running into a problem, and law enforcement will not like it. I yield back.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Yield. The chairman has asked for time. I yield some of my time to you.</p><p>      GRAVES:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And first, let me just commend the committee, this is one -- been one of the most respectful in-depth debates I think we've -- we've had as a committee and it's -- it's really compelling and amazing arguments on both sides. The one clarity that I pulled out of all of these is that there is not lack of support for the concept of -- of bringing what is known as a gray area in the financial market to something of a little bit better understanding, nor is there a lack of desire to help those who truly need and desire to have assistance through medicinal purposes.</p><p>      But I do sense that this committee is not ready to take the leap to the next step. And I -- I respect that. I know we've debated the previous amendment and the -- and the other bill, I think it was Mr. Culberson's bill, that was medicinal only and I think we've embraced that in a different -- different fashion.</p><p>      So Mr. Chairman, as I -- as I look at this, I think this -- this committee has done remarkable here. I'd point out a couple of things, if these were to be adopted, this would be a one-year solution potentially if it is enacted into law and that could create some more disparity and uncertainty as we look ahead. But let it be known that this committee really cares about our constituents and if we could provide assistance medicinally, I think I've heard that here.</p><p>      And Mr. Joyce said if this were not to prevail today, I hope you'll continue the effort and maybe in incremental steps, but we have recognized a tremendous class and that's the states versus the federal government. And they're out there on this. And we must come together and sort through this and work through this together.</p><p>      But let me just thank each and every committee member who chose to voice your opinions. This has been a fantastic debate and discussion. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Reclaiming my time. I am -- basically I think at times a facilitator and mediator as chairman of this committee, but I have definite opinions about the legalization of marijuana. In New Jersey, we have medicinal marijuana and certainly we understand this as it described the plight of sometimes children and adults in the most excruciating pain that have been -- that should have access whether they're veterans or non-veterans, I think they basically should have access.</p><p>      But I visit about 90 schools a year, juniors and seniors in high school, some elementary schools, and the question is always, they say what are we going to ask this dinosaur? Do you believe in the legalization of marijuana? And I say, you know, I know in this room that you are often in middle school, eighth grade, and juniors and seniors in high school, you're adult enough we hope to make the right decisions.</p><p>      But what worries me and I say to them quite blankly, I worry about the availability of your younger brothers and sisters and I'm sympathetic to the plight of the banking industry and people who have large cash, you know, sitting in some safe or under the counter and I understand that this is -- this is the outgrowth of this legalization movement and maybe I'm on the wrong side of history.</p><p>      But I feel extremely uncomfortable without moving ahead with this amendment. I think it's just that the tone of the discussion here, I feel that some of you share those same concerns and I think it's about time we call for a vote and I don't think there's any further, I get the last word. You have the last word, a minute to close, Mr. Joyce.</p><p>      JOYCE:  I thank you very much Mr. Chairman. And I certainly appreciate the -- the debate we had here. I certainly wish we could have a debate like this on the floor. The sad part about it is that sometimes we conflate the different issues, and, if you would take the opportunity to see how these agencies and dispensaries are working, one has to show their license. They have to be over 21. </p><p>      It eliminates this black-market trade. It keeps it from getting to kids which is important for all law enforcement. I certainly spent 25 years making that happen. I know you have your ideas, but, you know, we got to talk about reality. Kids are going to find marijuana just like they find alcohol and other things.</p><p>      But the only way we can do it is bring the -- the -- bring this money into the system so we know what we're dealing with and be able to talk apples to apples why we're doing this. And just so I may provide a little bit of insight here, the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, said just this afternoon -- said marijuana use is permitted in (ph) some states, but not by federal law. He said the disparity puts federal regulators in a very difficult position and the Fed would love to see this hazy issue clarified.</p><p>      The idea of putting this out today was to try to remove this cloud, was to try to bring the transparency that my friend, Mr. Amodei, has talked about and tried to put it out there in those states which this has been legislated or voted on by the will of the people. We represent the people, I may not be in favor of some things, but, you know, when the people want it, we should represent their interest.</p><p>      With that, I would ask each and every member here, I would urge them to support my amendment and I surrender the balance of my time.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK, the question is on the Joyce amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those who oppose, say nay.</p><p>      In the opinion of the chair -- thank you so much. Yes, the opinion of the chair -- I -- I think the nays have it. </p><p>      Any further amendments? Yes. Mr. Cartwright?</p><p>      CARTWRIGHT:  Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, amendment number 1. I ask that it be considered read.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Considered read. The gentleman is recognized.</p><p>      CARTWRIGHT:  Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Quigley and all the committee staff for your hard work on this bill. I offer this amendment that would simply strike a harmful provision from the bill that limits investment transparency. The provision would, if enacted, ban the Securities and Exchange Commission from enacting a rule requiring publicly traded companies to disclose how they spend shareholder funds on political contributions.</p><p>      I think such a prohibition on SEC's rulemaking ability goes against the idea of free markets. Free open markets work because of disclosures. Disclosures are the foundation of our financial system. Disclosures keep the market transparent. Disclosures separate us from rigged stock exchanges where the government picks where you get to invest the way they do in China. Disclosures ensure investors know where their money goes.</p><p>      And this is not unwarranted or unwanted rulemaking. More than 1.2 million investors and citizens have called for the SEC to go forward with this disclosure requirement, banning the SEC from doing its job to regulate the stock market and protect investors' interests has no place in the appropriations bill or any bill for that matter. Without this amendment, investors will be kept in the dark as to where their money is being spent and as to what policies it ends up supporting.</p><p>      The great American marketplace of ideas demands more transparency, not less. For these reasons, I urge everyone to support my amendment. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the -- the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his remarks. Chairman Graves?</p><p>      GRAVES:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Unfortunately, I have to rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. The SEC is certainly not an expert at all in this area of campaign finance nor is it set up to be an expert in campaign finance or disclosure whatsoever. We have a commission for that at the FEC. They do -- they do a great job. They're very zealous I might add and they've got exclusive jurisdiction over all the campaign finance laws.</p><p>      Now, I'd point out for the committee, the bill does not preclude, prohibit any public company from reporting their political spending if their shareholders choose. So an opt-in is certainly available. I appreciate the gentleman's concerns in this area. We've had discussions in the past, but with that, I'd have to oppose the amendment. Thank you.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Mr. Quigley is recognized.</p><p>      QUIGLEY:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of this amendment. As Justice Brandeis said, the sunlight is the best of disinfectants. In recent years, the Supreme Court decisions like Citizens United and McCutcheon have cast a dark shadow over democracy allowing the voices of every day Americans to be easily drowned out by corporations, shadowy front groups and a handful of billionaires. Just look at the language embedded every year since 2016 in this bill.</p><p>      The ability of corporate executives to spend company resources for political purposes raises significant concerns. Without transparency or disclosures, corporations are free to spend funds invested by shareholders without accountability. Reducing the role of corporate influence in our electoral process requires a comprehensive approach and that includes reinstating the SEC role to require publicly traded companies to disclose their political spending. I urge the adoption of this amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion? If not, I look to the gentleman, for a minute to close, from Pennsylvania.</p><p>      CARTWRIGHT:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's true, under Citizens United for better or worse, the Supreme Court of the United States has told us that money is speech. And if we're going to give the megaphone to corporations, shouldn't we also give investors the right to know what they're lending their voices to when they invest in their corporations?</p><p>      Keeping this provision in the bill is simply a handout to corporate interests at the expense of investors and open markets. We owe our constituents open, transparent markets and the protection that inherently follows with them. Please join me in supporting transparency by voting yes on this amendment. I yield back, and thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentleman. The question is on the Cartwright amendment. All of those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.</p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not agreed to. </p><p>      Further amendment? Ms. Lee is recognized.</p><p>      LEE:  I have an amendment at the desk. This is Lee amendment number 1.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Would you consider it read?</p><p>      LEE:  Unanimous consent to dispense with the reading.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  We're pleased to recognize you.</p><p>      LEE:  Thank you. Mr. Chairman, this is very simple. It would strike Section 810 of the bill which is yet another Republican ideological rider. This policy rider which bans federal funds appropriated for the District of Columbia to pay for abortion services is a clear violation of the District's home rule and is dangerous to the health of the women in the District of Columbia.</p><p>      Year after year, I have stood in this committee along with our ranking member to highlight just how detrimental this policy rider really is. No other jurisdiction or state is told how to use its own locally raised revenue, yet this committee is prepared to once again vote to force Congress's view on the District of Columbia. We should never be in the business of denying a woman's reproductive health coverage because of her race, her ethnicity, her source of insurance, income or where she lives, yet that's exactly what this policy rider does.</p><p>      It specifically targets women of color and low-income women in the District. In fact, 93 percent of the Washingtonians whose access to abortion care is restricted by this ban are women of color and we know that a woman who seeks an abortion but is denied is more likely to fall into poverty than one who has access to their full range of reproductive choices including abortions.</p><p>      We already know that since 1973, the very terrible Hyde amendment has prohibited use of federal funds to provide or promote abortion services. Now, my personal view is that the Hyde amendment should be overturned, but the unfortunate fact of the matter is that the removal of the D.C. abortion ban would not alter the current prohibition against federal funding of abortion services. And of course, this rider is just another example of members of Congress trampling over the rights of D.C. residents and denying D.C. taxpayers the freedom to make their own decisions, their own decisions about how local funds should be used.</p><p>      So for many reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Ms. Lee. Chairman Graves.</p><p>      GRAVES:  Mr. Chairman, I'd rise in opposition to the amendment. I know the gentlelady raises this issue each year, but D.C. local funds limitation has been in place every year, every year since 1996 with the exception of one year. And I would I guess commend to the committee here that we should make it two years. Let's -- let's keep this streak going, let's keep it going and I'd oppose the amendment and ask the committee to continue with the current position of the bill.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentleman. Mr. Quigley is recognized.</p><p>      QUIGLEY:  Having a right and being able to access that right are two very different things. The sad truth is that women with resources can choose whether or not to grow their families while women without resources are left with no choice or they struggle to make ends meet.</p><p>      Choice is the heart of this issue, but it's not a choice for us to make. It's the choice for women and their families, a choice between women and their doctors. I never understood this contradiction in my mind with being a conservative. I always felt that we are being told that it's not for government to tell people what to do, how to handle their own situations and their personal situations.</p><p>      This is as intimate a decision as there is and you're intruding upon that. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentleman. Ms. DeLauro is recognized. And then I see some additional hands. Mr. Price and Ms. Clark and others.</p><p>      DELAURO:  Mr. Chairman, I speak in support of the amendment put forward by our colleague, Congresswoman Lee. It strikes the language. It bans the use of the District of Columbia funded abortions. In 2011, the majority successfully prohibited the District of Columbia from using its own locally raised revenues to cover abortions for women living in the city.</p><p>      According to the family, the Kaiser Family Foundation, the ban impacted the health care choices of almost 60,000 women in 2013 alone. The residents and government of Washington, D.C. should be able to determine how they want to use their local resources without congressional interference just like any other state. In fact, it strikes me as ironic that while this majority continually claims to support the sovereignty of local governments in health care, they seek to restrict the District of Columbia's ability to make its own decisions about its own funds.</p><p>      To this end, this is about a right for women to make their own decisions with their family and with their doctors, with clergy. It is also about trusting women to make these decisions. I share this belief with the majority of the American people who support Roe v. Wade and the right to a safe and legal abortion in this country, but the majority would rather take us back to a time when women could not make their own health care decisions.</p><p>      We must promote and protect the rights of every woman, every family, every American to make their own family planning decisions. Congresswoman Lee's amendment would do so. It would help reverse the majority's attack on women's rights and the -- the autonomy of the District of Columbia. I urge my colleagues to support it.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you Ms. DeLauro. Ms. Lowey is recognized, the ranking member.</p><p>      LOWEY:  I rise in strong support of this amendment. Yet again, the majority is wasting time in an attempt to prevent the District of Columbia from using its own funds to safe legal health services. If you want to dictate what should be done with local dollars, you ought to run for the D.C. council, but for now, none of us were elected to force a hyper-partisan ideologically driven agenda on the residents of Washington.</p><p>      Let me be very clear, lack of public funding for health services creates a grave financial burden for already struggling families. It forces women to make an impossible choice between paying out of pocket for reproductive health care services or for basic necessities like groceries for their families. This restriction frankly is a slap in the face to all District residents, many of whom are sitting in this room as members of our staff.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Ms. Clark is recognized.</p><p>      CLARK:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yet again, here we are talking about attacking women's rights instead of listening to what women and families actually need. Women in my district need safe and respectful work environments where they're paid equally for equal work. Women in my district need affordable child care so they can make decisions about their work-life balance that's what -- that's what is about what's right for their families, not what they have to do out of necessity.</p><p>      Women in my district need affordable quality health care, but what we're talking about today is a bill that tells women they don't have a right to plan their own families and that politicians should have more of a say in their health care decisions than they do. Women in my district deserve to make their own medical decisions and so do the women of Washington, D.C. You should not be telling women that being a D.C. resident means you sign away your right to make private choices about your own health care. Congress should not be placing itself between women and their doctors.</p><p>      The District of Columbia has the right to use its own locally raised funds to offer necessary health coverage to its citizens. I adamantly support the gentlewoman from California's amendment to strike this regressive and inappropriate restriction. I urge my colleagues to get back to work for women and families and support this amendment. I yield back.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Ms. Clark. Mr. Price and then Ms. Wasserman Schultz will be recognized.</p><p>      PRICE:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm happy to join with Ms. Lee in sponsoring this amendment. It would remove the poison bill rider that denies coverage for the full range of reproductive health services including abortion care for women enrolled in D.C. Medicaid.</p><p>      Federal insurance coverage of abortion care is already restricted, except in limited circumstances. I personally take issue with that policy, but our amendment addresses an even more prescriptive rider, because currently all 50 states have the autonomy to determine how to spend their own money, their locally raised Medicaid dollars, including whether or not this non-federal funding could be used for abortion coverage.</p><p>      Frustratingly, Congress routinely denies that option for Medicaid beneficiaries in Washington, D.C. This restriction overrides the will of D.C.'s own elected officials, withholds comprehensive health care coverage for women in the capital. The D.C. abortion ban disproportionately affects women and families of color, immigrants, youth and low-income individuals many of whom already have a hard time accessing equitable and competent care.</p><p>      So we need to end this policy that treats Washingtonians differently than all other Americans. The members of the House Appropriations Committee were not elected to represent D.C. residents and we shouldn't be in the business of legislating their health care. Every woman deserves to make their own health care decisions without congressional interferences and that should be regardless of her ZIP Code or her insurance coverage. I urge the adoption of the amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Price. Ms. Wasserman Schultz is recognized for time.</p><p>      WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Study after study shows that placing strict limits on abortion coverage can have a profound impact on those who already face significant barriers to care, such as low income individuals, immigrants, youth, women of color and transgender and gender non-conforming individuals.</p><p>      According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 59,800 non-elderly Medicaid enrolled women whose access is affected by this ban resided in D.C. in 2013. In 2011, of the Washingtonians whose access to abortion care is restricted by the local funds ban, the vast majority, 93 percent, were people of color. To make matters worse, these studies have also shown that poor women are often forced to use money that would have been spent for rent, utility bills, food and clothing for themselves and their families in order to be able to pay for abortion services. In fact, almost 60 percent of Medicaid-eligible women reported that paying for an abortion presented serious burdens compared with only 26 percent of women not eligible for Medicaid.</p><p>      Forcing those who already face obstacles in accessing health care to make choices like whether to pay rent or obtain medically necessary reproductive health care is not only wrong, it is shameful. Sadly, the D.C. ban is not only bad policy, but it also violates the spirit of the Supreme Court's decisions in Harris versus McRae which clearly asserted that state funds used to provide abortion services for low income women is a state, not federal decision.</p><p>      For a party that prides itself on support for strong and local governments, my Republican colleagues sure have a funny way of showing it. The District of Columbia should have the same ability to control its own tax powers as the 50 states including having the option to support -- to provide support to low income women with its local tax dollars. Consistently we hear a states' right argument from republicans, unless it's inconvenient to their -- their alternative points of view.</p><p>      There's no consistency here on the part of the party and this damaging language in this bill that's carried every year except one should be dropped because it shouldn't have ever been carried in the first place. I yield back.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentlewoman. Ms. Lee, a minute to close.</p><p>      LEE:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, let me just say since it's been offered in place since 1996 really doesn't make it right, and it is discrimination against women in the District. D.C. is the only area in the country with this federally mandated prohibition, why should we force this on the District of Columbia? </p><p>      I have to ask you, my colleagues, do you want us to interfere in your local districts and legislate what they can use their local money for? It's their own money. It's not federal tax dollars. Their duly elected representative who is here with this, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton -- she has spoken out strongly against the imposition of nonresident members of Congress' ideology -- placing your ideology on her district, even when some of those same members attempted to silence her voice.</p><p>      A woman in the District of Columbia struggling in to make ends meet must have the ability to make important personal decisions with her own physician based on what is best for her family and her circumstances. It's time that Congress stopped playing politics with D.C.'s home rule and with the health of its women in residence and in this ideological posturing, you really wouldn't want me coming into your district advocating a policy to get your districts to stop using their own funds for what they want to use them to, this is downright wrong.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentlewoman.

The ayes are 22, the nays are 29, 29, the amendment is not agreed to. We have six more amendments to do. Mr. Ryan is recognized to -- for his amendment.</p><p>      RYAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  It's considered read?</p><p>      RYAN:  You can read it, because it's only a line.</p><p>      CLERK:  \"An amendment offered Mr. Ryan. In section 818, strike 'none of the funds' and insert 'none of the federal funds.'\"</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Gentleman is recognized.</p><p>      RYAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Section 818 is a new provision prohibiting federal and local funds from being used to carry out the Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act or RHNDA, a law passed by the D.C. Council in 2014. RHNDA protects employees working in the District of Columbia from workplace discrimination based on their reproductive health decisions and those of their spouses and dependents.</p><p>      Under this law, an employer cannot fire a woman for having an abortion after a rape or for using in vitro fertilization to address infertility. It prohibits an employer from reducing the salary of a man who uses condoms for family planning or a parent who buys birth control for a son or daughter in college.</p><p>      As written, section 818 prohibits the District of Columbia from using any funds including local funds consisting solely of local taxes and fees to carry out RHNDA. This provision represents the sixth attempt by Congress to undermine this nondiscrimination law since 2015, but the first time this RHNDA rider has been included in the underlying financial services appropriations bill.</p><p>      Unlike the D.C. Council, no member of this committee or this Congress was elected to legislate on local D.C. issues. The inclusion of section 818 is undemocratic, a violation of the majority stated belief, and local control, and autonomy, and yet another insult to D.C. residents, some of whom are staffers, their spouses, and their children. To remedy this, my amendment inserts federal before funds, restoring the District of Columbia's ability to spend its local funds to carry out RHNDA's mission.</p><p>      In anticipation of possible objections to my amendment, let me be clear about what RHNDA does not do. It does not discriminate against churches or religious organizations. It applies to all employers, and the law protects religious liberty by ensuring every employee in D.C. can follow his or her religious or moral beliefs when making health care decisions without fear of retaliation. </p><p>      It does not force employers to cover elective abortions in their health insurance plans. RHNDA is clear on this. The law states this section shall not be construed to require an employer to provide insurance coverage related to a reproductive health decision.</p><p>      There's absolutely no ambiguity here, it does not require pro-life organizations to hire individuals who advocate for abortion, it protects employees decisions regarding their own reproductive health, their beliefs about reproductive health are outside the scope of the law, organizations can still make employment decisions based on religion and political views, and employees must be willing to carry out employers' missions and directives.</p><p>      In short, RHNDA is not about religious liberty, it's about basic workplace fairness, employees should be judged by their employers solely on job performance, not on the reproductive health decisions they make outside of work. I strongly urge my colleagues to support my amendment and allow the District of Columbia to spend its local funds protecting employees from workplaces.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentleman for his comments. Mr. Graves is recognized, the chairman.</p><p>      GRAVES:  Mr. Chairman, the majority opposes the amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Mr. Quigley is recognized.</p><p>      QUIGLEY:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I've spent nine and a half years in this city for some period of time, it's not Chicago, but it's is a place I would live, I think the only reservation I would have is that it's a jurisdiction largely controlled by an outside government, and that's us.</p><p>      Every year we mark up this bill, we discover how many of our colleagues aspire to a seat on the District of Columbia City Council by asking not to carry out that urge at the expense of the right of the people of the District to govern themselves as they see fit and to spend their tax dollars as they see fit. I urge the support of this amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion on the Ryan amendment? Otherwise, the gentleman has a minute to close. It's on, Ms. Lee. Excuse me. Apologies.</p><p>      LEE:  Yes.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Ms. Lee is recognized.</p><p>      LEE:  Once again, I rise in strong support of Congressman Ryan's amendment, once again, another anti-D.C. rider, another anti-woman rider. This is a new rider that prohibits the District of Columbia from implementing a law, the Reproductive Health Nondiscrimination Amendment Act of 2014, that the D.C. Council passed unanimously. This rider is about violating D.C. Home Rule and protecting women's access to care. All women, regardless of their ZIP Code, their income, or their employer, should have the ability to make private decisions regarding their health care. D.C.'s bill simply ensures that employees can make their own reproductive health decisions without interference or fear of retribution from their employers.</p><p>      Unfortunately, my colleagues will stop at nothing -- short of nothing to limit women's access to reproductive health care and to trample on D.C.'s autonomy. Members of Congress who are not accountable to the residents of the District of Columbia should not interfere with D.C. local laws.</p><p>      Once again, it's hard for me to imagine why in the world you continue to do this. These are ideological attacks on women's health. We have no business getting into the business of the District of Columbia. They passed their legislation unanimously. Again, you don't want me coming to your districts, advocating for something to -- you know, that you may not like, that they're trying to do with their own local funds.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Ms. Lee. And Mr. Serrano is recognized.</p><p>      SERRANO:  Very briefly. For years I've said this and I haven't said it recently. Washington, D.C. has become the playground for so many members of Congress to do whatever they want to do. </p><p>      In other words, when they go back home to get asked, \"How do you feel about school vouchers?\" \"Well, I'm for them.\" \"You are?\" \"Yes, in Washington D.C.\" \"How do you feel about marijuana?\" \"I'm against it.\" \"You are?\" \"Yes, in Washington D.C.\" \"Abortions?\" \"Well, I'm against them.\" \"Where?\" \"In D.C.\"</p><p>      And D.C. becomes the place that gives you people cover for saying they are for or against certain issues and they use it as if there was no respect for human beings that work and live in that community called Washington, D.C. And I think it's time that we realize that we have to treat people with dignity and respect, but it will fall on deaf ears and we will continue to do this.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  No further discussion. Mr. Ryan has a minute to close.</p><p>      RYAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to remind my colleagues what this amendment is about. It's not about religious liberty. It is not about abortion. It's about basic workplace fairness. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support my amendment and allow the District of Columbia to spend local funds protecting employees from workplace discrimination. Thank you.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you. I thank the gentleman. The question's on the Ryan amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.</p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not agreed to. </p><p>      Further amendments? Ms. Kaptur has an amendment.</p><p>      KAPTUR:  Yes, I have an amendment at the desk, please.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Would you consider it read?</p><p>      KAPTUR:  I would ask it be considered as read.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  The gentlewoman is recognized to speak on her amendment.</p><p>      KAPTUR:  Yes.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you.</p><p>      KAPTUR:  My amendment essentially would strike Titles 9, 10 and 11 in our bill, which comprise about a good 30 percent or more of the bill itself, starting on page 168. And what this comprises is the -- what's called The Choice Act, I would like to call it the Wrong Choice Act, and it involves financial institution regulation.</p><p>      The last time I looked, the financial institutions, especially the Wall Street based ones are doing quite well in our country. All their profits are up and just coincidentally, they happen to be the largest contributors both to presidential and congressional elections. Isn't that something? So, what this section that I'm seeking to eliminate does, it authorizes on an appropriation bill at a very egregious level. Unbelievable.</p><p>      I like to call it the Wrong Choice Act, has been passed on the floor of Congress several times, so why do we need to stick it in an appropriation bill? And I would really ask the majority, you think you're really going to sneak this past the Senate? So, it must be being put in here for some other reason, and I can only imagine what that might be. This bill keeps coming back from the dead.</p><p>      So, I just have to say this for the record because I have served here for a while, and had to bear in my state the cost of Wall Street egregiousness, and I go back to the financial crisis of 2008, when Wall Street gambled away the individual fortunes of millions and millions of Americans amounting to well over $12 trillion, and I think only one fellow went to jail up there. His initials were B.M. But the rest of them didn't, and our people are still digging out of what happened.</p><p>      Now, this Wrong Choice Act functionally kills the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which I know a lot of people don't like. Let me just put it in perspective. So, they took away $12 trillion from the American people and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau got back $12 billion, $12 billion. And people make a big deal out of that, it is nothing compared to what was taken away from people in my state and other places. Now, just let me read a couple words, I can't give you every page, but what this actually does, it changes the law regarding angel investors. I hope everybody knows what those are:  registration exemptions for mergers and acquisition brokers. How interesting. This is also -- shell companies, a shell company that is formed by an entity that is not a shell company, you define that for me.</p><p>      How about truth in lending, changes in that? Exemptions -- really interesting use of words in several sections. And I just would say to my colleagues, you may not remember what collateralized debt obligations were or derivatives, but I sure do. And you'll give them an inch, and they will take not just a mile.</p><p>      And so, I would urge my colleagues to take this authorizing language, and it's just not two words. Mr. Joyce's amendment was fairly concise. But they throw out the emergency mechanism that prevents future taxpayer bailouts throughout the emergency mechanism, why is that a good thing? Let me just put on the record also that the individuals who are pushing these kinds of changes are doing very well. Jamie Dimon, the CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, just in his salary, earns $28 million a year.</p><p>      James Gorman of Morgan Stanley makes $23 million. Now this doesn't include all their holdings, this is just the raw salary. Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs makes $22 million a year. Brian Moynihan of Bank of America makes $20 million a year. All these folks who are involved in what went wrong in 2008, they still got their jobs and they're doing even better.</p><p>      Meanwhile, the median household income of our country is up 5.3 percent since 2008, barely above the 2008 inflation level after adjusting for inflation and inequality in our country continues to grow. In 2007, the top 1 percent of people in our country owned 34 percent of wealth, they now own 39 percent.</p><p>      In 2007, the bottom 90 percent owned 29 percent of this country's wealth, now they all under -- they own under a quarter, 23 percent. So, Mr. Chairman, I ask that Titles 9, 10 and 11 be struck from this bill, I think it's the right thing to do, especially because it is massive authorizing on an appropriation bill. It is inappropriate in an appropriation bill. And I yield back.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Ms. Kaptur. And Chairman Graves.</p><p>      GRAVES:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I, you know, I, you know, rise an opposition, and at first I have to say, I'm really surprised that Ms. Kaptur wants to strike these sections. This is truly the heart of this bill with a bipartisan heartbeat, what's unique about these sections is that the majority of all the provisions were bipartisan through the House, either passed with 250 or more votes many at 270, 80, and 90, and a lot of them were just suspensions that were overwhelmingly supported by the House. So, while the talking points that recited there might not match completely with what we have here, this is the most bipartisan section that I would ask this committee to keep intact in object this -- object to this amendment. So with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Graves. Mr. Quigley, do you seek time or...</p><p>      QUIGLEY:  No.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Mr. Yoder, excuse me. Mr. Yoder is recognized.</p><p>      YODER:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Chairman Yoder.</p><p>      YODER:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Frankly, Mr. Chairman, I'm stunned and out outraged that my colleague from Ohio would bring this amendment. What -- one of things she's striking here is the E-mail Privacy Act, which has passed the House unanimously in the last Congress and this Congress. And striking that amendment would allow the government to have unwarranted warrantless searches of Americans' e-mails without their permission, without their knowledge, and continue this horrible practice from a 1986 law that allows the government to spy on American citizens without their knowledge or permission.</p><p>      The House has spoken on this twice, and spoken on it in the last Congress unanimously, it spoke on it this Congress unanimously. And so, it's the kind of bipartisan legislation that Americans want us to pursue, and allowing agencies to continue to violate our Fourth Amendment rights to me is unconscionable.</p><p>      And so, voting for Ms. Kaptur's amendment would be a vote against the -- voting for Ms. Kaptur's amendment would be a vote against the Fourth Amendment, a vote against the civil liberties or constituents, a vote against technology, a vote to support the Senate's practice of sitting on our House bills and never moving them, and worst of all, it's a vote against bipartisanship on this unifying legislation. I'd like to think Chairman Graves for his working with us to get this in the legislation and his team, and I would strongly oppose the Kaptur amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion on the Kaptur -- and Ms. Lowey is recognized, the ranking member.</p><p>      LOWEY:  I just rise in strong support of my friend's amendment. Just Title 10 alone -- Title 9 alone is nearly half of this bill. It is filled with a garden variety of financial services authorizing language. Its inclusion highlights real friction simmering within the majority. With two chambers of Congress and the White House under Republican control, why does the majority feel compelled to push so much authorizing language through this committee?</p><p>      Let me be clear, I voted for some of the bills included in Title 9, several have even passed the House on a voice vote. But last time I checked, this is the Appropriations Committee, not the Financial Services committee, this language along with Titles 10, and 11 -- and 11 simply have no place in our bills, so let's do the right thing, leave it to the authorizers, strike this language for the -- for the amendment. Thank you.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentlewoman for her comments. Any further comments? If not, Ms. Kaptur has a minute to close.</p><p>      KAPTUR:  Just remember 2008. Remember collateralized debt obligations, and remember derivatives. And there were little words put in bills like this that ended up being time bombs that practically brought the country down. </p><p>      So I would say for the gentleman that is -- would like to bring up the e-mail issue, bring it up to the floor in an authorizing capacity, don't put it in an appropriation bill. It's amazing to me that this entire -- that's why I say there must be other motivation for this in an election year, that this would be stuck in an appropriation bill that we want to pass in order to make sure that the government of the United States operates. I yield back. Please vote for the Kaptur amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Ms. Kaptur. The question's on the Kaptur amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.</p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not adopted. </p><p>      Further amendments? Ms. Wasserman Schultz and then Mr. Serrano after that.</p><p>      WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have an amendment at the desk and I ask that it considered as read.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  It's considered read. We're pleased to recognize you.</p><p>      WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I offer this amendment with Ms. Lee to strike section 112 of the bill. As it would diminish the vitality of our nation's religious organizations and violate our First Amendment rights. Section 112 which my amendment strikes would water down a provision in the tax code, sometimes referred to as the Johnson amendment, which protects the integrity and independence of charities and houses of worship by ensuring that they do not endorse or oppose political candidates.</p><p>      One of the characteristics of American religious institutions that has made them so sacred is that they are separate from governments and separate from campaign politics. If Americans want to get involved in partisan elections, we know how to do that, but what we are seeking when we attend church, synagogue, mosque, temple, or any other house of worship is quite different.</p><p>      This distinction has long been reflected in how our law treats religious institutions differently than political institutions. To preserve their sacred place in American society, houses of worship must stay above the political fray and refrain from endorsing candidates for political office. Current law strikes a careful balance, and it's important to emphasize what houses of worship with tax exempt status can do, they are permitted to advocate for policies that are consistent with their values, and they can help their members become engaged in the political process.</p><p>      They can organize public debates on any issue, organize candidate forums, conduct voter registration drives, get out the vote, and help transport people to the polls. They just can't tell people who to vote for. It's no surprise that a wide array of religious organizations and faith leaders support the Johnson amendment and oppose section 112, out of an understandable concern that political parties and candidates seeking power would be empowered to use their congregations as tools and pressure them for endorsements.</p><p>      And I ask, Mr. Chairman, that letters signed by thousands of these concerned and respected organizations, which I know I brought to the committee with me -- so I want to actually, visibly show you how many we have received, that these thousands of concerned and respected organizations have sent letters to the Congress, urging that this action be dropped from the bill.</p><p>      Make no mistake:  Weakening existing law would have the unintended consequence of dividing congregations and opening them up to political wheeling and dealing. I think we can all agree that Americans have had enough of political partisanship, they don't want more of it, and they certainly don't want it in their houses of worship where so many seek refuge from the tumult and chaos of their day to day life. As if gutting these protections for houses of worship weren't bad enough, this provision also likely violates our First Amendment rights.</p><p>      While current law applies to all tax exempt nonprofit organizations, section 112 would only applied to houses of worship. Specifically, section 112 makes it nearly impossible for the IRS to investigate claims that houses of worship have violated the law. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was designed to prevent exactly this kind of religious favoritism.</p><p>      Regardless of our political stripes and colors, and regardless of our religion, no one wants our houses of worship to be torn apart by partisan campaign politics. And no one wants their First Amendment rights torn away from them. As people of faith, we cannot allow this effort to politicize our sanctuaries of worship to move forward. And as federal lawmakers, we have a responsibility to ensure equal justice, liberty, and protection for all people. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on my amendment. And I yield to my colleague, Ms. Lee.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK. Ms. Lee, you...</p><p>      LEE:  Thank you very much. And as a co-sponsor of this amendment, I wanted...</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  You have -- you have about a minute or so, because if you're -- you can claim your own time in a few minutes.</p><p>      LEE:  OK.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Would you rather claim your own time?</p><p>      LEE:  I'll claim my own time.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for her comments.</p><p>      WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Thanks.</p><p>      LEE:  Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Chairman Graves.</p><p>      GRAVES:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The majority...</p><p>      LEE:  Of course.</p><p>      GRAVES:  ... opposes the amendment from the gentlelady from Florida.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK. Mr. Quigley.</p><p>      QUIGLEY:  (inaudible)</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Would you yield to...</p><p>      QUIGLEY:  (inaudible)</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Ms. Lee and then we're going to go to Mr. Culberson, so.</p><p>      LEE:  OK. But thank you very much. Let me just associate myself with the remarks of my colleague Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz, and thank her very much for introducing this amendment again. As she mentioned, section 112 of this bill is designed to give religious organizations in violation of the First Amendment special tax benefits and privileges that are unavailable to other nonreligious organizations. Sadly, this provision would make it very difficult for the IRS to investigate religious organizations if they are in violation of the law. Now, as a person of faith I can attest that I do not want my place of worship to become overly politicized. And other Americans agree as you have just seen.</p><p>      According to public opinion polling, more than seven in 10 Americans oppose allowing places of worship to endorse political candidates. Americans and our Constitution are on the right side of this issue, our committee should follow suit and support this amendment. In order to protect the integrity and independence of houses of worship and faith based charities, and the separation of church and state, we need to ensure that they do not endorse or oppose political candidates. So, I hope my colleagues will support this important amendment. Thank you and I yield back.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentlewoman for her comments. Mr. Culberson from Houston, Texas is recognized.</p><p>      CULBERSON:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, the language which Chairman Graves has included in this bill. My request is very narrowly drawn to ensure that the First Amendment rights of pastors are protected consistent with the First Amendment, which directs that Congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise of religion or abridging the freedom of speech.</p><p>      Now, this amendment is very, this section that Chairman Graves included is very narrowly drawn, so that only the commissioner of the IRS can remove the nonprofit status of a church or place of worship if the commissioner determines that they've engaged in political speech.</p><p>      The -- one of the largest -- I represent the two largest churches, in the country, Lakewood and Second Baptist Church, and Second Baptist had their tax exempt status threatened several years ago when they simply handed out voter registration cards. Now, that's absurd. We want everyone who can vote in America to vote, and we want -- I think should we -- should we encourage people to in -- to register people to vote, and the amendment, the section that it -- this amendment would strike, is again, very nearly drawn and designed to protect the free speech rights of our pastors and churches while preserving the ability of the IRS to revoke the nonprofit status of a place of worship that does engage in political conduct. So I urge members to vote against the amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Culberson. Mr. Price is recognized and then Ms. Clark.</p><p>      PRICE:  Mr. Chairman, I rise this in support of the amendment and suggest to colleagues that we really better be careful about this one. We really better be careful. I suggest that you think about it very carefully. The Johnson amendment is a valuable safeguard that protects our religious institutions and our political process. Our guideposts in this should be the twin constitutional pillars, the free exercise clause and the Establishment Clause that serve not only to ensure that houses of worship do not become entangled with the state, but also that houses of worship are protected from the state. The core value is religious liberty. It's entirely appropriate that the Establishment Clause is part of the Bill of Rights.</p><p>Congress -- congregations currently have ample freedom to speak out on political and social issues. They can host candidate forums. They can organize \"souls to the polls\" trips (ph). They can hold voter registration drives. These activities are protected, and they should be. As long as the activity is about promoting conscientious citizenship and related faith to the issues of the day, we want to encourage more of this activity, not less. </p><p>      There's plenty of evidence that this kind of advocacy, religious concern for good citizenship on the common good is alive and well in our religious institutions. But what is not permissible under current law is the endorsement of specific candidates or direct intervention in political campaigns. That's really what's at stake in the Johnson amendment.</p><p>      We should think very carefully before we legitimate (ph) using religious institutions as a conduit for political contributions or for candidate or party-centered political advocacy. That would threaten, rather than enhance the freedom of these institutions. And I think it would lead to great cynicism about the activities of these institutions.</p><p>      At present, our houses of worship are by and large greatly respected. They have great moral force. People pay attention when the faith community speaks out. If these voices are seen as a front for campaigns or as institutions that are being exploited by campaigns, that undermines that moral force, something we would all live to regret. Let's be careful. Let's maintain the safeguards that are in place and have served our congregations and our constituents well. I urge the adoption of this amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Mr. Graves, any comment on Mr. Price's amendment?</p><p>      OK. What?</p><p>      Ms. Clark, you're recognized.</p><p>      CLARK:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, speak in strong support of my colleague's amendment to remove the language in this bill that would seriously undermine the Johnson amendment. Section 112 of this bill would make it virtually impossible for the IRS to enforce the Johnson amendment as it applies to religious institutions, allowing them to actively endorse or oppose political candidates.</p><p>      As Congressman Price just stated, we encourage lots of activity in our houses of worship, but this is going too far and putting us on a dangerous path. Allowing this section to become law would put at risk the ability of churches and other places of worship to continue to serve as nonpartisan places for worship, reflection, and community, rather than as another political battleground.</p><p>      Further, by singling out houses of worship among all 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations, this section raises a serious question about its constitutionality. The First Amendment prohibits the government from creating a legal preference for religious over non-religious entities. Hundreds of religious organizations and thousands of faith leaders agree that being pulled apart by divisive political campaigns would be a harmful step for their institutions and their communities.</p><p>      On constitutional grounds, on the grounds of common sense and decency, we should all be able to agree that keeping politics separate from our centers of worship makes sense and it's the right thing to do. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. And I yield back.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion? Ms. Roybal-Allard is recognized.</p><p>      ROYBAL-ALLARD:  Mr. Chairman, I am in strong support of this amendment. And I yield the balance of my time to Mr. Quigley.</p><p>      QUIGLEY:  I thank my colleague -- thank you.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Mr. Quigley, you could claim your own time but you're recognized.</p><p>      QUIGLEY:  Thank you. Look, places of worship are intended to be just that. They inspire belief, and they build community. By repealing this amendment, divisive themes, the Johnson amendment, divisive themes are introduced into the unified environments that religious organizations strive to build, thereby, undermining their core objectives.</p><p>      Now, you know what we've lived through under this law for some time, nothing in the law prevents pastors from speaking out from the pulpit on issues no matter how controversial. But beyond the ideological argument lies a constitutional one. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment calls for the separation of church and state, but by repealing this amendment, we are facilitating a direct transaction between the two.</p><p>      Let's look at what our colleagues did over on the authorizing side, they rejected recent attempts to include a repeal of the Johnson amendment in the new tax law. Furthermore, this subverts campaign disclosure laws, finance disclosure laws, and lends itself to the creation of new \"religious organizations,\" quote, as instruments of campaign cash. In short, this repeal overtly link state and church and greases the wheel for dark money. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. And I yield back.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  That worries me.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion? Ms. Wasserman Schultz has a minute to close.</p><p>      WASSERMAN SCHULTZ:  Thank you. Sorry. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to close really by issuing a single plea to my colleagues. This really is as Mr. Price said, a \"Be careful what you wish for\" moment. Partisan politics has infiltrated so many aspects of our lives already. I know all of us regret this state of affairs even though we have chosen to engage in it on a daily basis. </p><p>      Now, imagine how our constituents feel. I think it's safe to say that the vast majority of them who are members of religious congregations treasure their houses of worship as spaces far removed from the literally profane political discourse that is all around us. Let us not turn our pews into pits of partisan conflict.</p><p>No house of worship should be pressured to turn its pulpit into a super PAC, where millions of dollars in donations could be washed across its collection plates with little transparency and all while handing deep pocketed donors massive tax write-offs. Do we want to elected officials and candidates to go to houses of worship speaking out spiritual guidance but political endorsements? Do we congregations to grapple not with the Divine Word of God, but with the poll tested words of politicians? I think not.</p><p>      I hope that the members of this committee recognize and agree with me that we should make sure that our houses of worship continue to be the respite that they were intended to be and have been for thousands of years, and remove this badly misguided section of the bill. I yield back the balance of my time.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Now the question is on the Wasserman Schultz amendment. All of those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.</p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not agreed to.

Mr. Serrano's recognized...</p><p>      SERRANO:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  ... for the purpose of amendment.</p><p>      SERRANO:  Yes, and I ask it to be waived -- reading.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Considered read and waived, and the gentleman is recognized.</p><p>      SERRANO:  Done. Done with it. You want the Spanish version or the English version?</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Well, you can do both if you want, but let's keep it short.</p><p>      SERRANO:  Mr. Chairman, last week acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Mike Mulvaney, fired all 25 members of the bureau's consumer advisory board on a conference call.</p><p>      To this day members have not received the dignity of a clear explanation for their terminations even after Mr. Mulvaney's political appointee told the members that, \"Nothing is wrong with the present group.\" To make matters worse, they also -- they have also been barred from reapplying to serve on the board in the future. The move has been met with a wave of criticism and concern about Mr. Mulvaney's motivations. There's also no discussion in the law allowing these actions.</p><p>      This board was established under Dodd Frank and statutorily mandated to meet with the director at least two times per year. Members of the consumer advisory board are a broad and geographically diverse set of stakeholders, including consumer advocates, and lawyers, financial service industry representatives, CDFIs, academics, and more.</p><p>      These members serve in a voluntary capacity and they have sacrificed their time, money, and energy to provide their best insights and experiences with the bureau to help develop rules and policies that will protect consumers and businesses alike. My amendment would simply revoke the acting director is termination and reinstate all members of the consumer advisory board.</p><p>      It would also remove the director's ability to terminate members of the board without cause and require a written notification to the board member in question and to Congress. This amendment is pretty straightforward, and would right the petty terminations of these board members, which was completely unnecessary.</p><p>      Now, my Republican colleagues will argue that this amendment is authorizing language and should be opposed. But I would like to point out to those same colleagues that this 312 page bill we're working on now has 142 pages of authorizing language. This amendment is a drop in the bucket. And I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  I thank the gentleman for his remarks. So, Chairman Graves recognized.</p><p>      GRAVES:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the amendment, but I also rise to applaud the gentleman from New York, he's one of the lone voices on the other side that wants to see CFPB under our jurisdiction. And Mr. Serrano, thank you, thank you for offering this amendment because you're expressing -- I think everyone's concern that is we want to have oversight, we want to offer direction, and while I oppose the amendment here, because I know that the director is going to reappoint the board later this year with new members, he's going to populate the board, I do -- I do appreciate though you're willing to step out there in provide appropriating oversight over this bureau. With that though, I oppose the amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion on the amendment? Ms. Lowey is recognized, the ranking member.</p><p>      LOWEY:  I rise in -- I rise in strong support of my friend's amendment. The Trump administration's dismantling of the CFPB is underway. It is a direct and unacceptable attack on consumer financial protections that prioritizes special interests over our constituents. Earlier this month at Mick Mulvaney's direction, the CFPB disbanded its advisory board and councils. The advisory board is mandated by Dodd Frank to advise and consult the CFPB, convening twice a year. Since Mulvaney took over last year, it hasn't met once.</p><p>      This isn't surprising, but it is concerning. We must ensure that the CFPB is permitted to carry out its mission, protecting consumers from predatory lending, and other loan practices. So, I ask you to vote for the amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion on the amendment? Mr. Serrano has a minute to close.</p><p>      SERRANO:  Thank you. Simple amendment -- I think that this is an overreach. I think it's an ability of Mr. Mulvaney to do away with people he didn't want on the board; eventually, to try to do away with the board itself. And, lastly, the chairman is correct. I am a lone voice in saying that there should be oversight by this committee of that whole provision in the law.</p><p>      And the reason I do it is for two reasons:  one, because it's the right thing to do, and secondly, because I'm a big fan of this committee. I didn't come on this committee to see it dwindle away. I think we should reach the days -- in the old days where our oversight meant a lot in this Congress and in this country. Thank you.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Serrano. The question is on the Serrano amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.</p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not agreed to.</p><p>      SERRANO:  What?</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  What?</p><p>      SERRANO:  I didn't hear that.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Want to get back to the old days? OK.</p><p>      Further amendments, Mr. Pocan has a...</p><p>      SERRANO:  (inaudible).</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  The amendment is not agreed to. Who do we have next?</p><p>      SERRANO:  I thought my amendment would pass.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Ms. McCollum. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Pocan, you'll be next. Thank you.</p><p>      MCCOLLUM:  Thank you, Mr. Chair. I have an amendment at the desk. And I would like it to consider to be read.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  The gentlewoman is recognized.</p><p>      MCCOLLUM:  Thank you. My amendment restores a provision that prevents automatic pay raises for the vice president and other high-level political appointees in the executive branch. And you might ask why I'm doing this and the executive schedule is index for raises, but it appears that they cannot get an increase if there is no general schedule increase. And to my knowledge, there is no general scheduled pay increase.</p><p>      So, it's my understanding that Mr. Trump has in fact proposed a civilian pay freeze for 2019. So, with the civilian pay raises freezes in effect, I believe at a time when American families are seeing stagnant wages, it is just unacceptable that the majority would want to abandon past years of precedent and give pay raises to senior officials in the Trump administration only. I find this politically motivated that it goes to political appointees.</p><p>      And I'm -- I personally find it rather hypocritical, when we're -- when it's not pay raises for everyone in the federal government that would be instituted. Because, if it was, these political appointees would be taken care of. </p><p>      I would very much like to see -- in the past, we've had Democratic administrations exercise financial restraint on their appointees' salaries. But to allow political appointees right now and allies of the Trump administration to be able to reward themselves with taxpayers' dollars is just unacceptable.</p><p>      I would ask my Republican colleagues, do they have any other justification other than partisanship, why they would drop their insistence on salary caps now that the benefits would only be to the Trump administration political appointees?</p><p>      Do they believe that these administration political appointees have been such responsible stewards of our tax dollars? We're faced with daily stories about the Cabinet members, for example, like EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt treating himself to taxpayers' perks, first-class flights, hundred-thousand-dollar trips to Italy and Morocco and a ridiculous $43,000 sound booth, the use of aides to procure a mattress from the Trump Hotel, the official -- on an official trip that Secretary Mnuchin so he could contently (ph) watch the solar eclipse from Fort Knox, a $30,000 dining room set purchased by Secretary Carson for his office -- just to name a few. </p><p>Congress should be cracking down on these abuses of taxpayers, not giving the executive branch salary raises. So I urge adoption of my amendment. I yield back.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Ms. McCollum. Chairman Graves.</p><p>      GRAVES:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The majority opposes the amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion on the amendment? Ms. Lowey is recognized.</p><p>      LOWEY:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of my friend's amendment. There is no reason why the Trump administration which boasts the wealthiest cabinet in modern history should be held to a different standard than the previous administration when it comes to pay increases. This is just another case of Jekyll and Hyde games played by the majority. On the one hand, they claim to be focused on the wellbeing of our kids and our grandkids, and on the other hand, they want to give pay increases to political appointees, all while passing a tax bill that will dramatically increase the deficit. Vote for the amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion? Mr. Quigley is recognized.</p><p>      QUIGLEY:  The provision in question has been included in the final version of this bill since fiscal year 2014, and it has only then during the Trump administration that it has been left out of the House version, we shouldn't have a different standard for the Trump administration than we have the Obama administration, I support this amendment, and urge my colleagues to support it as well.</p><p>      RYAN:  Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Mr. Ryan is recognized.</p><p>      RYAN:  I appreciate and I thank all the points have been made. Let me briefly add that this Congress through our legislative branch appropriations bill that Mr. Yoder and I and our teams crafted do not have a pay raise for members of Congress. So, here we are saying to ourselves, no pay raise, but yet one of the wealthiest cabinets we've ever seen is going to be eligible. I think that flies in the face of what we want to do here and I wanted to make that point and support this amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion on the gentlewoman's amendment? Ms. McCollum has a minute to close.</p><p>      MCCOLLUM:  Mr. Chairman, I think the points have been made. And I just urge adoption of this amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK. The question is on the McCollum amendment. All of those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.</p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not agreed to.

The amendment is not adopted.</p><p>      Mr. Pocan's recognized for his amendment.</p><p>      POCAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask it to be considered read.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Considered read. The gentleman's recognized.</p><p>      POCAN:  Thank you very much. This is an amendment I am going to withdraw, but I do want to just put this out there for the committee and especially the subcommittee. In section 922 of the bill there are provisions for some banks that take them away from some regulation, and the reality is many of these bigger banks are cutting jobs here in the United States and sending them overseas, especially in customer service call centers.</p><p>      You know, we know that the president has been very aggressive, having a trade war over the loss of manufacturing jobs and not that I exactly understand what he's doing in his trade war, but I know there is a trade war over manufacturing jobs, these are now service jobs that we're also seeing leave. If you lose your manufacturing jobs, you lose your service jobs, pretty soon you don't have any jobs.</p><p>      Last year, Wells Fargo announced it was building a new 7,000-person call center in the Philippines. And just last week, Wells Fargo announced it was closing a call center in Reno, Nevada eliminating hundreds of jobs. The CEO at Wells Fargo admitted at a Senate hearing last year that many of the thousands of the jobs being cut in call centers were due to their jobs being shipped overseas. And it's not just Wells Fargo. It's Capital One, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase, Citibank and others -- have recently offshored significant numbers of call center jobs.</p><p>      What this amendment was trying to do, and I just hope that this is something that the committee can look at perhaps more in the future, is that the provisions that allow some banks to have less regulation would not be in place for people who have outsourced more than 50 jobs.</p><p>      I think at some point, we need to be able to address this, this amendment would do that, but given that people did not support the amendment that Marcy Kaptur had which I think would have solved some of these problems, I expect that that vote would go down and I want to be courteous of time, although I do have to get to 7:30 to win the pool, I will say that...</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Just keep on talking and...</p><p>      POCAN:  And with that, I will withdraw my amendment, but I appreciate the time to...</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Pocan for your patience. And Mr. Graves is recognized -- Chairman.</p><p>      GRAVES:  Mr. Chairman, the majority opposes Mr. Pocan's amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion on the Pocan amendment? Anyone? Withdrawing -- it's being withdrawn. Thank you for withdrawing. Any further amendments?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I was thinking that was coming back up.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I don't know.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Any further amendments?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I really appreciate you working with us.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Seeing none, I'm going to recognize -- are you rising? The gentleman has an amendment at the desk. Mr. Joyce.</p><p>      CLERK:  An amendment offered...</p><p>      JOYCE:  Considered read.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  I'd like, you'll give a full explanation of what -- if you would. We won't read it, but if you could give us a full explanation. The chair asks that courtesy.</p><p>      JOYCE:  Sure. Thank you.</p><p>      Well, I understand from some they would like -- I got it. I appreciate that. What this would amount to is a bill that -- Joyce number 3 that's in front of you, the last paragraph being, after line 20 of medical marijuana, \"Any entity that engages in any activity involving marijuana that is not exclusively for medical purposes shall not be covered by this provision.\"</p><p>      I know we've had a long and engaged debate about this. I know we're in the process of putting those together at the moment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  If you would suspend -- are there copies?</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  We need five official copies.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  The minority doesn't have copies.</p><p>      JOYCE:  Again, we're in the process of handwriting...</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Just suspend for just a minute. Thank you.</p><p>      JOYCE:  Thank you very much for inquiring, ma'am, and I apologize for this but it's in the process of being made right now.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  So, we're going to wait until something is printed.</p><p>      JOYCE:  They're being hand-printed as we speak, some of the language that was added there. I read the one part that was in addition to what was handed out to everyone is Joyce number 3.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  There's some difference in what we have than what you've mentioned. Our document does not say solely.</p><p>      JOYCE:  I read the last paragraph, sir, before, and I know we're in the process of getting your copy right now, ma'am. I have people down here handwriting them for you to make sure they have it.</p><p>      LOWEY:  I have no idea. In fact, I was just told there are a few copies here.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  If you could just use your microphone, Ms. Lowey.</p><p>      LOWEY:  Just give us a final copy.</p><p>      OK. Take you a minute.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK. When we get the final copy, we'll give you a couple of minutes to look it over, I guess.</p><p>      JOYCE:  In the meantime, I'd like to add, Mr. Chairman, that in listening to fellow members of the committee and trying to address your concerns, that's what we've tried to craft here is something that takes into consideration the 46 states, the three territories and the district that have engaged in or voted for or -- and legislated for the medical marijuana, that this amendment would cover medical marijuana only and that the production and sale would all be for medical marijuana only and leave out what those states, I tried to encompass everybody to be fair in the first time around. But I found some issue there. So, therefore, we've left out those states that have or -- and included that have medical that we don't use it for the recreation.</p><p>      LOWEY:  Yes. Will the gentleman yield?</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  If the gentleman has the time and I guess we'll use the time until we have recovered the documents.</p><p>      LOWEY:  I'd like to clarify a question on this is that states that have only medical marijuana laws in place or medical and/or, because some states have both and I wouldn't want to preclude states that have both. Understanding this would only cover medical.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  I'm going to ask the gentleman to suspend until we have a final copy which can be looked over.</p><p>      LOWEY:  Thank you.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  The meeting will come to order. I believe we have a final copy of the draft and I'm going to ask the clerk to read it, then I'll recognize the sponsor once again to explain it.</p><p>      CLERK:  An amendment offered by...</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Please give your attention to the clerk.</p><p>      CLERK:  \"An amendment offered by Mr. Joyce, Number 3. At the end of the bill, before the spending reduction account, insert the following section:  blank, 'None of the funds made available by this Act may be used with respect to the states of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming, or with respect to the District of Colombia, Puerto Rico or Guam.</p><p>      \"'To penalize a financial institution solely because the institution provides financial services to an entity that is a manufacturer, producer, or a person that participates in any business or organized activity that involves handling medical marijuana or medical marijuana products and engages in such activity pursuant to a law established by a state or a unit of local government as it pertains to medical marijuana. Any entity that engages in any activity involving marijuana that is not exclusively for medical purposes shall not be covered by this provision.'\"</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  The gentleman from Ohio is recognized to explain his amendment and obviously we'd welcome any additional comments from members and certainly from the chair and the ranking member.</p><p>      Mr. Joyce is recognized.</p><p>      JOYCE:  Thank you. Somewhat to say we've debated this ad nauseam and I can appreciate that. What I tried to do is listen to the concerns with my brothers and sisters here. I wish and I beg your indulgence for keeping you beyond the time we should have been out of here. And I could tell you as a fellow appropriator that if every committee in this building worked as hard as we do, we'd get a lot more done.</p><p>      But I certainly appreciate your staying by. We tried to engage since we passed -- it was brought to our attention that when we passed in CGIS, a criminal or the part of the withholding funds for the criminal aspect was for medical then this would be in line with the medical marijuana purposes that were being served in those states that have it, and I urge you to consider and vote for it because I believe it's appropriate for those states that have legitimately brought state medical marijuana to the forefront.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Chairman Graves is recognized.</p><p>      GRAVES:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      And I want to thank the gentleman. I know he's been working on this issue for a long time. He's heard the concerns of the committee. And this is a complicated issue, but there's clearly a gray area and there's room for improvement. This is a good first step. I think he has narrowed it to a point of which he heard the consensus of this committee in a bipartisan sense. But with that, certainly it's up to the committee and your decision whether or not we include this in our final bill, but I thank the gentleman for his good work and hard work on this.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Graves.</p><p>      Mr. Quigley?</p><p>      QUIGLEY:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      I want to congratulate the gentleman for his persistence, creativity. It's been an interesting process in this last amendment. I just want you to know as a 10-year veteran of the Cook County Board and a staffer for 10 years at the Chicago City Council, I am home.</p><p>      All that being said, I support the amendment.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Mr. Chair?</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  The gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Cole.</p><p>      COLE:  Thank you and I thank my friend. It's actually been a good discussion. It had been helpful to some of us that are not as involved in this issue.</p><p>      I would ask the gentleman, I know Oklahoma is listed here, we've not made the decision yet as a state to adopt medical marijuana. That's actually on the ballot in Oklahoma on June the 26th. And so, I don't want anything that would presuppose how that election will go. Literally the voters of the state have not made a decision on this yet.</p><p>      So, I would ask if the gentleman would, if he could just withdraw us from his amendment and if that's appropriate, just a little second because I don't want to be voting on something that presumes my state is for something that I don't know yet how they're going to vote.</p><p>      JOYCE:  If I'm not mistaken, at the moment...</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  You'll yield to Mr. Joyce, my friend.</p><p>      COLE:  Certainly.</p><p>      JOYCE:  And CBD oil, which is part of this, that -- it treats...</p><p>      COLE:  That -- OK, that would apply.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes.</p><p>      COLE:  OK. Well, then, I'll withdraw my concern. It was not clear to me. I thank my friend.</p><p>      JOYCE:  Thank you.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion? Ms. McCollum and then Mr. Moolenaar.</p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  OK.</p><p>      MCCOLLUM:  Mr. Chair, members of the committee, I want to compliment Mr. Joyce. I want to compliment all of us. This is very rare in Congress where we see an opportunity to come together, move something forward and address everybody's concerns and considerations, and I want to thank Mr. Joyce for working with me and the members on our side of the aisle.</p><p>      Mr. Chair, I yield back.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Mr. Moolenaar, you didn't say anything about going home, did you? That was Mr. Simpson.</p><p>      MOOLENAAR:  No. That was Mr. Simpson.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK.</p><p>      Mr. Moolenaar?</p><p>      MOOLENAAR:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      And I guess my concern with this amendment is I don't -- it's not clear to me what definition we're using of medical marijuana. Are we using a federal definition? If so, what is the definition of medical marijuana in the federal law? And if not, is each state determining their own definition of medical marijuana? It seems to me very unclear.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  You're making just general comments. You're not addressing them to...</p><p>      MOOLENAAR:  Well, if the sponsor of the amendment and I appreciate the work he's done on this would answer that question, it would help me, because I cannot support something where it's referring to medical marijuana if we don't have a consistent definition in federal law what medical marijuana is.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Would you want the sponsor to yield to you?</p><p>      MOOLENAAR:  Yes, please.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  OK.</p><p>      JOYCE:  The federal treatment of marijuana is always consistent. That hasn't changed. What we've allowed to do is the states to exercise their rights and make their judgment as to what they deem to be medical marijuana. As you can see in the case that was just brought up my dear friend, Mr. Cole, that CBD oil which helps children with seizures is considered part of what Oklahoma already determines to be medicinal marijuana.</p><p>      Yet, further aspects or use of that will be voted on by his people, just like I'm not sure what happened in your state, but in Ohio, the legislature did it and other states have passed it as an amendment or as somehow passed it through state referendums.</p><p>      'So, each state is defining what and again, it goes back to Mr. Moolenaar, the idea that we to do the research as to what it's good for and what it's bad for. Obviously, we've heard that it's been effective in some states where it's been found to be illegal from ladies and gentlemen who served in the service for PTSD. The full effects of it are yet to be found and that's what we're trying to get accomplished here.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion? Former Chairman Mr. Rogers.</p><p>      ROGERS:  Mr. Chairman, there is a reason why we have a division between authorization and appropriations. And this is one of the best examples that I can think of where we need to let the authorizers with their expertise and their experience and their time to sort through the questions that we have about this matter. This is a complicated matter, obviously. It's also significant. But this would be a very significant change in the law which I think should be done by the authorizers, not us.</p><p>      Number two, I don't know how a bank would be able to tell whether or not a sack of money that comes in, whether or not that's from medical marijuana or recreational. I don't know how they would be able to decide that. And if they can't, they're subjecting themselves to possible heavy liability and I don't think it's fair for us to foist on to the banks to determine and examine whether or not the sack of cash is legal or not.</p><p>      So, I would hope we would let the authorizers handle this matter and we would have a lot more confidence in the answers to the questions that people like my friend has just raised. I yield back.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion?</p><p>      I have some comments. I admire the fact that Mr. Joyce is going back to the drawing board. He's drawing on some of the knowledge of some of the people in the room here who are more professionally involved in these issues.</p><p>      I am extremely uncomfortable about quite honestly moving forward on this. It is complicated and there is a gray area. Obviously, if there's a desire to have a vote, I personally think that this needs far more attention. I'm very uncomfortable about moving ahead on this. Just from listening to the members, I'm concerned about it and I'm sort of inclined quite honestly to ask you to withdraw your amendment and take it on for another day. But I want to be respectful obviously of the work and thought that's gone into this.</p><p>      I think it's extremely complicated and I somewhat want to associate myself with Mr. Rogers. We are moving right into the -- in the area of authorization, the very type of authorization that many people criticize us on other parts of our bills. So, I'd like -- I'd ask that you consider withdrawing your amendment.</p><p>      JOYCE:  I've had the opportunity to -- been working on this since -- especially since Ohio has gotten involved into it. The answers to the questions that you raised are legitimate -- legitimate answers that we're going to find out.</p><p>      I agree if Congress was doing their job. The authorized committees were doing their job. Maybe we do something. But that just hasn't occurred. And so, what we're trying to do is we're not changing the law. We're just asking for those who are trying to do what they find to be the wishes of their constituents since we are a body of representatives allowing that to take place in the -- what we would call the laboratories of our states both for medical marijuana and for democracy. They have chosen this route.</p><p>      46 states have voted it in. We're just asking for them to have the opportunity if they see fit. Banks and credit unions don't have to do this. But those who want to engage in it will provide the buffer between us and the illegal remedies or the illegal dealers out there because they would have to verify that the funds coming in are coming from medical, medicinal facilities. They at least have the opportunity to engage if they want to and if they don't want to, fine. But that's what I'm asking for. That's why I think we'd like to move this one step forward and I would ask for a recorded vote -- or, no, not a recorded vote, excuse me, a voice vote because I know you want to get going, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Ms. Kaptur?</p><p>      KAPTUR:  Yes. I just wanted to state something, because I'm not a doctor and I'm not a medical professional but obviously Ohio is like the number one state in deaths per capita related to opioid abuse and fentanyl, black tar heroin, all of it. And every...</p><p>      JOYCE:  Will the lady yield for a moment?</p><p>      KAPTUR:  I'll yield to the gentleman in a second. Every law enforcement officer I talk to, I ask about the pathway toward use. And to a person, as they have examined people who have died, there's an entry level experience and it begins with an M and it's not methamphetamine.</p><p>      And so, I had the head of NIH to come in and see me because I said \"I want you to give me the best information NIH has on what happens to the brain, to the patient, and inter-generationally to their children.\" And I said, \"So, show me for long-term use of marijuana\" and I'm not disagreeing with medical use of marijuana. I voted for that in the past. But, I said, \"I want to know what happens to the brain where it happens. I want to know what happens with black tar heroin. I want to know what happens with cocaine. Every single addictive substance, I want to know what happens.\"</p><p>      And thy began to show me maps of the brain and some of what they don't know which was shocking to me and they could not answer my questions definitively on long-term use of marijuana and increased amounts of use and then the pathway to something else and to look at what -- and they showed me what it takes to try to get someone off of an addictive substance like that and the numbers we have, we have approximately eight readmissions per patient that is heavily addicted, right, I'm not saying to marijuana, but other drugs that follow on and how difficult it is to try to unwind it in the brain and why. And they showed me MRIs of the brain.</p><p>      What was shocking to me was after all these years, why can't medical science tell us exactly what happens to the brain and to the children of users? They can't answer that. So, it creates uncertainty in members who are not medical professionals who are trying to do the right thing for their constituents and for their country. But I just wanted to put that set of facts on the table because it made me very uncomfortable.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion on the Joyce amendment, Mr. Ryan?</p><p>      RYAN:  Mr. Chairman, I'd just like to add. I guess we could probably have this discussion in Ohio and leave everybody else out of it at this point. But, I just want to make the point that one of the concerns that I think a lot of us have is that we do have marijuana getting laced with all of these other drugs in them.</p><p>      And where 30 years ago someone experimenting marijuana could now face -- laced with all of this horrible stuff that we're seeing in Ohio. I believe that the process here of moving towards both medical and overall legalization will provide safer, more controlled substances just like in alcohol. There are limited levels. It's controlled. As the gentleman from Nevada suggested, it's eventually taxed.</p><p>      So, I just want to support this amendment, my friend from Ohio, and say that this is complicated. But I support him because this is the kind of thing that needs to get done. These things are helping save lives, improving the quality of life, and I just -- I wanted to add my support.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Ryan.</p><p>      Ms. Herrera Beutler is recognized.</p><p>      HERRERA BEUTLER:  I thank the chairman and the sponsor for working diligently on this. And like I said before, I think there are good people on both sides of this issue. This is not a cut and dry issue and I associate myself with the remarks of the former chairman and the current chairman in which, hey, surprise, surprise, guys, come on.</p><p>      I really strongly believe that we're making -- it seems like a small thing and it was tailored and it was crafted tightly and I know that the staff and the teams working on this did everything they could. But the reality is, we are stepping into a place that we have no business stepping into. We have not done the hearings. We have not heard the testimony. We do not have the science. We do not have the background. Good or bad, we're appropriators. And in Labor H, we've had some of these conversations and I welcome more. Let's have more. Let's do it. Let's take it on.</p><p>      But at 7:45 and we got this new amendment 10 minutes ago and we're debating a major change to federal policy here and now. I'm just saying it is, because when you open this door, the way this amendment was originally crafted was including recreational use, and that was not an accident, and I'm not saying that against the gentleman who offered it. I'm saying it against the people in the industry who is behind it.</p><p>      The reason it was crafted that way is to allow banking -- federal banking for recreational use. And if we don't believe that, then, shoot, we fell off the turnip truck yesterday and I love that the chairman -- or the sponsor re-crafted it because I don't think that was his intent and the lady.</p><p>      I don't think they're trying to do that. But the reality is, if we open this piece and we don't have all the background behind it, man, the litigation and the gray area that we're stepping into as appropriators, not as authorizers, is too much for this hour -- at this time and hour. And again, I just plead that we hit pause.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  The gentleman from Texas, Judge Carter?</p><p>      CARTER:  Mr. Chairman, I very much admire...</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Please give Judge Carter your attention. Thank you.</p><p>      CARTER:  This is going to be very brief. I very much admire his tenacity, but I want to go on record to say I'm voting no.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Further discussion? Let me say -- I ask the sponsor -- I would like you to withdraw your amendment. I'm asking you again to withdraw your amendment.</p><p>      JOYCE:  Well, I appreciate my former chairman and my chairman putting their foot down, I guess, and trying to make sure that I don't have enough votes to carry this forward. I appreciate the fact that you don't want to vote, but just for giggles maybe we might try a voice vote if the chairman would allow that and be satisfied with the results of said voice vote.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  I'm asking you to withdraw your amendment.</p><p>      JOYCE:  I withdraw the amendment.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  Any further amendments? If not -- the amendment is withdrawn.</p><p>      If not, the gentleman from Kentucky is recognized for a motion.</p><p>      ROGERS:  Mr. Chairman, I move to favorably report to the House the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2019.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  The question is on the motion. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay. </p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. The motion is agreed to.</p><p>      ROGERS:  Mr. Chairman, I request a recorded vote.</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  A recorded vote -- there's been sufficient hands.</p><p>      CLERK:  Mr. Aderholt?</p><p>      FRELINGHUYSEN:  The clerk will call the roll.</p><p>      CLERK:  Mr. Aderholt?</p><p>      ADERHOLT:  Yes.</p><p>      CLERK:  Mr. Aderholt, yes.</p><p>      Mr. Aguilar?</p><p>      AGUILAR:  No.</p><p>      CLERK:  Mr. Aguilar, no.</p><p>      Mr. Amodei?

If members could take seats and we're going to begin.   </p><p>      Again, the chair recognizes the gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Palazzo...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALAZZO</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  ... for the purpose of an amendment. You have an amendment at the desk. Would you consider it read? Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALAZZO</emphasis>:  Yes, I ask that it be considered read.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Good. And you're recognized to present your amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALAZZO</emphasis>:  All right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Please give Mr. Palazzo your attention.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALAZZO</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, this is a simple amendment that would increase funding for community development financial institutions, otherwise known as CDFIs. Unfortunately, the committee mark proposed a $59 million reduction in funding from fiscal year 2018 levels.  </p><p>      But with the help of the chairman of the subcommittee and his wonderful staff, we've been able to find a path forward. My amendment would take the first step towards returning these essential funds by reallocating $25 million to make up a part of the shortfall.  </p><p>      For those of you who aren't familiar, CDFI banks take a small amount of public money to leverage private investment in communities that are traditionally underserved with historically high poverty rates.  </p><p>      For every $1 of public investments in CDFIs over $12 of private investment are used to support for small businesses, create jobs and revitalize the most impoverished communities in America.  </p><p>      In addition, they help put millions on the road to buying homes and establishing personal financial security. They also provide essential financial literacy education to their customers. I know many of you on this committee represent areas with high poverty rates.  </p><p>      CDFIs are active in your communities and are essential sources of banking for many of our most underserved. I ask my colleagues to support the amendment and I yield back the balance of my time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROGERS</emphasis>:  Will the gentleman yield before you...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  The gentleman yield to the chairman, Mr. Rogers.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROGERS</emphasis>:  Will the gentleman yield?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALAZZO</emphasis>:  Yield to the chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROGERS</emphasis>:  I'd like to identify myself with the gentleman's remarks. It's a great amendment. The CDFIs are vitally important in poor areas like mine and perhaps yours. And I would urge that we pass the gentleman's amendment. I yield.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thanks the gentleman.  </p><p>      Mr. Graves is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to thank, Mr. Palazzo and Chairman Rogers for their positive comments. I rise to accept the amendment. These increases -- as he referenced, the CDFI funds financial and technical assistance grants by $25 million, taking it to a total level of $216 million.  </p><p>      And let me remind the committee that is $202 million above the president's request. The administration initially requested $14 million. I know this committee's commitment is to rural communities throughout our country. And this will assist in that way. So I want to thank, Mr. Palazzo and his commitment here and I look forward to accepting the amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion? Mr. Palazzo, you have an -- a minute. You don't have to take it to close.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PALAZZO</emphasis>:  Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. In the interest of time I will keep it brief. Please support my amendment. I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK. The question is on the Palazzo amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.   </p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it.  </p><p>      Ms. Pingree is recognized, gentlewoman from Maine.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PINGREE</emphasis>:  Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I have an amendment at the desk, Pingree Number 1.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Yes. Let me say that last amendment was adopted. I apologize. And your amendment is considered read and you're recognized. Excuse me.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PINGREE</emphasis>:  Thank you. First, I want to thank the chair and the subcommittee for recognizing the importance of giving the executive branch authorities to combat corruption and to punish human rights abusers around the world.  </p><p>      I'm pleased that the Bill adds $2 million to the Treasury Department's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, which handles sanctions investigation and enforcement. I'm also pleased that the report language stresses the need for resources to be directed towards Africa, including to address protracted conflicts in Sudan, South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  </p><p>      It also calls for robust implementation of the Global Magnitsky Act sanctions on corruption in human rights. Currently, there are only five sanctions investigators assigned to the team, responsible for designations and delistings for all Africa sanctions programs as well as Global Magnitsky in Venezuela.  </p><p>      Too often these staffers are pulled away to deal with emerging issues like Iran. My amendment would add an additional $2.9 million to create nine new positions with the relevant offices at Treasury to accomplish this goal. Recognizing that the bill already includes an increase, I'm willing to withdraw my amendment and happy to work with the chair going forward.  </p><p>      Will the chair attempt to increase -- support this increase as we move toward conference to ensure that additional resources for Treasury go to the needs identified in the report such as nations in conflict in Central and East Africa and for the global Magnitsky Act?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  We'll -- Chairman Graves.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Maine for raising this issue. It's an issue I think we're all committed to. Government sanctions, abuses of human rights around the world is on the rise.  </p><p>      I look forward to working with you in the days ahead and also with Chairman Rogers and his subcommittee as well. But thank you, again, for your interest in this issue and your commitment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PINGREE</emphasis>:  Thank you. And thank you for being willing to work on this. Just to make sure it's clear. I have people from the Sudan, South Sudan, Burundi in my state. And often those smaller countries are the ones that never get these enforced and there just aren't enough people to do it.  </p><p>      So I know you understand that. I just wanted to help make that point clear. And I hope that there is potential for additional funding if we can find a way to work in it together. And I withdraw my amendment and thank you for your consideration.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you. The amendment has been withdrawn.  </p><p>      Recognize Dr. Harris for the purpose of an amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. I have an administration at the desk.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Would you consider it read?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  And yes, I move to dispense with the reading.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  So ordered and the gentleman is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, this amendment follows up on what you talked about in your opening statement, that one important program funded by this bill is the OSP, what is the school program, the school choice program in Washington, D.C.</p><p>      And it's tremendously successful. Has a waiting list. They could actually move some students into that program from D.C. public school, D.C. charter schools if they had more funding, so what my amendment does is it adds an additional $5 million into their funding, offsetting that by decreasing funding into the public school and charter school part of that program -- of that program spending.  </p><p>      And that way leaves actually more per pupil expenditures for both the public school and the public charter schools while fulfilling an increase in the ability of students to engage in the OSP.  </p><p>      So I offer the amendment and I will -- I've spoken to the chairman of the subcommittee. He's agreed to work on getting that funding increased, so I will intend to withdraw the amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, doctor.  </p><p>      Mr. Graves.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate Dr. Harris's commitment to children and providing the best education. You're absolutely right, I agree with you on the impact this has had in the past and look forward to working with you in the days ahead to make sure we're impacting lives in a positive way as children are being educated in this area. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  So I withdraw the amendment, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK. Thank you both.  </p><p>      Mr. Joyce, amendment number 2. You have two amendments.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Yes, I do. And I appreciate this opportunity to speak, Mr. Chairman. I have that amendment at the desk. And I ask...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Would you consider it read?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  ... consider as read. Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  And you are recognized on your second amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. My amendment would reverse the 2015 decision by the United States Postal Service to its lower delivery service standards for first class mail and periodicals.  </p><p>      Since these standards are lower, timely processing and delivery of the mail has been significantly degraded across the country. Mail delays are dragging down our business and I'm sure I'm not alone in saying that my constituents have noticed the effects of late mail.  </p><p>      I hear it all the time. Medications aren't arriving in a timely fashion. (inaudible) pay your bill on time, if the bills arrive late, so in turn they receive a late fee payment. Invitations get lost, especially to my house.  </p><p>      And weekly newspapers arrive a week late. And importantly, absentee balances are arriving late and at this point it's unlikely the United States Postal Service can guarantee a timely delivery for elections this spring and next November.  </p><p>      So, although, the Postal Service reduction of standards was intended to save money, the consolidation plan actually cost money for fiscal year 2015. The Postal Service spent $130 million on increased transportation costs as a result of the closures and lost a total of $66 million due to the consolidation plan.  </p><p>      I therefore urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment to restore the postal standards to those that were in effect in July 1st, 2012, so all of our constituents may receive the service they depend on.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Joyce.  </p><p>      Mr. Graves?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, unfortunately, I have to raise an opposition to the amendment, but not to my good friend, Mr. Joyce personally. But the amendment -- and he and I have had a discussion about this. His intentions are well, but clearly this has a direct impact on the Postal Service. I think it's a $1.5 billion negative impact on the Postal Service. I truly respect and understand the gentleman's concern about the service standards.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  And look forward to working with you in the days ahead, hopefully along with OGR, the committee of jurisdiction. But because of the high cost of this one amendment, it's a tremendous cost I would have to oppose, the amendment only but not the gentleman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Ms. Kaptur, I understand is recognized to talk on this amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAPTUR</emphasis>:  I would like to rise in support of the gentleman's amendment and implore the chair and the ranking member to try to really look at this. I don't think that the -- whoever did this for the Postal Service was really thinking.  </p><p>      And their decision to eliminate overnight service for first-class mail and even the manner in which our mail arrives now, this has never happened before but an envelope will be in an envelope. Something was ripped because it was sent up to Pontiac, Michigan out of Ohio, let's say.  </p><p>      And really there have been a lot of delays. What Congressman Joyce talks about medicine that is true. And there is something really wrong with the way this routing is going and degrading our mail standards has impacted the timely delivery of everything from medicines to greeting cards, bill payments to business mail, personal letters to government correspondence, not to mention local election mail.  </p><p>      The timely processing delivery of mail is really critical. And the Postal Service delivers 154 billion pieces of mail annually to 155 million delivery points, accounting for 47 percent of the world's mail.  </p><p>      It's an enormous undertaking that equals over 2000 percent more in terms of business than either the UPS or FedEx. The Postal Service serves everyone and they have admitted that their decision to reduce delivery standards has cost the agency $66 million in losses due to added transportation cost, in 2015, $130 million alone.  </p><p>      So this isn't even a very wise business decision. So, I would really implore the chair to keep working with us. I think we should exercise our authority. They've had trouble appointing people to the board of the Postal Service, whoever heard of that.  </p><p>      And the future of our public Postal Service is threatened by delayed mail and it harms small business. It harms people in rural America. And we really have to exercise our authority here. So, I urge my colleagues to support our Postal Service, Mr. Joyce's amendment.  </p><p>      And I would really urge the chairman somehow to work with us as we move toward the floor, if he can't accept this now and would urge my colleagues to vote for the Joyce amendment. And I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Mr. Quigley on the Joyce amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUIGLEY</emphasis>:  Sure. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan amendment to restore mail delivery service standards to 2012 levels. Every year millions of Americans rely on the USPS to provide affordable, efficient mail delivery service. And in many communities USPS is the only affordable option to send and receive mail. Over the last year, I've received countless Postal Service complaints on slow and inconsistent mail service in my district.  </p><p>      This includes delayed mail, sometimes taking weeks to arrive due to bad weather or unscheduled employee absences, wrongly delivered mail, and severely damaged mail. Americans have come to expect timey and dependable mail service. And we need to make sure that the Post Office is maintaining its high standards, therefore I support this amendment and urge my colleagues to vote in favor.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion on the Joyce amendment? If (ph) -- hearing none, Mr. Joyce has a minute to close.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Why, thank you, Mr. Chairman. U.S. mail system is an important part of our nation's infrastructure, connecting people of all communities with the institutions that serve them. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. And I thank you, again, Mr. Chairman. And yield back the balance of my time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK. The question is on the Joyce amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.  </p><p>      Got you. You find this humorous. I think the ayes got it. The amendment is approved. At least you got one approved today.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  I know it's much to your chagrin, sir.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Mr. Price?  </p><p>      Mr. Price is recognized for the purpose of an amendment.  </p><p>      Mr. Price has an amendment at the desk.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>:  I have an amendment at the desk. I ask that its reading be dispensed with.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Considered it done. The gentleman is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment offered in partnership with Mr. Serrano that would restore net neutrality protections that entrepreneurs, small businesses, and the public rely on over the use of internet.  </p><p>      I am sure all of us here know that net neutrality is a term used to describe the principle that all content travelling over the internet should be treated equally by the owners of the networks providing internet service to customers.  </p><p>      Since its inception, the internet has allowed anyone with an internet connection to access or to provide information, goods or services on a relatively equal footing. This open design has been largely responsible for the revolutionary impact that the internet has had on global commerce, innovation and information sharing in so many other aspects of our daily lives.  </p><p>      Yet, in recent years, some companies have openly defied these bedrock open internet principles. There are well-documented examples of internet service providers deliberately throttling broadband speed when consumers try to connect to certain applications, blocking content from competitors and providing preferential treatment to their own content.  </p><p>      So in 2015, after several years of legal battles and careful deliberation, the FCC issued its revised open internet order. These rules enshrined in federal regulation the basic principle of net neutrality, that the companies that provide internet service to consumers to offer that service in an open and nondiscriminatory manner.  </p><p>      This principle is supported by the major tech companies, entrepreneurs, small businesses, research universities, librarians, local governments, a large majority of Americans, nearly everybody, in fact except the companies that provide these commercial internet services.  </p><p>      And yet, despite receiving millions of consumer comments supporting net neutrality, the FCC suddenly voted last year to overturn net neutrality, eroding the principles of openness, innovation and fairness that are the cornerstone of the internet.  </p><p>      Citizens are paying attention to this issue. I expect all of us can attest to that. I received 14,000 letters and e-mails on this subject in this Congress alone. On Monday, these FCC net neutrality protections officially lapsed. The Senate has already voted to overturn the FCC's net neutrality repeal. And this amendment presents us with the opportunity to do the same. So let's put our constituents, small businesses and entrepreneurs first by restoring net neutrality. I urge support for this amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Price.  </p><p>      Mr. Graves?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would have to rise in opposition to the amendment. I think we can all agree on the desire for a free and open internet. And we all do, in fact, it is. I just heard that the gentleman received 14,000 e-mails in opposition to the rule. Apparently, the internet is open and it's free. And people are expressing their opinions. That's what we want and that's what we desire.  </p><p>      But this amendment will just restore things back to the old rule and prohibit FCC from issuing any other rules. In fact, it's circumventing the whole process of public comments and the openness and transparency that we all desire.  </p><p>      The Senate has taken up this issue. I suspect the House may take it up as well. This is not the right committee or jurisdiction in which to do that. The Internet has been the biggest driving force for innovation in our lifetimes.  </p><p>      This is no time to mess with it in a hearing such as this. It's doing well. Just check your e-mails. You're getting them. So, Mr. Chairman, with that, I'd have to rise in opposition to the amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Ms. Lowey?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOWEY</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of my friend's amendment. This week despite overwhelming public support, the FCC's repeal of net neutrality protection officially went into effect.  </p><p>      It's an unfortunate step as we know net neutrality protects small businesses, entrepreneurs, students and consumers by ensuring a level playing field online. Paid prioritization means the end of a free and open internet.  </p><p>      Today, we have an opportunity to protect net neutrality, ensure that our constituents choose what websites and apps they can access online. We owe it to our constituents to do everything in our power to fight for their open access.  </p><p>      Please, vote for the amendment. I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentlewoman.  </p><p>      Mr. Serrano, a cosponsor of the amendment, is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SERRANO</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      I want to thank my good friend from North Carolina, Mr. Price, for working on this issue for so many years. On the net neutrality, we do not see a stifling of creativity in innovation like we were told by the opposition.  </p><p>      In fact, it did the opposite, ushering in a spirit and wave of innovation because more people were able to access an internet that treated all content and data the same. This amendment would simply reinstate the 2015 net neutrality rules that have kept the internet open and fair for all Americans.  </p><p>      It would prevent our constituents from having to pay more to access their favorite websites and streaming services. It will prevent students from having educational content blocked by their ISPs, therefore jeopardizing their learning experience.  </p><p>      And it would prevent small businesses from having their websites throttled and face delays in trying to showcase their products for consumers. While major service providers like Comcast and AT&amp;T have recently announced that they have no plans to prioritize certain web traffic or create paid fast lanes, what is to stop them from changing their minds in the future and raising prices on consumers? Let us not forget that the first priority of any cooperation is to make money. But it should be the responsibility of Congress and the federal government to protect all Americans' ability to access a resource that has become so engrained in our culture and economy.  </p><p>      That is why the principles enshrined in the 2015 net neutrality rules are so important and why tens of millions of Americans strongly support these principles. This is a matter of fairness and equality.  </p><p>      I ask my colleagues to put the interests of families, students, rural and urban Americans and small businesses ahead of corporate interest. I urge a yes vote on the Price Serrano amendment. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentleman for his comments.  </p><p>      I see Mr. Kilmer and then Mr. Cartwright, Mr. -- OK.  </p><p>      Mr. Taylor, I guess you...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAYLOR</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just a couple of things. Number one:  obviously, net neutrality in the way it's been framed is inaccurate and deceiving in many ways. And it's kind of embarrassing in some respects as well.  </p><p>      When you look at -- talk about corporate interests and one of the issues here is blocking and throttling, the only folks doing blocking and throttling now are the big tech companies and, of course, they support net neutrality, which would put the ISPs who are not just your Verizons and Cox and stuff like that but 3,000 of them across the nation that provide low cost internet to rural areas, like some in my own district.  </p><p>      And they, of course, would support pushing them to be regulated under a 1930s scheme. So think about that for a second. Companies that are in the internet being regulated under a 1930 scheme, does that really make any sense? I don't think so.  </p><p>      So, of course, the tech companies would support that because they don't want them to get into the data business, which is highly profitable. Look, I think everyone here there's an equality of desire not to have -- to have a level playing field, to not have blocking, to not have throttling. But also to regulate the internet under the same ecosphere, so -- ecosystem, excuse me, so under the FCC, everyone being regulated under the same rules.  </p><p>      And having that opt -- the opt-in -- and our people would have the ability to opt in, and then perhaps look at potential soft regulations on data, on who owns your data. So this is a larger discussion that has to happen, but not here in this committee. So I would oppose it. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Kilmer is recognized and then Mr. Cartwright.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KILMER</emphasis>:  Thanks. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I support this amendment; I support a free and open internet. But we had a debate on the -- on the last bill about the inability of Congress to step in in an area where it ought to use some of its authority. That was with regard to authorization for use of military force.  </p><p>      But I think this is another example where Congress has sort of dropped the ball. You know, this is larger than just one issue. Congress should look at holistically reforming our telecom laws because the last major piece of telecom policy that passed out of Congress was in 1996.  </p><p>      You know, 1996, less than a quarter of Americans were online. The ones that were used Netscape and a dial-up modem. When they got their e-mail, it said, \"You've Got Mail.\" You know, that was seven years before, MySpace, a PalmPilot was thought to be cutting-edge technology at that time.  </p><p>      Someone who used the term smart phone at that time was describing something that weighed more than a pound and was the size of a brick. You know, but because Congress hasn't acted on this, agencies have tried to pick up the slack and that's not the way to go. Rather than seeing this issue decided by agency action, I'd like to see Congress step up and set some rules of the road and pass legislation that comprehensively reforms our telecom and technology policy. To me, it's a competitiveness issue. I think you've heard folks on both sides of the aisle with different perspectives on this, but make the same point that this is important to our businesses, this is about jobs...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAYLOR</emphasis>:  Will the gentleman yield?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KILMER</emphasis>:  Yes. Sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAYLOR</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate the sentiment and I agree with the gentleman that we should -- that Congress should take this up and look at it holistically. But the gentleman mentioned the antiquated action that was taken -- you know, 1996 I guess prior to MySpace. But does the gentleman believe that we should look at regulating a -- you know, the ISPs under a 1930 scheme?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KILMER</emphasis>:  So just reclaiming my time. In my view, the issue needs to be decided by Congress rather than just yielding to the executive. I think it's time for Congress to catch up with the rest of the country, bring our laws up to speed with our technology. And I support the amendment but I also support the Congress stepping in and doing something about it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK. Further discussion? Mr. Culberson's recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CULBERSON</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, support net neutrality. I want to prevent the internet service providers from throttling access to services for any customer, but I have a real concern this amendment as chairman Graves said, particularly the way it's drafted, that the amendment would prevent the Federal Communications Commission from reissuing a rule in substantially the same form. I'm not sure what substantially means. What -- how is that defined?  </p><p>      So I'm afraid that the -- while we are in agreement I believe with the spirit of what Mr. Price is doing, the amendment itself is not effective, unenforceable, undefinable, and I'm not sure how you'd ever make any sense out of what this amendment proposes to do. So I hope we'll find another opportunity to restore that neutrality but not do it here and do it in a more thoughtful, careful fashion.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentleman from Texas for his remarks. Mr. Cartwright from Pennsylvania is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARTWRIGHT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I speak in support of this amendment and I do thank Representatives Price and Serrano for their hard work on this matter. I also wish to associate myself with remarks of Mr. Kilmer. I think the free exchange of information and ideas is an essential principle in this country.  </p><p>      Every single one of our constituents wants net neutrality because they want to be assured they have access, choice, and freedom to get the internet content that they want. As such, I think the American people and the companies affected by this issue deserve some certainty on the matter.  </p><p>      That's why I hope, as Congressman Kilmer said, that, as a Congress, we can soon work in a bipartisan fashion to address this issue legislatively to let our voters know we are listening to their concerns and we are actively engaged on this issue. I urge support of the amendment. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion on the amendment? Mr. Pocan and then Ms. Lee.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">POCAN</emphasis>:  Sure. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I think the argument by the subcommittee chairman on this was that so many contacts -- 14,000 contacts proves it works. Well, the rule change just took effect this week so it did work, you're right.  </p><p>      The previous system worked very well. In fact, I had 12,983 contacts as of a month ago that were against the ruling and zero, zero for it. Now, to be fair, I did have a telecommunications lobbyist from my district stop by the other day, and he asked to be counted, so I am now up to 12,983 to 1.  </p><p>      But I think this is very similar in many of our districts. My small business owners don't want us to throttle the internet, my farmers don't want to have fast lanes, and the consumers don't want to. So this is something that the Senate took care of. Now it's in the hands of the House.  </p><p>      We could do a discharge petition, which I hope many of you will sign on to, but I think this is one where people are way, way, way ahead of us on this, and I strongly support this amendment. I thank the gentleman who introduced this and I hope we'll pass it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank the gentleman for his comments. Further discussion? Ms. Lee is recognized for some comments on the amendment, the Price amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me just associate myself with all the remarks that have been made and say a couple things about our democracy, really, in terms of the blow it's taken as it relates to the FCC rules mandating net neutrality.  </p><p>      This really is equal treatment of all content on the internet, and it was overturned by this new rule imposed by the chairman. Mr. Price's amendment is extremely important because it nullifies this new rule. Internet providers will be able to provide websites from loading or slow them down simply because they disagree with what the website says.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAYLOR</emphasis>:  Will the gentlelady?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Yes, I'll yield.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Gentleman's -- gentlelady's yielded.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAYLOR</emphasis>:  (inaudible). Will the gentlelady agree -- I think everybody agrees about the blocking and throttling and not stopping websites just because you don't agree with the content from up. Will the gentlelady -- that a lot of that -- some of the content you're speaking of is also from not ISPs, but on social media platforms. Will the gentlelady agree that those should also be regulated in the same ways so as to have that information come out and not be blocked or throttled, which does not -- does not address this amendment?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Let me reclaim my time please. This is really about freedom of speech and freedom of expression. OK? From entrepreneurs to advocates for social justice, the internet has been a powerful tool for everyone, especially communities of color, to revitalize our neighborhoods and draw attention really to the injustices in our society in order to change them.  </p><p>      And so this new repeal of the open internet rule -- it really kills this free expression and innovation and it kills it online. And it shouldn't be a partisan issue. It's opposed by 86 percent of the public, Democrats and Republicans understand what's at stake. So I urge a yes vote on this amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Ms. Lee. Mr. Ruppersberger has been very patient.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUPPERSBERGER</emphasis>:  Thank you. First, I support this amendment but the one thing that's become very clear to me is this whole process in what we're dealing with now needs to be dealt with with our Congress. The American people clearly feel passionately about this issue and we need to come up with a bipartisan legislative solution, so there is no ambiguity on the regulatory side, and future administrations continue to ping pong back and forth. Democrat and Republican, this issue is not good for American consumers or American businesses. Yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank the gentleman for his comments. A minute to close, Mr. Price is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's interesting to see members raise the bugaboo of regulation and as though there was any option here. We're talking about one FCC regulation versus another. OK? So make your choice.  </p><p>      It's the FCC regulation enacted after great care -- with great care in 2015 that, in fact, protected that level playing field that we all want to see. And I agree with the chairman, it's no time to mess with the internet.  </p><p>      The messing with the internet with this new regulation that overturns that carefully arrived at rule. Many members in this room have embraced the Congressional Review Act in dealing with regulations that they find objectionable over this last year. This takes the form of exactly that.  </p><p>      This is a -- this is a Congressional Review Act type amendment. It reflects what was done on a bipartisan basis in the Senate. It is something where the House needs to step up to the plate. And, for that reason, I urge the support of this amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Price. The question is on the Price amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.  </p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not agreed.

The amendment is not adopted.  </p><p>      Mr. Joyce, amendment number 1, you're recognized to present your amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have an amendment at the desk and ask that it be considered as read.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  It's considered read and the gentleman's recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My amendment -- my amendment simply put prohibits penalization of financial institutions solely because the institution provides financial services to an entity that involves a properly-registered state-compliant marijuana-related company.  </p><p>      To be clear, the business or entity must be operating within the laws of the state to avoid penalization. This is not about whether or not one approves of marijuana. This is about public safety and financial transparency.  </p><p>      While 46 states, 3 territories and the district now allow cannabis-related businesses to operate, our banks and credit unions cannot provide financial services to them. Strangely enough, ATMs are allowed inside dispensaries so one may withdraw funds from their bank to make a purchase in cash.  </p><p>      The situation is untenable. No industry can operate safely and transparently without access to banks or other financial institutions. To ensure these legitimate going concerns are safe, legitimate, and operating completely within the laws of the licensing state, we must allow them access to the financial system. I urge support of my amendment in the interests of financial transparency and public safety and reserve the balance of my time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentleman. Chairman Graves.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think I'll just leave it at this. I look forward to watching the committee hash this out for a little while.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Mr. Quigley.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUIGLEY</emphasis>:  I was tempted to say the opponents of this are dazed and confused, but I'll hold back. I do rise in support of the Joyce amendment. It is ridiculous that at a time when the majority of states allow some form of recreational or medical use that these businesses are forced to operate as all-cash operations, having no choice but to pay their taxes, employees' salaries, and rent with bags of cash.  </p><p>      When I think of an all-cash operation, I think of the mob or a cartel, not a legal, regulated business. We are effectively telling these businesses that they should operate like the black market, encouraging obscurity rather than transparency.  </p><p>      Additionally, by denying legal businesses access to banking services such as credit card processing and deposit revenues, a public safety risk is created. Recent headlines demonstrate this risk, reporting of robberies, home invasions, and other threats associated with possessing large sums of cash.  </p><p>      Regardless how each of us may view the legalization of marijuana, I think we all agree that financial institutions should be allowed to serve businesses that are operating legitimately. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, which respects states' rights and prioritizes public safety.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion on the Joyce amendment? I'm seeing a number of hands. Mr. Stewart is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEWART</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I do look forward to this, as the subcommittee chairman said a robust debate on this, but I'll be very brief. First, I'd like to point out there's some confusion and it's brought into this debate, there is a meaningful difference between medicinal marijuana and recreational use of marijuana.  </p><p>      That's not apples and oranges. That's apples and dinosaurs. These are very, very different issues. And don't conflate the two by saying, \"Well, some of these are used by those who are supporting the medicinal use.\"  </p><p>      I'm talking about the recreational use, which is, by the way, the vast majority of the use and the revenue generated by this. So ask yourself these very simple questions. Do you think it's a good idea generally to promote the use of -- recreational use of marijuana in our society? If you think that's a good thing, then support this.   </p><p>      Do you think it's good for our society generally to have more and more marijuana use, or less? If you think the answer is, \"More is better,\" then go ahead and support this amendment. If you think it's -- you want to legitimize the use of marijuana to our kids -- if you think that's a good idea, then support this amendment.  </p><p>      If you think it's a good idea to signal to the business community that having a marijuana dispensary is on par with having a car dealership or selling tires or any other business, then go ahead and support this amendment.  </p><p>      I, on the other, think we should discourage that type of use and one of the ways we discourage that is making it harder for these businesses to carry out their business. And if they're using all cash, then I say, \"You know what? They knew that going into this. Let them deal with it. Let's not help them and make it easier for them.\" And I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion? Ms. Lee is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Thank you very much. I rise in support of Mr. Joyce's amendment. This is a bipartisan proposal. It would prohibit federal agencies from unduly penalizing financial institutions for providing basic banking services to legitimate cannabis businesses in states where it's legal.  </p><p>      This amendment would ensure that legitimate business owners can comply with state regulations and help ensure that regulator and law enforcement officers can hold businesses accountable. And for the 46 states and jurisdictions that have passed cannabis reform laws, this amendment would provide important financial certainty to business owners, employees, government agencies, and financial institutions.  </p><p>      Now, regardless of how you feel about the legalization or decriminalization of cannabis, I think we all can agree that the state has made their own decisions to take action and to pass a range for various laws pertaining to medical or adult use cannabis.  </p><p>      It's become increasingly apparent that there is a need to align federal and state laws when it comes to addressing the banking crisis, which it is. Last year, the legal cannabis industry was worth around $10 billion but is largely forced to operate exclusively in cash.  </p><p>      These outdated and predatory policies are a major obstacle to these small businesses and only serve to undermine their financial security. Enforcing small businesses to operate as all-cash businesses, these policies make the jobs of state regulators and tax collectors unnecessarily difficult.  </p><p>      And it leaves these entrepreneurs, their employees, and the business itself vulnerable to dangerous criminal targeting. It's a matter of public safety and economic necessity. In fact, in California, a state treasurer has called for action to on the cannabis banking industry saying we all have an obligation to take reasonable and necessary steps to protect our citizens and ensure businesses operating legally within California are engaged fully in our banking and commerce -- excuse me, system.  </p><p>      And I've visited small businesses like these in my home district in Oakland, California and I know how that impacts these acts -- excuse me, I know how it impacts the lack of access to financial services.  </p><p>      Using these services will allow entrepreneurs and small businesses to ensure their financial security, grow their business, and better serve their communities. So I urge my colleagues to listen to legal and job creating businesses in your own districts where these laws have been passed and support this amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Ms. Lee. Dr. Harris is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  Thank you very much. You know, I'm going to speak in opposition to this amendment. You know, the last amendment we had dealt with medical marijuana. This is the incrementalism we're seeing. You know, when we -- when we restrained the Department of Justice a few weeks ago from enforcing federal law, it was medical marijuana.  </p><p>      This amendment is not about medical marijuana. It's about big marijuana businesses. You know, there's a reason why there are big dollars involved and lots of cash, because drug dealing makes a lot of money and it involves a lot of cash.  </p><p>      And no matter what we want -- no matter what other name we can call it, marijuana is a controlled substance, it's schedule one, it's drug dealing under federal law. And the gentleman from Utah is absolutely right, what we're doing, we pass this amendment so we're condoning drug dealing for recreational use.  </p><p>      And there may be small businesses involved, some of them maybe, but as soon as you the remove the financial obstacles, this is going to be big, big business. There are going to be big growers involved, big distributors involved. Pharma, move over, because now you've got a whole other industry dealing with drugs.  </p><p>      But this is just not my opinion. The other thing, by the way, is, you know, where do we stop with schedule one substances allowing banks to do it. What if, you know, some states -- I understand Oregon is considering legalizing heroin. So we're going to remove -- we're going to allow the banks to participate in that as well?  </p><p>      It's a slippery slope we don't want to go to. We really should have the argument about legalization first. But you don't have to take my opinion. I've got two letters here -- and I'll read briefly from them and then I'll ask they be entered into the record -- from the National Fraternal Order of Police -- represents 355,000 police officers in the United States.   </p><p>      Asking this committee -- and, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, you know because you got this letter today, asking this committee to please not pass this legislation. They say, quote, \"Public safety is threatened by the growing use of marijuana nationwide, with the greatest negative impact in states that no longer comport with existing federal law.\"  </p><p>      It's exactly what this -- who this amendment addresses. So this is from the National Fraternal Order of Police, but, if you don't believe National Fraternal Order (ph) of Police, the Major Cities Chiefs Association (sic) -- these are the police chiefs of major cities -- they say the facts are undeniable. The legalization of marijuana has only hindered local law enforcement's efforts to keep communities safe.   </p><p>      These are the people that our -- that men and women and families in this country trust to keep our community safe. Mr. Chairman, they plead with this committee not to pass this -- not to pass this amendment. Look, at some point, we might get to the point where this -- where this is in order. I think it's way premature. I will oppose the amendment. Thank you. I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Harris. And Ms. Pingree from Maine is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PINGREE</emphasis>:  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to speak in support of this bipartisan amendment. I disagree with my colleagues. I don't think this is how you -- this is not related to how you feel about legalizing marijuana.  </p><p>      In my state in 2016 with referendum, our voters voted to legalize marijuana. We already had medical marijuana. Then last month our legislature passed and even overrode a governor's veto statutory and regulatory framework.  </p><p>      So soon in our state, we're going to have businesses official operating selling marijuana as a business just as you would sell any legal product, because it is legal in our state. But these entrepreneurs are going to end up with one hand tied behind their back, unsure where they can get access to capital to start or expand their business and use the banking system.  </p><p>      I just had a visit from the Maine credit unions and they told me they are eager to help but they're worried about the risks of lending if federal regulators interfere based on federal law. The Joyce amendment would eliminate this risk, provide protection both for lenders and the businesses who need capital to serve their customers.  </p><p>      I agree with many of my colleagues who mentioned that this will help law enforcement. Without being able to use the banking system, you have businesses who are storing enormous amounts of cash from marijuana transactions and this is already happening with medical marijuana. It's unsafe. It's a recipe for abuse.   </p><p>      Access to regulated financial services will provide some peace of mind to businesses customers and the public. I just want to say further, I think one of the reasons that many of us are making basically exactly the same argument is because it is ludicrous to have a legal business that cannot use the banking system.  </p><p>      It promotes crime, it makes it difficult for these businesses and I wholeheartedly support this amendment for the benefit of my states and other states where this is legalized and hope my colleagues will do the same and I yield.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentleman -- gentlewoman for her remarks. Mr. Rogers, former Chairman Rogers, is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROGERS</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Might I ask, Mr. Joyce, what is the significance of the states that are mentioned in your amendment?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  I'm sorry, sir.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROGERS</emphasis>:  What is the significance of mentioning the states that you have in your amendment?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Because each one of the states...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Could you just repeat his question? Because I'm not sure everybody heard it. The significance of the states...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  The fine chairman asked what's the significance of the states that are listed in the amendment, and that is because only the states that have this -- some form of either medicinal or medicinal and recreational use -- are the ones that are listed there.  </p><p>      There are other states that have made this choice not to be involved and so therefore, you're trying to -- you're not bringing them into the system because they're not part of it. Only those states in which the state either legislature or the vote of the people has enacted the laws to allow a cannabis industry into their state.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROGERS</emphasis>:  Well, for states that do not want to legalize recreational marijuana, the involvement of the financial community, the banks, is one of the last remaining things that a state has to keep from legalizing marijuana in their state if that's what they want to do, because the bank by handling the cash from an illegal act in many states is an aider and an abettor. And can be and could be charged and convicted of conspiracy to violate the state law or the federal law. Always bear in mind, the federal law even today does not legalize recreational marijuana.  </p><p>      States, many states, some states have done the same. If they're not able to use the financial institution feature they were talking about, the states lose the last -- one of the last possible ways to keep from being legalized over their objection. And I don't think we should be telling a state what they should do about this matter.  </p><p>      The -- I'll close with this. All of the polls and all of the information and research that we've seen says that marijuana is the stepping stone particularly for young people toward opioid abuse, which boils my blood. I yield.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  The gentlewoman from Kentucky, Ms. McCollum is recognized. Thank you for your patience.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCOLLUM</emphasis>:  Thank you. I support the Joyce amendment which prevents funds from being used to penalize financial institutions that provide banking services to state legal marijuana businesses.  </p><p>      Now, you have the 46 states that have reformed their marijuana laws to allow for some form of medical or adult use. My home state of Minnesota for the gentleman from Utah recently legalized some forms of medical marijuana for use under certain circumstance, under a doctor's use.  </p><p>      And I'm going to read from the Minnesota Department of Health. For patients to receive medical cannabis, the law requires a licensed health care provider to certify that the patient has one or more of the qualifying conditions. A qualifying condition that your health care practitioner must certify that you have one of the qualifying conditions -- conditions.  </p><p>      And it's all spelled out here. The most compelling people to testify in Minnesota, we have very strict controls on how the medical marijuana is used, were parents of children with epilepsy. And what a game-changer it was for these children. And their parents were going to give up their jobs and sell their houses and go to states where they could have access to this transformational change for these young adults.  </p><p>      And there's other medical conditions in Minnesota in which it is prescribed and used too. So denying a state-sanctioned business that's operating entirely within the laws of their state and to keep them from banking is just irresponsible and it's a threat to public safety.  </p><p>      Why would we want a doctor who is legally prescribing under certain circumstances which is heavily regulated in Minnesota to be forced into a cash-only environment? We should be encouraging law-abiding citizens running small businesses to work with inner banking systems, not putting them at risk, not putting communities, not putting families that they serve in danger. This amendment for Minnesota and for many of us is not about legalizing marijuana. It is about safe banking. With that, I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks.   </p><p>      So Sheriff Rutherford is recognized and then, Mr. Amodei and any others, please do indicate. Yes, Mr. Ryan. Sheriff, you're recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RUTHERFORD</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, thank you. I rise to speak in opposition to this bill even though I think it's well-known that I support investigating and research for determining the efficacy of marijuana for medical purposes.  </p><p>      In fact, I was very involved in the state legislature in Florida a few years back when we actually had Charlotte's Web, which is a marijuana extract that was actually passed by a very conservative quite frankly Republican House and Senate in the state legislature. So I'm very much in favor of looking at marijuana from its medical use.  </p><p>      However, I also understand that from my time as sheriff that national -- transnational organizations, these cartels face two problems. Number one is bringing drugs into the country across our border. And the second is moving large amounts of cash back across the border.  </p><p>      And that is an opportunity as well to intervene in the drug trade affecting our country. And so one of the things those in the Justice Department have begun to see is a lot more attempts by drug cartels to actually move their money through wire transfers and banking operations, which is why DEA and others have begun to really focus on that as an element. And I'm really concerned about marrying together through these banking processes illicit and legal marijuana funds. So, for that reason, Mr. Chairman, I oppose the bill.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I think the gentleman for his remarks. Mr. Ryan is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYAN</emphasis>:  (inaudible) banks, credit unions looking to Congress for reassurance that if the state can do business (inaudible).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Ryan. Mr. Amodei is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AMODEI</emphasis>:  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  And then I see Mr. Aderholt and...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AMODEI</emphasis>:  Briefly and I want to thank my colleague from Ohio who's taken the first step but by coming from a state which regulates a few vices -- the record should reflect that nobody laughed when that last statement was -- there are some things that we should talk about here. It's like, OK, you want them to bank, great. That's fine with me. I get the public safety stuff, I get all that stuff.  </p><p>      But guess what, there's that regulatory piece and that law enforcement piece which if you're a regulated vice, guess what, those regulators and those law enforcement people get to come in and see your accounts any time they want.  </p><p>      They don't need to play hopscotch, they don't need a warrant. They want to make sure that you're doing business as that legally state licensed deal and that you haven't got folks from other countries in the hemisphere doing things. That's missing. That's very important.  </p><p>      And let me just tell you one other thing and I know it's not within this committee's jurisdiction, but if you're going to let these folks access that banking system, which is regulated state and federally, I can assure you that whether it's the Buckeye State or the whodunit state on the list, they're getting tax revenue from it.  </p><p>      And so to just give it away for no tax revenue, if we've learned anything in terms of alcohol and other vices, tobacco as an instance, then guess what, alcohol is taxed federally and tobacco is taxed federally.  </p><p>      Why would this be exempt? And this bill, this amendment, which I want to support but I ain't giving it away for nothing. So with all due respect, if we really want to do it and I want to do it, we ought to get some tax revenue out of it, learn those lessons with tobacco and alcohol. And, by the way, we ought to be able to check on the records any time we want so all this sanctity and virginity in the state stuff is confirmed by the feds. Thank you. Good evening. And God bless vices.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Oh, boy. Mr. Aderholt I believe wishes to be recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ADERHOLT</emphasis>:  Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  In the wake of Mr. Amodei's remarks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ADERHOLT</emphasis>:  yes, I just -- well, I'll be brief. I just wanted to say certainly we don't oppose the person bringing the amendment but we do have -- there are some concerns that I think many of us have about the amendment itself.  </p><p>      I just received a note from the sheriffs from Alabama and they had indicated to me they're very much concerned about the amendment. And so I would say that the timing on this is definitely not right and we need to hold off on this amendment, in all due respect to its sponsor. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK. Anything -- yes, Ms. Kaptur is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAPTUR</emphasis>:  Yes, I just wanted to say -- put a couple facts out there. Former Speaker of the House John Boehner, according to press reports. who was from the state of Ohio as some people might be -- remember -- he's changed and now serves on the board of a company called Acreage Holdings -- a company that cultivates, processes, and dispenses cannabis, OK?   </p><p>      So it's just interesting some of the things that happen around here. I don't know what that means. That's what I read in the newspaper. I haven't had a chance to ask him about that.  </p><p>      The other thing I just want to mention -- and I know Congressman Joyce is very careful is his wording, but, you know, in my district, they're cutting marijuana with black tar heroin and fentanyl now. People are dying of it. And I don't know how you separate this.  </p><p>      I don't know how you -- I voted for medical marijuana, thinking it would be tightly regulated, and I'm not sure what we have right now in our country. All I know is, in Ohio, we have such an epidemic. I just left another sheriff in one of our counties and he needed money for more officers and all of the deputy chiefs, everybody that's worked in -- I'll tell you the county, Lorain County, Ohio, they were asking me for help from the federal government to hire more officers just to deal with the -- what is occurring in that one location, and that's only one of 88 counties in deep trouble because of addiction and deaths related to these substances.  </p><p>      So I just -- I'm uncomfortable -- I want to support my colleague from Ohio and he's probably very well-intentioned. I just think that some of this has implications beyond what maybe some of us even completely understand and with some states having some laws and other states not having those laws, pretty soon we're going to get an amendment up here to have state reciprocity just like we do with guns. If you can, you know, conceal and carry in Indiana, then can you walk it into Ohio or vice versa, well, what's the difference with this?  </p><p>      So I'm just -- I am -- we have an epidemic in this country and I want to trace the money. I want -- I want to do that, but I am very -- and you want it to be in sunshine, right? You want to do what's right. I just am not sure this amendment at this time, maybe, and it doesn't say medical marijuana in the -- in the amendment. And for me, that is a -- that is a troubling factor. So I just wanted to put that on the record and I thank you and I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Ms. Kaptur. Mr. Jenkins would like to be recognized. You are recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JENKINS</emphasis>:  Would the sponsor of the amendment yield?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Absolutely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JENKINS</emphasis>:  Thank you. I'm really struggling with this because I'm a states right guy, but I'm also concerned about the slippery slope and I know West Virginia is listed on this and West Virginia has legalized medical marijuana non-combustible, so very narrow sliver, but already since that's passed there's been legislative efforts at the state level to expand that and I think every state wherever you are in the spectrum, your state is probably going to be pushing for expansion at some point in time, number one.  </p><p>      I assume once your state is named here and it says whatever the state laws, as the state law expands, so too would, obviously, the financial institution's ability to service that, so you're not locked in to whatever the state of the law is in your state at the point of passage of this.  </p><p>      So if you went from medical marijuana to full recreational, this would still give carte blanche ability for financial institutions without concern of penalty service the recreational even though you maybe medical today only  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Correct.  </p><p>      OK, secondly, are there other regulatory aspects we know just as Dr. Harris referenced a week or two ago DHA in the limited area of medical marijuana. While, this is not limited to medical marijuana, this is dealing with financial institutions, are there other regulatory entities at the federal level that the marijuana industry is concerned about and we're going to be -- we're taking care of financial institutions today, are there other folks on down the pike that are going to be given labors potentially if we should so choose.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  I can't answer that with specificity because I have not looked through every single regulatory agency to figure all that out.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JENKINS</emphasis>:  We're taking care of law enforcement, we're taking care of financial institutions of this in the past, are there others in the queue potentially?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  One thing that was brought up at the last hearing we had in which we talked about the law enforcement aspects in the CJS hearing and I fully agree with my friend from Maryland, Dr. Harris, there needs to be research. We need to know in states where you have -- where now it is legal, what is the amount that someone can operate machinery under? At what point they come to work? You're going to have other going concerns that have people employed by them, at what point do they have to worry that this person shouldn't be operating machinery, this person shouldn't be behind the desk, shouldn't be operating a computer?  </p><p>      We need to have the research. As we've talked about before, it's sort of a chicken and egg thing because right now we're denying state universities and others the ability to do the research until we pass something. And obviously, as an institution, we don't have the guts to get this done and this absolutely changed my mind similar to my dear friend John Boehner who has said his thinking has evolved as well as others here that it was Sam Farr, a member of this committee that was telling me that in California he had a fine V.A. hospital. The V.A. hospital was not allowed to give medicine that would treat PTSD for our soldiers and had found to be effective, was not allowed to do it in his hospital. And the more I think about it, and the more I've watched, we continue to grow the industry, but we continue to act like it doesn't exist.  </p><p>      Well, you know, we talk about illegal drug dealers. This takes them off the street. This -- this takes it -- yes, it does legitimize it, but we have to think of prohibition. How did that work? I know we have a thing and I agree completely with Mr. Amodei with the fact that we should have these financial institutions, everything should be above board, everything should be transparent, every member of the 40-16th that has voted for his should know exactly how much is being sold and track it like they do right now from seed to sale and be able to know exactly what this is, and so deal with it accordingly.  </p><p>      And we consider the -- we consider the...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Mr. Jenkins, this is your time. Are you yielding? Did you yield?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JENKINS</emphasis>:  I yield back. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Ms. Herrera Beutler is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HERRERA BEUTLER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I think the sponsor of this amendment is touching on just how difficult -- I shouldn't say that, just how complex this issue is. There are so many far reaching facets. I -- I, you know, I'm from a state that has legalized recreational marijuana, and I wish we hadn't. I did a call with my school superintendents, my police chiefs and my sheriffs, I wanted to talk about the state of our schools and our kids and what they thought would help.  </p><p>      And I fully expected them to start the whole conversation off talking about guns and they spent the first 10 or 15 minutes talking about the harm that the use of recreational marijuana has done in our schools with our kids. I was flabbergasted. And now, I recognize this is with regards to medical or medicinal marijuana, and that's a subject, I can't remember who said it, you know, it's one I support. You know, I -- I have talked to parents who have very young children who suffered major seizure disorders who have found types or use for medical marijuana and obviously not smoking it, but there's a way to extract and they've seen a benefit. And boy, if I was that mom, I'd do everything possible, right?  </p><p>      So I get that and I support that. But my concern with this amendment is we're doing it here and now, at this hour, with this short amount of time, without the input of all of our colleagues when this is an issue that is so much bigger than -- we had a one-year appropriations bill. There are so many valid points on this.   </p><p>      And I just -- I -- the reason I am not going to be able to support it is because I'm too -- until you've sat next to a drug addict at a roundtable who has looked at you and says (ph), \"The biggest mistake you folks ever made was legalizing recreational marijuana,\" and I'm sitting there going, \"First of all, I didn't do it\" -- but when his heart is breaking, he's telling you that -- it just causes me to want to pause this effort here.  </p><p>      Now, there are good people on all sides of this. I've talked with my credit unions too, but I don't think that this is the place to do it. And I'm not saying that as a punt. I'm saying I want to get this right. So with that, I unfortunately oppose the gentleman's amendment and I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentlelady for yielding. Judge Carter of Texas is recognized for time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARTER</emphasis>:  I apologize for my voice today, but I want to say if there's $900,000 in cash in a marijuana shop, garage some place because they can't get in the banking system, then there's $900 million worth of marijuana cash somewhere in the cartel system. The cartels run the marijuana in Mexico in a gigantic way and Mr. Harris is right, the second problem they have is what to do with cash?  </p><p>      They have the same problem with that marijuana shop guy's got. Now, if we make it legal for people to do it in the United States, then they're either going to offer some major incentives to get illegal marijuana trade into our banking system or they're going to do what they do down on the border, they'll cut somebody's hand or leg off to convince them to put marijuana in their system. And dollars don't look any different -- $900,000 don't look any different whether it's legal or illegal. I think this is something we need to think out.  </p><p>      There's a reason we have laws to restrict cash deposits, it's so we can find illicit drug trade. That's why we have that law. If we are waiving it, we're running into a problem, and law enforcement will not like it. I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Yield. The chairman has asked for time. I yield some of my time to you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And first, let me just commend the committee, this is one -- been one of the most respectful in-depth debates I think we've -- we've had as a committee and it's -- it's really compelling and amazing arguments on both sides. The one clarity that I pulled out of all of these is that there is not lack of support for the concept of -- of bringing what is known as a gray area in the financial market to something of a little bit better understanding, nor is there a lack of desire to help those who truly need and desire to have assistance through medicinal purposes.  </p><p>      But I do sense that this committee is not ready to take the leap to the next step. And I -- I respect that. I know we've debated the previous amendment and the -- and the other bill, I think it was Mr. Culberson's bill, that was medicinal only and I think we've embraced that in a different -- different fashion.  </p><p>      So Mr. Chairman, as I -- as I look at this, I think this -- this committee has done remarkable here. I'd point out a couple of things, if these were to be adopted, this would be a one-year solution potentially if it is enacted into law and that could create some more disparity and uncertainty as we look ahead. But let it be known that this committee really cares about our constituents and if we could provide assistance medicinally, I think I've heard that here.  </p><p>      And Mr. Joyce said if this were not to prevail today, I hope you'll continue the effort and maybe in incremental steps, but we have recognized a tremendous class and that's the states versus the federal government. And they're out there on this. And we must come together and sort through this and work through this together.  </p><p>      But let me just thank each and every committee member who chose to voice your opinions. This has been a fantastic debate and discussion. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Reclaiming my time. I am -- basically I think at times a facilitator and mediator as chairman of this committee, but I have definite opinions about the legalization of marijuana. In New Jersey, we have medicinal marijuana and certainly we understand this as it described the plight of sometimes children and adults in the most excruciating pain that have been -- that should have access whether they're veterans or non-veterans, I think they basically should have access.  </p><p>      But I visit about 90 schools a year, juniors and seniors in high school, some elementary schools, and the question is always, they say what are we going to ask this dinosaur? Do you believe in the legalization of marijuana? And I say, you know, I know in this room that you are often in middle school, eighth grade, and juniors and seniors in high school, you're adult enough we hope to make the right decisions.  </p><p>      But what worries me and I say to them quite blankly, I worry about the availability of your younger brothers and sisters and I'm sympathetic to the plight of the banking industry and people who have large cash, you know, sitting in some safe or under the counter and I understand that this is -- this is the outgrowth of this legalization movement and maybe I'm on the wrong side of history.  </p><p>      But I feel extremely uncomfortable without moving ahead with this amendment. I think it's just that the tone of the discussion here, I feel that some of you share those same concerns and I think it's about time we call for a vote and I don't think there's any further, I get the last word. You have the last word, a minute to close, Mr. Joyce.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  I thank you very much Mr. Chairman. And I certainly appreciate the -- the debate we had here. I certainly wish we could have a debate like this on the floor. The sad part about it is that sometimes we conflate the different issues, and, if you would take the opportunity to see how these agencies and dispensaries are working, one has to show their license. They have to be over 21.   </p><p>      It eliminates this black-market trade. It keeps it from getting to kids which is important for all law enforcement. I certainly spent 25 years making that happen. I know you have your ideas, but, you know, we got to talk about reality. Kids are going to find marijuana just like they find alcohol and other things.  </p><p>      But the only way we can do it is bring the -- the -- bring this money into the system so we know what we're dealing with and be able to talk apples to apples why we're doing this. And just so I may provide a little bit of insight here, the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, said just this afternoon -- said marijuana use is permitted in (ph) some states, but not by federal law. He said the disparity puts federal regulators in a very difficult position and the Fed would love to see this hazy issue clarified.  </p><p>      The idea of putting this out today was to try to remove this cloud, was to try to bring the transparency that my friend, Mr. Amodei, has talked about and tried to put it out there in those states which this has been legislated or voted on by the will of the people. We represent the people, I may not be in favor of some things, but, you know, when the people want it, we should represent their interest.  </p><p>      With that, I would ask each and every member here, I would urge them to support my amendment and I surrender the balance of my time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK, the question is on the Joyce amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those who oppose, say nay.  </p><p>      In the opinion of the chair -- thank you so much. Yes, the opinion of the chair -- I -- I think the nays have it.   </p><p>      Any further amendments? Yes. Mr. Cartwright?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARTWRIGHT</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, amendment number 1. I ask that it be considered read.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Considered read. The gentleman is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARTWRIGHT</emphasis>:  Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Quigley and all the committee staff for your hard work on this bill. I offer this amendment that would simply strike a harmful provision from the bill that limits investment transparency. The provision would, if enacted, ban the Securities and Exchange Commission from enacting a rule requiring publicly traded companies to disclose how they spend shareholder funds on political contributions.  </p><p>      I think such a prohibition on SEC's rulemaking ability goes against the idea of free markets. Free open markets work because of disclosures. Disclosures are the foundation of our financial system. Disclosures keep the market transparent. Disclosures separate us from rigged stock exchanges where the government picks where you get to invest the way they do in China. Disclosures ensure investors know where their money goes.  </p><p>      And this is not unwarranted or unwanted rulemaking. More than 1.2 million investors and citizens have called for the SEC to go forward with this disclosure requirement, banning the SEC from doing its job to regulate the stock market and protect investors' interests has no place in the appropriations bill or any bill for that matter. Without this amendment, investors will be kept in the dark as to where their money is being spent and as to what policies it ends up supporting.  </p><p>      The great American marketplace of ideas demands more transparency, not less. For these reasons, I urge everyone to support my amendment. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the -- the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his remarks. Chairman Graves?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Unfortunately, I have to rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment. The SEC is certainly not an expert at all in this area of campaign finance nor is it set up to be an expert in campaign finance or disclosure whatsoever. We have a commission for that at the FEC. They do -- they do a great job. They're very zealous I might add and they've got exclusive jurisdiction over all the campaign finance laws.  </p><p>      Now, I'd point out for the committee, the bill does not preclude, prohibit any public company from reporting their political spending if their shareholders choose. So an opt-in is certainly available. I appreciate the gentleman's concerns in this area. We've had discussions in the past, but with that, I'd have to oppose the amendment. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Mr. Quigley is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUIGLEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of this amendment. As Justice Brandeis said, the sunlight is the best of disinfectants. In recent years, the Supreme Court decisions like Citizens United and McCutcheon have cast a dark shadow over democracy allowing the voices of every day Americans to be easily drowned out by corporations, shadowy front groups and a handful of billionaires. Just look at the language embedded every year since 2016 in this bill.  </p><p>      The ability of corporate executives to spend company resources for political purposes raises significant concerns. Without transparency or disclosures, corporations are free to spend funds invested by shareholders without accountability. Reducing the role of corporate influence in our electoral process requires a comprehensive approach and that includes reinstating the SEC role to require publicly traded companies to disclose their political spending. I urge the adoption of this amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion? If not, I look to the gentleman, for a minute to close, from Pennsylvania.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARTWRIGHT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's true, under Citizens United for better or worse, the Supreme Court of the United States has told us that money is speech. And if we're going to give the megaphone to corporations, shouldn't we also give investors the right to know what they're lending their voices to when they invest in their corporations?  </p><p>      Keeping this provision in the bill is simply a handout to corporate interests at the expense of investors and open markets. We owe our constituents open, transparent markets and the protection that inherently follows with them. Please join me in supporting transparency by voting yes on this amendment. I yield back, and thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentleman. The question is on the Cartwright amendment. All of those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.  </p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not agreed to.   </p><p>      Further amendment? Ms. Lee is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  I have an amendment at the desk. This is Lee amendment number 1.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Would you consider it read?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Unanimous consent to dispense with the reading.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  We're pleased to recognize you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Thank you. Mr. Chairman, this is very simple. It would strike Section 810 of the bill which is yet another Republican ideological rider. This policy rider which bans federal funds appropriated for the District of Columbia to pay for abortion services is a clear violation of the District's home rule and is dangerous to the health of the women in the District of Columbia.  </p><p>      Year after year, I have stood in this committee along with our ranking member to highlight just how detrimental this policy rider really is. No other jurisdiction or state is told how to use its own locally raised revenue, yet this committee is prepared to once again vote to force Congress's view on the District of Columbia. We should never be in the business of denying a woman's reproductive health coverage because of her race, her ethnicity, her source of insurance, income or where she lives, yet that's exactly what this policy rider does.  </p><p>      It specifically targets women of color and low-income women in the District. In fact, 93 percent of the Washingtonians whose access to abortion care is restricted by this ban are women of color and we know that a woman who seeks an abortion but is denied is more likely to fall into poverty than one who has access to their full range of reproductive choices including abortions.  </p><p>      We already know that since 1973, the very terrible Hyde amendment has prohibited use of federal funds to provide or promote abortion services. Now, my personal view is that the Hyde amendment should be overturned, but the unfortunate fact of the matter is that the removal of the D.C. abortion ban would not alter the current prohibition against federal funding of abortion services. And of course, this rider is just another example of members of Congress trampling over the rights of D.C. residents and denying D.C. taxpayers the freedom to make their own decisions, their own decisions about how local funds should be used.  </p><p>      So for many reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Ms. Lee. Chairman Graves.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I'd rise in opposition to the amendment. I know the gentlelady raises this issue each year, but D.C. local funds limitation has been in place every year, every year since 1996 with the exception of one year. And I would I guess commend to the committee here that we should make it two years. Let's -- let's keep this streak going, let's keep it going and I'd oppose the amendment and ask the committee to continue with the current position of the bill.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentleman. Mr. Quigley is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUIGLEY</emphasis>:  Having a right and being able to access that right are two very different things. The sad truth is that women with resources can choose whether or not to grow their families while women without resources are left with no choice or they struggle to make ends meet.  </p><p>      Choice is the heart of this issue, but it's not a choice for us to make. It's the choice for women and their families, a choice between women and their doctors. I never understood this contradiction in my mind with being a conservative. I always felt that we are being told that it's not for government to tell people what to do, how to handle their own situations and their personal situations.  </p><p>      This is as intimate a decision as there is and you're intruding upon that. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentleman. Ms. DeLauro is recognized. And then I see some additional hands. Mr. Price and Ms. Clark and others.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DELAURO</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I speak in support of the amendment put forward by our colleague, Congresswoman Lee. It strikes the language. It bans the use of the District of Columbia funded abortions. In 2011, the majority successfully prohibited the District of Columbia from using its own locally raised revenues to cover abortions for women living in the city.  </p><p>      According to the family, the Kaiser Family Foundation, the ban impacted the health care choices of almost 60,000 women in 2013 alone. The residents and government of Washington, D.C. should be able to determine how they want to use their local resources without congressional interference just like any other state. In fact, it strikes me as ironic that while this majority continually claims to support the sovereignty of local governments in health care, they seek to restrict the District of Columbia's ability to make its own decisions about its own funds.  </p><p>      To this end, this is about a right for women to make their own decisions with their family and with their doctors, with clergy. It is also about trusting women to make these decisions. I share this belief with the majority of the American people who support Roe v. Wade and the right to a safe and legal abortion in this country, but the majority would rather take us back to a time when women could not make their own health care decisions.  </p><p>      We must promote and protect the rights of every woman, every family, every American to make their own family planning decisions. Congresswoman Lee's amendment would do so. It would help reverse the majority's attack on women's rights and the -- the autonomy of the District of Columbia. I urge my colleagues to support it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you Ms. DeLauro. Ms. Lowey is recognized, the ranking member.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOWEY</emphasis>:  I rise in strong support of this amendment. Yet again, the majority is wasting time in an attempt to prevent the District of Columbia from using its own funds to safe legal health services. If you want to dictate what should be done with local dollars, you ought to run for the D.C. council, but for now, none of us were elected to force a hyper-partisan ideologically driven agenda on the residents of Washington.  </p><p>      Let me be very clear, lack of public funding for health services creates a grave financial burden for already struggling families. It forces women to make an impossible choice between paying out of pocket for reproductive health care services or for basic necessities like groceries for their families. This restriction frankly is a slap in the face to all District residents, many of whom are sitting in this room as members of our staff.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Ms. Clark is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARK</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yet again, here we are talking about attacking women's rights instead of listening to what women and families actually need. Women in my district need safe and respectful work environments where they're paid equally for equal work. Women in my district need affordable child care so they can make decisions about their work-life balance that's what -- that's what is about what's right for their families, not what they have to do out of necessity.  </p><p>      Women in my district need affordable quality health care, but what we're talking about today is a bill that tells women they don't have a right to plan their own families and that politicians should have more of a say in their health care decisions than they do. Women in my district deserve to make their own medical decisions and so do the women of Washington, D.C. You should not be telling women that being a D.C. resident means you sign away your right to make private choices about your own health care. Congress should not be placing itself between women and their doctors.  </p><p>      The District of Columbia has the right to use its own locally raised funds to offer necessary health coverage to its citizens. I adamantly support the gentlewoman from California's amendment to strike this regressive and inappropriate restriction. I urge my colleagues to get back to work for women and families and support this amendment. I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Ms. Clark. Mr. Price and then Ms. Wasserman Schultz will be recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm happy to join with Ms. Lee in sponsoring this amendment. It would remove the poison bill rider that denies coverage for the full range of reproductive health services including abortion care for women enrolled in D.C. Medicaid.  </p><p>      Federal insurance coverage of abortion care is already restricted, except in limited circumstances. I personally take issue with that policy, but our amendment addresses an even more prescriptive rider, because currently all 50 states have the autonomy to determine how to spend their own money, their locally raised Medicaid dollars, including whether or not this non-federal funding could be used for abortion coverage.  </p><p>      Frustratingly, Congress routinely denies that option for Medicaid beneficiaries in Washington, D.C. This restriction overrides the will of D.C.'s own elected officials, withholds comprehensive health care coverage for women in the capital. The D.C. abortion ban disproportionately affects women and families of color, immigrants, youth and low-income individuals many of whom already have a hard time accessing equitable and competent care.  </p><p>      So we need to end this policy that treats Washingtonians differently than all other Americans. The members of the House Appropriations Committee were not elected to represent D.C. residents and we shouldn't be in the business of legislating their health care. Every woman deserves to make their own health care decisions without congressional interferences and that should be regardless of her ZIP Code or her insurance coverage. I urge the adoption of the amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Price. Ms. Wasserman Schultz is recognized for time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WASSERMAN SCHULTZ</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Study after study shows that placing strict limits on abortion coverage can have a profound impact on those who already face significant barriers to care, such as low income individuals, immigrants, youth, women of color and transgender and gender non-conforming individuals.  </p><p>      According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 59,800 non-elderly Medicaid enrolled women whose access is affected by this ban resided in D.C. in 2013. In 2011, of the Washingtonians whose access to abortion care is restricted by the local funds ban, the vast majority, 93 percent, were people of color. To make matters worse, these studies have also shown that poor women are often forced to use money that would have been spent for rent, utility bills, food and clothing for themselves and their families in order to be able to pay for abortion services. In fact, almost 60 percent of Medicaid-eligible women reported that paying for an abortion presented serious burdens compared with only 26 percent of women not eligible for Medicaid.  </p><p>      Forcing those who already face obstacles in accessing health care to make choices like whether to pay rent or obtain medically necessary reproductive health care is not only wrong, it is shameful. Sadly, the D.C. ban is not only bad policy, but it also violates the spirit of the Supreme Court's decisions in Harris versus McRae which clearly asserted that state funds used to provide abortion services for low income women is a state, not federal decision.  </p><p>      For a party that prides itself on support for strong and local governments, my Republican colleagues sure have a funny way of showing it. The District of Columbia should have the same ability to control its own tax powers as the 50 states including having the option to support -- to provide support to low income women with its local tax dollars. Consistently we hear a states' right argument from republicans, unless it's inconvenient to their -- their alternative points of view.  </p><p>      There's no consistency here on the part of the party and this damaging language in this bill that's carried every year except one should be dropped because it shouldn't have ever been carried in the first place. I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentlewoman. Ms. Lee, a minute to close.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, let me just say since it's been offered in place since 1996 really doesn't make it right, and it is discrimination against women in the District. D.C. is the only area in the country with this federally mandated prohibition, why should we force this on the District of Columbia?   </p><p>      I have to ask you, my colleagues, do you want us to interfere in your local districts and legislate what they can use their local money for? It's their own money. It's not federal tax dollars. Their duly elected representative who is here with this, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton -- she has spoken out strongly against the imposition of nonresident members of Congress' ideology -- placing your ideology on her district, even when some of those same members attempted to silence her voice.  </p><p>      A woman in the District of Columbia struggling in to make ends meet must have the ability to make important personal decisions with her own physician based on what is best for her family and her circumstances. It's time that Congress stopped playing politics with D.C.'s home rule and with the health of its women in residence and in this ideological posturing, you really wouldn't want me coming into your district advocating a policy to get your districts to stop using their own funds for what they want to use them to, this is downright wrong.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentlewoman.

The ayes are 22, the nays are 29, 29, the amendment is not agreed to. We have six more amendments to do. Mr. Ryan is recognized to -- for his amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYAN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  It's considered read?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYAN</emphasis>:  You can read it, because it's only a line.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLERK</emphasis>:  \"An amendment offered Mr. Ryan. In section 818, strike 'none of the funds' and insert 'none of the federal funds.'\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Gentleman is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYAN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Section 818 is a new provision prohibiting federal and local funds from being used to carry out the Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act or RHNDA, a law passed by the D.C. Council in 2014. RHNDA protects employees working in the District of Columbia from workplace discrimination based on their reproductive health decisions and those of their spouses and dependents.  </p><p>      Under this law, an employer cannot fire a woman for having an abortion after a rape or for using in vitro fertilization to address infertility. It prohibits an employer from reducing the salary of a man who uses condoms for family planning or a parent who buys birth control for a son or daughter in college.  </p><p>      As written, section 818 prohibits the District of Columbia from using any funds including local funds consisting solely of local taxes and fees to carry out RHNDA. This provision represents the sixth attempt by Congress to undermine this nondiscrimination law since 2015, but the first time this RHNDA rider has been included in the underlying financial services appropriations bill.  </p><p>      Unlike the D.C. Council, no member of this committee or this Congress was elected to legislate on local D.C. issues. The inclusion of section 818 is undemocratic, a violation of the majority stated belief, and local control, and autonomy, and yet another insult to D.C. residents, some of whom are staffers, their spouses, and their children. To remedy this, my amendment inserts federal before funds, restoring the District of Columbia's ability to spend its local funds to carry out RHNDA's mission.  </p><p>      In anticipation of possible objections to my amendment, let me be clear about what RHNDA does not do. It does not discriminate against churches or religious organizations. It applies to all employers, and the law protects religious liberty by ensuring every employee in D.C. can follow his or her religious or moral beliefs when making health care decisions without fear of retaliation.   </p><p>      It does not force employers to cover elective abortions in their health insurance plans. RHNDA is clear on this. The law states this section shall not be construed to require an employer to provide insurance coverage related to a reproductive health decision.  </p><p>      There's absolutely no ambiguity here, it does not require pro-life organizations to hire individuals who advocate for abortion, it protects employees decisions regarding their own reproductive health, their beliefs about reproductive health are outside the scope of the law, organizations can still make employment decisions based on religion and political views, and employees must be willing to carry out employers' missions and directives.  </p><p>      In short, RHNDA is not about religious liberty, it's about basic workplace fairness, employees should be judged by their employers solely on job performance, not on the reproductive health decisions they make outside of work. I strongly urge my colleagues to support my amendment and allow the District of Columbia to spend its local funds protecting employees from workplaces.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentleman for his comments. Mr. Graves is recognized, the chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, the majority opposes the amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Mr. Quigley is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUIGLEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I've spent nine and a half years in this city for some period of time, it's not Chicago, but it's is a place I would live, I think the only reservation I would have is that it's a jurisdiction largely controlled by an outside government, and that's us.  </p><p>      Every year we mark up this bill, we discover how many of our colleagues aspire to a seat on the District of Columbia City Council by asking not to carry out that urge at the expense of the right of the people of the District to govern themselves as they see fit and to spend their tax dollars as they see fit. I urge the support of this amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion on the Ryan amendment? Otherwise, the gentleman has a minute to close. It's on, Ms. Lee. Excuse me. Apologies.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Ms. Lee is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Once again, I rise in strong support of Congressman Ryan's amendment, once again, another anti-D.C. rider, another anti-woman rider. This is a new rider that prohibits the District of Columbia from implementing a law, the Reproductive Health Nondiscrimination Amendment Act of 2014, that the D.C. Council passed unanimously. This rider is about violating D.C. Home Rule and protecting women's access to care. All women, regardless of their ZIP Code, their income, or their employer, should have the ability to make private decisions regarding their health care. D.C.'s bill simply ensures that employees can make their own reproductive health decisions without interference or fear of retribution from their employers.  </p><p>      Unfortunately, my colleagues will stop at nothing -- short of nothing to limit women's access to reproductive health care and to trample on D.C.'s autonomy. Members of Congress who are not accountable to the residents of the District of Columbia should not interfere with D.C. local laws.  </p><p>      Once again, it's hard for me to imagine why in the world you continue to do this. These are ideological attacks on women's health. We have no business getting into the business of the District of Columbia. They passed their legislation unanimously. Again, you don't want me coming to your districts, advocating for something to -- you know, that you may not like, that they're trying to do with their own local funds.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Ms. Lee. And Mr. Serrano is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SERRANO</emphasis>:  Very briefly. For years I've said this and I haven't said it recently. Washington, D.C. has become the playground for so many members of Congress to do whatever they want to do.   </p><p>      In other words, when they go back home to get asked, \"How do you feel about school vouchers?\" \"Well, I'm for them.\" \"You are?\" \"Yes, in Washington D.C.\" \"How do you feel about marijuana?\" \"I'm against it.\" \"You are?\" \"Yes, in Washington D.C.\" \"Abortions?\" \"Well, I'm against them.\" \"Where?\" \"In D.C.\"  </p><p>      And D.C. becomes the place that gives you people cover for saying they are for or against certain issues and they use it as if there was no respect for human beings that work and live in that community called Washington, D.C. And I think it's time that we realize that we have to treat people with dignity and respect, but it will fall on deaf ears and we will continue to do this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  No further discussion. Mr. Ryan has a minute to close.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYAN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to remind my colleagues what this amendment is about. It's not about religious liberty. It is not about abortion. It's about basic workplace fairness. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support my amendment and allow the District of Columbia to spend local funds protecting employees from workplace discrimination. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you. I thank the gentleman. The question's on the Ryan amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.  </p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not agreed to.   </p><p>      Further amendments? Ms. Kaptur has an amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAPTUR</emphasis>:  Yes, I have an amendment at the desk, please.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Would you consider it read?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAPTUR</emphasis>:  I would ask it be considered as read.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  The gentlewoman is recognized to speak on her amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAPTUR</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAPTUR</emphasis>:  My amendment essentially would strike Titles 9, 10 and 11 in our bill, which comprise about a good 30 percent or more of the bill itself, starting on page 168. And what this comprises is the -- what's called The Choice Act, I would like to call it the Wrong Choice Act, and it involves financial institution regulation.  </p><p>      The last time I looked, the financial institutions, especially the Wall Street based ones are doing quite well in our country. All their profits are up and just coincidentally, they happen to be the largest contributors both to presidential and congressional elections. Isn't that something? So, what this section that I'm seeking to eliminate does, it authorizes on an appropriation bill at a very egregious level. Unbelievable.  </p><p>      I like to call it the Wrong Choice Act, has been passed on the floor of Congress several times, so why do we need to stick it in an appropriation bill? And I would really ask the majority, you think you're really going to sneak this past the Senate? So, it must be being put in here for some other reason, and I can only imagine what that might be. This bill keeps coming back from the dead.  </p><p>      So, I just have to say this for the record because I have served here for a while, and had to bear in my state the cost of Wall Street egregiousness, and I go back to the financial crisis of 2008, when Wall Street gambled away the individual fortunes of millions and millions of Americans amounting to well over $12 trillion, and I think only one fellow went to jail up there. His initials were B.M. But the rest of them didn't, and our people are still digging out of what happened.  </p><p>      Now, this Wrong Choice Act functionally kills the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which I know a lot of people don't like. Let me just put it in perspective. So, they took away $12 trillion from the American people and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau got back $12 billion, $12 billion. And people make a big deal out of that, it is nothing compared to what was taken away from people in my state and other places. Now, just let me read a couple words, I can't give you every page, but what this actually does, it changes the law regarding angel investors. I hope everybody knows what those are:  registration exemptions for mergers and acquisition brokers. How interesting. This is also -- shell companies, a shell company that is formed by an entity that is not a shell company, you define that for me.  </p><p>      How about truth in lending, changes in that? Exemptions -- really interesting use of words in several sections. And I just would say to my colleagues, you may not remember what collateralized debt obligations were or derivatives, but I sure do. And you'll give them an inch, and they will take not just a mile.  </p><p>      And so, I would urge my colleagues to take this authorizing language, and it's just not two words. Mr. Joyce's amendment was fairly concise. But they throw out the emergency mechanism that prevents future taxpayer bailouts throughout the emergency mechanism, why is that a good thing? Let me just put on the record also that the individuals who are pushing these kinds of changes are doing very well. Jamie Dimon, the CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, just in his salary, earns $28 million a year.  </p><p>      James Gorman of Morgan Stanley makes $23 million. Now this doesn't include all their holdings, this is just the raw salary. Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs makes $22 million a year. Brian Moynihan of Bank of America makes $20 million a year. All these folks who are involved in what went wrong in 2008, they still got their jobs and they're doing even better.  </p><p>      Meanwhile, the median household income of our country is up 5.3 percent since 2008, barely above the 2008 inflation level after adjusting for inflation and inequality in our country continues to grow. In 2007, the top 1 percent of people in our country owned 34 percent of wealth, they now own 39 percent.  </p><p>      In 2007, the bottom 90 percent owned 29 percent of this country's wealth, now they all under -- they own under a quarter, 23 percent. So, Mr. Chairman, I ask that Titles 9, 10 and 11 be struck from this bill, I think it's the right thing to do, especially because it is massive authorizing on an appropriation bill. It is inappropriate in an appropriation bill. And I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Ms. Kaptur. And Chairman Graves.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I, you know, I, you know, rise an opposition, and at first I have to say, I'm really surprised that Ms. Kaptur wants to strike these sections. This is truly the heart of this bill with a bipartisan heartbeat, what's unique about these sections is that the majority of all the provisions were bipartisan through the House, either passed with 250 or more votes many at 270, 80, and 90, and a lot of them were just suspensions that were overwhelmingly supported by the House. So, while the talking points that recited there might not match completely with what we have here, this is the most bipartisan section that I would ask this committee to keep intact in object this -- object to this amendment. So with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Graves. Mr. Quigley, do you seek time or...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUIGLEY</emphasis>:  No.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Mr. Yoder, excuse me. Mr. Yoder is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YODER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Chairman Yoder.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YODER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Frankly, Mr. Chairman, I'm stunned and out outraged that my colleague from Ohio would bring this amendment. What -- one of things she's striking here is the E-mail Privacy Act, which has passed the House unanimously in the last Congress and this Congress. And striking that amendment would allow the government to have unwarranted warrantless searches of Americans' e-mails without their permission, without their knowledge, and continue this horrible practice from a 1986 law that allows the government to spy on American citizens without their knowledge or permission.  </p><p>      The House has spoken on this twice, and spoken on it in the last Congress unanimously, it spoke on it this Congress unanimously. And so, it's the kind of bipartisan legislation that Americans want us to pursue, and allowing agencies to continue to violate our Fourth Amendment rights to me is unconscionable.  </p><p>      And so, voting for Ms. Kaptur's amendment would be a vote against the -- voting for Ms. Kaptur's amendment would be a vote against the Fourth Amendment, a vote against the civil liberties or constituents, a vote against technology, a vote to support the Senate's practice of sitting on our House bills and never moving them, and worst of all, it's a vote against bipartisanship on this unifying legislation. I'd like to think Chairman Graves for his working with us to get this in the legislation and his team, and I would strongly oppose the Kaptur amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion on the Kaptur -- and Ms. Lowey is recognized, the ranking member.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOWEY</emphasis>:  I just rise in strong support of my friend's amendment. Just Title 10 alone -- Title 9 alone is nearly half of this bill. It is filled with a garden variety of financial services authorizing language. Its inclusion highlights real friction simmering within the majority. With two chambers of Congress and the White House under Republican control, why does the majority feel compelled to push so much authorizing language through this committee?  </p><p>      Let me be clear, I voted for some of the bills included in Title 9, several have even passed the House on a voice vote. But last time I checked, this is the Appropriations Committee, not the Financial Services committee, this language along with Titles 10, and 11 -- and 11 simply have no place in our bills, so let's do the right thing, leave it to the authorizers, strike this language for the -- for the amendment. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentlewoman for her comments. Any further comments? If not, Ms. Kaptur has a minute to close.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAPTUR</emphasis>:  Just remember 2008. Remember collateralized debt obligations, and remember derivatives. And there were little words put in bills like this that ended up being time bombs that practically brought the country down.   </p><p>      So I would say for the gentleman that is -- would like to bring up the e-mail issue, bring it up to the floor in an authorizing capacity, don't put it in an appropriation bill. It's amazing to me that this entire -- that's why I say there must be other motivation for this in an election year, that this would be stuck in an appropriation bill that we want to pass in order to make sure that the government of the United States operates. I yield back. Please vote for the Kaptur amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Ms. Kaptur. The question's on the Kaptur amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.  </p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not adopted.   </p><p>      Further amendments? Ms. Wasserman Schultz and then Mr. Serrano after that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WASSERMAN SCHULTZ</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have an amendment at the desk and I ask that it considered as read.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  It's considered read. We're pleased to recognize you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WASSERMAN SCHULTZ</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I offer this amendment with Ms. Lee to strike section 112 of the bill. As it would diminish the vitality of our nation's religious organizations and violate our First Amendment rights. Section 112 which my amendment strikes would water down a provision in the tax code, sometimes referred to as the Johnson amendment, which protects the integrity and independence of charities and houses of worship by ensuring that they do not endorse or oppose political candidates.  </p><p>      One of the characteristics of American religious institutions that has made them so sacred is that they are separate from governments and separate from campaign politics. If Americans want to get involved in partisan elections, we know how to do that, but what we are seeking when we attend church, synagogue, mosque, temple, or any other house of worship is quite different.  </p><p>      This distinction has long been reflected in how our law treats religious institutions differently than political institutions. To preserve their sacred place in American society, houses of worship must stay above the political fray and refrain from endorsing candidates for political office. Current law strikes a careful balance, and it's important to emphasize what houses of worship with tax exempt status can do, they are permitted to advocate for policies that are consistent with their values, and they can help their members become engaged in the political process.  </p><p>      They can organize public debates on any issue, organize candidate forums, conduct voter registration drives, get out the vote, and help transport people to the polls. They just can't tell people who to vote for. It's no surprise that a wide array of religious organizations and faith leaders support the Johnson amendment and oppose section 112, out of an understandable concern that political parties and candidates seeking power would be empowered to use their congregations as tools and pressure them for endorsements.  </p><p>      And I ask, Mr. Chairman, that letters signed by thousands of these concerned and respected organizations, which I know I brought to the committee with me -- so I want to actually, visibly show you how many we have received, that these thousands of concerned and respected organizations have sent letters to the Congress, urging that this action be dropped from the bill.  </p><p>      Make no mistake:  Weakening existing law would have the unintended consequence of dividing congregations and opening them up to political wheeling and dealing. I think we can all agree that Americans have had enough of political partisanship, they don't want more of it, and they certainly don't want it in their houses of worship where so many seek refuge from the tumult and chaos of their day to day life. As if gutting these protections for houses of worship weren't bad enough, this provision also likely violates our First Amendment rights.  </p><p>      While current law applies to all tax exempt nonprofit organizations, section 112 would only applied to houses of worship. Specifically, section 112 makes it nearly impossible for the IRS to investigate claims that houses of worship have violated the law. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was designed to prevent exactly this kind of religious favoritism.  </p><p>      Regardless of our political stripes and colors, and regardless of our religion, no one wants our houses of worship to be torn apart by partisan campaign politics. And no one wants their First Amendment rights torn away from them. As people of faith, we cannot allow this effort to politicize our sanctuaries of worship to move forward. And as federal lawmakers, we have a responsibility to ensure equal justice, liberty, and protection for all people. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on my amendment. And I yield to my colleague, Ms. Lee.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK. Ms. Lee, you...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Thank you very much. And as a co-sponsor of this amendment, I wanted...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  You have -- you have about a minute or so, because if you're -- you can claim your own time in a few minutes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Would you rather claim your own time?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  I'll claim my own time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for her comments.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WASSERMAN SCHULTZ</emphasis>:  Thanks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Thank you. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Chairman Graves.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The majority...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  Of course.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  ... opposes the amendment from the gentlelady from Florida.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK. Mr. Quigley.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUIGLEY</emphasis>:  (inaudible)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Would you yield to...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUIGLEY</emphasis>:  (inaudible)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Ms. Lee and then we're going to go to Mr. Culberson, so.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEE</emphasis>:  OK. But thank you very much. Let me just associate myself with the remarks of my colleague Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz, and thank her very much for introducing this amendment again. As she mentioned, section 112 of this bill is designed to give religious organizations in violation of the First Amendment special tax benefits and privileges that are unavailable to other nonreligious organizations. Sadly, this provision would make it very difficult for the IRS to investigate religious organizations if they are in violation of the law. Now, as a person of faith I can attest that I do not want my place of worship to become overly politicized. And other Americans agree as you have just seen.  </p><p>      According to public opinion polling, more than seven in 10 Americans oppose allowing places of worship to endorse political candidates. Americans and our Constitution are on the right side of this issue, our committee should follow suit and support this amendment. In order to protect the integrity and independence of houses of worship and faith based charities, and the separation of church and state, we need to ensure that they do not endorse or oppose political candidates. So, I hope my colleagues will support this important amendment. Thank you and I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentlewoman for her comments. Mr. Culberson from Houston, Texas is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CULBERSON</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, the language which Chairman Graves has included in this bill. My request is very narrowly drawn to ensure that the First Amendment rights of pastors are protected consistent with the First Amendment, which directs that Congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise of religion or abridging the freedom of speech.  </p><p>      Now, this amendment is very, this section that Chairman Graves included is very narrowly drawn, so that only the commissioner of the IRS can remove the nonprofit status of a church or place of worship if the commissioner determines that they've engaged in political speech.  </p><p>      The -- one of the largest -- I represent the two largest churches, in the country, Lakewood and Second Baptist Church, and Second Baptist had their tax exempt status threatened several years ago when they simply handed out voter registration cards. Now, that's absurd. We want everyone who can vote in America to vote, and we want -- I think should we -- should we encourage people to in -- to register people to vote, and the amendment, the section that it -- this amendment would strike, is again, very nearly drawn and designed to protect the free speech rights of our pastors and churches while preserving the ability of the IRS to revoke the nonprofit status of a place of worship that does engage in political conduct. So I urge members to vote against the amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Culberson. Mr. Price is recognized and then Ms. Clark.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRICE</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I rise this in support of the amendment and suggest to colleagues that we really better be careful about this one. We really better be careful. I suggest that you think about it very carefully. The Johnson amendment is a valuable safeguard that protects our religious institutions and our political process. Our guideposts in this should be the twin constitutional pillars, the free exercise clause and the Establishment Clause that serve not only to ensure that houses of worship do not become entangled with the state, but also that houses of worship are protected from the state. The core value is religious liberty. It's entirely appropriate that the Establishment Clause is part of the Bill of Rights.  </p><p>Congress -- congregations currently have ample freedom to speak out on political and social issues. They can host candidate forums. They can organize \"souls to the polls\" trips (ph). They can hold voter registration drives. These activities are protected, and they should be. As long as the activity is about promoting conscientious citizenship and related faith to the issues of the day, we want to encourage more of this activity, not less.   </p><p>      There's plenty of evidence that this kind of advocacy, religious concern for good citizenship on the common good is alive and well in our religious institutions. But what is not permissible under current law is the endorsement of specific candidates or direct intervention in political campaigns. That's really what's at stake in the Johnson amendment.  </p><p>      We should think very carefully before we legitimate (ph) using religious institutions as a conduit for political contributions or for candidate or party-centered political advocacy. That would threaten, rather than enhance the freedom of these institutions. And I think it would lead to great cynicism about the activities of these institutions.  </p><p>      At present, our houses of worship are by and large greatly respected. They have great moral force. People pay attention when the faith community speaks out. If these voices are seen as a front for campaigns or as institutions that are being exploited by campaigns, that undermines that moral force, something we would all live to regret. Let's be careful. Let's maintain the safeguards that are in place and have served our congregations and our constituents well. I urge the adoption of this amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Mr. Graves, any comment on Mr. Price's amendment?  </p><p>      OK. What?  </p><p>      Ms. Clark, you're recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLARK</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, speak in strong support of my colleague's amendment to remove the language in this bill that would seriously undermine the Johnson amendment. Section 112 of this bill would make it virtually impossible for the IRS to enforce the Johnson amendment as it applies to religious institutions, allowing them to actively endorse or oppose political candidates.  </p><p>      As Congressman Price just stated, we encourage lots of activity in our houses of worship, but this is going too far and putting us on a dangerous path. Allowing this section to become law would put at risk the ability of churches and other places of worship to continue to serve as nonpartisan places for worship, reflection, and community, rather than as another political battleground.  </p><p>      Further, by singling out houses of worship among all 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations, this section raises a serious question about its constitutionality. The First Amendment prohibits the government from creating a legal preference for religious over non-religious entities. Hundreds of religious organizations and thousands of faith leaders agree that being pulled apart by divisive political campaigns would be a harmful step for their institutions and their communities.  </p><p>      On constitutional grounds, on the grounds of common sense and decency, we should all be able to agree that keeping politics separate from our centers of worship makes sense and it's the right thing to do. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. And I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion? Ms. Roybal-Allard is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROYBAL-ALLARD</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I am in strong support of this amendment. And I yield the balance of my time to Mr. Quigley.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUIGLEY</emphasis>:  I thank my colleague -- thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Mr. Quigley, you could claim your own time but you're recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUIGLEY</emphasis>:  Thank you. Look, places of worship are intended to be just that. They inspire belief, and they build community. By repealing this amendment, divisive themes, the Johnson amendment, divisive themes are introduced into the unified environments that religious organizations strive to build, thereby, undermining their core objectives.  </p><p>      Now, you know what we've lived through under this law for some time, nothing in the law prevents pastors from speaking out from the pulpit on issues no matter how controversial. But beyond the ideological argument lies a constitutional one. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment calls for the separation of church and state, but by repealing this amendment, we are facilitating a direct transaction between the two.  </p><p>      Let's look at what our colleagues did over on the authorizing side, they rejected recent attempts to include a repeal of the Johnson amendment in the new tax law. Furthermore, this subverts campaign disclosure laws, finance disclosure laws, and lends itself to the creation of new \"religious organizations,\" quote, as instruments of campaign cash. In short, this repeal overtly link state and church and greases the wheel for dark money. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. And I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  That worries me.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion? Ms. Wasserman Schultz has a minute to close.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WASSERMAN SCHULTZ</emphasis>:  Thank you. Sorry. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to close really by issuing a single plea to my colleagues. This really is as Mr. Price said, a \"Be careful what you wish for\" moment. Partisan politics has infiltrated so many aspects of our lives already. I know all of us regret this state of affairs even though we have chosen to engage in it on a daily basis.   </p><p>      Now, imagine how our constituents feel. I think it's safe to say that the vast majority of them who are members of religious congregations treasure their houses of worship as spaces far removed from the literally profane political discourse that is all around us. Let us not turn our pews into pits of partisan conflict.  </p><p>      No house of worship should be pressured to turn its pulpit into a super PAC, where millions of dollars in donations could be washed across its collection plates with little transparency and all while handing deep pocketed donors massive tax write-offs. Do we want to elected officials and candidates to go to houses of worship speaking out spiritual guidance but political endorsements? Do we congregations to grapple not with the Divine Word of God, but with the poll tested words of politicians? I think not.  </p><p>      I hope that the members of this committee recognize and agree with me that we should make sure that our houses of worship continue to be the respite that they were intended to be and have been for thousands of years, and remove this badly misguided section of the bill. I yield back the balance of my time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Now the question is on the Wasserman Schultz amendment. All of those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.  </p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not agreed to.

Mr. Serrano's recognized...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SERRANO</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  ... for the purpose of amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SERRANO</emphasis>:  Yes, and I ask it to be waived -- reading.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Considered read and waived, and the gentleman is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SERRANO</emphasis>:  Done. Done with it. You want the Spanish version or the English version?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Well, you can do both if you want, but let's keep it short.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SERRANO</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, last week acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Mike Mulvaney, fired all 25 members of the bureau's consumer advisory board on a conference call.  </p><p>      To this day members have not received the dignity of a clear explanation for their terminations even after Mr. Mulvaney's political appointee told the members that, \"Nothing is wrong with the present group.\" To make matters worse, they also -- they have also been barred from reapplying to serve on the board in the future. The move has been met with a wave of criticism and concern about Mr. Mulvaney's motivations. There's also no discussion in the law allowing these actions.  </p><p>      This board was established under Dodd Frank and statutorily mandated to meet with the director at least two times per year. Members of the consumer advisory board are a broad and geographically diverse set of stakeholders, including consumer advocates, and lawyers, financial service industry representatives, CDFIs, academics, and more.  </p><p>      These members serve in a voluntary capacity and they have sacrificed their time, money, and energy to provide their best insights and experiences with the bureau to help develop rules and policies that will protect consumers and businesses alike. My amendment would simply revoke the acting director is termination and reinstate all members of the consumer advisory board.  </p><p>      It would also remove the director's ability to terminate members of the board without cause and require a written notification to the board member in question and to Congress. This amendment is pretty straightforward, and would right the petty terminations of these board members, which was completely unnecessary.  </p><p>      Now, my Republican colleagues will argue that this amendment is authorizing language and should be opposed. But I would like to point out to those same colleagues that this 312 page bill we're working on now has 142 pages of authorizing language. This amendment is a drop in the bucket. And I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I thank the gentleman for his remarks. So, Chairman Graves recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the amendment, but I also rise to applaud the gentleman from New York, he's one of the lone voices on the other side that wants to see CFPB under our jurisdiction. And Mr. Serrano, thank you, thank you for offering this amendment because you're expressing -- I think everyone's concern that is we want to have oversight, we want to offer direction, and while I oppose the amendment here, because I know that the director is going to reappoint the board later this year with new members, he's going to populate the board, I do -- I do appreciate though you're willing to step out there in provide appropriating oversight over this bureau. With that though, I oppose the amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion on the amendment? Ms. Lowey is recognized, the ranking member.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOWEY</emphasis>:  I rise in -- I rise in strong support of my friend's amendment. The Trump administration's dismantling of the CFPB is underway. It is a direct and unacceptable attack on consumer financial protections that prioritizes special interests over our constituents. Earlier this month at Mick Mulvaney's direction, the CFPB disbanded its advisory board and councils. The advisory board is mandated by Dodd Frank to advise and consult the CFPB, convening twice a year. Since Mulvaney took over last year, it hasn't met once.  </p><p>      This isn't surprising, but it is concerning. We must ensure that the CFPB is permitted to carry out its mission, protecting consumers from predatory lending, and other loan practices. So, I ask you to vote for the amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion on the amendment? Mr. Serrano has a minute to close.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SERRANO</emphasis>:  Thank you. Simple amendment -- I think that this is an overreach. I think it's an ability of Mr. Mulvaney to do away with people he didn't want on the board; eventually, to try to do away with the board itself. And, lastly, the chairman is correct. I am a lone voice in saying that there should be oversight by this committee of that whole provision in the law.  </p><p>      And the reason I do it is for two reasons:  one, because it's the right thing to do, and secondly, because I'm a big fan of this committee. I didn't come on this committee to see it dwindle away. I think we should reach the days -- in the old days where our oversight meant a lot in this Congress and in this country. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Serrano. The question is on the Serrano amendment. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.  </p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not agreed to.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SERRANO</emphasis>:  What?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  What?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SERRANO</emphasis>:  I didn't hear that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Want to get back to the old days? OK.  </p><p>      Further amendments, Mr. Pocan has a...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SERRANO</emphasis>:  (inaudible).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  The amendment is not agreed to. Who do we have next?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SERRANO</emphasis>:  I thought my amendment would pass.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Ms. McCollum. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Pocan, you'll be next. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCOLLUM</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chair. I have an amendment at the desk. And I would like it to consider to be read.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  The gentlewoman is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCOLLUM</emphasis>:  Thank you. My amendment restores a provision that prevents automatic pay raises for the vice president and other high-level political appointees in the executive branch. And you might ask why I'm doing this and the executive schedule is index for raises, but it appears that they cannot get an increase if there is no general schedule increase. And to my knowledge, there is no general scheduled pay increase.  </p><p>      So, it's my understanding that Mr. Trump has in fact proposed a civilian pay freeze for 2019. So, with the civilian pay raises freezes in effect, I believe at a time when American families are seeing stagnant wages, it is just unacceptable that the majority would want to abandon past years of precedent and give pay raises to senior officials in the Trump administration only. I find this politically motivated that it goes to political appointees.  </p><p>      And I'm -- I personally find it rather hypocritical, when we're -- when it's not pay raises for everyone in the federal government that would be instituted. Because, if it was, these political appointees would be taken care of.   </p><p>      I would very much like to see -- in the past, we've had Democratic administrations exercise financial restraint on their appointees' salaries. But to allow political appointees right now and allies of the Trump administration to be able to reward themselves with taxpayers' dollars is just unacceptable.  </p><p>      I would ask my Republican colleagues, do they have any other justification other than partisanship, why they would drop their insistence on salary caps now that the benefits would only be to the Trump administration political appointees?  </p><p>      Do they believe that these administration political appointees have been such responsible stewards of our tax dollars? We're faced with daily stories about the Cabinet members, for example, like EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt treating himself to taxpayers' perks, first-class flights, hundred-thousand-dollar trips to Italy and Morocco and a ridiculous $43,000 sound booth, the use of aides to procure a mattress from the Trump Hotel, the official -- on an official trip that Secretary Mnuchin so he could contently (ph) watch the solar eclipse from Fort Knox, a $30,000 dining room set purchased by Secretary Carson for his office -- just to name a few.   </p><p>Congress should be cracking down on these abuses of taxpayers, not giving the executive branch salary raises. So I urge adoption of my amendment. I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Ms. McCollum. Chairman Graves.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The majority opposes the amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion on the amendment? Ms. Lowey is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOWEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of my friend's amendment. There is no reason why the Trump administration which boasts the wealthiest cabinet in modern history should be held to a different standard than the previous administration when it comes to pay increases. This is just another case of Jekyll and Hyde games played by the majority. On the one hand, they claim to be focused on the wellbeing of our kids and our grandkids, and on the other hand, they want to give pay increases to political appointees, all while passing a tax bill that will dramatically increase the deficit. Vote for the amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion? Mr. Quigley is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUIGLEY</emphasis>:  The provision in question has been included in the final version of this bill since fiscal year 2014, and it has only then during the Trump administration that it has been left out of the House version, we shouldn't have a different standard for the Trump administration than we have the Obama administration, I support this amendment, and urge my colleagues to support it as well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYAN</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Mr. Ryan is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYAN</emphasis>:  I appreciate and I thank all the points have been made. Let me briefly add that this Congress through our legislative branch appropriations bill that Mr. Yoder and I and our teams crafted do not have a pay raise for members of Congress. So, here we are saying to ourselves, no pay raise, but yet one of the wealthiest cabinets we've ever seen is going to be eligible. I think that flies in the face of what we want to do here and I wanted to make that point and support this amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion on the gentlewoman's amendment? Ms. McCollum has a minute to close.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCOLLUM</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I think the points have been made. And I just urge adoption of this amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK. The question is on the McCollum amendment. All of those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.  </p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the nays have it. The amendment is not agreed to. Further -- requisite number of hands, the clerk will call the roll.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLERK</emphasis>:  Mr. Aderholt?

I'm (ph) seeing no one. The clerk will tally.  </p><p>      On this vote, the ayes are 21; the nays are 27. The amendment is not adopted.  </p><p>      Mr. Pocan's recognized for his amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">POCAN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask it to be considered read.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Considered read. The gentleman's recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">POCAN</emphasis>:  Thank you very much. This is an amendment I am going to withdraw, but I do want to just put this out there for the committee and especially the subcommittee. In section 922 of the bill there are provisions for some banks that take them away from some regulation, and the reality is many of these bigger banks are cutting jobs here in the United States and sending them overseas, especially in customer service call centers.  </p><p>      You know, we know that the president has been very aggressive, having a trade war over the loss of manufacturing jobs and not that I exactly understand what he's doing in his trade war, but I know there is a trade war over manufacturing jobs, these are now service jobs that we're also seeing leave. If you lose your manufacturing jobs, you lose your service jobs, pretty soon you don't have any jobs.  </p><p>      Last year, Wells Fargo announced it was building a new 7,000-person call center in the Philippines. And just last week, Wells Fargo announced it was closing a call center in Reno, Nevada eliminating hundreds of jobs. The CEO at Wells Fargo admitted at a Senate hearing last year that many of the thousands of the jobs being cut in call centers were due to their jobs being shipped overseas. And it's not just Wells Fargo. It's Capital One, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase, Citibank and others -- have recently offshored significant numbers of call center jobs.  </p><p>      What this amendment was trying to do, and I just hope that this is something that the committee can look at perhaps more in the future, is that the provisions that allow some banks to have less regulation would not be in place for people who have outsourced more than 50 jobs.  </p><p>      I think at some point, we need to be able to address this, this amendment would do that, but given that people did not support the amendment that Marcy Kaptur had which I think would have solved some of these problems, I expect that that vote would go down and I want to be courteous of time, although I do have to get to 7:30 to win the pool, I will say that...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Just keep on talking and...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">POCAN</emphasis>:  And with that, I will withdraw my amendment, but I appreciate the time to...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Pocan for your patience. And Mr. Graves is recognized -- Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, the majority opposes Mr. Pocan's amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion on the Pocan amendment? Anyone? Withdrawing -- it's being withdrawn. Thank you for withdrawing. Any further amendments?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I was thinking that was coming back up.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I don't know.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Any further amendments?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  I really appreciate you working with us.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Seeing none, I'm going to recognize -- are you rising? The gentleman has an amendment at the desk. Mr. Joyce.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLERK</emphasis>:  An amendment offered...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Considered read.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I'd like, you'll give a full explanation of what -- if you would. We won't read it, but if you could give us a full explanation. The chair asks that courtesy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Sure. Thank you.  </p><p>      Well, I understand from some they would like -- I got it. I appreciate that. What this would amount to is a bill that -- Joyce number 3 that's in front of you, the last paragraph being, after line 20 of medical marijuana, \"Any entity that engages in any activity involving marijuana that is not exclusively for medical purposes shall not be covered by this provision.\"  </p><p>      I know we've had a long and engaged debate about this. I know we're in the process of putting those together at the moment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  If you would suspend -- are there copies?  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  We need five official copies.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  The minority doesn't have copies.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Again, we're in the process of handwriting...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Just suspend for just a minute. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Thank you very much for inquiring, ma'am, and I apologize for this but it's in the process of being made right now.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  So, we're going to wait until something is printed.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  They're being hand-printed as we speak, some of the language that was added there. I read the one part that was in addition to what was handed out to everyone is Joyce number 3.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  There's some difference in what we have than what you've mentioned. Our document does not say solely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  I read the last paragraph, sir, before, and I know we're in the process of getting your copy right now, ma'am. I have people down here handwriting them for you to make sure they have it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOWEY</emphasis>:  I have no idea. In fact, I was just told there are a few copies here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  If you could just use your microphone, Ms. Lowey.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOWEY</emphasis>:  Just give us a final copy.  </p><p>      OK. Take you a minute.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK. When we get the final copy, we'll give you a couple of minutes to look it over, I guess.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  In the meantime, I'd like to add, Mr. Chairman, that in listening to fellow members of the committee and trying to address your concerns, that's what we've tried to craft here is something that takes into consideration the 46 states, the three territories and the district that have engaged in or voted for or -- and legislated for the medical marijuana, that this amendment would cover medical marijuana only and that the production and sale would all be for medical marijuana only and leave out what those states, I tried to encompass everybody to be fair in the first time around. But I found some issue there. So, therefore, we've left out those states that have or -- and included that have medical that we don't use it for the recreation.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOWEY</emphasis>:  Yes. Will the gentleman yield?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  If the gentleman has the time and I guess we'll use the time until we have recovered the documents.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOWEY</emphasis>:  I'd like to clarify a question on this is that states that have only medical marijuana laws in place or medical and/or, because some states have both and I wouldn't want to preclude states that have both. Understanding this would only cover medical.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I'm going to ask the gentleman to suspend until we have a final copy which can be looked over.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOWEY</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  The meeting will come to order. I believe we have a final copy of the draft and I'm going to ask the clerk to read it, then I'll recognize the sponsor once again to explain it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLERK</emphasis>:  An amendment offered by...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Please give your attention to the clerk.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLERK</emphasis>:  \"An amendment offered by Mr. Joyce, Number 3. At the end of the bill, before the spending reduction account, insert the following section:  blank, 'None of the funds made available by this Act may be used with respect to the states of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming, or with respect to the District of Colombia, Puerto Rico or Guam.  </p><p>      \"'To penalize a financial institution solely because the institution provides financial services to an entity that is a manufacturer, producer, or a person that participates in any business or organized activity that involves handling medical marijuana or medical marijuana products and engages in such activity pursuant to a law established by a state or a unit of local government as it pertains to medical marijuana. Any entity that engages in any activity involving marijuana that is not exclusively for medical purposes shall not be covered by this provision.'\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  The gentleman from Ohio is recognized to explain his amendment and obviously we'd welcome any additional comments from members and certainly from the chair and the ranking member.  </p><p>      Mr. Joyce is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Thank you. Somewhat to say we've debated this ad nauseam and I can appreciate that. What I tried to do is listen to the concerns with my brothers and sisters here. I wish and I beg your indulgence for keeping you beyond the time we should have been out of here. And I could tell you as a fellow appropriator that if every committee in this building worked as hard as we do, we'd get a lot more done.  </p><p>      But I certainly appreciate your staying by. We tried to engage since we passed -- it was brought to our attention that when we passed in CGIS, a criminal or the part of the withholding funds for the criminal aspect was for medical then this would be in line with the medical marijuana purposes that were being served in those states that have it, and I urge you to consider and vote for it because I believe it's appropriate for those states that have legitimately brought state medical marijuana to the forefront.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Chairman Graves is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GRAVES</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      And I want to thank the gentleman. I know he's been working on this issue for a long time. He's heard the concerns of the committee. And this is a complicated issue, but there's clearly a gray area and there's room for improvement. This is a good first step. I think he has narrowed it to a point of which he heard the consensus of this committee in a bipartisan sense. But with that, certainly it's up to the committee and your decision whether or not we include this in our final bill, but I thank the gentleman for his good work and hard work on this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Graves.  </p><p>      Mr. Quigley?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUIGLEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      I want to congratulate the gentleman for his persistence, creativity. It's been an interesting process in this last amendment. I just want you to know as a 10-year veteran of the Cook County Board and a staffer for 10 years at the Chicago City Council, I am home.  </p><p>      All that being said, I support the amendment.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Mr. Chair?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  The gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Cole.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COLE</emphasis>:  Thank you and I thank my friend. It's actually been a good discussion. It had been helpful to some of us that are not as involved in this issue.  </p><p>      I would ask the gentleman, I know Oklahoma is listed here, we've not made the decision yet as a state to adopt medical marijuana. That's actually on the ballot in Oklahoma on June the 26th. And so, I don't want anything that would presuppose how that election will go. Literally the voters of the state have not made a decision on this yet.  </p><p>      So, I would ask if the gentleman would, if he could just withdraw us from his amendment and if that's appropriate, just a little second because I don't want to be voting on something that presumes my state is for something that I don't know yet how they're going to vote.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  If I'm not mistaken, at the moment...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  You'll yield to Mr. Joyce, my friend.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COLE</emphasis>:  Certainly.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  And CBD oil, which is part of this, that -- it treats...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COLE</emphasis>:  That -- OK, that would apply.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COLE</emphasis>:  OK. Well, then, I'll withdraw my concern. It was not clear to me. I thank my friend.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion? Ms. McCollum and then Mr. Moolenaar.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCOLLUM</emphasis>:  Mr. Chair, members of the committee, I want to compliment Mr. Joyce. I want to compliment all of us. This is very rare in Congress where we see an opportunity to come together, move something forward and address everybody's concerns and considerations, and I want to thank Mr. Joyce for working with me and the members on our side of the aisle.  </p><p>      Mr. Chair, I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Mr. Moolenaar, you didn't say anything about going home, did you? That was Mr. Simpson.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MOOLENAAR</emphasis>:  No. That was Mr. Simpson.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p>      Mr. Moolenaar?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MOOLENAAR</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>      And I guess my concern with this amendment is I don't -- it's not clear to me what definition we're using of medical marijuana. Are we using a federal definition? If so, what is the definition of medical marijuana in the federal law? And if not, is each state determining their own definition of medical marijuana? It seems to me very unclear.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  You're making just general comments. You're not addressing them to...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MOOLENAAR</emphasis>:  Well, if the sponsor of the amendment and I appreciate the work he's done on this would answer that question, it would help me, because I cannot support something where it's referring to medical marijuana if we don't have a consistent definition in federal law what medical marijuana is.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Would you want the sponsor to yield to you?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MOOLENAAR</emphasis>:  Yes, please.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  The federal treatment of marijuana is always consistent. That hasn't changed. What we've allowed to do is the states to exercise their rights and make their judgment as to what they deem to be medical marijuana. As you can see in the case that was just brought up my dear friend, Mr. Cole, that CBD oil which helps children with seizures is considered part of what Oklahoma already determines to be medicinal marijuana.  </p><p>      Yet, further aspects or use of that will be voted on by his people, just like I'm not sure what happened in your state, but in Ohio, the legislature did it and other states have passed it as an amendment or as somehow passed it through state referendums.  </p><p>      `So, each state is defining what and again, it goes back to Mr. Moolenaar, the idea that we to do the research as to what it's good for and what it's bad for. Obviously, we've heard that it's been effective in some states where it's been found to be illegal from ladies and gentlemen who served in the service for PTSD. The full effects of it are yet to be found and that's what we're trying to get accomplished here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion? Former Chairman Mr. Rogers.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROGERS</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, there is a reason why we have a division between authorization and appropriations. And this is one of the best examples that I can think of where we need to let the authorizers with their expertise and their experience and their time to sort through the questions that we have about this matter. This is a complicated matter, obviously. It's also significant. But this would be a very significant change in the law which I think should be done by the authorizers, not us.  </p><p>      Number two, I don't know how a bank would be able to tell whether or not a sack of money that comes in, whether or not that's from medical marijuana or recreational. I don't know how they would be able to decide that. And if they can't, they're subjecting themselves to possible heavy liability and I don't think it's fair for us to foist on to the banks to determine and examine whether or not the sack of cash is legal or not.  </p><p>      So, I would hope we would let the authorizers handle this matter and we would have a lot more confidence in the answers to the questions that people like my friend has just raised. I yield back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion?  </p><p>      I have some comments. I admire the fact that Mr. Joyce is going back to the drawing board. He's drawing on some of the knowledge of some of the people in the room here who are more professionally involved in these issues.  </p><p>      I am extremely uncomfortable about quite honestly moving forward on this. It is complicated and there is a gray area. Obviously, if there's a desire to have a vote, I personally think that this needs far more attention. I'm very uncomfortable about moving ahead on this. Just from listening to the members, I'm concerned about it and I'm sort of inclined quite honestly to ask you to withdraw your amendment and take it on for another day. But I want to be respectful obviously of the work and thought that's gone into this.  </p><p>      I think it's extremely complicated and I somewhat want to associate myself with Mr. Rogers. We are moving right into the -- in the area of authorization, the very type of authorization that many people criticize us on other parts of our bills. So, I'd like -- I'd ask that you consider withdrawing your amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  I've had the opportunity to -- been working on this since -- especially since Ohio has gotten involved into it. The answers to the questions that you raised are legitimate -- legitimate answers that we're going to find out.  </p><p>      I agree if Congress was doing their job. The authorized committees were doing their job. Maybe we do something. But that just hasn't occurred. And so, what we're trying to do is we're not changing the law. We're just asking for those who are trying to do what they find to be the wishes of their constituents since we are a body of representatives allowing that to take place in the -- what we would call the laboratories of our states both for medical marijuana and for democracy. They have chosen this route.  </p><p>      46 states have voted it in. We're just asking for them to have the opportunity if they see fit. Banks and credit unions don't have to do this. But those who want to engage in it will provide the buffer between us and the illegal remedies or the illegal dealers out there because they would have to verify that the funds coming in are coming from medical, medicinal facilities. They at least have the opportunity to engage if they want to and if they don't want to, fine. But that's what I'm asking for. That's why I think we'd like to move this one step forward and I would ask for a recorded vote -- or, no, not a recorded vote, excuse me, a voice vote because I know you want to get going, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Ms. Kaptur?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAPTUR</emphasis>:  Yes. I just wanted to state something, because I'm not a doctor and I'm not a medical professional but obviously Ohio is like the number one state in deaths per capita related to opioid abuse and fentanyl, black tar heroin, all of it. And every...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Will the lady yield for a moment?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KAPTUR</emphasis>:  I'll yield to the gentleman in a second. Every law enforcement officer I talk to, I ask about the pathway toward use. And to a person, as they have examined people who have died, there's an entry level experience and it begins with an M and it's not methamphetamine.  </p><p>      And so, I had the head of NIH to come in and see me because I said \"I want you to give me the best information NIH has on what happens to the brain, to the patient, and inter-generationally to their children.\" And I said, \"So, show me for long-term use of marijuana\" and I'm not disagreeing with medical use of marijuana. I voted for that in the past. But, I said, \"I want to know what happens to the brain where it happens. I want to know what happens with black tar heroin. I want to know what happens with cocaine. Every single addictive substance, I want to know what happens.\"  </p><p>      And thy began to show me maps of the brain and some of what they don't know which was shocking to me and they could not answer my questions definitively on long-term use of marijuana and increased amounts of use and then the pathway to something else and to look at what -- and they showed me what it takes to try to get someone off of an addictive substance like that and the numbers we have, we have approximately eight readmissions per patient that is heavily addicted, right, I'm not saying to marijuana, but other drugs that follow on and how difficult it is to try to unwind it in the brain and why. And they showed me MRIs of the brain.  </p><p>      What was shocking to me was after all these years, why can't medical science tell us exactly what happens to the brain and to the children of users? They can't answer that. So, it creates uncertainty in members who are not medical professionals who are trying to do the right thing for their constituents and for their country. But I just wanted to put that set of facts on the table because it made me very uncomfortable.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion on the Joyce amendment, Mr. Ryan?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RYAN</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I'd just like to add. I guess we could probably have this discussion in Ohio and leave everybody else out of it at this point. But, I just want to make the point that one of the concerns that I think a lot of us have is that we do have marijuana getting laced with all of these other drugs in them.  </p><p>      And where 30 years ago someone experimenting marijuana could now face -- laced with all of this horrible stuff that we're seeing in Ohio. I believe that the process here of moving towards both medical and overall legalization will provide safer, more controlled substances just like in alcohol. There are limited levels. It's controlled. As the gentleman from Nevada suggested, it's eventually taxed.  </p><p>      So, I just want to support this amendment, my friend from Ohio, and say that this is complicated. But I support him because this is the kind of thing that needs to get done. These things are helping save lives, improving the quality of life, and I just -- I wanted to add my support.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Ryan.  </p><p>      Ms. Herrera Beutler is recognized.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HERRERA BEUTLER</emphasis>:  I thank the chairman and the sponsor for working diligently on this. And like I said before, I think there are good people on both sides of this issue. This is not a cut and dry issue and I associate myself with the remarks of the former chairman and the current chairman in which, hey, surprise, surprise, guys, come on.  </p><p>      I really strongly believe that we're making -- it seems like a small thing and it was tailored and it was crafted tightly and I know that the staff and the teams working on this did everything they could. But the reality is, we are stepping into a place that we have no business stepping into. We have not done the hearings. We have not heard the testimony. We do not have the science. We do not have the background. Good or bad, we're appropriators. And in Labor H, we've had some of these conversations and I welcome more. Let's have more. Let's do it. Let's take it on.  </p><p>      But at 7:45 and we got this new amendment 10 minutes ago and we're debating a major change to federal policy here and now. I'm just saying it is, because when you open this door, the way this amendment was originally crafted was including recreational use, and that was not an accident, and I'm not saying that against the gentleman who offered it. I'm saying it against the people in the industry who is behind it.  </p><p>      The reason it was crafted that way is to allow banking -- federal banking for recreational use. And if we don't believe that, then, shoot, we fell off the turnip truck yesterday and I love that the chairman -- or the sponsor re-crafted it because I don't think that was his intent and the lady.  </p><p>      I don't think they're trying to do that. But the reality is, if we open this piece and we don't have all the background behind it, man, the litigation and the gray area that we're stepping into as appropriators, not as authorizers, is too much for this hour -- at this time and hour. And again, I just plead that we hit pause.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  The gentleman from Texas, Judge Carter?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARTER</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I very much admire...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Please give Judge Carter your attention. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARTER</emphasis>:  This is going to be very brief. I very much admire his tenacity, but I want to go on record to say I'm voting no.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Further discussion? Let me say -- I ask the sponsor -- I would like you to withdraw your amendment. I'm asking you again to withdraw your amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  Well, I appreciate my former chairman and my chairman putting their foot down, I guess, and trying to make sure that I don't have enough votes to carry this forward. I appreciate the fact that you don't want to vote, but just for giggles maybe we might try a voice vote if the chairman would allow that and be satisfied with the results of said voice vote.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  I'm asking you to withdraw your amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOYCE</emphasis>:  I withdraw the amendment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  Any further amendments? If not -- the amendment is withdrawn.  </p><p>      If not, the gentleman from Kentucky is recognized for a motion.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROGERS</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I move to favorably report to the House the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2019.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  The question is on the motion. All those in favor, say aye. All those opposed, say nay.   </p><p>      In the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. The motion is agreed to.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROGERS</emphasis>:  Mr. Chairman, I request a recorded vote.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  A recorded vote -- there's been sufficient hands.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLERK</emphasis>:  Mr. Aderholt?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRELINGHUYSEN</emphasis>:  The clerk will call the roll.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLERK</emphasis>:  Mr. Aderholt?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ADERHOLT</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLERK</emphasis>:  Mr. Aderholt, yes.  </p><p>      Mr. Aguilar?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AGUILAR</emphasis>:  No.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLERK</emphasis>:  Mr. Aguilar, no.  </p><p>      Mr. Amodei?

My name is Rohit Chopra, and I'm honored to sit alongside Chairman Simons to represent the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>Congressional oversight ensures that regulatory and enforcement agencies are accountable to the public. I welcome this oversight, and I believe it makes us stronger.</p><p>As Congress tackles some of the biggest challenges facing our economy, society, and even our national security, the Federal Trade Commission should be a critical piece of the puzzle. The stakes could not be higher. For example, how will we combat pharmaceutical industry abuses contributing to out-of-control drug prices that can mean the difference between life and death for patients? What can we do to make sure that Americans can get a pay raise in a competitive job market, rather than being squeezed by employer consolidation and non-compete agreements? How will we reverse the worrisome decline in new business formation and make sure that American entrepreneurs are not blocked by incumbents protecting their turf? How will we safeguard sensitive data from abuse and misuse by those here at home seeking profit and by those abroad seeking to do us harm? How will we deal with the rising dominance of Big Tech when it comes to fake reviews, facial recognition, fair competition, and so much more?</p><p>Congress is currently considering an increase in funding for the FTC, and I share Chairman Simons' commitment to use every resource effectively to deliver value for the public.</p><p>The FTC hearings that convened over the last year were a reminder of the importance of self-critical analysis. We must always be searching for ways to be more effective. For example, what more can we do to leverage the resources and authorities of our federal and state law enforcement partners to win full redress for victims and accountability for corporations and their executives that broke the law? How can we codify existing policy guidance and case law into clear rules so we can seek stiff penalties to be returned to taxpayers? What more can we do to protect honest businesses who play by the rules? We are actively thinking about new ways to use the authorities and resources that Congress has entrusted to the agency that solve problems in our markets.</p><p>We appreciate the opportunity to work with you to tackle these challenges and opportunities, and I look forward to responding to your questions.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AP/AP23/20190925/110005/HHRG-116-AP23-Wstate-ChopraR-20190925.pdf\">http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AP/AP23/20190925/110005/HHRG-116-AP23-Wstate-ChopraR-20190925.pdf</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COSHC925903S692599</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSY-V3W1-DYVR-P109-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"434\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 25, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

I'm pleased to welcome Federal Trade Commission Chairman Joseph Simons and Commissioner Rohit Chopra, batting .100 so far. It is--okay--it's the Cubs I'm thinking of. It has been more than seven years since the FTC has appeared before this subcommittee, so gentlemen you're late. Now, it's long overdue and the FTC is obviously one of the most important agency the subcommittee funds, and it's only gotten more important over the last few years.  </p><p>You have enormous jurisdiction policing most sectors of our economy for bad behavior. You cracked out on abusive robocallers, they investigate data breaches that expose sensitive personal information, they analyze consolidation in the health care market, help--helping to limit abusive pricing for essential drugs and health services. Perhaps, at the front of mine, they are the top cop on the beat for consumer privacy violations and other issues in the technology sector.  </p><p>This is something everyone worries about these days; Democrat and Republican. Well, the tech companies are respecting the privacy choices of their customers whether they are choking off competition by favoring their own products or buying up competing products, we've seen some promising actions recently. The FTC certainly did not take a summer break.  </p><p>In the past few months, they finalized high-profile settlements with Facebook, YouTube and Equifax. They launched an antitrust investigation on Facebook and possibly other companies. We recognize the challenges the FTC faces in policing such a large swath of the economy. That's why this year's House appropriation bill proposed a $40 million increase in FTC funding, that is a bump of more than 10 percent.  </p><p>Part of the reason we're here is to understand how the FTC can invest these resources wisely; how they can get the best bang for the buck for consumers. It is also our duty as appropriators to determine if the FTC is using its existing resources as efficiently as possible. Consider this summer's Facebook settlement; yes, $5 billion is by far the largest private settle--privacy settlement but it doesn't seem to match the magnitude of the privacy violations.  </p><p>That's--that fine does not represent even a full month of revenue for the company. It's not clear that the corporate changes, the FTC secured will head our future privacy violations. We could raise similar points about YouTube or questions why the Equifax settlement over one of the largest data breaches in history included only $31 million for alternative compensation.  </p><p>The economy has transformed dramatically in the past decade. The companies we worry about today are structured much differently than the companies of concern in the past. What we want to know is this; can the FTC do better? Can it win bigger monetary settlements to provide greater redress to consumers or send clear signals to the market that the U.S. will not tolerate anti-competitive or deceptive behavior and that there will be severe consequences if that does happen.  </p><p>We look forward to hearing from the Chairman and the Commissioner. Before I turn to the witnesses, I would like to recognize Mr. Graves for his opening remarks.  </p><p>GRAVES: Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate you holding this hearing today. Mr. Chairman, thank you for being here and Commissioner as well. Before the hearing of your testimony and, you know, we--I think we all know that the Federal Trade Commission basically has two primary missions and the first is to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive and fraudulent practices as the chairman's discussed and this includes protecting Americans from identity theft, false advertising, those dreaded telemarketing calls, the unwanted telemarketing calls and certainly, scams against the most vulnerable or elderly internet that are in our communities and our great service members.  </p><p>The FTC also make sure our markets are open and free. Mr. Chairman, I was thinking about your comments about it's been nearly seven years since they've been before us. There may be a reason for that and that since 2018, 95 percent, nearly 95 percent of all their decisions and their work on the Commission has been unanimous and we don't hear--hear a lot about that around here in a bipartisan way knowing that this is a--a bipartisan commission.  </p><p>So congratulations to both of you on how you've worked together and I know there's still a 5 percent out there where there's tremendous debate and--and we expect that. But as we become more dependent on technologies in our everyday lives, these tasks are certainly more challenging that you face and--and some of them are thoughts that the chairman's brought up.  </p><p>It's critically important though that technology companies that serve Americans act in an open and transparent manner, that the technology sector protects consumer privacy and that they do not conduct anti-competitive business practices whatsoever. And however, as a regulator of the FTC, must be careful not to stifle innovation while conducting its important work and I know it's a difficult balance that you--you grapple with every day because we've all seen in the past that over-regulation of industries can hurt the economic growth and ultimately can hurt consumers as well. So Mr. Chairman, well thank you for having this hearing today. I think it's going to be very informative and I appreciate the chairman for you joining us, and the commissioner as well and look forward to hearing your testimony.  </p><p>QUIGLEY: Thank you, sir. I would now like to recognize the chairman for his testimony.  </p><p>SIMONS: Thank you, Chairman Quigley, Ranking Member Graves, and members of the subcommittee. I am extremely pleased to be before you today to testify about the commission's work and funding requests, and particularly alongside my dear colleague, Commissioner Chopra.  </p><p>The FTC is a highly effective independent agency with a broad mission as you said to protect consumers and maintain competition in most sectors of the economy. On the consumer protection side, we are aggressively pursuing law enforcement on privacy and data security matters including record-breaking settlements with Facebook, Google, and YouTube, and Equifax.  </p><p>We've mainly used a 100 year old statute, Section 5 of the FTC Act to bring our privacy and data security actions, but our authority under Section 5 is limited. These limitations have a critical effect on our ability to protect consumers which is why we urge Congress to enact privacy and data security legislation enforceable by the FTC which grants us civil penalty authority targeted APA rulemaking authority and jurisdiction over nonprofits and common carriers.  </p><p>In addition to privacy and data security cases, we continue to bring a broad range of enforcement actions addressing among other issues, fraud against older adults, service members and other diverse and underserved communities. On the competition side, enforcement actions in the pharmaceutical sector continue to be a big priority for us. Cases like our pay for delay matters protect generic competition which helps keep down drug prices.  </p><p>To address concerns about the power of big tech, we have created a technology task force within the Bureau of Competition to concentrate our expertise and better investigate conduct by technology companies. I want to thank this committee for the additional $40 million for the FTC that is in the House Fiscal Year 2020 Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill. I assure you, we will make good use of that additional funding. Although, 40 million is a very large number, more than half of it might be needed to cover mandatory compensation increases, step increases, and non-compensation costs related to our agency operations such as our consumer, Sentinel Services contract, our litigation support service and our--an additional expert witness fees.  </p><p>The remaining portion of the $40 million would likely be used for adding additional personnel in the neighborhood of 90 FTE. We would focus new staff additions to priority areas such as our privacy and enforcement divisions and the bureau of consumer protection, hiring more technologists, doubling the size of our technology task force and hiring more economists.  </p><p>Finally, but significantly while principled differences among commissioners occasionally lead to split decision, some of them high-profile ones at that, the FTC predominantly works in a bipartisan fashion, and we will continue to do so.  </p><p>We are committed to using every resource to effectively protect consumers and to promote competition and we look forward to continuing to work with the subcommittee and the Congress and I look forward to your questions. Thank you.  </p><p>QUIGLEY: Thank you. Commissioner Chopra.  </p><p>CHOPRA: All right. Thank you, Chairman Quigley, Ranking Member Graves and members of the subcommittee. I appreciate you holding this hearing today. My name is Rohit Chopra and I'm honored to sit alongside Chairman Simons to represent the Federal Trade Commission.  </p><p>Congressional oversight ensures that regulatory and enforcement agencies are accountable to the public and I welcome this oversight. I know it makes agencies stronger and as Congress tackles some of the biggest challenges facing our economy, our society, and even our national security, the Federal Trade Commission should be a critical piece of that puzzle. The stakes simply could not be higher. For example, how are we going to combat pharmaceutical industry abuses that contribute to out-of-control drug prices? That mean the difference between life and death for patients.  </p><p>What can we do to make sure that Americans can get a fair pay raise in a competitive job market rather than being squeezed by employer consolidation and non-compete agreements? How are we going to reverse the worrisome decline in new business formation and make sure that American entrepreneurs are not blocked by incumbents protecting their turf? How will we safeguard sensitive data from abuse and misuse by those here at home seeking profit and by those abroad seeking to do--seeking to do us harm?  </p><p>How will we deal with the rising dominance of big tech when it comes to fake reviews, facial recognition, fair competition, and so much more. Congress is currently considering an increase in funding for the FTC and I share the Chairman's commitment to use every resource effectively so that we deliver real value for the public. The FTC hearings that convened over the last year were reminder of the importance of self-critical analysis.  </p><p>We must always be searching for ways to be more effective. For example, what can we do to leverage the resources and authorities of our federal and state law enforcement partners to win full redress for victims and accountability for corporations and their executives that broke the law? How can we codify existing policy guidance and case line to clear rules so we can seek stiff penalties to be returned to taxpayers?  </p><p>What more can we do to protect honest businesses who play by the rules but are harmed by those who cheat? We are actively thinking about new ways to use the authorities and resources that Congress has entrusted to the agency that solve real problems in our markets. We appreciate the opportunity to work with you to tackle these challenges and opportunities and I look forward to your questions.  </p><p>QUIGLEY: Thank you both and again, thank you both for being here. Commissioner, you and your fellow Democratic commissioner dissented in the YouTube and Facebook settlements. Could you give us a deeper dive as to the reasoning for your dissent and what you think the FTC can do differently or better to address these issues?  </p><p>CHOPRA: Sure. The Facebook corporation is a major governance and managerial challenge facing every regulator in the globe. They have serious dysfunction and they repeatedly violated the 2012 FTC order almost immediately. I was not happy with the outcome of the settlement. I think that it provided blanket releases of claims that were unspecified. There was not a deep--  </p><p>QUIGLEY: It's not just the money or is money part of it? </p><p>CHOPRA: Well it--will--will $5 billion while it is a record, is it going to change a firm that makes that amount of money very, very quickly? This is one of the largest corporations in the world and Wall Street reacted, they didn't actually find it that big of a deal. Most in Silicon Valley who analyzed that business didn't see it as so significant. So for me, I outlined all of these concerns and look, since the time we finalized that settlement, we've now heard of more and more problems.  </p><p>You know, just recently, just a few days ago 64,000 apps suspended, we learned from the Massachusetts attorney general court filings, you know, we learn about phone numbers. I mean, it just keeps going and going and I am concerned that the core problems in that firm are not fixed.  </p><p>QUIGLEY: Mr. Chairman, I would ask your thoughts on that settlement and so--and more importantly, the ongoing issue that that settlement was discussing. And--and if you could add into this discussion, if what--if these decisions and settling are because of a risk of losing in court and is there something we can do to mitigate against that concern?  </p><p>SIMONS: In this case, I don't think it had anything to do really with the risk of losing in court. Just to give some context, we do not have the authority ourselves to fine people. We have to go to court and get a court to agree to the fine and to any other additional injunctive relief. So in this case, I think there's a widespread view that if we had gone to court, if we had spent years in litigation and if we had won, the relief that we achieved in the settlement was far greater than any court would have likely granted us.  </p><p>So in terms of whether--whether, you know, the settlement or going to litigation was the right choice, I know--I think it's really clear. The settlement was far greater than we could have gotten in litigation and it's--there are now under--well actually, hopefully soon, they will be under order when the court signs the--the papers and finalizes it. And once that happens, then they're under a much sti--stiffer regime than they were previously.  </p><p>The other thing I would say is two, is in terms of the five billion, that is about 22 or 23 percent of their profits from last year. I mean, taking--taking that much of someone's profit is--is, you know, should be making them think about how they run their business.  </p><p>QUIGLEY: Is there something besides the fines though that can change behavior and I--I just want you to elaborate on that.  </p><p>SIMONS: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So part of this, another--another big part of this settlement is the injunctive relief. So we've done a whole bunch of things there. We've got--we've got a new committee of the board that's formed that deals solely with privacy and is only composed of independent directors, we've got a requirement on Mr. Zuckerberg that he certify quarterly that they are in compliance with--with the privacy program that's mandated in the order. He can't--he can't just stick his head in the sand. He gets mandatory information flows which--which he has to review.  </p><p>There's a very beefed up third-party assessor that's in here, we have the ability to hire and fire. That assessor has access to these mandatory information flows that the order requires. And then, the FTC itself has the ability to monitor too more stringently than we have had in the past.  </p><p>QUIGLEY: Thank you. Mr. Graves.  </p><p>GRAVES: Mr. Chairman, I--I know we'll talk a little bit more about antitrust and Facebook and others but something is a little bit more pressing for me is--because we've been hearing a lot about it in the news lately is SIM swapping. And this--this is when a bad actor, you know, pretends to be somebody calls a--a telecommunications company and--and convinces them to activate a SIM card on a different device and then that allows them to basically have mobile identity theft and have access to a person's phone oftentimes, bank accounts, their applications, passwords, all those change things.  </p><p>And what's interesting is that the--the FTC actually responded to this over three years ago and there's a--a blog that was posted about this very thing. But it seems to be intensifying and--and more active. In fact, Jack Dorsey who suffered this just a few weeks ago himself and--and his phone was taken over. Can you give us an update what--what role do you have in--in this and what can consumers do to protect themselves from this and Mr. Chairman, I'll start--start with you on that if you don't mind. </p><p>SIMONS: Yeah, so--so we share your concerns. This--this is--this is a big problem and it enables fraudsters to access consumers text messages and phone calls as you said, get information, personal information, get--potentially get into their bank accounts and other--other important aspects of their personal lives. So this is--this is--this is a--this is a serious problem.  </p><p>We--we did provide and do provide on our website guidance to the consumers on this issue and we continue--we continue to monitor this issue very--very carefully. So this is--this is something we're--we're--we're focused on.  </p><p>CHOPRA: The only thing I'll add is that as two-factor authentication spreads which is generally a good thing, most people are using that through their personal cell phone and so obviously, that's now a big vulnerability, the more someone can dig into that phone. So for me, I think of this broader issue of identity theft as really, problems in our data security infrastructure and that has huge impacts on Commerce, national security, everything. So if we don't take this seriously, the--we can't quantify the harm that can come from this.  </p><p>GRAVES: So the--but the two-step verification doesn't really stop a SIM swap--  </p><p>CHOPRA: No--no but it makes it--  </p><p>GRAVES: It might help with an application or--or such.  </p><p>SIMONS: It makes it more damaging, right.  </p><p>GRAVES: It doesn't stop from reading somebody's text messages, changing passwords out on a cell phone and other things. What--what can the federal government do to protect consumers from this and--and I guess that's my basic--I think--I think consumers are doing everything they can, you know, technology is moving very rapidly, they're trying to protect their own identity but now, some of our telecommunications companies are inadvertently giving out personal information.  </p><p>SIMONS: Maybe there's something we could do in terms of encouraging the carriers because a lot of--a lot of what enables this, right, is that the--the--the carrier--the--the scammer--the--the fraudster is able to get enough information that when you go through the security questions, they're able to answer them. And so, maybe we need--we need to--we need to think about how to--how to make that more secure.  </p><p>GRAVES: Yeah, thank you and Mr. Chairman, if I could, I have one other question related because another issue that sort of been on my mind a little bit--as a relationship, chairman and I both have this similar position about cybersecurity and some of the threats we--we face as it relates to protection of privacy, that's why I'm bringing up SIM swaps.  </p><p>But we had an FTC meeting recently that discussed geo location data being shared by--being sold from these same companies without a consumer's knowledge as well. The FTC has some jurisdiction here as--as well to take action against those that are engaged in these unfair deceptive practices. Can you give us an update as to what involvement you have in that area too, Mr. Chairman?  </p><p>SIMONS: Sure, I'd be happy to. So--so we're extremely concerned about this area as well. Location information is particularly sensitive because it's autho--it-- its unauthorized sharing can create safety concerns, stalking for example. We do not have the jurisdiction to bring cases against common carriers and we--we've asked for that--that immunity to be reversed and for us to have jurisdiction.  </p><p>But we have brought several cases alleging un--unfair and deceptive practices in connection with--with this problem. For example, we alleged that a popular flashlight app shared information with ad networks without disclosing the fact first. This was the Goldenshores case and we have several non-public investigations going on right now regarding this issue.  </p><p>GRAVES: Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>QUIGLEY: Ms. Torres.  </p><p>TORRES: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Ranking Member, Commission Chopra, thank you for being here. In your dissenting statement in the YouTube settlement, you noted the Commission already has a--has strong authority over children's privacy under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act but has failed to use the enforcement tools at its disposal to effectively deter actions that infringe on children's right to privacy.  </p><p>So I was very surprised to learn that on Monday, FTC officials actually suggested weakening restrictions on how data can be collected from users who watch videos aimed at children. How would this move impact children's privacy and legal protections under the law--current law?  </p><p>CHOPRA: Well, this--I have not re--reviewed the statement that was made by him but I don't know, he does not speak for me or any other individual commissioner. I do not agree that we should be, you know, moving toward any sort of weakness. We are doing a review and if we do weaken the rule in a harmful way, that's not something I would want to support and obviously, Congress will have to review that and has the right under the Congressional Review Act to overturn it.  </p><p>So I think we should go into it, looking for ways to actually make sure protections are stronger and that we can have the tools to deter the worst type of behavior because we are already seeing how mass accumulation of data on children is so lucrative, but it also can be extremely harmful and misused and--and we should take that very seriously.  </p><p>TORRES: I haven't seen so many abuses at every level specifically as it relates to foster children and, you know, being a--a grandma of a four-year-old, I want to make sure that this issue doesn't, you know, go by the wayside. We have to do everything that we can to protect the future of children and their identities.  </p><p>California Consumer Privacy Act, CCPA is consider the most expensive privacy law in the country. It will take effect in January 1st, 2020. Congress and state legislators are working on legislation that would provide baseline consumer privacy protections in the US. Have you reviewed the California law?  </p><p>CHOPRA: Yes, I have.  </p><p>TORRES: And are there any elements of that law that you think should be adopted at the federal level?  </p><p>CHOPRA: Well, there's a lot of details to the law but just some things that come to mind. There's a very clear way of deterring and penalizing firms that engage in violations and there's a different level of penalty for willful or intentional violations compared to unintentional ones. I think making sure that there's clear liability for those who violate the law will create the incentives in the market to actually protect data and not abuse it. There's also some new consumer rights that are part of it.  </p><p>I think all of that is good but we also need to make sure we're looking at how to attack the underlying incentive that is about going to--relates to collecting geolocation data. All of this data is monetized and that's the business model that is impacting so many of our problems online.  </p><p>TORRES: It's--this is an issue that is--it's zero tolerance. If you accidentally swipe your card and know that there's zero balance on your checking account, the bank is not forgiving and says, it's your first mistake, we're going to waive all fees, the credit companies don't give you a break. You're punished by it and it should be in the same line; zero tolerance for that.  </p><p>The FTC often works with state attorney generals on cases. Will the California law or other state privacy laws impact the Commission's work in any way?  </p><p>CHOPRA: I'm happy that--I always think it's good when state AGs are with us. They often have authorities and ability to pen--get penalties. So for me I'm really encouraging more state action when it comes to going after some of the abuses in the tech area. So--and we're seeing more laws being passed and that's going to give us more leverage at the table. But obviously, a federal law will help us as well.  </p><p>TORRES: And--and just really briefly, you probably won't have time but I just want to put this on the record for you. In recent years, consumers have reported an increase in online hotel booking scams when third-party vendors falsely claim to be affiliated with or proprietors of a hotel. So I'm curious to know what actions the FTC has taken to combat these scams as an issue that comes up often in my district. so, you know, same as Facebook, zero tolerance, and this is the same type of issue where you have like pages.  </p><p>CHOPRA: So it's--oh, go ahead. It's obviously a problem and these types of scams, one of my concerns is that they are heavily facilitated by some of the advertising models of the larger firms because they don't really police a lot of this content. So I saw this firsthand with all of these student debt scams that started several years ago, and most of the ways they were reaching people were through Google and Facebook ads.  </p><p>So, you know, Google and Facebook claim that they have no liability for it but we have to really look at that because often, they're-- </p><p>TORRES: It's their platform, they should be held liable for it.  </p><p>CHOPRA: And--and they're--they're monetizing some of that and--and their business model is to get people to take action so they profit from it too.  </p><p>TORRES: Fine. </p><p>QUIGLEY: I'm going to move on to Mr. Joyce, but I'll let the chairman comment on that as well.  </p><p>SIMONS: I was just going to say that so one of the things that we do is--is we--we go after not only the fraudster but the people who help the fraudster and so that's--that's consistent with what you're suggesting. So, yes.  </p><p>QUIGLEY: Mr. Joyce.  </p><p>JOYCE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, gentlemen, thank you very much for being here today. Service members like all consumers are potential targets for fraudsters. Certain schemes are more likely to target the military community and in part because military frame--families frequently relocate. Many service members are young, living on their own and earning a paycheck for the first time. How big of an issue is it for fraud against servicemembers?  </p><p>SIMONS: This is a big issue and it's a--it's a big priority for us. We have some recent cases where we've had enforcement actions against for-profit schools and their lead generators where they basically posed as being associated with the military, tricked people who wanted to enlist in the military, use--took their information, used it as leads for the--for-profit schools, implied that those for-profit schools were associated with the military and it would help a military career. And so, you know, that's just one example of what we do.  </p><p>Another thing that we do is we run a website called militaryconsumer.gov which has all kinds of help--helpful information, identify scams, how to avoid them and also helpful things about, you know, how to set up a budget and things like that, you know, for very--for service members in various points in their careers.  </p><p>JOYCE: I know it's probably hard to quantify but do you feel that we're reaching the service members who need this information or what else could we be doing to help make sure that these people aren't being targeted?  </p><p>SIMONS: I--I think we're doing--I think we're doing a pretty effective job, Congressman.  </p><p>JOYCE: Okay.  </p><p>CHOPRA: I--I would just add, consumer education is really going to have its limitations when it comes to reaching service members and veterans giving PCS orders, all of that. Just to add-- </p><p>JOYCE: The consumer needs--wants to be educated or it has to take some of--interesting.  </p><p>CHOPRA: Yeah, I think sometimes we need to focus on what are some of the incentives that are driving the targeting of military families. Chairman Simons mentioned our actions against lead generators and schools that target them. One of the reasons those for-profit colleges target them is because of--of a rule--a law by Congress that says you need to get at least 10 percent of your federal funds of your--of your revenue from outside of the Department of Education program.  </p><p>So guess what some of these schools do? They go hard after the GI bill and they go hard after the DoD military tuition assistance. So there's a cottage industry of companies that are just trying to go after the military. So some of this is we need to address that incentive and we also need to look, I think a criminal sanctions for some of this behavior because when we are leading to so much financial distress for military families, what are the impacts?  </p><p>We lose--they lose security clearances, they're more likely to separate. The DoD did an extensive report on this and I think we need to act especially when it comes to these for-profit schools that target them.  </p><p>JOYCE: So we screwed up passing the law, we need to do something to fix that.  </p><p>CHOPRA: Yeah, and we need to enfor--everyone needs to enforce this. I mean, the Department of Education has just allowed this to go on for years and years under multiple administrations and they need to fix it too.  </p><p>JOYCE: It's a very good point, thank you. I know the FTC also operates that Do Not Call Registry and collects consumer complaints about telemarketing calls. The Do Not Call registry is affected when law-abiding tele--telemarketers actually comply with it. But I understand you're working with the FTC--you're--who regulates the telecommunications industry and reducing robocalls. What actions are being taken against telemark--marketers that inappropriately target Americans?  </p><p>SIMONS: So this is a multi-faceted approach. Obviously, this is a, you know, very high priority for us. So we do--we do law enforcement, it's an example that is we had a big sweep a couple of months ago involving a large number of state and local law enforcement partners.  </p><p>So we do--we do that; in addition we--we're looking at the entry point for the robocallers to get into the system, whether it's a VoIP carrier or another con--or a common carrier which allow me to segue into putting a plug in for getting rid of the common carrier exemption because I think to us--to a significant degree, some common carriers may be facilitating the robocalls and if we had jurisdiction, we could--we could get at that.  </p><p>So those--those are--those are the on--the other thing we did is we ran a--a technology contest which in order to generate solutions for robocalls and that produced--that produced several different technologies that are actually on the market now. One is called Nomorobo and the other is Robo Killer. So in fact, the last one is I--I--I am--I am--I'm very excited about that one because what that one does is it answers the call with a bot and just keeps the purse--keeps the caller on the line and definitely wasting their time and their money, not yours.  </p><p>JOYCE: I certainly appreciate that. Do you foresee it--I know just about out, Mr. Chairman, but foresee what Americans can expect a reduction in robocalls?  </p><p>SIMONS: That's--that's really hard to say. One of the things that we--we work with the FTC and encourage them to do is what's now being implemented which this shake and stir program. So that would require identification of the--of the calls so that would--that would dramatically reduce spoofing.  </p><p>JOYCE: You should certainly see it with a long--all the digits behind it but it'll be a local number as it appears on your TV.  </p><p>SIMONS: Right, oh yeah. So the--so the FTC is working with the carriers to try to--to fix that problem.  </p><p>JOYCE: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.  </p><p>QUIGLEY: Certainly. Mr. Crist.  </p><p>CRIST: Thank you--thank you Mr. Chairman. I want to thank Chairman Simons and Commissioner Chopra for being with us this morning. I appreciate your critically important mission to protect America's consumers. Having been Florida's Attorney General, protecting consumers is very important to me and I think all members of our committee as well as you.  </p><p>I want to tell you about one such consumer. His name is Mike McKinney. Mike runs a minority-owned small business based out of St. Petersburg in my district. His daughter Taylor was diagnosed with diabetes nine years ago. Since her diagnosis, the family has focused on Taylor's health and treatments.  </p><p>Mike told me about the thousands he's had to pull out of the family's 401k and the \"creative things they did when they had nowhere else to turn.\" Mike left his corporate job to start his own business but the insurance ran out at one point. Mike had to pay a $120 for a three day supply of Taylor's life sustaining insulin. In that vein, I'd ask you to look at this chart behind me. They show the prices of brands of insulin over time.  </p><p>The insulin manufacturers, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi are increasing their prices dramatically as you can see and they are doing it in lockstep. Market forces are not driving these increases and yet insulin, the drug that sustains America's 30 million diabetics including Taylor keeps getting more and more expensive. All while profits for the drug companies continue to skyrocket.  </p><p>Drug companies are price fixing because they know their market is broken, they know their monopolies are legal for now and they know their 30 million consumers cannot influence price because their demand isn't negotiable. They need their insulin or they will die. This is anti-consumer behavior at its most egregious, its most harmful and this is where Americans need the FTC.  </p><p>My question for both of you, but for you Commissioner Chopra specifically, because you mentioned the outrageous costs in prescription drugs in your testimony. What is the FTC doing to stop the drug company price-fixing and what additional authorities would you need to save consumers lives from the greed of these drug companies?  </p><p>CHOPRA: Well, I don't want to comment on any specific drug or investigation but if there is price fixing or other anti-competitive conduct that is literally leading to potentially people dying, we have to take that seriously and we have to use all the authorities to do that. One of the things that I think is--is a concern for years and years is how pharmaceutical companies abuse their intellectual property; filing more patents, creating patent tickets, engaging and pay-for-delay, all of this nonsense.  </p><p>We have the ability to get money but when it comes to price-fixing, that also can suggest criminal liability which is not an authority that we have. But again, I don't want to comment on a specific drug or--or but--but it is a serious issue and that as you all think about drug prices, you need to think about remedies for pharma misconduct because it's not just about, you know, doing things here and there to get prices down, it's also about going after violations of law. Because if you can violate the law and simply pay out of your profits in justifying, you're not going to change.  </p><p>CRIST: They may look at it as a cost of doing business. Please sir.  </p><p>SIMONS: Yeah. So this is a--this is a big area of emphasis for us. We have a whole unit that is devoted to looking at anti-competitive conduct in this--in this space. Just as with commissioner Chopra, I'm unable to talk about nonpublic investigations specifically but so, we're monitoring this space, we look at pricing over time, we monitor drug prices and if we see something fishy, we look at it.  </p><p>If it looks like something that's related to price fixing, we make an affirmative referral to the justice department and often--in oftentimes, that results in them taking action. If--if the referral comes back, in other words, if they don't think it's criminal, then that's something that we will look at and investigate very closely. So we're--this is a--this is a--this is a priority area for us.  </p><p>CRIST: Great. Are there--are there other tools that you would like to have at your disposal in order to be able to be more effective?  </p><p>SIMONS: So there's--there's a bunch of legislation that's circulating now that deals with pay-for-delay, abuse of citizens petitions, and things like that, and those I think deserves some real careful attention. I think in general, that--that type of effort would be helpful.  </p><p>CRIST: Thank you very much, gentleman. Thank you Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>QUIGLEY: Thank you. Mr. Cartwright.  </p><p>CARTWRIGHT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I--I'd like to--that was an interesting discussion about the Facebook July settlement. Obviously, you two were at odds over the--whether the settlement should go forward and I want to get into that a little bit. And Commissioner Chopra, Chairman Simons said that the $5 billion equated to 23 percent of annual profits. As a factual matter, are you on the same page with that?  </p><p>CHOPRA: That I don't know exactly, that sounds right. It is a roughly I think 9 percent of annual revenue and maybe 22 percent of profits.  </p><p>CARTWRIGHT: Okay. And you felt that that wasn't another, that was kind of a slap on the wrist because the stock price went up right when they--and not--when you guys announced the settlement.  </p><p>CHOPRA: I think here's the issue is that there is--Facebook's business model is still completely intact in terms of they can still collect all sorts of data and monetize it. So for me, there's not a fundamental change to their behavioral advertising business model--  </p><p>CARTWRIGHT: Sure.  </p><p>CHOPRA: --which motivates them to engage in this mass data collection and ultimately creates problems.  </p><p>CARTWRIGHT: No, I understand that. I just want to sort of flesh out where you guys--where you guys agree and disagree. In fact Commissioner Chopra, in your--your dissenting statement to that settlement, you said that breaking the law has to be easier that--has to be riskier than following it and I don't think anybody disagree with that.  </p><p>I--I also looked at Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter's dissent to that. It looked like--was it a three-to-two decision?  </p><p>CHOPRA: Yes.  </p><p>CARTWRIGHT: Okay. It was a good discussion. One thing that she brought up was that this wasn't just breaking the law, it was violating a court order which in my mind has an elevated level of seriousness, particularly because it's intentional conduct, intentional illegal conduct thumbing their noses at the courts. And I want to go back to you chairman, what do you make of that? And I also want you to touch on Commissioner Slaughter's comments and that you read in her--her dissent about the value of actually going to court. Just saying, damn the torpedoes, let's see what the--the courts rule on this.  </p><p>I--personally, I never met a judge that sat still for the intentional violation of court orders. I never did. Go ahead commissioner.  </p><p>SIMONS: Yeah so--so I--I think it makes sense sometimes to say, you know, damn the torpedoes or whatever and go for the litigation if you have some reasonable chance of getting significantly more in the litigation than you do in a settlement. But that just wasn't the case here. And so going to court may have kind of been cathartic for some people and, you know, maybe--maybe made some things more public but it would have taken a long time, it would have taken a lot of our resources and they wouldn't have been under the new more--more stringent order during that time period.  </p><p>CARTWRIGHT: Was this a bench trial or a jury trial?  </p><p>SIMONS: I think it would been a jury--jury trial because civil penalties are involved.  </p><p>CARTWRIGHT: Okay. Did you do research? Was this DOJ prosecuting this case?  </p><p>SIMONS: It would have been, yes.  </p><p>CARTWRIGHT: Without revealing things that shouldn't be revealed, I mean, what made you think the judge--the judge and the jury weren't going to really throw the book at Facebook for this intentional violation of court orders?  </p><p>SIMONS: So we--we talked to a lot of people have experience litigating these types of things and the general consensus was you wouldn't even get it remotely close to what you got in the settlement.  </p><p>CARTWRIGHT: It was a big part of that that there had never been an award that high?  </p><p>SIMONS: I think it--I think the--that probably was a problem. The other thing too that I thought was really important to get this in--get the settlement effective as soon as possible with that $5 billion is that would set a new floor. So rather than litigate for three years and hopefully get them on an order at that point, they're already being under an order and if they do something and then the order doesn't work this time, then we're in a position to get even more relief because we say to the judge, look, we got $5 billion last time ago, the last injunctive wasn't good enough, they got to give us more.  </p><p>CARTWRIGHT: Thank you. Back to you Commissioner Chopra. Comment on those things.  </p><p>CHOPRA: Yeah, I--I would--I--I--I don't agree that it's about catharsis or anything emotional. A trial or frankly further investigation, we have full ability to compel testimony. I think not clearly deposing Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg was a mistake because often, when you are able to directly depose those executives, you determine a lot more the factual background around the management and governance incentives. On top of this-- </p><p>CARTWRIGHT: And you're also touching on something Commissioner Slaughter mentioned is the--is how about individual liability? These are human beings that are making these illegal decisions to go ahead. So what you-- </p><p>CHOPRA: And actually, we named individuals with small firms that are--that are controllers of those firms all the time and Mr. Zuckerberg controls this firm. I mean, I will tell you, there's state court litigation in multiple jurisdictions now. Through the discovery process, we are learning about more and more potential wrongdoing. So it was difficult for me to even size the problem that we were attacking without having more information. So--and again, to me money is one thing but actually going after the individuals who made the calls and the fundamental business incentives, that would be the only way to comprehensively fix this problem in my view.  </p><p>CARTWRIGHT: Thank you gentlemen. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>QUIGLEY: Thank you and before we go to a second round, uh, we'll start with Mr. Graves. Just for the record, people have asked my constituents, proceeds of settlements like this go to--  </p><p>SIMONS: Federal Government Treasury.  </p><p>QUIGLEY: Thank you. Mr. Graves.  </p><p>GRAVES: Than you, Mr. Chairman, and Commissioner Chopra. A question about something sort of come up in Energy and Commerce Committee and I know we were talking about lawsuits and such and it appears that the commission has lost a few lawsuits over time. And maybe as a result of that and some of those decisions in testimony earlier in Energy and Commerce Committee I guess this year, the commission's request an expansion in FTC Authority--enforcement authority through the enactment of privacy and data security legislation.  </p><p>I know both of y'all would be familiar with that. Pending this expansion though, the FTC is also advocated for increased use of court decrees should a target not agree to the FTC's demand or not abide by the prescriptive restrictions on the business practices. Beyond what the courts say, can--can you help us understand what's the FTC's justification for adopting that approach ahead of the congressional debate over the changes to the FTC Act to grant the authority that you're seeking?  </p><p>SIMONS: I'm sorry, I don't--I didn't really understand the question. Do you--do you want it--the reason we're asking for privacy and data security authority like civil penalties or is that what you're looking at or--  </p><p>GRAVES: No.  </p><p>SIMONS: --I'm not sure.  </p><p>GRAVES: Prior to that, you--you before--I guess you're seeking the act, the changes in the act as well through the authorizing committee. But it also seems you've advocated for an increased use of court decrees as well prior to the enactment of congressional abatement/ </p><p>SIMONS: Yeah, so beginning in the 1980s, the FTC started to bring actions in federal court seeking disgorgement and consumer redress. And that--and that enables us to stop fraudsters in their track to go in and get asset freezes before they dissipate all the money and to recover whatever we can recover on behalf of consumers. And their--and for 30 years, there have been a quite a number of circuit court decisions that uphold that ability of ours, that authority. And recently, there have been some circuit court decisions that questioned that.  </p><p>And so we think it's really important that the Congress clarify that the prior existing view is the right view so that we can continue to stop fraudsters, we can freeze their assets and we can get consumer redress.  </p><p>GRAVES: Does the FTC ever impose or ask a business or an entity to go beyond what the court seizes? Is there appropriate response?  </p><p>CHOPRA: So I'll try with--with respect to the provision the chairman is saying. Many of the courts for years have--have interpreted our statute to allow us to get that money, that is ill-gotten gains or redress. I think we're try--trying to make sure that that is clarified so that, you know, firms don't exploit some legal ambiguity and that we can continue doing our work.  </p><p>SIMONS: The problem we have is that now, companies are more likely to litigate with us which will drain our resources further. So if we clarify that we have this right, then that would--that would mean less litigation for us.  </p><p>GRAVES: Currently, you don't have that--that right? </p><p>SIMONS: Well, we think we do, but there's just some ambiguity around it. So the ambiguity causes an incentive for the--for the defendants to champ--to not--to not settle with us and to litigate on that issue in particular.  </p><p>GRAVES: I understand. Then one--one final question on the antitrust. So just a few weeks ago we saw that most if not all the Attorney Generals from the states have engaged in the antitrust debate as well and a nationwide Antitrust probe and the Facebook and--and Alphabet. So the Judiciary Committee is also investigating Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google as well. How do these state investigations or the congressional investigations impact your work and some of the decisions you're making?  </p><p>SIMONS: Yes, so the state attorney generals are very, very highly valued partners of ours and we--we collaborate with them on all sorts of levels very heavily in consumer protection and also in the competition area. So this is a standard thing where we're working on the same matter and we--we cooperate with each other. You know, they--they--they find things, then--then tell us about it, we find things and tell them. So it--it actually it helps to kind of leverage our resources and we--we do it very favorably.  </p><p>GRAVES: Great.  </p><p>CHOPRA: Yeah, I think it's--it is an all-hands-on-deck kind of moment and I--I really value the state AGs being involved. I've been part of many multi-state arrangements and I try to be in constant communication with--with those who are--are eager to make some change. So I welcome this and of course--yeah, just to on congressional oversight, I think we have to keep a lot of our investigation, the contents of it confidential but there is always value of Congress investigating as well because the public is also learning about some of these business practices.  </p><p>GRAVES: Commissioner and Chairman, thank you for your work on the commission. And, you know, Mr. Chairman, highlight again their bipartisan nature in which this commission operates is of good value to all our constituents. So thankful--thank for the work to protect our--our constituency as you do.  </p><p>QUIGLEY: Thank you, Mr. Graves, I agree and it's--I'm going agree with that part of it but it raises concerns about two other entities that seem to have disagreements. You won a case against Qualcomm back in May and the Department of Justice sided with Qualcomm. What's happening? How do we address this and the potential for duplicative jurisdictions conflicting? Obviously, FTC you share this jurisdiction over Antitrust enforcement with DOJ. That's generally worked well. Where are we now in that regard?  </p><p>SIMONS: So it's still on average working--working well. I'm recused from the--from the Qualcomm matter but needless to say, watching from a little bit of outside in this circumstance, I don't think anyone at the FTC was happy about their intervention. It was highly unusual. The only other time--  </p><p>QUIGLEY: Could you elaborate on highly unusual, how often besides the blue moons that we see this?  </p><p>SIMONS: Yeah, the only other time that I am aware that anything like this happened was in our--I think one of our initial pay-for-delay cases where there was a cert petition filed and the--the--the Department of Justice did not want to support our cert petition, and in fact the government didn't support our cert petition. They took a--they took a different stance. So I think--I think that's the only other instance that I'm aware of.  </p><p>CHOPRA: Well, the--the appeal was still ongoing. I was very proud of the outcome at the district court level. I also found it not just unusual but very mysterious as to why the Department of Justice decided to weigh in. I think it raises questions about their commitment to fair administration of our antitrust laws, and so I was very disappointed by it but we will continue to try and seek relief for all of the victims of Qualcomm's anti-competitive behavior.  </p><p>QUIGLEY: And generally, avoiding the issues of duplication, how do you manage that?  </p><p>SIMONS: So generally, we have a--we have a clearance agreement with the Justice Department's been in effect in one form or another for 70 or 80 years, it's been a long time, and that agreement provides that no agency should review a matter without it or start an investigation of a matter without it being cleared from the other agency. And then--and the general approach is not to--not to clear anything that would be involved in overlapping investigation.  </p><p>QUIGLEY: Mr. Joyce.  </p><p>JOYCE: Thank you again, Mr. Chairman. Overall, what is your approach to investigating the tech companies? Do you have a--  </p><p>SIMONS: Yeah. Well, it's not--it's not one single approach and it depends on, you know, what we're investigating but so, we formed this technology task force on the Antitrust side to focus specifically on the high tech platforms to look at not only currently what they're doing but to look historically what they've been doing, to look at some of the past mergers that they--they participated in and see if--if any of that is worth pursuing in terms of an enforcement action.  </p><p>And then on the consumer protection side, you know, we have the privacy issues, we have potentially data security issues, and there are two parts of the--of our consumer protection bureau that deal with that. So there's an enforcement division that handles order enforcement and so they took the lead on the Facebook case because that was a violation of an existing order. And then our privacy division which--which looks at de novo matters.  </p><p>CHOPRA: It--these firms, I think six or seven of the ten largest publicly-traded--I'm sorry, seven ten largest corporations in the world are--are Chinese or US tech companies. So it is involving everything beyond what Chairman Simons said; fake reviews, facial recognition. There are so many potential abuses against consumers, small businesses, competitors. So if the Congress cares about competition and cares about a new startup being able to challenge one of the big guys, you all need to support aggressive Antitrust enforcement and aggressive enforcement on against consumer abuses as well.  </p><p>JOYCE: What type of anti-competitive behavior have you seen when you look into these big tech companies?  </p><p>SIMONS: Well, we can't really talk about any specific investigation. But one of the main things you might look for is a situation where the platform is engaged in some kind of exclusionary conduct particularly against a company that might not be a direct competitor immediately but might turn into one. An example of this is what history kind of like repeats itself in cycles. So an example of this from the past would have been Microsoft and--and the--their anti-competitive behavior rating--relating to Netscape's browser.  </p><p>So they did all kinds of things to get in the way of Netscape succeeding because they were worried that Netscape was going to be--was--as middleware was going to make the operating system irrelevant.  </p><p>CHOPRA: I would also add--  </p><p>JOYCE: I was old enough to remember that one.  </p><p>SIMONS: Yeah.  </p><p>CHOPRA: I would also add looking closely at past mergers, joint ventures; to what extent was the purchase of many, many firms part of--a potentially a way to eliminate a potential competitor or maintain a monopoly. That has to be--that's always part of how effective antitrust enforcement should look at things. It's not just looking at mergers before they're consummated it's also looking at them after to determine was it part of a plan to essentially shut down a potential threat.  </p><p>SIMONS: You can imagine a situation in which the--the plan is to try to buy the companies that are the most threatening. And then if that doesn't work, then you engage in different types of exclusionary conduct to make them irrelevant. So it, you know, there could be a like a--like a pattern as Commissioner Chopra said involved in an overall kind of strategic approach to dealing with, you know, the significant competitive threats.  </p><p>JOYCE: Certainly, we want to help small businesses compete and be able to be out there in the marketplace but it requires having a competitive playing field.  </p><p>SIMONS: Yeah, exactly. I mean that we want small businesses to get big, you know, that's--that's--that's--that's what the--the free market system encourages and so we--we don't want to get in the way--we don't want to allow companies to artificially through any competitive means stop that process from occurring.  </p><p>CHOPRA: Yeah. And--and I'm concerned about the argument that some in the sector are making that they need to stay big and dominant in order to compete against China. We should not try and replicate the Chinese system when it comes to tech. We should be having lots of entrants constantly innovating, challenging the leader because that's actually how we innovate and get ahead, not by just allowing big incumbents to protect their turf.  </p><p>SIMONS: Yeah, protecting big incumbents is really--is not the right way. National champions I think is--is a proven failure that when countries try to promote national champions, they just end up undermining the competitive strength of the companies they're supposedly trying to benefit and that hurts everybody. It hurts the company, it hurts--it hurts the--the domestic consumers because the prices are too high and then eventually, it's probably going to hurt the workers because eventually those jobs are going to go away because champions are not champions but competitive companies from other parts of the globe are going to come in.  </p><p>JOYCE: Thank you Mr. Chairman for holding this hearing today and I realized I'm out of time. But whatever I had, I yield back.  </p><p>QUIGLEY: Thank you. Mr. Cartwright.  </p><p>CARTWRIGHT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Simons, I want to talk about elder fraud a little bit. I read that since 2014, the FTC has had nearly 1.3 million reports about government imposters, people pretending to be from the HHS, from the IRS. And what we've seen is that scammers have become so sophisticated, they can have the--the caller ID of the person at home, show the actual name of the agency they're pretending to be part of including the Social Security Administration.  </p><p>2019, we've seen an explosion of reports regarding the Social Security Administration imposters, 64,000 reports in the first six months of this calendar year. Unfortunately, seniors and elders tend to be the most vulnerable to these types of schemes and ideal targets for social security schemes given that Social Security tends to be their biggest form of income. How is the FTC addressing these robocalls targeting seniors, specifically those pretending to work for the Social Security Administration?  </p><p>SIMONS: So this is--this is another big priority area for us and I'll--I'll talk specifically about the Social Security Administration the first and then, give me a chance and I'll tell you what else we're doing. So we became aware that this Social Security scam was going on and we were--and they were duplicating, they were spoofing the Social Security Administration phone number. But it was a phone number that they didn't use except for to take incoming calls.  </p><p>So we worked with the Social Security Administration to make the phone line on--only work for incoming calls not for outgoing calls and so I think that what--that--that was fairly effective in dealing with--with--with that problem at least in that form.  </p><p>More broadly, in--in March of this year we had a huge federal state and international crackdown on elder fraud schemes and these were primarily focused on tech support cases. We're about to submit a second annual congressionally mandated report on elder fraud detailing all our law enforcement actions, research, and data analysis and strategies to reduce fraud so that will be out shortly. And then, we--we regularly host common ground conferences with state AGs and local enforcement around the country to work collaboratively and in particular, we hosted one in Minnesota with a panel focus specifically on elder fraud. And we have an ongoing partnership with AARP which is also very helpful, and then we have consumer outreach as well.  </p><p>CARTWRIGHT: Okay, we're going to one touch on that. In past congresses, I've been introducing a bill called the Elder Protection and Abuse Prevention Act which would among other things expand the definition of elder abuse to include financial crimes and incorporate elder abuse prevention, training, screenings, and more into federal activities. My question for you is on outreach is how are you making sure that warnings reach senior citizens who may have more limited access and use of the latest technology?  </p><p>SIMONS: So we introduced a program which I don't hold me the exact name but I think it's called passing--pass it on and what this program is designed to do is to get elder citizens to become an advocate in their own community and take--take our material and pass it on. And so, you know, because sometimes, like when you get, you know, I'm old enough to be in this category. You--you think, you know, everything and you don't want to be told what to do but if it's something for helping others then it's more, you know, it's--it's something you might--you might--you might do out of the box. So that's--that--that's--that--that approach seems to be having a fair degree of success.  </p><p>CARTWRIGHT: Thank you and Commissioner Chopra, do you have anything to add on that?  </p><p>CHOPRA: Yeah. The only thing I'd add is that we always need to look not just at the individual scams because, you know, that can be whack-a-mole. We have to look sometimes up the chain to determine who's facilitating the payments, who's use--who's providing the infrastructure that all these crimes essentially are--are perpetrated through.  </p><p>SIMONS: Yeah, that's a very effective approach for us.  </p><p>CARTWRIGHT: Very good. Thank you Mr. Chairman, I yield back.  </p><p>JOYCE: Can I ask a question? </p><p>QUIGLEY: Mr. Joyce.  </p><p>JOYCE: Are most of the--as you go up the chain, are most of these people out of the country when they're--they start these tele-fraud games? Among y days as a prosecutor, they were in Canada or Jamaica.  </p><p>SIMONS: Yeah, it could be. Yeah, it depends on the situation. Sometimes--sometimes, you know, like these robocalls are just scams and they're coming from foreign countries but sometimes they're coming from inside the country. And one of the reasons we want to go after the--the carriers who are taking the calls and putting them into the U.S. telephone system is just for this reason; They're out of--the--the--the fraudster themselves actually is out of reach and but we can get to the carrier and stop them from facilitating the fraud.  </p><p>JOYCE: For what it's worth, every time I've done one of these education processes at senior centers, all of them I've reached have gotten these calls.  </p><p>SIMONS: Yeah, oh yeah, absolutely.  </p><p>CHOPRA: Yeah, we also need--we need push the carriers writ large on a lot of these types of problems. I think they have evaded a lot of scrutiny when it comes to their role in this.  </p><p>QUIGLEY: Thank you Mr. Joyce. Thank you, Mr. Graves and our colleagues for their thoughtful questions.

It is a privilege to meet with you at this critical juncture in American history, indeed in world history.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The pandemic is exposing and exaggerating longstanding inequalities in health and wealth. It will worsen the inequalities between black and white, between the more and the less educated, and between ordinary people and the well off. Enlightened policy can moderate these effects, as has already been the case. But we are not done</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This pandemic, like other pandemics before it, lights up anew the fault lines in society. Inequalities that we knew about, like racial and ethnic inequalities, are more starkly visible. Inequalities in work and in living conditions have become salient in new ways, as people are sorted into essential and inessential workers, as jobs, transportation, and activities that once were safe become unsafe, and as access to the internet becomes the difference between learning or not learning, or working safely or not working at all.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The pandemic may turn tolerable inequalities into intolerable inequalities. There is a danger of social unrest, but there are also opportunities to address long-standing problems. The need to repair our policing has already become urgent. Other outstanding issues include healthcare, antitrust policy, and our system of unemployment benefits.</p><p>I want to start by describing inequalities in the US before the pandemic struck. I shall then discuss how these inequalities shaped the experience of the pandemic, often amplifying them, and then I shall go on to discuss issues for the future.</p><p>My guess is that, left to itself, the pandemic will worsen inequalities in the US, between blacks and white, between the more and the less educated, and between ordinary people and the very well off. Enlightened policy can moderate the worsening, or there could be serious disruption. But we have been here before; the income and wealth inequalities of 2000, if they had seen from 1960, would have seemed intolerable, but tolerated they were.</p><p>BEFORE THE PANDEMIC</p><p>Educational attainment, race, and unequal lives</p><p>In the past half century, the lives of Americans have become increasingly divided according to whether or not people have a four-year college degree; those with a BA are prospering and living longer, while those without are foundering. Not only are the gaps widening in the outcomes that make for a good life, but for less-educated Americans, life is getting worse. The American economy is not delivering for less-educated Americans.</p><p>In our recent book, Deaths of despair and the future of capitalism, Anne Case and I document the disaster and the divide. Most stunningly, mortality rates in midlife, which had been declining for a century since the last pandemic, began to rise in the mid-1990s, driven by increases in suicides, drug overdoses and alcoholic liver disease (what we call \"deaths of despair\") as well as by a reversal of progress against mortality from heart disease. There were 158,000 deaths of despair in 2018 (the latest year we have data) compared with 65,000 in the mid-1990s. The increase was almost entirely among the two-thirds of white non-Hispanics who do not have a bachelor's degree. Until 2013, black non-Hispanics, who had suffered their own catastrophe in the 1970s and 80s, escaped this epidemic. After 2013, when illegal fentanyl hit the streets of eastern cities, black deaths of despair began to rise too, again almost exclusively among African Americans without a bachelor's degree. Other rich countries appear to be exempt from deaths of despair, at least for now, although here are much smaller epidemics in other English-speaking rich countries, most notably in Britain.</p><p>There has also been a surge of pain, of disability, of difficulty in socializing, and in loneliness, again largely confined to the less-educated. The fraction of men in employment has fallen for many decades and, since 2000, for women too. Yet labor force participation has held steady for educated men and women. Median earnings of less-educated men have fallen for half a century; if benefits are included, especially employer-provided health insurance, the decline is moderated, but, as I argue below, these \"benefits\" are worth much less than they cost, and are harming working people in other ways. The earnings premium between those with at least a BA and those without has now risen to an astonishing 80 percent.</p><p>Community and social lives of the less-educated have deteriorated, creating a widening gap with the more educated. For those without a BA, divorce has risen, as has out of wedlock childbearing, and many never marry, though they participate in serial cohabitations that often bring children, many of whom lose touch with their fathers. The decline in unions has depleted an important social and community resource, and rates of churchgoing have fallen. Again, these dysfunctions are confined to less-educated Americans, whose lives are getting worse, and whose lives are diverging from the third of the population with a BA or more.</p><p>African American mortality rates have long been higher than those of whites; it is true today, and it has been true for as long as we have data. In the 1930s, midlife mortality rates for blacks were two-and-a-half times those for whites. The gap has diminished steadily, closing particularly rapidly when white mortality rates began to rise in the mid-1990s. This convergence came to a halt after 2013, with the rise in fentanyl deaths among blacks; blacks with a BA--22.5 percent of the black population--were largely exempt.</p><p>In our book, we argue that the disintegration of life among inner-city African Americans in the 1960s and 1970s, culminating in the crack epidemic, was echoed forty years later by the epidemic of deaths of despair among whites. Black Americans, then among the least-skilled workers, faced the leading-edge of globalization as manufacturing jobs in cities were lost.</p><p>In the last thirty years, globalization and automation has eliminated many more jobs, especially for less-skilled workers. Wages fell along with employment as good jobs vanished and workers relocated to less well-paying jobs, gig jobs, or jobs in labor supply firms, or dropped out of the labor force altogether. Some of the worst jobs like chicken processing plants in rural America, or meat packing plants--where many immigrants work--have become danger zones in the COVID-19 epidemic. Good, stable, jobs with high wages became scarcer, undermining the foundations of community and social life. In many of the worst-affected communities, where despair ran deep, pharma companies pushed doctors to prescribe huge numbers of opioids--essentially FDA approved heroin--a ladder from despair to addiction and death. Meanwhile, globalization opened up new worlds of opportunities for the educated elite, who prospered as never before, some quite spectacularly so.</p><p>African Americans have long done worse than whites on almost all positive outcomes, in unemployment, wages, wealth, housing, health insurance and access to quality healthcare, and especially in rates of imprisonment. On some indicators, such as self-reported pain, or life-satisfaction, education now appears to be as important a divide as race. However, while a third of white Americans have a BA or more, less than a quarter of blacks Americans do.</p><p>Health insurance and healthcare pre-COVID</p><p>American healthcare played an important role in the disaster even before COVID-19. There are three key facts: American health care is exorbitantly expensive; much of it is financed through employer provided health insurance; and it delivers relatively poor outcomes. It is a major driver of income inequality, because it transfers unnecessarily large sums upward from the general public to providers, some of whom are very wealthy, and it lowers wages and destroys good jobs for lower paid workers. An average family (single) policy cost $20,000 ($10,000) in 2019 which has to come out of what the worker is worth to the firm. This means lower wages, or often for the least skilled, elimination of the job. Outsourcing firms can provide the same work, but often without benefits, and at lower wages; few large firms now hire their own janitors, security guards, drivers, or food-service workers. Those low-level jobs--the proverbial mailroom worker--often provided the sense of being part of an important firm, and for some, the opportunity for promotion. The rapid increase in the cost of healthcare--now twice as expensive as in any other country--has lowered wages, destroyed jobs for the less-educated, and enriched hospital executives, pharmaceutical companies, device manufacturers, insurance executives, and a minority of physicians--the most common occupation among the top one percent.</p><p>All of this harm is over and above the role of the system in the opioid epidemic.</p><p>DURING THE PANDEMIC</p><p>The quick and the dead: age, sex, race, and ethnicity</p><p>Death does not come equally to all, especially not COVID deaths. COVID infections and death are structured by sex, by age, by race and ethnicity, by education, and by geography. Pre-existing inequalities shape who dies and who lives, just as the pandemic itself creates new inequalities.</p><p>In some cases, the odds of dying are approximately (and only approximately) proportionally elevated for everyone so that the epidemic reinforces pre-existing health inequalities. Men are more likely to die than women from COVID; by June 10, 51,397 men had died, and 44,209 women. In 2018, with no COVID, 1.5 million men died and 1.4 million women; the normal disadvantage of men is has been exaggerated by COVID. Older people were more likely to die at baseline, and are more likely to die in the pandemic. By June 10, the ratio of COVID deaths for those aged 85 and over to deaths for those aged 55 to 64 was 2.8 to 1; in 2018, that ratio was 2.3 to 1. Once again, COVID somewhat exaggerates the mortality inequalities by age and sex that already exist.</p><p>While we are used to the fact that the old are more likely to die than the young, and that men are more likely to die than women, we do not fully understand why these differences exist, and if, as seems likely, they are influenced in part by social arrangements, they are potentially correctable. The mechanisms of COVID are even less well understood. It could be that, like a predator in the wild, it singles out the weak. Or it could be something more specific, like older people are less likely to have had another childhood vaccine that is partially protective--like rubella. Old people who live in nursing homes have been heavily affected. There is also evidence that women are more likely than men to accept and observe social distancing restrictions.</p><p>The exaggeration of pre-existing mortalities is much larger for African Americans relative to whites, while, for Hispanics, a pre-existing mortality advantage (the so-called Hispanic paradox) has changed into a mortality disadvantage with more Hispanics dying than their proportion in the population. In 2018, relative to white non-Hispanics, blacks' death rates were 18 percent higher, and white Hispanic death rates a third lower. During the pandemic, and up to June 10, blacks' mortality rates from COVID were 84 percent higher than for whites, and Hispanics four percent higher. It is important to note that these differences have already changed and will change more with time and as the geographic composition of the epidemic changes. As the pandemic spreads to more places that are predominately white, the white advantage will diminish, although it almost certainly will not vanish.</p><p>Death rates have been disturbingly high among native Americans. In Arizona, AIANs account for 22 percent of COVID deaths, but are only four percent of the population. In New Mexico, they are 50 percent of deaths, but are only nine percent of the population.</p><p>What explains these racial and ethnic differentials? We will not have definitive answers for some time, but we know something.</p><p>Where and how people live matters a great deal for any infectious disease, including COVID. The disease has not yet reached some areas, many of them predominately white. Many minorities live in segregated communities, with high population density and multifamily living arrangements. Segregated communities are often less well-served by healthcare. These inequalities have long been known, but have a new significance with COVID.</p><p>Transportation seems to have been important in New York City, as people commuted in crowded subway trains to Manhattan from the ethnic and racially structured communities in which they lived. The patterns of mortality by race and ethnicity are quite different in New Jersey and Massachusetts than in New York, showing less or no white advantage. Geography, transportation, and segregation all help control the spread of an infectious disease.</p><p>Pre-existing conditions make COVID more deadly. Patients who suffer from underlying health conditions, particularly cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or chronic lung disease, are six times more likely to be hospitalized, and once hospitalized twelve times more likely to die from COVID. Because underlying health conditions are more common among the less educated, and among African Americans, they contribute to the COVID mortality differences among those groups.</p><p>Minority workers are disproportionately represented in services and in healthcare. The CDC reports that 25 percent of Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks work in services occupations, compared with only 16 percent of whites. African Americans are 12 percent of all employment but 30 percent of nurses.</p><p>African Americans are disproportionately incarcerated, and prisons have become hotspots for COVID.</p><p>The patterns we document in Deaths of despair, with mortality and income gaps expanding simultaneously, will be further exaggerated by the pandemic, or rather by the measures that have been taken to moderate and control it. Many educated people get to stay at home, continue to earn their salaries, communicate with colleagues and friends electronically. Their health is protected along with their incomes. Their children take zoom classes and their attendance is monitored by their parents.</p><p>People without a college degree keep their jobs, if they are essential workers, but may risk infection, or, if they are not essential, lose their jobs and risk their earnings, but stay safe. Essential occupations include food and agriculture (including retail and the infamous meatpacking jobs) where only 14 percent of workers have a BA, and where about half of workers are people of color. For non-essential workers who lose their jobs, most have been at least temporarily covered by emergency payments. In the longer term, some jobs may never return, and some workers may feel they have to return to work, even when they do not feel safe. Otherwise, they risk not having money to buy food, or to pay rent.</p><p>Under these conditions, the gaps by education in both health and earnings will surely expand.</p><p>Healthcare is supposed to be met by the money paid to hospitals in the CARE act, and insurers are largely foregoing copays and deductibles. But the situation remains murky, and many people may face hospital charges. A quarter of a million people have been hospitalized with COVID since the pandemic began, and that number could more than double by the end. If insurers pay now, they will have to recoup later. There is scope here for enormous popular discontent as this situation unwinds. If so, there will also be demands for reform.</p><p>Other issues and looking forward to post-COVID</p><p>The Constitution of the US embodies sharp inequalities in political representation in the Senate. The largest four states, California, Texas, Florida, and New York, have a third of the population, but only eight percent of the Senate. In contrast, Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, and South Dakota comprise less than one percent of the population but also have eight Senate seats. The distribution of COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths are more concentrated than population and have even fewer Senate votes. The four states with the highest number of deaths, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Michigan have half of all deaths so far, and, once again, eight percent of Senate votes.</p><p>This inequality will narrow as the pandemic moves across the country and into more rural areas. But, for the present, the inequality of representation makes it harder to provide financial relief to the states that are hardest hit.</p><p>In the gilded age, with vast material inequalities, antitrust laws were introduced to break up trusts and to make capitalism fairer to workers and consumers. Many commentators and researchers have recently been concerned about increasing industrial concentration today: hospitals are an important example, airlines another, though the champion is retail, with Amazon and Walmart. A related but distinct concern is about big tech, their quasi monopoly position, and whether they are a net benefits or threats to society. At the same time, the share of labor in GDP--long thought to be an immutable constant--has been falling, not only in the US but around the world. If there is prolonged unemployment post-COVID, the position of labor will weaken further. Many have argued that government anti-trust enforcers, and the courts, have lost interest in antitrust enforcement. Prices of many goods and services that used to be cheaper in the US than in Europe are now more expensive, arguably because the EC has been a more effective regulator than the US.</p><p>All this can be argued both ways. Big tech, and retailers like Amazon and Walmart have brought great benefits to us all. Yet there is a level of discomfort that is growing to something like alarm as COVID causes greater consolidation. Many bricks and mortar facilities have been closed, whether inessential retail or manufacturing, while anything with an e- in front of it has been open. Many stores have gone bankrupt. Big tech has money to purchase firms in difficulties, as does private equity.</p><p>One thing that I do not worry about is that the unemployment we see now, and that may last for a while, will bring an epidemic of deaths of despair. Our book argues that deaths of despair are the consequence of a prolonged, half-century undermining of the supports of working-class life in America. These deaths do not respond to the ups and downs of employment and unemployment. Deaths of despair were rising before the Great Recession, they rose during the Great Recession, and they continued to rise after the Great Recession. We expect deaths of despair to continue through the pandemic, but not to spike in response to the unemployment that has been generated as a part of social distancing.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://budget.house.gov/sites/democrats.budget.house.gov/files/documents/Deaton_Testimony.pdf\">https://budget.house.gov/sites/democrats.budget.house.gov/files/documents/Deaton_Testimony.pdf</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSHC623001Z3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:606M-3591-JCCP-03YN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3168\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 23, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Country &amp;

Good afternoon and welcome to the budget committee's hearing entitled Software Update Required: COVID-19 Exposes Need for Federal Investments in Technology. </p><p>I want to welcome our witnesses who are here with us today. At the outset, I want to welcome our--I want--I ask unanimous consent that the chair be authorized to declare a recess at any time to address technical difficulties that may arise with such remote proceedings. Without objection, so ordered.  </p><p>As a reminder, we are holding this hearing virtually in compliance with the regulations for committee proceedings pursuant to House Resolution 965. First, consistent with regulations, the chair or staff designated by the chair may mute participants microphones when they are not under recognition for the purposes of eliminating inadvertent background noise. Members are responsible for unmuting themselves when they seek recognition or when they are recognized for their five minutes. We are not permitted to unmute--to unmute members unless they explicitly request assistance. If I notice you have not unmuted yourself I will ask you if you would like the staff to unmute you. If you indicate approval by nodding the staff will unmute your microphone. They will not unmute you under any other conditions.  </p><p>Second, members must have their cameras on throughout this proceeding and must be visible on screen in order to be recognized. As a reminder, members may not participate in more than one committee proceeding simultaneously. </p><p>Finally, to maintain safety in light of the attending physician's new guidance, any members present in the hearing room may--must--must wear a mask at all times when they are not speaking. Those members not wanting to wear a mask the House rules provide a way to participate remotely from your office without being physically present in the hearing room.  </p><p>Now, I want to introduce our witnesses. This afternoon we will be hearing from Ms. Teresa Gerton, President and CEO of the National Academy of Public Administration. Ms. Jennifer Pahlka, founder of Code for America and co-founder of U.S. Digital Response. Ms. Rebecca Dixon, Executive Director of the National Employment Law Project, and Dr. Robert Wah, a physician leader in healthcare and technology.  </p><p>I will now yield myself five minutes for an opening statement. It's appropriate that today, on our postponed tax day, we are discussing how our nation's outdated information technology systems have failed to meet the needs of the American people. Rash funding cuts over the past decade have prevented the IRS from modernizing its IT systems, deteriorating the agency's ability, not only to carry out its core function of tax collection and enforcement, but also needlessly prolonging the delivery of stimulus payments to workers and families during the Coronavirus pandemic and recession.  </p><p>The pandemic has proved that the quicker the response the better the outcome and that the steps taken by Congress to help American workers and families are only as effective as the agencies delivering that really. Unfortunately, the IRS is not alone in its inability to meet the needs of the American people in these perilous times. Instead of helping to generate much needed solutions outdated IT systems are worsening an already difficult situation as Americans grapple with unreliable or insufficient internet access, useless automated systems, and overwhelmed and under-prepared agencies.  </p><p>Emergency assistance programs across the board have been--been hampered by our antiquated IT systems, leaving families with delayed relief or no relief at all. The most glaring example is unemployment assistance. We are four months into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression and there are still tens of thousands of workers who have filed for jobless claims but have not yet received a single payment, many are going into debt or default, skipping meals or losing their homes.  </p><p>State unemployment offices, already underfunded and understaffed, were left completely unprepared for the massive influx of need. And a big reason for that is that the fact that the--the national administrative funding is essentially the same as it was in 2001 - and that's before accounting for inflation. This lack of federal investment combined with old hardware, crashing web services, and the need for new hires efficient in COBOL, their system's 60-year-old coding language, have left state scrambling. The antiquated IT systems failed and continue to fail repeatedly and American workers, those who lost their jobs through no fault of their own, are paying the price.  </p><p>This aspect of our ongoing crisis is not new. The federal government has long sought to prioritize modern, secure and shared IT solutions but funding uncertainties stemming from constrained discretionary funding under budget caps, shut down threats, and continuing resolutions have made agencies more likely to update instead of modernize. And I might add, after reading today's testimony, that it may be--another factor may be flawed philosophy of how to handle the old data management system.  </p><p>GAO reports that while the total share of federal IT spending is increasing it isn't because we are investing in better and new technology, it's because the price of updating our existing systems is snowballing as our ancient software becomes increasingly outdated and hardware parts nearly impossible to find.  </p><p>We are passing these acute problems on to state and local partners that distribute unemployment insurance, nutrition assistance and other support to workers and families on behalf of the federal government. Federal and state governments are in dire need of solutions and investments now. We cannot foster a successful recovery while relying on IT systems from the 1950s. We cannot meet the demands of today when we are depending on software that is older than some members of this committee.  </p><p>To date, Congress has passed legislation that includes $1 billion in grants to state unemployment offices to help process claims faster and more is needed.. By refusing to bring the HEROES Act to the floor Leader McConnell is holding up an additional $1 billion for the Federal Technology Modernization Fund and a combined $5.5 billion to help schools, libraries and impacted families access high speed connectivity and devices to facilitate distance learning, something we must prioritize in order to protect our children and educators.  </p><p>Earlier this month, House Democrats passed the Moving Forward Act, a comprehensive infrastructure package that includes $100 billion in broadband funding to extend high speed internet to under-served and hard to reach communities. We have to invest in modernization now so that the federal government can help provide workers, families and state and local governments with the necessary tools and resources to support our nation's recovery efforts. I look forward to discussing this urgent need with our witnesses.  </p><p>I now yield five minutes to the ranking vice chair, Mr. Johnson, of Ohio. </p><p>JOHNSON: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for holding this important hearing. and--and a special thanks to our witnesses for joining us today.  </p><p>You know, as an information technology professional with over 30 years in the industry, I understand just how important IT is in today's digitally connected world. And there is no doubt that the Coronavirus pandemic has demonstrated the need for workers, businesses and students all across America to have reliable access to the internet. And these networks must be secure. Instances of Zoom bombing cannot become commonplace in our children's online classrooms, nor can businesses operate on hacked systems.  </p><p>In areas such as eastern and southeastern Ohio, other rural parts of the country, the Coronavirus has emphasized the need for broadband Internet access, period. Our students in rural Appalachia are not, for example, able to take advantage of eLearning because they simply don't have access to the internet. I've even heard horror stories from local teachers having to teach their classes remotely from their cars parked in a McDonald's parking lot because they don't have access to internet at home. While I applaud their dedication to their students, I'm simultaneously frustrated by the lack of progress we've made online solving the digital divide.  </p><p>It is also imperative that federal information technology systems are safe, secure and reliable. Federal workers, many of whom have been working remotely the last several months, often handle sensitive or classified data. It's vitally important that we have procedures in place to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to such data so that we can prevent exposure of personally identifiable data and avoid greater national security risks.  </p><p>And we've seen how the Coronavirus has heightened our awareness of just how fragile our supply chains are, including our reliance on other countries for critical items, including the dangers of companies controlled by our adversaries that are equipping our networks. We must ensure that companies like Huawei and ZTE no longer have access to our networks.  </p><p>While these concerns call for federal assistance for efforts such as rip and replace programs, the federal government should also leverage American ingenuity. I've often said technology industries have in part been so successful because the federal government could never find a way to regulate them. Public/private partnerships and investments in tech startups here at home can be more cost effective and in the long run more advantageous in terms of providing methodologies for advancing needed IT solutions. America has always been and must continue to be the front runner in technological innovation.  </p><p>Information Technology crosses every sector of our economy and investments in IT can drastically improve our way of life by creating efficiencies, providing access to an ever increasing digital global economy, lifesaving medical treatments, motor vehicle safety, advanced weapon systems to provide our national security, and countless other solutions to problems that we haven't even begun to realize yet. However, we must ensure that federal funds are used efficiently and transparently, particularly when it comes to IT. We've seen far too many instances of the federal government throwing money at a problem instead of investing in carefully detailed and proven solutions.  </p><p>One example of this occurred at the VA back in 2012. Then VA Secretary Shinseki's main objective was creating an electronic health record, yet his top IT advisor could not show me a graphic of the department's IT architecture. If a federal agency can't show Congress exactly where the IT funding would be going, how the system connect, how the IT investments would enable the agency to further its main missions, then we shouldn't be supporting an increasing and an IT's--in an agency's IT budget.  </p><p>There is no question that federal funding for IT modernization is important, but many challenges of its modernization efforts have included missed deadlines, cost overruns, and the abandonment of failed programs, not to mention a lack of transparency. Federal IT programs are important, but Congress must focus on reining in autopilot spending while prioritizing limited discretionary resources on federal IT investments that demand agency accountability, efficiency and ultimately, successful execution.  </p><p>I look forward to hearing from our witnesses on this important topic. Mr. Chairman, thanks again for this hearing, and I yield back. Mr. Chairman, you're muted. </p><p>YARMUTH: Thank you. See, they mute me too automatically. </p><p>Anyway, thank you, Mr. Johnson for your opening statement. In the interest of time, if any other members have opening statements you may submit those statements electronically to the clerk for the record.  </p><p>Once again, I want to thank our witnesses for being here this--this afternoon. The committee has received your written testimony and it will be made part of the formal hearing record.  </p><p>Each of you will have five minutes to give your oral remarks. As a reminder, please unmute your microphone before speaking.  </p><p>Ms. Gerton, you'll be recognized for five minutes. Please mute your microphone. You may begin when you're ready. </p><p>GERTON: Thank you, Chairman Yarmuth, Ranking Member--Vice Chair Johnson and members of the committee. I appreciate the opportunity to testify today. I'm a fellow at the National Academy of Public Administration and have served as its president and chief executive officer since January of 2017. Established in 1967 and chartered by Congress in 1984, the Academy is an independent, nonprofit and nonpartisan organization with a proven record of improving the quality, performance and accountability of government at all levels.  </p><p>As the title of this hearing plainly states, the Coronavirus pandemic has laid bare the challenging state of government IT systems at every level, but this is not a new problem. In 2016, the Government Accountability Office identified the 10 oldest IT systems in the federal government. At that time they included the IRS Individual Master File that receives taxpayer data and dispenses refunds. The Department of Veteran Affairs Benefit Delivery Network that tracks benefit claims filed by veterans and the Transportation Department Hazardous Material Information System. IT modernization has been on GAO's high risk list for decades and critical IT related topics on the most recent list include the 2020 census, DoD's business systems modernization and the nation's cybersecurity.  </p><p>This situation, though, does not surprise those in government who have keeping these outdated systems operational through both extraordinary ingenuity and the electronic equivalent for failing wire (INAUDIBLE). But it does beg another question, if government officials know how close these critical systems are to failure why haven't they fixed them before now?  </p><p>As our government IT systems rely on programming language and hardware developed in the late 20th century, our federal budgeting and acquisition systems are equally archaic. In the simplest example it is far easier to get budget authority to maintain those old COBOL systems than it is to procure an agile software development and sustainment contract that would deliver modern functionality, improve cybersecurity and better citizen service.  </p><p>Regarding acquisition practices, the Federal Acquisition Regulation unrealistically categorizes all participants as either supplies or services. This distinction, established decades ago, is too rigid to effectively procure modern technology solutions (INAUDIBLE) with evolving delivery models. It often leads to contracts that are neither optimized nor appropriate for the solution being acquired. And ironically, government bears an extra cost burden for such strategies because they must allocate expensive resources to maintain obsolete and inefficient solutions, which by any reasonable standard should have been rationalized and replaced long ago.  </p><p>Institutionally, we approach IT as an overhead cost, always seeking to minimize it instead of seeing it as a fundamental tool in the 21st century that would deliver increased accountability, better outcomes and improved citizen satisfaction.  </p><p>In a recent attempt to address this situation, Congress authorized the Technology Modernization Fund and the Modernizing Government Technology Act pf 2017. The TMF received $100 million in 2018 to the fund modernization projects, $25 million in 2019, and an additional $25 million in FY 20. And yet, members of Congress remain skeptical of a revolving fund approach to IT investment.  </p><p>The Academy recognized these challenges when we released last November our list of 12 Grand Challenges in public administration. Our list of Grand Challenges includes ensure (INAUDIBLE) security and privacy rights of individuals and make government AI ready. We also established the Agile Government Center to assist government agencies applying to their business practices the agile development processes that have made software development so rapid and responsive.  </p><p>We're currently developing proposed agendas in these and all 12 of the Grand Challenges. The drive change beginning in January of 2021. In our ongoing mission to promote best practices, the Academy has partnered with sponsors to co-host a monthly forum on shared services, and quarterly forums on grants management and working capital funding management. Taken together, these three venues are helping managers across the federal government modernize their business practices and IT investment strategies to improve operations and reduce costs. They are making the improvements they can within the rules they currently operate under.  </p><p>But to really change the future we must change the rules. Today the government has challenges with cloud procurement, but the market is constantly evolving, more things will be sold as a service in the future and with enablers like quantum computing and machine learning technology, innovation will inevitably continue at an increasing rate. We must be ready to effectively acquire the resultant solutions or risk failures in our support to our citizens and potentially catastrophic failures in our ability to govern. The National Academy of Public Administration stands ready to assist in all of these efforts.  </p><p>Mr. Chairman, that concludes my statement and be pleased to answer any questions you or the committee members may have. </p><p>YARMUTH: Thank you, Ms. Gerton, for your testimony. I now recognize Ms. Pahlka for five minutes. Please unmute your mic and proceed. </p><p>PAHLKA: Thank you. Chair Yarmuth, Ranking Member Womack and members of the committee, I very much appreciate your inviting me here today to add my voice to this critical topic.  </p><p>A common proverb tells us that the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago and the second best time is now. Now that COVID has thrown millions of Americans lives into chaos and created unprecedented need for sport it's clear that the best time to modernize government services was 20 years ago. We have largely failed to update our policies, processes and technology to enable scalable, agile, human centered services.  </p><p>And now we find that while Congress has the will to support the American people through this crisis, in too many areas the machinery of government just can't deliver. Up to 15 million people have not received their stimulus checks. People who may have been exposed to the virus are not alerted quickly because too many counties still share data by fax machine. It's clear that the next best time to modernize our government is now.  </p><p>We must invest in modernizing the technology that runs our services, but I am deeply concerned that the urgency of the moment will cause us to forget that we must also change how we make these investments. Now, more than ever, we cannot afford to pour time, attention and enormous sums of money into a process for building and buying software that hasn't worked for decades.  </p><p>Let's take unemployment benefits. The state systems that deliver this service rely on a hodgepodge of legacy systems and has been already called out in this hearing. at their core, many of them still use mainframe systems running a programming language designed in 1959. We're asking this technology to be agile, handling now the demands of three programs with dependencies between each instead of one. We're asking it to scale, in some places to 9 to 20 times the previous volume. And we're asking it to work for people, for the questions and processes to be clear so that applicants know how to answer them accurately without assistance, for the people who administer the program to be empowered to make decisions that get the benefit to those in need as fast as possible.  </p><p>Neither the technology nor the policies were designed to be agile, scalable, or get to yes and we have known this for decades. Ten years ago the National Association of State Workforce Agencies stated that most state IT systems cannot efficiently handle today's demands. Many states joined consortia to contract for new systems together. Some of these systems have been implemented in the states for which they were procured. Others are somewhere along in the 10, 12, even 15 year procurement and development cycles. Collectively, they've spent billions of taxpayer dollars and yet even the states that had supposedly modernized are struggling to respond to this crisis.  </p><p>Modernization has largely failed in these cases and will continue to fail as long as these projects and others that support other very needed benefits, follow the basic recipe of large, slow government procurement and development done in the conventional model. By definition, you cannot modernize if the project takes over a decade. By definition - excuse me - and you cannot modernize by simply moving legacy policies and practices that have accumulated over decades to slightly less outdated technology platforms.  </p><p>True modernization breaks down the silos between policy, technology and other disciplines so that the service itself can be co designed to work for its users and people who administer in it. True modernization means that services provide real-time data about their usage and that program administrators analyze that data to understand what's working, what's not working and what can be done about it so that it can get constantly better. These agile human-centered models for developing government software systems work. When public servants are allowed to use them these models reduce risk and the projects that use them cost less and deliver results faster.  </p><p>These models are currently in use at all levels of government at places like the United States Digital Service, GSA's 18F, Kessel Run at the Air Force, Defense Digital Service, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, several states also have stood up their own digital service teams but the vast majority of government technology projects still do things the old way. Why? A common belief, or perhaps an excuse, is that Congress dictates the old model and will punish any deviation from how it's always been done.  </p><p>To fix this, Congress will need to be more than a checkbook. This body will have to become a staunch and visible ally of hybrid tech policy teams who practice agile development and user-centered design wherever they exist. To use a metaphor beloved by my former boss, Todd Park, we need to stop arming the empire and start arming the rebels. Stop pouring millions of dollars into projects everyone knows will fail, fund the USDS and the state digital services who can help others across government successfully implement these practices. This is not just the next best time to truly modernize government services, it is our last chance. Thank you. </p><p>YARMUTH: Thank you, Ms. Pahlka for your testimony. I now recognize Ms. Dixon for five minutes. Please unmute your mic and proceed. You have it, Ms. Dixon.  </p><p>DIXON: Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Chairman Yarmuth and Ranking Member Womack and members of the committee for the opportunity to testify today. I'm Rebecca Dixon, Executive Director of the National Employment Law Project, NELP. The challenges facing workers seeking access to unemployment insurance payments as an issue that NELP has been working on for many years. I appreciate the committee's work to ensure robust UI access for millions of workers and job seekers, especially underpaid black indigenous Latinx people and workers of color.  </p><p>The current employment surge poses--unemployment surge, poses an unprecedented challenge, although new claims peaked at 6.6 million this week--this spring, states are still processing upwards of 2 million claims a week, which is twice the highest week in history. Workers are understandably frustrated. During the course of this pandemic it has been impossible to ignore the human suffering from workers unsuccessfully attempting to access UI.  </p><p>Entire online systems crashed. In several states, workers trying to contact the agency with questions about online applications have been unable to get through. Some report calling dozens of times a day. Claimants were confused about how to check the status of their claim and were left in limbo for weeks. States had difficulty reprogramming their systems to provide expanded benefits. In some states that took up to a month and a half to establish the online application process for the new pandemic unemployment assistance.  </p><p>For underpaid workers two months delay can be the difference between surviving and losing everything. For example, Rena from California, was furloughed from a small event production company but the industry won't return for a long time. She's already had to move to a cheaper apartment, gone through her entire life savings waiting for unemployment and now he's worried that she's going to lose her health insurance, home, car, and even ability to eat. Meanwhile, the program has been especially important for workers of color. According to the CBO, 47 percent of workers receiving UI in July are workers of color. This includes 16 percent of black workers, 14 percent of Latin-x workers, 10 percent of white workers, and 14 percent of workers of other backgrounds.  </p><p>Seven years ago I wrote a report called Federal Neglect Leaves State Unemployment Insurance Systems in Disrepair and unfortunately, much of what I wrote remains true today. Only 16 states have fully modernized their systems with the rest operating on, as others have mentioned, a COBOL mainframe. In addition, when states do not move to update these--do move to update these outdated systems we are seeing--we've seen significant delays and service disruptions breakdowns, backlogs and delays.  </p><p>It's also important to recognize that modernization is not a panacea and does not always mean progress. After all, Florida has, \"Modernized their system,\" but it was built on a foundation of public policy choices that were designed to limit access to UI. Few people realize that Florida's catastrophically failed system was modernized with a consortium with Massachusetts and New Mexico. When the other states in the consortium ran into problems with user access they went back to work with their vendor to improve their systems and as a result did not have the same results as Florida.  </p><p>Michigan's IT system was also designed to fail. Its MIDAS system flagged more than 40,000 workers for fraud and its accuracy was--it was 93 percent inaccurate. This is a really big penalty in Michigan four times the amount paid plus 12 percent interest and as a result, some claimants lost everything. The new administration in Michigan has committed to improving these systems and now has shifted course and become one of the fastest states in terms of payment processing. We know that faster payment processing is possible for all states.  </p><p>Congress must ensure that you UI IT systems are functional and accessible, specifically NELP recommends funding modernization requiring input from workers and advocates from beginning to end and comprehensive user testing to ensure  participation from black people who face the most barriers and all communities of color. We also want to include those who are on the other side of the digital divide, people with limited English proficiency, people with disabilities.  </p><p>Meanwhile, we should also create a unit devoted to IT that can give states hands-on assistance in modernization, review contractor agreements, audit contractors where necessary, and require states to document contractor performance, creating a federal task force to evaluate purpose performance and recommend reforms, including compliance with civil rights laws. This task force would function to determine whether some parts of the system need to be federalized. It would also have the authority to negotiate favorable terms with vendors and take advantage of the government's ability to leverage cost savings and produce high quality systems.  </p><p>More broadly centered customer centered design and user experience testing is also a recommendation. There are widely accepted practices in the private sector that can be implemented here. Unemployed workers need 24/7 online access, mobile services and they need their password reset protocols improved.  </p><p>In closing, the crisis was highlighted--has highlighted gaping holes in accessing unemployment, but it has also created an opportunity. We can build a 21st century system that's nimble enough to handle disasters and designed to meet the needs of customers who are depending on access to UI. Thank you. </p><p>YARMUTH: Thank you, Ms. Dixon, for your statement and I now recognize Dr. Wah for five minutes. Please unmute and proceed when you're ready.  </p><p>WAH: Chairman Yarmuth, Vice Ranking Member Johnson and committee members, thank you for inviting me to testify today. My name is Robert Wah. I'm a physician with over 23 years of active duty naval service and have worked in health IT for over 25 years. I was the Associate Chief Information Officer for Military Health at DoD and then the first Deputy National Coordinator at HHS, setting up the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT that we now call ONC. I also worked in the private sector IT. </p><p>Health IT has advanced in three major waves. First, we moved from paper records to digital information. Next, the digital information was networked together. The third wave uses this virtual pool of network digital information for analytics, machine learning, research, and population health.  </p><p>Picture everyone in healthcare, patients, doctors, and providers, hospitals, pharmacies, payers, government, and researchers all around this virtual pool of interoperable health information putting in and taking data. The ONC has nearly completed wave one and they are advancing wave two and three. This work must be continued, supported and funded.  </p><p>As has been noted, COVID-19 has exposed many needs and opportunities for federal health IT funding beyond the continued work on waves two and three. COVID-19 has highlighted the value of virtual remote healthcare as effective, efficient and well accepted. Investment is needed to connect telemedicine with this virtual pool of interoperable health information just like in-person care.  </p><p>Health information exchanges formed in wave two need to support public health and research. Traditional public health asks that certain diseases be reported when they're found, like tuberculosis or sexually transmitted diseases. A virtual pool of information will allow public health officials to see patterns of new diseases and epidemics before they're even named or reports or formula. Clusters of patients with fever, cough and sudden loss of taste and smell could be identified before we even knew to call it COVID. Funding to connect public health agencies to this wave two virtual pool is critical.  </p><p>In parallel, investment is needed to connect research innovation to the pool to expand clinical trials and use real-world evidence about new COVID treatments and vaccines. The pool has information about millions of people, not just a few hundred or thousand in clinical trial. </p><p>Now, Sam, if you could show my graphic I'd appreciate it.  </p><p>COVID-19 tests normally just have the patient's name and the result. Here's an example of the virtual pool across six states combining information on 1.5 million COVID patients tested where they displayed the results but also the distribution of patients by age, gender, race, and ethnicity. This is all because there's enrichment due to the virtual pool of information that's added to the patient's name and result.  </p><p>Sam, you can take that picture down now.  </p><p>For patients with chronic diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart, and lung disease, COVID has made them sicker and die more frequent. Patients with chronic diseases also use the largest part of our health care expenditures. We can connect with these patients in places they visit frequently. There are self-service smart health stations with free blood pressure, weight, BMI, and health assessments in pharmacies, grocery stores and for hard to reach population, food banks in unemployment offices. Funding investment can connect them to the virtual information pool so public health tools can be employed.  </p><p>One network has 10,000 stations nationwide and has taken over 350 million measurements in the last eight years. These could identify hotspots of pre-diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, and cardiovascular disease targeted for prevention and precautions during pandemic exposure and connect the patients to virtual and in-person care.  </p><p>COVID-19 has also highlighted the need to increase funding for supply chain technology and management in conjunction with our Strategic National Stockpile. As we send doctors and healthcare workers into battle every day we must arm them with medications, equipment, eventual vaccines, and personal protection equipment, PPE, to effectively fight the war against the pandemic. </p><p>I hope we'll have time later to talk about using clinical data outside healthcare, like back to work and travel, as well as cybersecurity. These are complex issues. Health is vital and personal to all of our citizens and costs make up a large part of the GDP. Government must use all available levers, policy, regulations, legislation, as well as financial to improve the health of the nation. Investment in health IT has a high impact on the health of our citizens and a high return on investment. We must continue investments in wave two and three in coordination with the ONC. Funding for the issues above will improve the health of our citizens during this fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and future health risks.  </p><p>Thank you for the opportunity to be here today. I look forward to your questions. Thank you very much. </p><p>YARMUTH: Thank you, Dr. Wah, for your testimony and once again, thanks to all of the witnesses for their testimony.  </p><p>I will now begin our question and answer session. As a reminder, members may submit written questions to be answered later in writing. Those questions and the answers of the witnesses will be made part of the formal hearing record. Any members who wish to submit questions for the record may do so by sending them to the clerk electronically within seven days. As I usually do, I will defer my questions until the end. So I now recognize the vice chairman of the committee, the gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. Moulton, for five minutes. </p><p>MOULTON: Good afternoon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and I want to thank all the witnesses for making the time to testify. And I'd like to offer a special thanks to Ms. Pahlka. My team worked closely with Code for America's Boston Brigade to develop an app to educate current and retired public servants about the Social Security Windfall Elimination Provision and allow them to accurately calculate their likely WEP reduction. This app is now hosted by Mass Retirees, an organization of retired public employees in the Bay State. And I'm extremely grateful for your leadership and vision that helped make this project possible.  </p><p>Sir Winston Churchill is credited with first saying, \"Never let a good crisis go to waste.\" He said that in the mid-1940s as we were approaching the end of World War II. We must take the opportunity to learn from our crisis today to prepare better for the future and to create a more capable government and a stronger, better country for our children and grandchildren.  </p><p>Per a recent GAO report the federal government invested over $90 billion in IT in fiscal year 2019 but 80 percent of this, a staggering $72 billion, went towards operating and maintaining existing aging IT investments. I mean, can you imagine if you spend 80 percent of your household budget in the next five years, not on buying new devices, upgrading your TV or phone or buying a new computer when yours becomes obsolete, but simply maintaining the devices that you have? Think about that, investing almost the entirety of your family IT budget in repairing your 1950s TV set to keep it working every year, which only becomes more expensive over time as the technology becomes more obsolete, rather than ever buying a flat screen.  </p><p>Now, speaking of 80 percent, I agree with 80 percent or more of the vice ranking members opening statement, we need to modernize our IT, we need to ensure that our systems are secure and we need to win the competition with China that, frankly, we are starting to lose. But I also want to point out two important places where I disagree.  </p><p>Mr. Johnson spoke about investing in proven solutions and I completely agree with him when it comes to the willingness of government to take commercially available off-the-shelf solutions and put them to work for all of us. In fact, my very first piece of legislation I passed as a member of Congress was a bill to get the VA to use commercially available scheduling apps to enable veterans to schedule their own appointments electronically when the VA wanted to instead spend tens of millions and much more time developing a proprietary solution on their own.  </p><p>But speaking more broadly about government investment in tech, if we only invest in proven solutions we are guaranteed to lose the race to China because China is investing their federal dollars in next generation technology from biotech to quantum computing and pushing the frontier forward not in buying tech that exists but in developing technology that does not. In fact, the Republican witness at our previous hearing specifically pointed out that federal investment should be focused on technology that is unproven, specifically because taking these investment risks is necessary for progress but often unbearable by the private sector.  </p><p>The other point is no regulation of tech. I hate excessive regulation as much as any American but complete and total lack of any regulation in tech is why we have foreign influence in our elections, unbridled monopolistic power in big tech, and we rely on elected representatives of the people to establish laws for weighty issues like which Facebook or Twitter posts to delete but rather rely on 20 something kids and black boxes to make those decisions on their own with no accountability whatsoever to the elected officials or the American people. There is a place for regulation in tech and there's much more that we need to do.  </p><p>My last engagement before this hearing was a visit to North Shore Medical Center, our local hospital, to thank the heroes on the front-lines who have been fighting this pandemic and doing so quite successfully here in Massachusetts I might add, where we take our science seriously and our case numbers continue to go down. Of course, we are preparing for that to change given what's happening in the rest of the country.  </p><p>There, I heard from doctors and nurses who want to make sure we heed Churchill's advice and ensure that we don't just keep doing this things the same way after this crisis. One great example was how the Psychiatry Department has had greater success with telehealth appointments than in-person visits, enabling people to keep appointments despite other medical conditions or family conflicts.  </p><p>Of course, modernization should happen in Congress as well. One of my team members, Nanda Bhatia, founded the Monetization Staff Association, a bipartisan group that focuses on internal reform issues that primarily affect Jr. Hill staffers. We have a lot of work to do in that department as well, looking ourselves in the mirror.  </p><p>With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. </p><p>YARMUTH: Time has expired. I now recognize the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Johnson, for five minutes. </p><p>JOHNSON: (OFF-MIC) </p><p>YARMUTH: Mr. Johnson's not responding. Can you unmute, Mr. Johnson? Are you there? Well, in that case, I yield five minutes to the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Crenshaw. We'll come back to Mr. Johnson. Is Mr. Crenshaw on? Mr. Crenshaw? No. How about Mr. Burchett? No, Mr. Flores? How about Mr. Flores from Texas? I know he's here. I yield five minutes to Mr. Flores from Texas. </p><p>FLORES: So I'm here. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Anyway, I appreciate the witnesses for joining us today.  </p><p>Dr. Wah, I have a--a few questions for you. Let me give you the preamble to the first set. In 2011, the VA and DoD begin an Electronic Health Record Modernization Initiative to replace two separate electronic health record systems that were used by the two departments to combine them into a single shared system. And in 2013, after spending more than a billion dollars on the program, the secretaries of VA and DoD announced that they will not continue their joint development of a single EHR, instead the VA will buy and convert to the DoD EHR system. And I remember being on the VA committee at the time and was pretty frustrated about that because Congress had ordered the DoD and the VA over a decade earlier to combine their system.  </p><p>So the first question is what were the problems that were encountered that led to the abandonment of this project? Dr. Wah. </p><p>WAH: Yes. Sorry, I had to unmute real quick.  </p><p>FLORES: Okay.  </p><p>WAH: Thank you, congressman.  </p><p>First and foremost, I would say that I left the DoD in 2006 so these events that you're describing happened after my departure. So I certainly don't have firsthand knowledge or an inside view on circumstances that you discussed.  </p><p>It is a complex problem in dealing with two health systems that take care of nearly 20 million patients around the world. From my point of view, part of it is I think the important thing to remember is that there are different reasons for the two organizations. The VA, while they're both healthcare systems taking care of patients, the location and the manner in which they take care of those patients are vastly different.  </p><p>So I--I basically came from the Department of Defense, where we have brick and mortar hospitals in the continental U.S., but also hospitals in (INAUDIBLE) Germany, Japan and things like that. But on top of that we have a--a--a readiness and a battlefield commitment to caring for beneficiaries as well and so we've got to have a system that can meet those requirements that are very unique in the battlefield, in the deployed environment, that the VA is more of about brick and mortar systems that we are accustomed to here in the continental U.S. So I just point that out that the--you know, the requirements are quite different between the two organizations and so finding a solution that meets all of those requirements is an extensive challenge.  </p><p>The other thing I would say is that the DoD and the VA also had really pursued slightly different strategies about government built software versus commercially off-the-shelf software.  </p><p>FLORES: Right.  </p><p>WAH: And so again, merging those two issues is another big challenge.  </p><p>And so, again, I wasn't there when these decisions were made so I can't give you direct insight into your question but these are some of the issues that I've seen that have come up in trying to deploy these vast systems for organizations that have different requirements. </p><p>FLORES: Thank you. I--I appreciate that. By the way, I was totally trying to hold you culpable for those issues so-- </p><p>So let me--let--I have a couple of other questions for the record on that which we'll submit and ask you to respond in writing. But you brought up something. You--you did a lot of work in the past on modernizing the DoD IT system. Can you describe for us the lessons learned from your experience with the DoD IT system? What were your biggest successes, biggest challenges? And how can we take the lessons learned from both the successes and challenges and apply them to future IT implementation? </p><p>WAH: Yeah, thank you for that.  </p><p>I--I think one of the things I would say that I found particularly useful that I have reused in all my other IT work is that it's very important to have, in particular in healthcare IT, clinical input at the outset, at the design and--and--and development of the system, as well as in the deployment of the system. And I'm biased, obviously, because I'm a physician but I believe that having that clinical perspective early on make sure that the technology works in the business process and workflow and the environment in which is going to be used. Left without that the technical architects and programmers may build something that is technically correct but doesn't fit the workflow and business process of healthcare. So there's just something important that I think that adds to the mix.  </p><p>The second thing I'd say that some of the biggest successes I--I always cite is that--one example I give is that in the last 30 years I haven't written a prescription on a piece of paper in a military facility. That's a remarkable data point I think. We're all used to electronic prescribing today, but it hasn't been around for 30 years in very many environments. And what that did was not only the legibility issue about doctors handwriting-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--but it also allowed us to build a real-time data set of 10 million beneficiary's' pharmacy history. So now when I write a prescription at Bethesda, Walter Reed and hit enter it goes against this database and immediately comes back to me and tells me if the prescription I just wrote is going to conflict with an allergy the patient has, a medication they're already on, or have a duplicate one they've already picked up. And this real-time database covers whether they picked up their medication at the Bethesda pharmacy, 66,000 civilian pharmacies, or got it through the mail order system. And we have prevented hundreds of thousands, millions of medication errors just because of that simple change going from paper prescriptions to digital.  </p><p>So I think there are some major advantages that we can cite throughout the time of the Military Health System. There are challenges as you've already cited, and I won't go into all those, but you know, it is--it is very challenging for a large organization with that diverse set of responsibilities in patient care to--to not have problems (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>FLORES: Thank you for your service. Thank you for being here today. I yield back.  </p><p>YARMUTH: The gentleman's time has expired. I now recognize the gentleman from New York, Mr. Higgins, for five minutes. </p><p>HIGGINS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>I find it ironic that we're experiencing technical difficulty on a hearing regarding federal investment in technology. A lot of this, you know, has to do with the current pandemic but I think all of us have experienced in the past five and a half months that COVID-19 has exposed the fragility of the American economy and American society. There is no treatment for this. There is no vaccine, despite the fact that the coronavirus has been with us for 20 years.  </p><p>Unemployment, you know, designed to give people $600 a week was an unmitigated disaster due to the old and broken technology unable to efficiently administer those checks to get people what they needed, money, and to get them what we needed them to do and that spend money creating demand in the economy.  </p><p>The good doctor had mentioned the issue of telemedicine. It certainly was accelerated, the use of it, and a new appreciation for it during this pandemic but it was limited because of the lack of infrastructure technology. Very, very important.  </p><p>You know, the U.S.-China relationship is critical as it relates to technology and who's going to win this race. The U.S.-China trade relationship is no longer about t-shirts, toys and sneakers, it's about technology. China, in the last few years, has invested a trillion dollars connecting China physically but also--also through technology to Europe and the Middle East. The United States spend $350 billion the last major infrastructure investment 15 years ago, 15 years ago. Not good enough. 5G, fifth generation, the super fast cellular networks, that are used as a foundation for both today and tomorrow's technologies, China is beating us. China has outpaced the United States in patent production, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, patents in semiconductors.  </p><p>So Dr. Wah, I just wanted to ask you, sir, on the health care piece of this, if we had better technology in the United States, if we were more advanced in fifth generation, a(PH) super fast cellular networks, would that speed up the development of a vaccine and/or an effective treatment for COVID-19? </p><p>WAH: Well, thank you, Congressman, for that question.  </p><p>I think what I'm hearing you ask is if we had--you--you mentioned things like 5G, which to me is infrastructure-- </p><p>HIGGINS: --Right.-- </p><p>WAH: --and so I think infrastructure is always important in the digital world because we need to move information faster. But for me healthcare IT is all about better information for better decisions and it's the role of the technology to deliver that better information so everybody makes a better decision. The speed in which that information is delivered and--and the ability, the scale is important so to that degree I think infrastructure would help.  </p><p>But there are many other components that are needed to be successful, particularly in developing a vaccine and that's why I cite the virtual pool of information that we're talking about. The richer that pool is, the more people contributing to and taking out of that pool, I think is what's really going to accelerate our ability to make major breakthroughs, not just in COVID, but in other diseases. And as I said before, imagine that we could use that pool to recognize patterns of disease that we don't even know what the disease is yet. We just know there's a cluster or a problem somewhere and then we can employ machine learning and augmented intelligence to sort that out.  </p><p>So I think yes, I would support better infrastructure, but it's really what that infrastructure supports, which is this grander pool of information. </p><p>HIGGINS: My final question, Doctor, vaccine development traditionally is a process that takes about 10 to 15 years. The fastest vaccine that was developed was developed for Ebola and that took five years and manufactured later by Merck. I'm concerned that the hope for a vaccine in the first quarter of next year and the reality, I'm concerned they cannot be reconciled. Do you have any thoughts on that? </p><p>WAH: Yeah, vaccines are not my area of expertise. I'm an OB GYN and infertility specialist with microsurgery so I just want to put that as a caveat. But yes, I think we are all very optimistic about the ability of our scientists to develop a vaccine that is effective and safe in a very short period of time. The things that encourage us are there are new technologies that were not present previously in terms of understanding genetic structure and protein structure and so that, I believe, will in fact, accelerate our ability to develop an effective vaccine.  </p><p>HIGGINS: Thank you, sir.  </p><p>WAH: And also, going back to what I said about real-world evidence, we have a way of monitoring that that we don't previously use. Clinical trials who usually enrolled patients, now we can look at the real-world behavior of many millions of patients, either using a treatment or a vaccine so I'm encouraged by that as well. </p><p>HIGGINS: Thank you, sir. I yield back. </p><p>YARMUTH: The gentleman's time has expired. I now recognize the gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. Burchett, for five minutes. </p><p>BURCHETT: Can you hear me now? Good deal.   </p><p>I've got to get on another call real quick. But I--quickly I've got one question I'll just ask the entire committee, the group. What are the federal barriers to your all's progress? And are there any federal regulations that serve as barriers to the successful IT input implementation? </p><p>GERTON: Congressman, perhaps I could take a first cut of that.  </p><p>From the federal level, there are a number of procurement flexibilities that could potentially allow organizations to make intentional investments in IT modernization, including working capital funds, CMF, and revolving funds. But one of the critical issues, or maybe two of the critical issues, are while Congress has passed flexibilities in procurement we remain constrained by a couple of key features, one is the CBO scoring rules, which require the full cost of an IT investment to be recognized in the first year and don't allow the consideration of offsets and future savings to be applied as a discount. So IT investment looks extraordinarily large and must be fully accommodated in the very first year for which it's plan.  </p><p>The second is the audit rules, the GAO audit rules, which mitigate against flexibility. I would say probably rightfully so but there's a strong perception that the old ways of buying either supplies or services are what remain acceptable even in the face of congressional flexibility and procurement authorities. So as Congress is thinking about alternative tools and flexibilities I think one of the key features would be engaging with CBO and GAO to encourage their flexibility in terms of how they score and how they audit those procurement decisions.  </p><p>BURCHETT: Ms. Pahlka, do you want to take a shot at that? </p><p>PAHLKA: I would love to. Thank you. </p><p>I agree with everything that Ms. Gerton said. Would add, I think some of what needs to change, as I--as I mentioned and as--as outlined in the written testimony, is practice over regulation but practices don't change because people are worried about being called in front of Congress. And I think if--if this body can demonstrate that they will support those who take innovative approaches that will change over time.  </p><p>As one example, most procurement officers, you know, will insist on putting something in a procurement that says only a company who has done a project of this size in the past, and there's a lot of restrictions around this and many caveats, you know, can successfully bid on this. Well, that's very anti-competitive and it really means that that project will only then be able to go to probably two companies. We know exactly how that project will end up and that is one of the hallmarks of this sort of death march towards a mega project that will fail that we see.  </p><p>And I think--I--I don't know and maybe--maybe Ms. Gerton can help me understand if that's a regulation that needs to be removed, but I think it's a decision that contractors make, contracting officers will make that if they can be supported to feel that that is not a necessary--many--many contracting officers are happy not to include it, but that they won't be punished for not including a requirement like that that is one environmental--it's sort (SP) of the environment that can change.  </p><p>I think, particular to unemployment insurance because it's--it's the topic, you know, one of the major topics here and obviously such a crisis in our country right now, there is no safe harbor for departments of labor at the state level and workers there to be able to say, \"I have done my best to make an eligibility determination about this individual who is applying for this benefit and I'm now going to award that benefit without any fear of being told later that my decision was wrong.\"  </p><p>We need to make much clearer guidance and probably much more specific and useful tools that every state can use where much like eVerify, which you know, you can use to say, \"I have checked this person. They are eligible for employment and now I have safe harbor to make this decision.\" We need sort of a set of--of tools that we can give every state, this would be a federal investment, that could say, \"I have run this person through this particular tool. I know that they are eligible, that we have checked their income, that they have not applied in another state, and there is no fraud happening here,\" and that will significantly increase the speed of determination and the delivery of unemployment benefits and that is an important thing that I think we should consider at a federal level. </p><p>BURCHETT: Great. Thank you so much. Mr. Chairman, I yield none of my time (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Thank you.  </p><p>YARMUTH: I thank the gentlemen. The gentleman's time has expired. I now recognize the gentlewoman from Illinois, Ms. Schakowsky, for five minutes. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you Mr. Chairman. Ms. Dixon I want to see if you can help me with this. At the end of April we saw that the Department of Labor reauthorized its IT modernization checklist in the face of the skyrocketing unemployment numbers, the service disruptions, massive processing backlog. The check--the checklist is originally from 2017. But states to--for--for states to ensure that all necessary systems function available to--are available before the launch of new unemployment benefit programs.  </p><p>But it's my under--it's my understanding that DOL does not have--does not keep track or monitor the progress of states' UI modernization initiatives and it does not have any enforcement mechanism that specifically targets current systems' failures. And is that correct.  </p><p>DIXON: Yes that--that is correct. We--we know that this checklist is there but it's really just a list of tasks and it doesn't really tell the states how to accomplish what they need to accomplish. You could actually write a manual about each business process that's on the checklist. So it is insufficient. And it is true the DOL-- </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: --So that--that was really my--my next question. And you would say--and my question was is this check lick--list enough to ensure that states make sufficient progress. And your answer is clearly no to that.  </p><p>So what else does the Department of Labor and the administration have to do to ensure that unemployment system is up and running before new benefits are rolled out. </p><p>DIXON: D--DOL really needs to create a specialized unit for IT and phone inside the agency. So they need to have infrastructure in the agency to provide states with more guidance, to help states find economies to scale as they do these modernization projects. So it needs to take a much more active role and to create standards. There are actually very few standards around customer service for UI. </p><p>There is not a standard that says all calls must be answered in 90 minutes or anything. So we manage what we measure. So having more measurement is really important.  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: So the--the CARES Act provided a temporary expansion on unemployment compensation to help the millions of workers who are furloughed, laid off, without work due to no fault of their--their own because of the COVOID--CO--COVID-19 pandemic. This expansion is set to expire on July 31st, coming right up. I have seen reports that it will take weeks to restart this program if it lapses, even in states with mod--modernized technology. </p><p>Will it be a technological problem if the $600 pandemic unemployment compensation rule--compensation runs out and is not extended before the deadline? </p><p>DIXON: You are absolutely correct. What we're hearing is that it would take states two to three weeks to get back up and reprogram. So that would re--that would lead to a delay--an unnecessary delay for folks who are depending on these benefits as a lifeline.  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: So is this really a technological problem that we're facing or is it just a decision about extending the--the benefits? </p><p>DIXON: I think that the two are intertwined. We definitely do need to make a decision and make a people-centered decision about supporting workers who have lost their jobs in this pandemic. And it's not just technology but also the decisions that are behind the choices we make in technology. </p><p>And so putting people first, developing customer-centered systems instead of more efficient systems is important. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Yeah thank you. My time is almost up, and I yield back (INAUDIBLE). Thank you very much I yield back. </p><p>YARMUTH: The gentlewoman yields back. I now recognize Mr. Kildee from Michigan for five minutes. </p><p>KILDEE: Thank you Mr. Chairman. And I'll pick right up where--where Ms. Schakowsky left off because I think this really is fundamentally a question that we're all facing right now. What we are seeing right now in the unemployment issue is both a policy question and a technology question. We have control of the policy choices--we meaning Congress. We could make the decision before--before these unemployment benefits lapse, and we hope--I hope we do.  </p><p>But there's a lot of sort of hand wringing around the issue. There's a lot of discussion about whether the $600 supplemental benefit was correct. It was done for its simplicity in part. You know--that added with state benefits was intended to equate somewhat roughly to replacement rate wages for the broad spectrum of people who lost their jobs.  </p><p>But I would really be concerned given the technological problems that we've seen just in implementing the $600 uniform benefit--I would really be concerned with challenging states to somehow implement a replacement wage system when we're talking about tens and tens of millions of people who are struggling with this problem.  </p><p>And I--and I reject out of hand the idea that the $600 is what's keeping people from going back to work. What's for the most part keeping people from going back to work is either there's no work to go back to or they're afraid, naturally, to go back into the workplace when they are at risk of contracting this really dangerous and deadly disease.  </p><p>So I guess I would be interested in what you all see--maybe starting with you Ms. Dixon because you did rightfully point out that in Michigan while we've made improvements, we made improvements from a horrible system that at one point in time under the previous administration essentially charged 20,000 people with unemployment fraud because they had a lousy system. And we've had to make up for that. And the--the current governor has been--has been attempting to do that.  </p><p>But can you talk about the challenges that the states would have to go through in order to calculate and--and come up with a replacement rate basis for this federal supplement as opposed to using a more simple formula that we adopted in the CARES Act. I'm starting with Ms. Dixon but I--then I'd open it up to others to comment. </p><p>DIXON: Absolutely. So each state has a--its own specific UI program and its specific UI formula for how they calculate benefits. And so that being the case, it's horribly complex for each state to then have to rework their benefit formula to reach that target replacement rate. So it's--it's actually a lot of work to get that done, particularly I think in the case where the $600 is obviously bolstering the economy in a--in a very--you know--tragic crisis situation. </p><p>KILDEE: Other--other members of the panel--yes. </p><p>PAHLKA: I think you should be very concerned. I think any changes now are going to cause some chaos. We through the United States digital response have had volunteer teams working with six states on the unemployment delivery and the--the--the public servants that they're partnered with are not incompetent. They're very dedicated, they are working as hard as they can, given the constraints that they're under.  </p><p>But they--they really--the--the system itself is pushed to its limits. And--and I think you should take them at their word when they say that there will be a disruption. I think the one thing we've really learned in this technology transformation world over the past 10 years is that it--policy and technology have to go together. They do go together. And we need to make policy with the implementation in mind. Understanding how it will be implemented is the only way to get the results that your policy intends.  </p><p>KILDEE: I think that's a really important point. In order to create public value we have to have operational capacity. And I think sometimes we just assume--well we just pass a law and--you know--by magic it all just sort of gets implemented. The case here is to get help to Americans.  </p><p>And I think finally I'll say this. It is a technical question. But it's a technical question that we ought to consider when we adopt these policies. And if we don't believe that we've invested in the technology sufficient to allow a more detailed solution then we ought to just keep it simple.  </p><p>And what I say is before the end of this month let's give states ample time to continue to administer this process. And then make sure that we're making the investments in far better technology and get ahead of this the way we want to plant a tree twenty years ago. We ought to get ahead of it. We ought not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. We ought to get it done before the end of this month. It stimulates the economy and it helps Americans survive this.  </p><p>I thank the panel and thank you Mr. Chairman for holding this very important hearing.  </p><p>YARMUTH: I'm sorry. I believe the gentleman's time has expired. I now recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. Panetta for five minutes. </p><p>PANETTA: Thank you Mr. Chairman, I appreciate that opportunity. I think--you know--Mr. Kildee it goes down to what that person on that portrait says in our (INAUDIBLE) green room. It's about governing through leadership rather than governing through crisis. And unfortunately when we don't make these types of investments we're left with governing by crisis as we've seen through this pandemic. </p><p>Now look, I think this pandemic obviously required a very, very bold response from Congress and I think we gave them that. We--we gave the people that with how we rose to the occasion with the number of the relief bills that we have passed. Obviously the CARES Act being a--a--a great example of that. But this pandemic has also--as we've seen, and it's being highlighted by this hearing Mr. Chairman which I appreciate you putting on. It demonstrates that ignoring these types of delivery systems for these benefits can come with real cost. And the attempts to save federal dollars in the short term obviously have big costs in the long term.  </p><p>And yes, we've been warned by the GAO and the inspectors general but choose not to make the necessary upgrades to our federal ID systems (INAUDIBLE). So it is--it is important to have this hearing. It's important to learn from our mistakes. But it's also necessary that we do make the investments--the proper investments going forward so that the next crisis we can be better prepared.  </p><p>Now the Coronavirus pandemic is as we're seeing not just a--a health crisis. It's not just an unemployment crisis. As we've--as I heard today on my local news, it's a--it's a hunger crisis. Since the onset of the pandemic 34 percent of households with children have reported food insecurity in their household. The demand at U.S. food bak(PH)--food banks as I have seen as I go out there and volunteer every week at food banks--has gone up by an average of 70 percent compared to the same time last year.  </p><p>And with nearly--this is what's instre--interesting. 40 percent of those in--waiting in line at the food banks are new customers. Have never, ever been to a food bank before. 40 percent. Now obviously the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program has helped address this crisis, but the technology to deliver this program does need to be better. And it needs to be more efficient. And I think the obvious way to do that is most likely with mobile phones considering how many people have them.  </p><p>So Ms. Dixon I'm going to pick on you for a little bit. And I want to--if you can see if you can tell us about the benefits and potential challenges that come with updating our technology delivery systems so benefru--beneficiaries can use smart phone technology that's so prevalent to access a federal nutrition assistance programs.  </p><p>DIXON: We know the particular workers of color--so black and Latinx work families--are the least likely to have broad band or a computer in the home. Most of us have or have access to a smart phone. And so it just makes good sense to optimize all of these sites so that they will work with a smart phone. </p><p>PANETTA: Right. Right. Now--now in California in our--through our CalFresh program but also with help from a USDA pilot program we've been able to take steps so beneficiaries can use their SNAP dollars to purchase food online. If they can't go through phone at least they can do it online--for delivery through certain real--retailers. Ms. Dis(PH)--Ms. Dixon can you speak to the value of that pilot program if you're familiar with it and the challenges we should be prepared for in expanding that program nationwide.  </p><p>DIXON: So I can't speak specifically to that program, but I can speak to the fact that if we don't actually target the program--if we don't actually look at what the needs are for the most vulnerable we create a program that's not accessible to them. So we have to actually start in the center with the most vulnerable and their needs and then it's a concentric circle to help everyone else. If we don't actually figure out what they need they're not going to be served.  </p><p>PANETTA: Are there any particular federal investments that we should be prioritizing to support that type of expansion on that program? </p><p>DIXON: I think that making sure that we review the evidence from the pilot to find out what are the bright spots and how do we replicate what's working. </p><p>PANETTA: Great. Great. Ms. Dixon thank you very much. Mr. Chairman I yield back my time unless Ms. Pahlka, did you have your hand up? </p><p>PAHLKA: I--I would love to share that-- </p><p>YARMUTH: --Ms. Pahlka wanted to add something yes. </p><p>PANETTA: Yeah. Thank you Mr. Chairman. </p><p>YARMUTH: Go ahead Ms. Pahlka. </p><p>PAHLKA: I worked significantly in SNAP over the past 10 years through my role at Cook for America which I stepped down from in January. We in fact did create an--a mobile first application for SNAP in California starting with a couple of counties and the state actually adopted it and made--required for all counties to use. And prior to this application you would need to be on a landline--you know--on a--on a computer with broadband access. You could not do it on mobile. </p><p>But not only--you know--was it an issue of mobile access. The legacy application had over 212 questions. You couldn't save your work and it took up to an hour. And so we made something you could apply for SNAP in California on a mobile phone in about seven minutes including using the camera on your oble--mobile phone to take a photo of your driver's license, your paycheck, etcetera. And there--you asked about the benefits.  </p><p>One of the many benefits--the cost of administration goes down. The--but really importantly we started to close the significant participation gap that existed in SNAP in California. The (INAUDIBLE) were quite low and it--going up as the state has--has adopted that. I just also wanted--and I--and I think this is--this is seen everywhere you put in a simple, beautiful, easy to use application.  </p><p>I also just really wanted to (INAUDIBLE) what Ms. Dixon said. Design for the most marginalized will work for everyone else. A last brief comment about down payments. There's a desperate need I think. Modernize the marketplace for payments in the SNAP program. Those regulation were written I believe before the internet existed and it means that you are not able to take advantage of the wonderful robust diverse marketplace of payment vendors.  </p><p>And while I'm proud that we were able to get some payments up for--excuse me. The ability for these users to use their benefits online, there remain significant problems with that program including that it's limited in most states to just two vendors, Amazon and Walmart which hurts local businesses.  </p><p>The fact that you can't--you can use it for the big--groceries but you can't use your SNAP for the delivery fees which is a significant barrier. And a whole host of other progra--problems which would be solved by simply modernizing the fed--federal regulations that govern SNAP payments and creating a much more robust and modern marketplace. </p><p>YARMUTH: Thank you very much. The gentleman's time is expired. I now recognize the gentleman from New York, Mr. Morelle for five minutes.  </p><p>MORELLE: Thank you so much Mr. Chairman and to the witnesses. This is really, really I think an important topic. Appreciate all the testimony. And I had written comments which I'm--I'm going to for the most part pass on because so many things have been said here.  </p><p>Clearly--you know--in a typical year we would struggle with technology. I think if you look at the investments we have not made at the state and federal government, this is hardly a typical year. So what we're facing is enormous dislocation in public health and economic--in our economy. And to have the systems we have which are--I think still largely legacy systems--is almost criminal considering the challenge we're going to face. </p><p>Couple things that people said that I did want to just maybe get some additional feedback. I was interested Dr. Wah talked about telehealth and telemedicine. I see a day and I think about just the technology I have on my wrist, which keeps track of steps and heartbeat, etcetera. I envision a world if we could get there where you could almost do predictive analytics.  </p><p>That you have real time data on an ongoing basis going to primary care providers or if you have chronic illness. The kinds of things you could do would enormously enhance the ability for people to even detect illnesses or things in their body chemistry before you even feel symptoms.  </p><p>But we have--we're just not in a position I think at the healthcare side and given the challenges they face. So I'm going to ask you to comment on that in--in just a second Dr. Wah. I was also--Ms. Pahlka talked about useful tools, benefit eligibility. I--for three years I've led a project in Rochester, New York where I serve where we're trying to break down the barriers between health, education, and social services and have a truly integrated delivery model.  </p><p>Literally it will be run by people in poverty and crisis. So they have single eligibility, that they log onto their smart phones, that they keep track of their data privacy and they control it. And yet--and people do want to focus entirely on the IT. And I think it's--that's what we're working on a lot. How to bridge these things, how to have data sources talk to one another. How to create a--a data and--you know--environment where the transfer of data's important.  </p><p>But it's also how does it help workflows? How does--I mean the technology's interesting, but if people aren't working together and if we're not getting better outcomes and lower costs the challenge is that--that there's so little investment. So I appreciate that.  </p><p>And finally Ms. Dixon you said something about human centered design. This project that we are doing with people in crisis, people in poverty is all using human centered design. Because you can have the best technology in the world. If people aren't comfortable with it, if they don't trust it, if they're not--if it's not in an environment that they feel they can use easily it ends up being for naught. So human centered design is a big part of what we're doing. </p><p>And I'd love to offline actually talk to each of you because all the things you've said today and what we're doing in Roches(PH)--we want to be the first city in America that has completely integrated health education and social services. And we've been--as I said working for three years on it.  </p><p>The state of New York has given us $15 million to invest in the technology and in the people who will work. So nurse practitioners, pediatricians, social service people, people in housing, food insecurity. I also sponsor a bill called the Hope Act which would create innovation grants for people in the--in the health--in the--in the space around hunger and giving nutrition to people.  </p><p>So--but if I go--so--maybe you could each sort of comment on the challenges I guess first and foremost about what would be the plan. How would the federal government start. What are the first things we ought to be doing as a Congress policy wise to try to address some of these things. And I did like what you said Ms. Pahlka that--you know--a ten year technology--you know--ten years is a long time frame and you're not going to have the newest technology if you wait ten years to get it done. </p><p>So I'm not sure who I'm asking this of. If any of you can just comment on what we should be doing im--in the immediate steps and then maybe just make some observation about the jumble of things I just said which probably make virtually no sense. </p><p>WAH: Congressman I'll--I'll jump out only because you started with my area of interest in healthcare. But I would say what government need to do is continue this investment that they've already made in what I call waves two and three and this virtual pool of information. As you stated, devices are coming up every day that are contributing to that pool and that richer pool allows us the power of analytics to be applied to that and make many new discoveries.  </p><p>The other thing I point out is what I talked about before is the non-clinical use of healthcare information. As we talk about COVID and trying to go back to work and back to school there's going to come a time when we're going to need to show status, whether you've already had the antibody or you've already had vaccine, it's going to allow us to enter stadiums, movie theaters, transfer to another country or an airplane.  </p><p>We need to figure out what's the technology that's going to allow that to happen. Because we've never before put that kind of importance on your vaccine status. Your vaccine status used to just let your kids go to camp. But now we're going to have to figure out a verifiable way to say that you got the vaccine, you're immune, and you're safe to travel or go into a stadium or go into another country.  </p><p>MORELLE: Well look I--if I could maybe the take the prerogative of reaching out to each of you individually and offline in my offices because I think each of you had a great deal to contribute here. And Mr. Chairman this is a great--I only wish--this is one of the few times I wish my five minutes were ten minutes. But--but I do appreciate very much you hosting this hearing. I think this is really important for us to all consider. I yield back. </p><p>YARMUTH: Okay. Gentleman's time has expired. I now recognize the gentlewoman from Texas Ms. Jackson Lee for five minutes.  </p><p>JACKSON LEE: Mr. Chairman thank you so very much. I unmuted I believe. And thank you to the Ranking Member. I'm going to be a living witness of how important this particular hearing is, why I'm so delighted to serve on the budget committee because it dig--digs deep into some of our most difficult issues.  </p><p>But let me before I start my questioning to very quickly for the witnesses remind everyone that COVID-19 in this arena of needs--because people are not in their normal places of work and interaction, technology has become--I hate to say the terminology--king in terms of working to save lives. Confirmed cases in the United States: 3.48 million. A 61,000 increase in the last 24 hours. 138,000 deaths, 787 increase. In the state where I am, the epicenter--one of them--281,000 cases confirmed, 10,745 increase. 3,378 deaths, 87 increase overnight.  </p><p>In my own community 70,000 cases in Houston. 2,000 cases in the last 24 hours. 653--676 deaths and 18 deaths over the last 24 hours.  </p><p>We are in the most desperate moments of our (INAUDIBLE) our time as a city and as a region. And we feel to a certain extent lost because of the inadequacies of some of the policies that we're facing. Let me particularly focus on the backlog of veterans' benefits claims spiked during the last few months. </p><p>According to the data released in May the backlog of claims for veterans' benefits--those that have yet to be addressed for 125 days or longer has crept up to over 100,000 which is unacceptable. So I would ask my first question. And I listened and I do agree that these are hardworking public servants in our state and our federal government. But the system just doesn't help us.  </p><p>There are federal agency beside veterans where citizens cannot even access to help them do simple things like file my taxes, get tax transcripts because the individuals cannot access their system. So my--my question is to the--Teresa Gerton because what do we do when it comes to public services? What is your answer as it relates to the veterans' crisis that we're having? Jennifer if you would add to that as well.  </p><p>And then to Ms. Dixon and Mr. Wah, people are feeling the pain of unemployment. I know that our state has said--Texas has said if we don't extend unemployment there will be a disruption. And so I--I'm interested in your response again on how devastating that impact would be in as much as people are so desperate for the unemployment--the $600.  </p><p>And Dr. Waugh you made a very important point about vaccines, technology. There is a company that is U.S. and Texas based, G-R-E-F-F-E-N, Greffen. What is the importance of technology in moving the vaccine research along Dr. Wah and doing it where we can focus on companies that are in fact U.S. based. Not to the exclusion but these companies are struggling to be a part of this. They're small companies. I think technology would be very helpful.  </p><p>A veteran's question, employment question, and a COVID-19 question on the vaccine. Could you start out Ms. Gerton very quickly? </p><p>GERTON: Congresswoman I'm happy to do that. I--as a veteran myself I appreciate your question about how well the VA is addressing veteran's benefits claims. I would circle back to one of the earlier questions about the electronic health record. And the VA has made tremendous progress at VA dot gov in addressing--and being a more customer centered delivery mechanism. But they are still governed by extraordinarily arcane regulations about eligibility, about processing. And in many cases we still require a human in the loop.  </p><p>The academy did a study with the Veterans Benefit Administration about three years ago on the backlog of veterans claims and how they could reduce them, suggesting amongst other things that they create for example a robotic process automation tool that would categorize those claims. And the ones that are very straightforward and could be dealt with quickly and at a generic--in a totally automated way, and ones that are more complicated that require more in-depth human interaction. </p><p>We certainly want to make sure that every veteran receives the benefits to which they are entitled and if we can do it in a way that is responsive. And so as the VA considers these alternatives I think there is a--a tremendous opportunity to automate some of those-- </p><p>JACKSON LEE: --Can I get the others to answer? Ms. Gerton thank you so very much. </p><p>GERTON: Sure. Thank you (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>JACKSON LEE: Jennifer could you very quickly--because I noted that they are backlogged. They're not being helpful at this point I think because of technology. And Ms. Dixon and Dr. Wah. Can you do that very quickly. Thank you. </p><p>PAHLKA: Sorry, I didn't--did you want me to go now or Dr. Wah. </p><p>JACKSON LEE: No very quickly if you can. I--I'm trying to get you and Dixon and Wah. They have two separate questions.  </p><p>PAHLKA: On--on--on the VA I am not current on that. But I--I would point to the fact that the progress with VA dot gov which Ms. Gerton spoke to is the result of this new model that I keep speaking about that does work. It's--was done by the--originally the USDS that through--became part of the VA under CTO Charles Worthington who's (INAUDIBLE) at this. And I think you can--the VA should continue to leverage that group in particular to make the progress that they need to make to meet the benefit--to clear that benefits backlog. </p><p>JACKSON LEE: Okay. They're having problems but I will continue on. Ms. Dixon, Dr. Wah. Ms. Dixon. </p><p>DIXON: So--so in terms of the $600 if it goes away we're talking about getting rid of 50 to two-thirds of the income of folks at the end of the month, so right before rent is due. And that is crashing into the fact that we're having upticks as you mentioned in the states and COVID cases. So some folks who were off might need to go back on. And then add to that the expiration of rent moratoriums and--and mortgage assistance in certain states. It's just a really horrible time to add on top of that two to three weeks delay to change the program because we want to reduce the amount. </p><p>WAH: And if there's time I'll just very quickly talk about vaccines-- </p><p>JACKSON LEE: --Dr. Wah quickly thank you. Dr. Wah quickly as it relates to vaccines and will companies (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>WAH: Yeah. So just as it relates to vaccines I'll go back to my original comment about waves two and three. These virtual pools of information that we have on our patients are going to be very helpful in accelerating our development and finalizing vaccines. And the U.S. companies will have access to this primarily. </p><p>So once it is out there we'll be able to monitor those patients through this virtual pool of information in a way we previously could not through classic clinical trials. </p><p>JACKSON LEE: Good. Mr. Chairman thank you for your--Dr. Wah thank you for your indulgence. Just want to put on the record my question about the benefits administration because I don't think (INAUDIBLE). They are backlogged and I will write a letter about that. Thank you Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>YARMUTH: Absolutely. Absolutely. </p><p>JACKSON LEE: Thank you. </p><p>YARMUTH: Gentlewoman set? </p><p>JACKSON LEE: Thank you. </p><p>YARMUTH: Gentle--gentlewoman's time is expired. Now recognize the gentleman from Nevada, Mr. Horsford for five minutes.  </p><p>HORSFORD: Thank you Mr. Chairman. Since February of this year more than one in four Nevada workers have lost their job statewide, pushing the state's unemployment rate to 30.1 percent. That's the highest level ever reported by any state in modern history and generating an unemployment case load orders of magnitude higher than anything the state has witnessed previous. </p><p>I've heard directly from my constituents during regular telephone town halls during this pandemic in which so many of them have expressed their frustrations about how difficult it has been to navigate the unemployment system. From website crashes to waiting several hours on the phone before getting a response to having trouble resetting their passwords. </p><p>Now the Families First Coronavirus Response Act which we passed in law back in March included a provision from my bill H.R. 6199 the Emergency Unemployment Insurance Stabilization and Access Act which provided a billion dollars in grants to state unemployment offices. Nevada received a little over $10 million.  </p><p>Those grants have been used to increase staffing, update information technology systems, and process the onslaught of unemployment insurance claims that have been coming in. We--we have provided a billion dollars to states. I do not think we realized how difficult it would be for state UI offices to produce on such an outdated technology system. And I've had many calls with Nevada state unemployment office about the issues and I know that Nevada is not alone.  </p><p>So Ms. Gerton, Ms. Pahlka, and Ms. Dixon can any of you explain why states have struggled to update their unemployment forms and payment systems under the federal pandemic unemployment compensation program? I'm particularly interested to know the various steps unemployment offices had to take in--in order to even upgrade their systems with the--with the Department of Labor. Ms. Pahlka. </p><p>PAHLKA: I think I spoke over my colleague Ms. Dixon earlier so let me let her take the lead this time. </p><p>DIXON: One of the important things is making sure that--I'm sorry I lost my train of thought when you were speaking. </p><p>HORSFORD: Well your testimony pointed out that the national administrative funding for UI systems is essentially unchanged from almost 20 years ago-- </p><p>DIXON: --Right-- </p><p>HORSFORD: --And so my question is what could the states have been able to do without the support from the Department of Labor to set those standards? And even to recommend the type of systems that should have been put in place.  </p><p>DIXON: We have the system that we have invested in. So we haven't invested in it and we know that the--as the--the Chairman mentioned at the top that the same funding from 2001 in terms of administrative funding. There is no dedicated funding for IT in particular, so states are having to try to squeeze that out of what they do get.  </p><p>So we do need to actually take this seriously and--and have dedicated funding and a plan to get all the--the systems modernized including those standards. So doing it in a way where we are putting people first and we want to know how are they interacting with the system? Do we need to simply the questions? There's lots of things that--that we can do to marry the policy with the funding.  </p><p>HORSFORD: Ms. Pahlka. </p><p>PAHLKA: To your specific question of what does it mean to--to update these systems. I--I think I'd just provide a little bit of detail. You have these systems really accrued over decades. We think of them as archaeological layers where people have made tweaks to an original system for many, many years ago over and over and over again. And so when you're asking them to update it is not simple.  </p><p>It--you--in fact in many cases you have either just one employee left who remembers how this script was written or that script was written and how to actually do something and make this change. And in some places you have sort of nobody left who knows how to do it or they're relying on a vendor that--again--you know--that speaks to the cost of maintenance of these systems that has come up earlier in these hearings.  </p><p>But the complexity of these changes really cannot be overstated. And it-- </p><p>HORSFORD: --Yeah it's--it's extremely frustrating. Especially for the gig workers, the independent contractors, the--the employers, or the companies that they worked for can't even submit verification. And I loved your idea about set--establishing a nationwide verification system something like E-Verify for companies that are national or multinational in order to ver--verify the wages that were paid to those employees.  </p><p>That is the biggest issue that we're facing here in Nevada. There has been no guidance provided by the Department of Labor or little guidance. There is no recommendation for the types of systems that would actually work. And so we have a piecemealed approach in 50 different states. And it's all outdated, it's all antiquated, and yet Congress appropriated a billion dollars. So we need to move this forward and create solutions now while we address the longer term kind of systemic issues. </p><p>So I know my time is up. I did want to just raise one point, Mr. Chairman, and I'll--I'll submit it for the record. But under Department of Agriculture, children and families that are eligible for SNAP or free and reduced meals based on their income eligibility--that information is not shared with the Department of Education in order for them to get free internet service. And that is contributing to the digital divide. And again, it's something that Congress can fix, it's something that through guidance from our federal agencies we can address. And I hope that my colleagues would work with us to improve that for our children and families in this country right now during this pandemic.  </p><p>Thank you and I yield back. </p><p>YARMUTH: Okay. Gentleman's time is expired. I now recognize the--I guess who is the--the acting Ranking Member now. The gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Woodall for ten minutes. Is Mr. Woodall--we're not getting your audio. If you want to be unmute--if you want the staff to unmute you just nod.  </p><p>WOODALL: Can you hear me, Mr. Chairman? </p><p>YARMUTH: There we go. Yes. We hear you, Mr. Woodall. Mr. Woodall, we hear you. We did.  </p><p>WOODALL: Yeah, thank you very much-- </p><p>YARMUTH: --There you go-- </p><p>WOODALL: --Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the indulgence. It's easier to do this from my living room than it is from your committee room. I don't blame you for that. I--I--I credit the--I credit the living room environment that we've all gotten used to. </p><p>Dr. Wah I wanted to start with you. I think about all the crises and the responses that have been talked about today. And then I think about what HHS did in response to that crisis. We're going to promote telemedicine; we're going to allow telemedicine to be used in ways we didn't allow before. But we're only going to do that through the end of the--end of the crisis.  </p><p>Tell me about some of the problems that we have seen in the expansion of telehealth within the Medicare system over the past three months that would lead us to want to pull that system back instead of make that expansion permanent.  </p><p>WAH: Thank you, Congressman. I think first as foremost is what I said before is that we need to make sure that the telemedicine visits are the same as in-person visits in that they're connected to our virtual pool of information that I talked about. So one thing is we don't want them to be isolated so that they're not getting information out of the pool to help the telemedicine appointment be richer and better. And when the appointment is finished they need not put the information back into the pool. So that would be consistent with my waves two and three. </p><p>But the other thing that people have been concerned about with telemedicine--and I think it is imminently solvable--is this issue is whether or not it's going to open the door to fraud and abuse. I think overuse of telemedicine is very unlikely. It is no more likely that we're going to overuse telemedicine than we're going to overuse in-patient in-person use of healthcare.  </p><p>Very rarely do people wake up and say I feel like calling my doctor six times this week. So I don't think it's going to be overused. But that is a concern and I think there are ways to put constraints on that and put guard rails on it so it doesn't become a problem. But I think it is recognized that it is safe, it is effective, and it is very well accepted to use telemedicine. It's been around for over 20 years, but it's really come to be highly useful in this environment when face to face interaction is so much more challenging.  </p><p>WOODALL: I have concerns about our desire to make sure things are qualitatively the same. We have opportunities to expand the access. And I don't expect my telemedicine visit to--to be qualitatively the same. If I used to have to get in the car, drive four and a half hours, sit in the waiting room for an hour, then get back in the car, drive four and a half hours back home. I could be willing to accept something that's slightly different as long as my family decides that it's a superior value. My constituents' family decides it's a superior value. </p><p>We as Ms. Dixon said earlier--we have the systems in place that we have paid for. We have created a set of expectations around the in person healthcare visits that we are trying to replicate. As we think about what we're doing this year, next year, ten years from now how important is it that we stay tethered to that I want it to be qualitatively the same as opposed to I want to utilize it for what it is and then I want to utilize something else for what it isn't. </p><p>WAH: Yeah. I'd love to use this as a comment that one of the things that I think would solve a number of things is--we have talked a lot about the historic fee for service system of medicine where we pay for everything we use and as we use it. But if we move as we're trying to to value based care where it's--as you said--the outcome for you and your family is the prize. It's not how many times you visited or how many issues you have. It's--are you and your family getting healthy and staying healthy. That's what we pay for and that's what we incentivize.  </p><p>And the private sector will find ways to achieve that goal. And it'll be a mix of in person care and virtual care. But it will get to the end goal of you and your family being healthier and better. And if we do that all of these things that we're talking about will be driven by competition to make sure that the marketplace meets that need to deliver the best product to you and your family so you're healthier and better because of it.  </p><p>WOODALL: Well Ms. Pahlka was right when she described the archaeological dig that is our--our computer systems today. I'm going to use that again. We can't change things without being intentional. The Bush Administration tried; the Obama Administration tried. If you'd asked me a decade ago if our EHR mandate was going to have me in 2020 without the ability to walk in any position's office anywhere in the--in the nation and have my records transferred in--in real time I'd say no of course we're going to have that kind of functionality. </p><p>We were intentional. We provided incentives, we provided penalties. We gave a five year lead time. And here we are without the functionality that we desired. Now tell me where the failure was. You just lauded the private sector and its ability to solve problems. We've all talked about the government's need to be intentional in this space. I thought that we combined those two in the EHR mandate, but we have not met my expectations. Tell me a little bit about where we went wrong and what we should be doing differently going forward.  </p><p>WAH: I'm sorry were you addressing that to Ms. Pahlka or myself? </p><p>WOODALL: Dr. Wah I was directing it to you, but Ms. Pahlka has identified the flaw-- </p><p>WAH: --Okay-- </p><p>WOODALL: --But she--you know--in the case of EHR we started from scratch. We didn't have the archaeological dig problem. We said we're going to walk in on day one. We want everybody to go out and buy a brand new system and we're going to create a--a--a real tangible benefit in terms of quality and cost for the--for the American healthcare public. </p><p>WAH: Yeah so I--I think we did accomplish what I call wave one, which was to get off of the paper record system which we sometimes forget how bad that was. When you want to talk about archaeological digs we used to have patients come in with shopping bags of paper. That has passed away fortunately. So going to digital has helped and that was a significant achievement of that effort that you talked about. </p><p>The interoperability is still a challenge and creating that virtual pool of interoperable information is an ongoing process that we're still doing. And I would submit some of those reasons are not technology but business reasons. So sometimes there were business reasons why people didn't want to share information. We just passed in the 21st Century (INAUDIBLE) law information blocking rules to prevent those business things that are preventing interoperability. </p><p>So it is not solely a technology problem. It is a regulatory, legislative, and statutory problem that we have to continue to address.  </p><p>WOODALL: Well it's not lost on me that in order to provide the kind of care that we all know our senior citizens need in this time of the pandemic, that HHS had to waive some HIPPA privacy rules and direct the office of civil rights not to enforce some of those rules so that we could use those modern technologies that we're all accustomed to using to achieve those goals.  </p><p>Ms. Pahlka, tell me about this from a--from a practitioner's standpoint. We did say start from scratch with your electronic health record system. Physicians did go out and buy these for the very first time. And here we are a decade later and we don't have the interoperability. I couldn't have possibly predicted the state of technology in 2020 back when the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act was passed a decade ago. So what would you advise us to do as--as legislators to mandate enough on the front end to achieve our goals but not mandate so much that we miss the opportunity for innovation. </p><p>PAHLKA: It's an excellent question. I am not going to be as expert or useful on the EHR issue as Dr. Wah will be. It's a specific sort of mega project in government that has--you know--plagued many, many administrations. It's gone back a long time. And I--and I don't pretend to know what to do about it now. The pattern I see is that these--what--when we are successful with implementations like this it's because we start small and learn as we go. And it was very hard to do that in an EHR context.  </p><p>And we--but we can do that in other contexts and we've successfully done it in other contexts. But I think that is not how EHR started. It started as a very require--heavy requirement driven extremely well-funded effort that had all the hallmarks of--of a failed mega project. I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful. </p><p>WOODALL: I--I--I hear that start small and go big. And I--I--I want to cast that against the concerns I've heard so many folks express about the different unemployment systems we have. Of course where we have 50 different systems in--in 50 different states. So that is going to be a constant tug and--and, Mr. Chairman, I know that you have called this hearing because you want us to be intentional in this--in this way.  </p><p>I--I--I hope that our efforts to solve 50 separate problems that we have heard so often and that we're all committed to solving--don't trample that good advice that Ms. Pahlka has--has given that some of our most successful efforts in this area have started small, proven the concept, and then we grew them out to the 50 states as opposed to that single mandate from on high.  </p><p>So thank you all the witnesses for--for being here. And thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p><p>YARMUTH: Thank--I thank the gentleman. His time is expired, and I yield myself ten minutes. And let me begin by thanking all the witnesses not just for your testimony in this live portion but for your written testimony as well. I--I was actually kind of stunned in reading testimony about what's a fairly wonky subject and how accessible and how logical and how accessible it was. </p><p>I--I was--I was very impressed with--with all of you. Somebody who's not as attuned to IT as--as many, many others I--I really got it and--and there was a revelation there particularly with--with Ms. Pahlka and Ms. Gerton's testimony that one of the issues that we seem to have is an issue of perspective. And when we're talking about medical health records I remember I was--I was here when we drafted the--the ACA and we were working on--on those provisions. </p><p>And the idea was how do we gather all this information? It was not what's the purpose of gathering the information. It was how do we gather it and how do we incentivize the doctors to do it as opposed to actually thinking about the end product and--and the people we were going to engage and what it was going to mean to them. And I--I think for the first time I've actually--I started to think when hearing testimony--I think--Ms. Pahlka you specifically said this. I thought of the government as a customer service organization.  </p><p>And I don't think we do that nearly--nearly as much. And so that was kind of a revelation I thank you for. And the other I--why a lot of the testimony resonated very deeply with me is one of my standard lines when I'm out talking and talking about Congress is I say--you know--we have a dilemma and that is that Congress at its optimum efficiency moves at 10 miles an hour. Right now we're two or three miles an hour.  </p><p>Meanwhile the world's moving at 100 miles an hour. And how do we make--how can we possibly make policy that anticipates where the world is going. You know--we--we generally legislate--it's been my experience--as if we're target shooting instead of skeet shooting. I mean--we need to be shooting where the--the--the target's going to be not where it is now.  </p><p>And that is certainly part of the issue here. And when we think differently we--we think--stop thinking about equipment and investment in equipment and thinking about functionality and purpose it seems like that--that's absolutely the right way to approach this issue. And--but I'm not sure the Congress is equipped to do it. </p><p>So I--I would start by asking Ms. Pahlka if--I'm not aware of any concerted Congressional effort to deal with this--this problem. And we--certainly in--in different areas of jurisdiction it's come up and we--we discussed it kind of on an ad hoc basis. One of the things that I always think about is we don't spend nearly enough time in Congress thinking about and discussing how to make the government work better.  </p><p>And that should be a primary function of--of ours. And I--and I know Mr. Woodall, we've had conversations like this. That I'm one of these Democrats who does not believe that every regulation is a meaningful helpful beneficial regulation. And we ought to be spending a lot more time thinking about how we can--what we're doing that makes a difference in the way government functions and in people's lives and not about a lot of the things we think about. </p><p>So if--I mean--if you were in--in our position--I'll start with Ms. Pahlka--and you say--you want to create a--a--a con--Congressional effort what would be the first place you would go. </p><p>PAHLKA: What an excellent question and a difficult one. I think that all efforts work when they have concrete successes behind them that--that start to actually show the American public that things can be different. So I would actually champion a couple of very specific projects that I think Congress could move along more quickly. </p><p>Congress obviously wouldn't be implementing them-- </p><p>YARMUTH: --Right-- </p><p>PAHLKA: --You would need U.S. (INAUDIBLE) or one of these places to do something like speed the delivery of UI benefits. And frankly the--the thing that I've spoken about here where you could potentially speed eligibility determinations and reduce the wait times is relevant. My thing is always start small. You'd start with one state, you'd expand it. But you could also start with one benefit like UI and then expand it to other benefits. Eligibility rules are different across different benefits. One of the members spoke about SNAP which is critical at this time and also facing challenges as it's had the same sort of expansion of--of both benefits and programs.  </p><p>But eventually you could create a centralized service that--that--that spread the determination of eligibility across a number of benefits. And I think what's really important is not just that we speed government for its own sake but that the people who are waiting on those benefits start to see a difference. So I would just do something very concrete, get behind it, and figure out along the way all of the attacks that come on and all the barriers to it and just start one by one. Use your power to remove those barriers and get the job done. </p><p>YARMUTH: Thank you. And I--Ms. Gerton I want you to answer that as well, but I also want to throw in that both of you mentioned the issue of--or the notion of agility. And I--I understand the word. I'm not sure I understand how it applies here. So if you could kind of elaborate on that Ms. Gerton as well as where you would go if you were directing Congress right now. </p><p>GERTON: Thanks, Congressman. I--I think I want to offer two suggestions. We've talked already today about the importance of SNAP and the importance of UI benefits to deliver crisis services. One of the things that we have been working on is the idea of providing work flexibility to the grant writers at the federal level to allow the recipients of those grants to integrate their systems. And if I could give you a quick example when I was at the Department of Labor I was responsible for overseeing the homeless (INAUDIBLE) program. I fairly small grant that provided training opportunities for homeless veterans returning to the workforce. </p><p>Interestingly the grantees who received our grants also received grants from the VA, received grants from HUD, and they received a variety of grants. Because of the way the grants were structured they had separate IT systems to report on the compliance for every one of those grants which placed an extraordinary administrative cost on them, which kept them from integrating those funds in a way that could better deliver outcomes for homeless veterans.  </p><p>So one of the things as Ms. Pahlka just mentioned--if you focused on UI for example or SNAP thinking about all of the grants that those grantees are receiving and making it easier for them to combine them in a way that still provides the accountability that Congress needs but that helps them optimize the delivery of services for their constituents would be a huge first step.  </p><p>It's not removing regulations but it's providing flexibility. And the second place I would suggest is sort of the back office approach--right. At the federal level we understand that hot systems for example could deliver better finance and accounting than our customized systems, could deliver better HR services. But those are sold sort of the software as a service. We don't need a big requirement to process--to tell us how to do best HR.  </p><p>So allowing the flexibility for shared services, allowing people to buy them as a service where that service is maintained in the cloud where it's kept constantly updated. Where the cyber security is much tighter than--you know--for example any agency who hasn't had the time to invest and is running on--on vulnerable software. You could--you could add flexibility to shared services space and simplify back office which would free up additional administrative costs and you could allow the flexibility on the front office side in service delivery so that grantees could better mix their funds to deliver outcomes for their clients. </p><p>YARMUTH: Okay. Well thank you--thank you very much. My time is running down and even though I have the gavel I'm not going to abuse that even though Rob would--Rob wouldn't mind. I--I'm so glad that you mentioned artificial intelligence in your testimony Ms. Gerton. And one of the things that--when I--one of the things when I'm out speaking I say. One of the three things that we absolutely have to focus on now if we're going to have a viable future. And one of them is climate change and one of them is early childhood education. And the third one is how we're going to deal with artificial intelligence. </p><p>I think it's that critical. And we at some point are going to have a hearing on artificial intelligence and what it might mean for the budget going forward. Because clearly there are--there are dangers with artificial intelligence and enormous opportunity. So I'm glad that you mentioned that because that's going to have to be a part of our technological future. And we need to be--we need to start thinking and talking about that right now as to how we're going to integrate it in--in a way that does serve our customers. And so you've given me a new--new mantra. That's a thing I'm going to talk about a lot. </p><p>Sometimes citizens, sometimes taxpayers, but always customers in the government. But anyway with that I will once again thanks--thank all of the witnesses. It's been an extremely valuable discussion. And again I think the record of--of our live hearing and also the written testimony is going to be a substantial record that we can rely on and members of Congress can rely on as we start thinking about how we deal with some of these issues. </p><p>So with that thanks again for your participation. Thanks to Mr. Woodall for staying with us to the end. And if there's no further business before the committee this hearing is adjourned. Thank you. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CF-KYG1-F15W-H37P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

How COVID-19 makes clear the need for change. </p><p>I want to welcome our witnesses here today. </p><p>At the outset, due to the new virtual hearing world that we're in, I ask unanimous consent that the Chair be authorized to declare a recess at any time to address technical difficulties that may arise with such remote proceedings. </p><p>Without objection, so ordered. </p><p>As a reminder we're holding this hearing virtually in compliance with the regulations for committee proceedings pursuant to House Resolution 965. </p><p>First, consistent with regulations, the Chair or staff designated by the Chair may mute participants microphones when they are not under recognition for the purposes of eliminating inadvertent background noise. Members are responsible for unmuting themselves when they seek recognition or when they are recognized for their five minutes. We are not permitted to unmute members unless the explicitly request assistance. If I notice that you have not unmuted yourself, I will ask you if you would like staff to unmute you. If you indicate approval by nodding, staff will unmute your microphone. They will not unmute you under any other conditions. </p><p>Second, members must have their cameras on throughout this proceeding and must be visible on screen in order to be recognized. As a reminder, members may not participate in more than one committee proceeding simultaneously. </p><p>Now, I will introduce our witnesses. </p><p>This afternoon we will be hearing from Professor Sir Angus Deaton, Senior Scholar at Princeton University Woodrow Wilson School and Presidential--Professor of Economics at the University of Southern California. </p><p>Dr. Patrice Harris, immediate past president of the American Medical Association. Dr. Damon Jones, Associate Professor at the University of Chicago Harris School, and Mr. Avik Roy, President of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity. </p><p>I will now yield myself five minutes for an opening statement. </p><p>The word unprecedented is often overused but right now what we are facing as a nation and a society is truly unprecedented. </p><p>We are simultaneously battling a global pandemic as the Coronavirus rages on, an economic freefall as business closures and waves of mass unemployment and a crisis of conscience as we grapple with the deadly effects of entrenched systemic racism in our country. Nearly every American has experienced uncertainty and far too many extreme hardships during the last several months. These crises have something else in common. They all disproportionately impact Americans of color. </p><p>Today, the budget committee will examine one aspect of this. The underlying health and economic inequalities that have exacerbated COVID-19's impact on our minority communities. </p><p>Historic and persistent racial disparities in income, employment, education, wealth, healthcare, housing and more have made Americans of color more vulnerable to the virus, both in terms of health and economic status. Nowhere is the disproportionate impact of Coronavirus clearer than in the virus's death rates. If black and Latino Americans died of COVID-19 at the same rate as white Americans, at least 14,400 black Americans and 1,200 Latinos would still be alive today. </p><p>While the CDC may not list structural racism as one of the chronic conditions putting people at a higher risk for severe COVID-19 disease, long term health inequities and barriers to accessing quality and affordable healthcare have made communities of color more vulnerable to serious illness and death from Coronavirus. </p><p>Where you live, where you work and how you get to work all influence health status and outcomes and more often than not, it's to the detriment of black and Latino families. These long-standing inequities are only hard to see if you refuse to look and when it comes to economic justice the facts are plentiful. In terms of median household earnings, the most recent census data shows that for every dollar a white family earns, Latino family earns .73 while a black family earns just 0.59. </p><p>Decades of income inequality and the resulting wealth gap have left black and Latino Americans with less savings and far less ability to weather a serious health emergency or economic crisis. </p><p>Today, families are battling both. The same households that had less going into this economic crisis have faced far more layoffs and job loss. While all groups have seen a historic rise in unemployment compared to pre-pandemic levels, the May 2020 unemployment rates for black and Latino Americans were substantially higher than for white Americans. </p><p>The pandemic has redefined essential work and while black and Latino workers compose 29 percent of the national workforce, they account for 34 percent of frontline workers. </p><p>Everyday they are forced to choose between their health and a paycheck. Despite this, many of these workers still do not have access to paid leave or hazard pay and more than one in four of frontline workers have said the Coronavirus has made it harder to meet their basic needs. </p><p>But workers aren't the only ones whose daily life has been upended. The Coronavirus has led to widespread school closures across communities and children of color may be impacted the most. </p><p>One study estimated that while the average white student may lose about six months of learning, the average Latino student may lose nine months and the average black student may lose ten months. Without action, this could exacerbate graduation rates, disparities among students of color, further perpetuating economic inequality for generations to come. </p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the cracks in our systems and laid bare the underlying inequities that have existed in the United States for generations in our healthcare system, our economy, in education and in our justice system. It threatens to widen the economic chasm between white Americans and Americans of color. If not contained and reversed, it will not only jeopardize the future of millions of American families, we risk the wellbeing of our nation. As we look forward to the next phase of recovery efforts, we must strive for structural change that will not only help our economy recover but also help more people, specifically people of color prosper when it does. We cannot be foolish enough to think that a rising tide will lift all boats. If we are, we will sink the country. This has to be a turning point. There is too much need, too much pain and too much anger for Congress to do little or nothing. </p><p>I know we cannot end institutional racism overnight, but we can certainly start. We can build a stronger nation, a more inclusive economy and an America that better reflects our values and that is what I hope to focus on today. </p><p>I now yield five minutes to the Ranking Member, Mr. Womack for his opening remarks. </p><p>WOMACK: I thank the Chairman and thanks to all the members of the committee for participating today. It's great to be in this hearing. </p><p>Prior to the Coronavirus, the U.S. economy was increasing wages and living standards. The median average income, adjusted for inflation increased by 3.4 percent in 2018, the poverty rate fell from 12.3 to 11.8 percent according to the latest Census Bureau data. Unemployment was at a five decade low of three and a half percent. Black, Hispanic and Asian unemployment rates fell to 5.4, 3.9 and 2.1 percent, respectively, all of which were record lows. </p><p>Wages were growing faster for low income workers than higher income workers but the pandemic as we all know, brought these upward trends to a screeching halt. While I think the topic of today's hearing is extremely important, and one that we need to carefully discuss and address, I'm concerned that this committee ought to be focused on a large and growing crisis that threatens income security programs for all Americans. And that threat is our out of control deficit and debt.  </p><p>Congress has, and I might add appropriately, and on a bipartisan basis enacted two and a half trillion dollars' worth of legislation to address our current public health and economic crisis. Even while we take unprecedented action, we can no longer ignore our country's long-term fiscal imbalance. </p><p>The nation's structural budget deficits which exist not only in economic emergency but also during peace and prosperity are a severe challenge to the critical programs that millions of our seniors and low income Americans rely on every day like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and that list goes on and on. </p><p>The federal governments future ability to fund these programs is under a real threat by the growth of net interest payments which are growing far more rapidly than the rest of the federal budget, even with historically low interest rates. </p><p>Ultimately, if we fail to live up to our duty to responsibly budget, future generations may face a sovereign debt crisis that would not only threaten our ability to fund these programs that tens of millions of Americans rely on but would also cause economic hardship for all Americans. And let me just add too that the pressure on the discretionary budget of the United States Congress speaks for itself in--with deficits and debt the way we are calculating them today. Since we fail to do our job during normal times and put the nation on a fiscally responsible path, we set ourselves up for an even more challenging budget outlook when the pandemic crisis hit. </p><p>Now, our deficit this year is projected to be under--just under four trillion dollars. By far the highest in American history. This committee needs to get back to its job of writing a budget resolution for Congress and making the tough choices we've been tasked to do . It's not going to be easy, indeed it's going to be much more difficult with the pandemic, but it needs to be done. This is the only way these critical safety net programs, programs so vital to our most vulnerable communities will continue to exist for current and future generations. </p><p>The past few months have been extremely challenging for the entire country and in fact, the entire world. In the United States over two million cases of COVID-19 have ravaged the health of our nation and our economy has been infected as well. The economic downturn caused by the quarantine orders has significantly increased the impact of COVID-19 on our most vulnerable. </p><p>Today, we will discuss how the pandemic has exacerbated pre-existing healthcare and economic inequalities in the nation. So, I look forward to today's discussion and Mr. Chairman, again I thank you for hosting the hearing today and I look forward to it. </p><p>And I yield back the balance of my time. </p><p>YARMUTH: I thank the Ranking Member. </p><p>Again, once again I'd like to thank the witnesses for being here this afternoon. </p><p>The committee has received your written statements and they will be made part of the formal hearing record. </p><p>Each of you will have five minutes to give your oral remarks. As a reminder, please unmute your microphone before speaking. </p><p>Dr. Angus Deaton, please unmute your microphone. You may begin when you are ready, you are recognized for five minutes. </p><p>Thank you for being here. </p><p>DEATON: Chairman Yarmuth, Ranking Member Womack and committee members, thank you for inviting me to (INAUDIBLE) Inequalities in the COVID-19 Pandemic. </p><p>The pandemic is exposing and exaggerating long standing inequalities in health and wealth. It will worsen the inequalities between black and white, between the more and the less educated and between ordinary people and the well offs. </p><p>Enlightened policy can monitor--moderate these effects as has already been the case, but we are not done. The pandemic may turn tolerable inequalities into intolerable inequalities. There is a danger of social unrest but there are also opportunities to address old problems.  Agreed to repair our policing has already become urgent. Other outstanding issues include healthcare, anti-trust policy and our system of unemployment benefits. </p><p>In the past half century, the lives of Americans have become increasingly divided according to whether or not people have a four-year college degree. Those with a BA have prospered and they are living longer while those without are congering (PH). Not only are the gaps widening but the lives of less educated Americans are getting worse. </p><p>The American economy is not delivering for less educated Americans. In our book, \"Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism\" Anne Case and I document this disaster. Mortality rates have risen, driven by rapid increases in deaths of despair, suicides, overdoses, alcoholic liver disease and an uptick in deaths from heart disease. At the same time, wages and employment have declined, as have marriages, socializing and church going. In all of these areas, more educated Americans continue to make progress. </p><p>The disintegration of white working-class life parallels an earlier disintegration among African American communities in the 1960's and 1970's, culminating in the crack epidemic. African American mortality rates have long been higher than those of whites, the gap has diminished steadily, closing particularly rapidly when white mortality rates began to rise in the mid 1990's.  </p><p>This convergence came to a halt after 2013 when Fentanyl deaths among blacks--blacks with BA were largely exempt. American healthcare played a role in the disaster. Pharmaceutical companies were largely responsible for the first wave of the opioid epidemic. The exorbitant cost of healthcare, much of which is financed through employment has lowered wages and destroyed good jobs for less educated Americans. </p><p>At the same time, it is expanding wealth inequality. This was before the pandemic. COVID death rates are higher for African Americans and Native Americans than for whites. Occupation, segregation, population density, transportation and the patterns of pre-existing health conditions are all involved. High incarceration rates for African Americans who (INAUDIBLE) excess mortality from COVID. Lives of the more educated are less at risk because many of us can work and earn while social distancing. Poorer kids are likely to do less well with internet classes. </p><p>The pandemic has exposed the (INAUDIBLE) health insurance to work. African Americans and Hispanics were less likely to have insurance pre-COVID and they and the millions who became unemployed find themselves at risk. Temporary arrangements are covering COVID related healthcare, but they are not sustainable. America needs what other rich countries have, healthcare that is not tied to employment that covers everyone from birth and that controls costs. Our patchwork state-based system of unemployment benefit is also being exposed by the pandemic. </p><p>Many (INAUDIBLE) have been concerned about consolidation and growing market power of large firms' prices rising faster in the U.S. than in Europe and the falling share of labor and national income. COVID has shuttered many businesses, increased the power of big tech and will cause further consolidation. Reinvigorating anti-trust enforcement was a priority before and will be urgent afterwards. </p><p>The four largest states have a third of the population, but only eight percent of the votes in the Senate. COVID victims are even less well represented. A half of all deaths have only eight percent of Senate votes, an inequality that will narrow as the epidemic moves into rural America. Unequal political representation in a pandemic serves further to divide us. </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>YARMUTH: Thank you, Dr. Deaton. </p><p>I now recognize Dr. Harris for five minutes. Please unmute your mic Dr. Harris. </p><p>HARRIS: Thank you. Good afternoon, Chairman Yarmuth, Ranking Member Womack and committee members. </p><p>The American Medical Association commends you for holding today's hearing. </p><p>My name is Dr. Patrice Harris and I am immediate past president of the AMA. I am a practicing child and adolescent psychiatrist from Atlanta and thank you for the opportunity to testify today. </p><p>As our nation confronts the dual crises of a deadly pandemic that has triggered economic instability and joblessness unseen since the Great Depression, inequities have been starkly revealed, most notably among black Americans, the Latinx community and Native American communities. And I would like to highlight just a few facts. </p><p>Black Americans have been among the hardest hit population by this virus. Not only are we hospitalized and dying in disproportionate numbers, we also are more likely than white Americans to have lost income because of the pandemic. In 42 states plus Washington, D.C. Hispanics and the Latinx community make up a greater share of confirmed cases than their share of the population. In eight states it's more than four times greater.  </p><p>The death rate in the Navajo Nation is higher than in any single U.S. state, so clearly COVID-19 is having a disproportionate impact on minoritized and marginalized communities. </p><p>And why?  </p><p>Structural inequities that result from long term policies, practices and procedures that determine access to comprehensive healthcare, as well as those determinates of health, inadequate housing, education, food insecurity and these are all influenced by bias and racial discrimination. </p><p>Higher prevalence of chronic health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, asthma and obesity and increased likelihood of working essential jobs such as bus drivers, train operators, those who are working in our supermarkets and meat packing plants, hospitals and nursing homes and of course that increases the risk of exposure. </p><p>A stronger likelihood of living in congregate, multigenerational living arrangements and major mistrust of medical institutions because of historical abuses of science and research and of course, misinformation and disinformation. So, the AMA is very concerned that the pandemic and economic fallout will further exacerbate these long standing and long-term health, economic and social inequities experienced by minoritized and marginalized communities. </p><p>These dual crises are also having an impact on our collective mental health. The toll is not yet known, but I will tell you that people are angry, exhausted and frustrated and in nearly every community people are demanding change. </p><p>New data from the Household Poll Survey suggests that the COVID-19 is worsening mental health for communities of color which as a group have less access to mental health services. </p><p>As a child and adolescent psychiatrist, I worry about the short term and the long-term mental health impact this pandemic will have on our children, particularly our children of color. The AMA is deeply committed to achieving greater health equity by raising awareness about its importance to patients and communities and by working to identify and eliminate inequities. The good news is we are talking about it. The public is more aware we are having this conversation today. So, we must use this opportunity to move our country forward on health equity through change at the individual level in our policies and procedures and in our culture. And how do we move forward? Briefly, some suggestions.  </p><p>We have to address implicit and unconscious bias at all levels and at all systems. We need targeted outreach on COVID-19 testing. We need to make sure that vaccine trials include a diverse population. </p><p>We need federal and state agencies to collect and report COVID-19 data on infections. We need support for increasing diversity of the medical workforce. We need a national strategy with state partnerships for increased resources for a mental health infrastructure that has for decades gone under resourced and underfunded. And we need to expand access to health insurance and high-quality healthcare. </p><p>We cannot go back to business as usual. We must work together to build a society that supports equitable opportunities for optimal health for all. </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>YARMUTH: Thank you, Dr. Harris and I now recognize Dr. Jones for five minutes. </p><p>Dr. Jones thank you for joining us. Unmute your mic please. </p><p>JONES: Thank you, Chairman Yarmuth and Ranking Member Womack for having me.  </p><p>I'm Damon Jones, an economist and associate professor at University of Chicago, Harris School of Public Policy. </p><p>My research and teaching focus on inequality, tax policy and household financial wellbeing. </p><p>My comments today will focus on four aspects of inequality in the U.S. and how they interact with the current COVID-19 pandemic. I will begin with the well documented decline in the individual and collective (INAUDIBLE) workers relative to their employers. </p><p>Unionization rates have reached record lows and recent research has highlighted market power by employers which allows them to suppress worker pay. These developments have coincided with stagnant wages for the typical worker. It is in this context that we now find frontline workers in between a rock and a hard place.  On the one hand, they have an opportunity to continue working when many others are forced into unemployment. On the other hand, they are being asked to risk exposure to COVID-19 infection. </p><p>In the erosion of worker power, I just mentioned leaves them unable to demand adequate protection equipment, paid sick leave or hazard pay.  To paraphrase economist Rhonda Sharpe, though these jobs are deemed essential, the workers who performed them are being treated as anything but. </p><p>My second point will be quite brief. By linking one's insurance coverage to one's employment status the U.S. is in the minority among its peer OEDC countries. The flaws of this system were made painfully clear as we undergo historically rapid spikes in unemployment, thrusting millions into the ranks of the uninsured. During both a public health crisis and a recession, many are dreading the potential of enduring long-term unemployment and chronic health complications related to COVID-19 infection, all the while with limited access to healthcare. </p><p>Next, let me turn to wealth inequality. Many households lack adequate liquid assets, which I define as cash on hand, or assets that can be easily converted into cash. The typical household has less than one month of income saved up for a rainy day, leaving many in a state of financial precarity. In recent research, my colleagues and I have shown that when faced with an unexpected cut in pay or a job loss, households with the least amount of assets have to cut spending on necessities by two to four times as much as their wealthier counterparts. </p><p>During the current pandemic, millions of families find themselves in this very position. While payments via the CARES Act and extensions to unemployment insurance have filled the gap for many, there remain households who have experienced delays in receiving relief. And there are others, people experiencing homelessness and undocumented people who are unlikely to receive payments or who are outright excluded from these benefits. </p><p>I will end with the issue of racial inequality. </p><p>(INAUDIBLE) all three instances the patterns of inequality are strongly predicted by ones racial and ethnic identity. Black workers make up a disproportionate share of frontline workers and Latinx workers are overrepresented in key frontline industries. Insurance coverage is lower for people of color especially Native families, relative to white ones and the disproportionate increases in unemployment among these groups is likely to exacerbate this gap. </p><p>The typical white household has between nine to ten times as much wealth as their black and Latinx counterparts. Our research shows that this racial wealth gap leaves black and Latinx households to have to cut spending significantly more than white ones when faced with a reduction in pay or a job loss. Given the above discussion, I recommend the committee consider the following policies. </p><p>First, protect the workers right to engage in collective bargaining, strengthen and enforce existing U.S. labor standards and during the pandemic convene bodies of representation from both workers and employers to address ongoing concerns of workplace and health and safety. </p><p>Second, in the sort run expand Medicaid eligibility for those who have experienced job loss. In the longer run, transition into a system of universal healthcare provision health insurance coverage. </p><p>Third, continue extensions of the unemployment insurance program beyond their expiration at the end of July. Tie this continued renewal of macroeconomic indicators and disburse additional periodic direct payments to households through the IRS. Provide resources to state and local governments to better reach individuals not covered by either of these previous two channels and extend relief to undocumented families. </p><p>Finally, the racial disparities I have summarized are driven by long standing factors such as historical and structural racism. They therefore require more fundamental interventions. </p><p>As an example, we should move forward with HR 40 in establishing a committee to explore reparations for African Americans. Such policies directly address racial inequality by moving toward what William Darity Jr. and A. Kirsten Mullen describe as acknowledgement, redress and possible closure with respect to historical racial injustice. </p><p>Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. </p><p>YARMUTH: Thank you very much, Dr. Jones and now I yield five minutes to Mr. Roy.  </p><p>Welcome to the committee, Mr. Roy, thanks for being with us. </p><p>AVIK ROY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and also to Ranking Member Womack and members of the committee, thanks for inviting me here today. </p><p>The Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, or FREOP for short, is a non-partisan think tank that focuses exclusively on ideas that can improve the lives of Americans on the bottom half of the economic ladder. </p><p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss our work on how COVID-19 economic lockdowns have widened racial inequities, education, health and the workforce. </p><p>My written statement contains a more detailed discussion of our findings. In my oral remarks I'll focus on three topics. </p><p>First, I'll discuss how economic lockdowns imposed by states and localities have disproportionately harmed minority employment and minority owned businesses. </p><p>Second, I'll touch on how economic lockdowns have further destabilized the fiscal sustainability of the United States. </p><p>Third, I'll discuss how COVID-19 mortality by race and ethnicity and how states failure to protect nursing homes in particular has harmed vulnerable seniors of all races. </p><p>As Mr. Womack noted, in late 2019 black unemployment reached its lowest rate in history, 5.4 percent. Today, the black unemployment rate is 16.8 percent. Hispanic unemployment rate was 3.9 percent in late 2019, now it's at 17.6 percent.      </p><p>In my written testimony I detail how disparities between white and non-white unemployment rates also reached their lowest levels in history prior to the pandemic but the economic lockdowns have brought those disparities back to levels last seen a decade ago. Compared to white and Asians, blacks and Latinos are less likely to work in white collar occupations, where working from home is feasible. Instead, they are seeing their jobs and hours slashed. Hourly wage work is down fifty percent on average, and even more in places with the most stringent lockdowns. </p><p>Black owned businesses have also been hit far harder than white owned businesses. It is estimated that black owned businesses have experience losses of 41 percent between February and April, versus 32 percent for Hispanic owned businesses and 17 percent for white owned businesses. Put simply, racial and ethnic disparities are worse when the economy is worse and especially during the government mandated shutdowns of the economy we're experiencing today. </p><p>As you know, the CARES Act and related legislation has increased the federal deficit by trillions of dollars. Material increases in the federal debt further destabilized what is already a dangerous situation. If demand for U.S. Treasury bonds declines on account of decreased (INAUDIBLE) credit worthiness, such as Congress must enact substantial austerity measures, it will be low income Americans that will bear the greatest burden. </p><p>Higher taxes resulting in shrinkage of the economy will harm economically vulnerable Americans through rising unemployment. Second, reductions in federal spending will most harm those who most depend on that spending, such as Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Hence, it is essential that Congress consider ways to pay for the recent COVID relief packages and also avoid further destabilizations of the federal budget.  </p><p>One rising concern is how COVID-19 is affecting different racial and ethnic populations. The latest data from CDC indicates that blacks represent a greater share of COVID deaths than they do of the general population even when adjusted for the fact that COVID is more prevalent in cities. Mortality rates are also higher, as has been noted by others, in Native American communities, especially in Arizona and New Mexico.  </p><p>What may be surprising is that whites are also dying of COVID at higher than predicted rates. On the other hand, Hispanics and Asians represent a lower share of COVID deaths than would be implied by their geographically adjusted share of the U.S. population. The likely reason for these differences is that morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 is most common among the elderly.  </p><p>81 percent of all COVID deaths in the U.S. have occurred in people aged 65 or older and whites are the oldest racial group in the U.S. with a median age of 44. Asians have a median age of 37, blacks 34, Hispanics 30. Hence, we should expect to see higher fatality rates in whites versus Asians and Hispanics due to their age, and we do. On the other hand, African Americans are also relatively young, but we are still seeing higher mortality among blacks.  </p><p>Some of you are familiar with our research on the tragedy taking place in our nursing homes and assisted living facilities. 0.6 percent of Americans live in long-term care facilities and yet, within this 0.6 percent of the population lies 43 percent of all deaths from the novel coronavirus. 43 percent. As you know, nursing homes are residential facilities for medically vulnerable seniors who have challenges with activities of daily living such as taking a shower or getting dressed.  </p><p>Nursing homes are disproportionally poor, nonwhite, and enrolled in Medicaid. The nursing home tragedy has a bronze lining, if you will, because it means that the risk of death from COVID for the rest of the population is considerably lower than we may have thought. We can use that information to reopen the economy and reduce the harm we are imposing on hundreds of millions of Americans of all colors. Thank you. </p><p>YARMUTH: Thank you for your testimony, Mr. Roy. Thanks, once again, to all the witnesses for their testimony and we will begin our question and answer period right now.  </p><p>As a reminder, members can submit written questions to be answered later in writing. Those questions and the witness's answer will be made part of the formal hearing record. Any members who wish to submit questions for the record may do so by sending them to the clerk electronically within 7 days.  </p><p>As is our custom, the ranking member and I will defer our questions until the end, so I now recognize the gentleman for New York, Mr. Higgins, for five minutes. Please unmute. Would you like the staff to unmute you? Just nod. Yup. Thanks. I think you're good to go. </p><p>HIGGINS: Okay. Alright. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, panel. Just a couple of thoughts here. First and foremost, and that is that 120,000 Americans are dead, and we have a government lockdown of the American economy because federal government failed to protect the American people. </p><p>We have a highly infectious, contagious disease that attacks the lung, the liver, and the heart, and the best thing that our fragile healthcare system can do for people suffering through the symptoms of COVID-19 is to provide them with Tylenol to help break their fever and to help them with their pain. The United States is the richest country in the world. We pay more for healthcare than any other country and we have no treatment, and we have no vaccine.  </p><p>Dr. Harris, I think this is an appalling set of circumstances for our country. And what has been done to the African American community with the higher than the percentage of their population cases of COVID-19, whether it's in Buffalo or any other city in this country, is very revealing and exposes the acute fragility of the American system.  </p><p>Now, I've heard Dr. Fauci, who probably is the most credible public health official, say that he is optimistic about the possibility of a vaccine at the end of this year. That's about 8 months from when we discovered this. From what I can tell, the quickest development of a vaccine was by Merck in response to Ebola, which was 5 years.  </p><p>Do you, as a medical professional, the formal head--former head of the American Medical Association, share my concerns that what Dr. Fauci is saying and what people hear are two different things? I'm concerned when he advances that optimistic view, perhaps overly, of having a vaccine by the end of this year, what people hear is that they can become complacent about the things that we're doing now--social physical distancing, facemasks, and personal hygiene. I'd like to get your thoughts on that. </p><p>HARRIS: Sorry-- </p><p>YARMUTH: --Please unmute--  </p><p>HARRIS: --I'll start again-- </p><p>YARMUTH: --Dr. Harris-- </p><p>HARRIS: --Yes. Yeah, sorry about that. Thank you, congressman, and let me first say that of course Dr. Fauci is the foremost expert on infectious diseases in our country. And let--I want to parse a little bit what I hear Dr. Fauci saying, as well. And I do think that there's certainly nothing wrong with being optimistic.  </p><p>But when Dr. Fauci's--and you're right that an end-of-year timeframe is optimistic and ambitious, but certainly when you have an all-hands-on-deck approach, I know it's possibil--possible, but I also hear Dr. Fauci saying that a vaccine could perhaps be developed by the end of the year. And I think what this body knows is that is just the first step--is development. Then you have to manufacture, then you have to distribute, and you have to, of course, make sure that the vaccine is ultimately equitably distributed.  </p><p>So, certainly Dr. Fauci is--has information that I don't have and certainly I would follow his lead when it comes to his timeline, but I also know that it will be important not just to develop the vaccine but also get it distributed. And we have to make sure that there is a diverse population who is included in the clinical trials. </p><p>HIGGINS: Okay, thank you. And just a final thought. It's like a tale of two countries. I represent Buffalo on the Canadian border and the United States federal response to coronavirus, COVID-19 was late, sloppy, and adversarial. The Canadian federal response was early, strong, and united.  </p><p>I'm trying to help get the U.S.-Canadian border opened up and, you know, we have been unsuccessful. I'm doing this with Elise Cusack (PH), who is my co-chair on the Northern Border Caucus. Here's why. The entire province of Ontario that includes Toronto (INAUDIBLE) New York City (INAUDIBLE) 5576 cases (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>The reason we can't get the border open is because the Canadians in Ontario don't want Americans over there because, given our high numbers, we are superspreaders. And again, I just think that underscores--I love optimism, but I want reality as well. And unless and until we develop an effective treatment and vaccine, there is no normalcy. Not in terms of our healthcare and not in terms of our economy. And with that I'll yield back, Mr. Chairman </p><p>YARMUTH: Alright, thank you. The gentleman's time has expired. I now recognize the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Wooderall--Woodall, for five minutes. Please unmute. </p><p>Oh, I'm sorry. Hold on. I think Rob dropped out. I now recognize the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Johnson, for five minutes. </p><p>JOHNSON: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you holding this hearing--and Ranking Member Womack. I think it's an important hearing. You know, over the past few months we've seen the devastating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our communities and we've also seen the positive power of deregulation when it comes to removing barriers to healthcare and stimulating our economy.  </p><p>And as we continue the long road to recovery, we must recognize the importance of deregulation and the need to continue removing unnecessary regulations that may inhibit economic recovery. I know in my district, we're already seeing the benefits of deregulation, especially when it comes to reducing barriers to telehealth access. The deregulation of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic has not only improved access to healthcare for my constituents in eastern and southeastern Ohio, but it also provided invaluable care for those in underserved rural areas across the nation. </p><p>Deregulation has helped change the way healthcare is delivered. We saw it play out over the past few months. It's my hope that Congress with embrace more regulatory flexibility that will ultimately help in our economic recovery and lead to greater access to quality, affordable health care.  </p><p>So, there is no question that this crisis has exposed the need for more healthcare reform, but the solution is certainly not to expand the Affordable Care Act, which has resulted in fewer choices and higher healthcare costs. The American people deserve better than a continuation of the ACA's broken promises, most notably the broken promise that it would reduce insurance costs, the broken promise that it would improve access, and the broken promise that it would increase patient choice.  </p><p>Future healthcare reform must be patient centered. Americans need more choices when it comes to healthcare and Congress should do everything in its power to prioritize a patient (INAUDIBLE) healthcare system rather than an inefficient, expensive government-run healthcare system. The American people deserve patient-centered market-based reforms that'll strengthen the patient-doctor relationship and give patients the ability to choose how best to meet their healthcare needs. And I look forward to working with my colleagues on these important issues as Congress takes additional steps to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p><p>So, Dr. Roy, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal budget was unsustainable with a debt rising uncontrollably. In your opinion, what affect does the rising federal debt have on low-income Americans?  </p><p>AVIK ROY: Well, as I mentioned in both my written and oral remarks, Mr. Johnson, I'm very concerned that both the spending of the CARES Act and related legislation and also the declining tax revenue from the economic lockdowns creates a perfect storm, which is going to massively increase the deficit and then that's going to push forward, meaning closer in time to us today, the fiscal reckoning that is sure to come with runaway federal debts.  </p><p>We're almost already at the point in which the interest on the federal debt exceeds what we pay for national defense. And when we get to a point where we have to cut back spending on Medicare and Medicaid because our bondholders leave us no choice, who is going to be most harmed? It's the people who most depend on those programs. Those who have high incomes, who can afford private insurance, will be fine. It's those that can't who will be most harmed. </p><p>JOHNSON: Yeah, I agree. You know, continuing with you, Dr. Roy, according to your research, what have been the public health impacts of the lockdowns and the extended lockdowns on low-income and minority communities? </p><p>AVIK ROY: Well, that's an excellent question and one that doesn't get asked enough, Mr. Johnson. And what I'd say is that it's going to take us years to really know what the effects are. But what we can certainly expect is that there are going to be people who didn't get their mammogram or their prostate exam during the lockdown and as a result, when their cancer does get diagnosed, it's too late to do something about it.  </p><p>There are going to be people who had a heart attack, but that heart attack went untreated. And we know that because the number of people who have gone into hospitals reporting heart attacks has declined precipitously during the lockdown. I could go on and on, but there are many, many different areas of public health where we ought to be concerned.  </p><p>JOHNSON: Yeah. </p><p>AVIK ROY: And then there's just the overall effects of massive unemployment for a prolonged period of time and the affect that has on life expectancy and other public health measures. </p><p>JOHNSON: Yeah. Okay. Well, I have other questions. I'll submit those for the record, Mr. Chairman, but thanks and I yield back my time. </p><p>YARMUTH: Absolutely. Gentleman's time has expired. I now recognize the gentlelady from Connecticut, Ms. DeLauro, for five minutes. </p><p>DELAURO: Can you hear me? Wonderful. Oh my gosh, I've become a technological genius in all of this. Thank you so much. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Womack, for this--for this hearing, and to our panelists.  </p><p>Dr. Deaton, I wanted to ask you. Along with my colleague, Suzan DelBene, and Senators Michael Bennett and Sherrod Brown, I've introduced the American Family Act-oh-that would take our child tax credit and essentially turn it into a child allowance by extending full eligibility to 1/3 of all children and families who earn too little to get the full credit. It increases its value and it delivers it monthly.  </p><p>The child tax credit is our nation's largest expenditure on children. And the recent data shows that the American Family Act would cut child poverty--that rate--by about two-fifths, the black child poverty rate in a ha--in one half, and Hispanic child poverty rate by 41 percent. What we do in the House-passed HEROES Act--it contains a 1-year version of this policy. That pr--would provide $300 dollars a month for young children and $250 for older children. In essence, the credit is fully refundable. You get $3600 dollars for young children under 6, $3000 dollars for older children ages 6 to 17. It's monthly installments indexed to inflation.  </p><p>My question is you have spoken about the important of family allowances when you were a young father. Help us and can you please talk, as what it meant to you, what it might mean for families and for children in the United States in the short-term and in the longer term as we look to deal with the issue of inequality, of poverty, and those whom are essentially the most affected about this today? </p><p>DEATON: Thank you. Thank you very much. I would tend to defer to some of my colleagues on child poverty in the United States, but I know it's a huge problem and-- </p><p>DELAURO: --Mm. It is-- </p><p>DEATON: --A great scandal. </p><p>DELAURO: Mm-hmm. </p><p>DEATON: And it really is important not just for the suffering in (INAUDIBLE) now but the suffering in (INAUDIBLE) in the future. There's really good evidence that children who grow up in poverty tend to suffer throughout their lives as a consequence.  </p><p>You asked me of my own experience. I grew up in Britain and I was a young widower when I was 29. And the child allowances that were paid to my two kids made a real difference for me between being able to go on and having enough money to put food on the table and look after my kids.  </p><p>I think it's not just children, but I mean I think one of the things that--in case I talk about that (INAUDIBLE)--is that the social safety net in America compared with what's happened in Europe is very frayed in many, many places. And, you know, people on the other side--and I, too--would say, well, you know, how are you going to finance that?  </p><p>And I think it's long past time for Americans to think seriously about a value-added tax, which they have in Europe. It's a tax that people don't mind paying very much. It also generates a lot of revenue.  </p><p>It's somewhat progressive in who pays it because everybody pays it, but the net affect when it goes to things like child credits and child tax credits and so on, and child benefits, is that it's extremely progressive. It also means that when you have something horrible happen like it's happened here, that kicks into place immediately in a way that it just doesn't in this country at all, so that we have a sort of automatic set of responses to bad times when they come. So, I'm very much in favor of that sort of expansion and using value-added tax to try to pay for it. </p><p>DELAURO: Mm-hmm. I would just--I'd say with the just remaining few seconds that I have, Dr. Deaton, I think we're looking probably--it's unlikely that we're going to deal with a value added tax. But I believe that what we can do is to look at--and the child poverty rates--and to take a look at how a child tax credit where we've got 1/3 of kids today, mostly African American kids and Latino kids, who are not eligible 'cause their families make too little, but to try to do something that we might, in a positive way, move forward on because it's already in existence and we are just adding it--to it. Thank you so much and thank the--all of you for your testimony. I yield back. </p><p>YARMUTH: Gentlelady's time has expired. I now recognize the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Holding, for five minutes. Please unmute. </p><p>HOLDING: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that. As pointed out, this virus and the statewide closures we've used to contain it have highlighted several inequities in access to childcare and nutrition services. And not only are minority children more likely to depend on school food programs, but they're also more likely to have parents who work in the services industry and are unable to stay at home when schools close. </p><p>And as we've seen disparities in nutrition, access are not just short-term problems. Over time, they lead to higher rates of comorbidities and chronic conditions that make minority communities especially vulnerable to viruses like the COVID-19.  </p><p>From the beginning of this crisis, nonprofits like the YMCAs in Raleigh and Charlotte have stepped up to address the nutrition and childcare gap and support underrepresented communities in their time of need. And over the past few weeks, the YMCA of the Triangle has served almost 50,000 meals to families across the region and provided childcare programs to over 1700 healthcare workers.  </p><p>In Garner, North Carolina--in my district--for--the Poole Family YMCA has set up day camps for children and runs blood drives to assist the healthcare community. These assistance programs played an essential role in providing stability to minority communities that have been disproportionately affected by this national emergency. </p><p>But despite the tremendous work that the YMCAs have done throughout the country, they have been left out of the federal assistance programs they desperately need. Under the Paycheck Protection Program, which Congress enacted specifically to help groups like this, affiliated organizations like the YMCA of Charlotte and the YMCA of the Triangle cannot access funds if they collectively employ over 500 people. And as a result, these two YMCAs have furloughed over 95 percent of their staffs and continue operating at loss. </p><p>So, without immediate federal assistance, YMCAs across the U.S. will no longer be able to provide these invaluable community services. I'm strongly urging all of my colleagues to support an adjustment in our next round of the paycheck protection program to ensure nonprofits like the YMCA continue to serve those in need. </p><p>So, my question to you, Dr. Roy, can you speak to the potential long-term effects of irregular access to food and childcare in low-income communities and how the federal government can best work with the private sector and nonprofits to bridge that gap? </p><p>AVIK ROY: Well, this--there's a lot of things to say about this topic. Let me highlight one thing that I mentioned in my written testimony, sir, which is that the closure of schools is a big disrupter in the delivery of nutrition to low income children because so many low income children get their lunch through the f--the federal school lunch program. So, this is where the school closures interact with a lot of federal systems, which flows through public schools, and why--one of the reasons why it's important to reopen schools where it's prudently possible to do so. And we at FREOPP are putting out a plan very soon on how you can reopen schools in a way that's consistent with public health. </p><p>HOLDING: Excellent. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. </p><p>YARMUTH: (INAUDIBLE) yields back. I now recognize the gentlelady from Illinois, Ms. Schakowsky, for five minutes. Please unmute. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: There I am. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And when I look at the name of this hearing, Health and Wealth Inequities in America, how COVID-19 makes clear the need for change. This could not be a more important moment to have this--the discussion. We have seen so many--and you listed some of them--inequities that have really come to light because of this. </p><p>I want to talk about one of the things that I worry about. 34 million Americans know someone who has died from not being able to afford their prescription drugs. But while 10 percent of white Americans know someone who has died because of that, 20 percent--twice as many--of nonwhite Americans know someone who has died from being unable to afford treatment.  </p><p>Similarly, people of color are twice as likely as white Americans to consider high drug prices to be among our most pressing issue today. This was even before--you know, well before we had COVID-19, this was the problem. And yesterday, Representative Doggett, and Representative DeLauro and DeFazio, and Representative Rooney--bipartisan--and I introduced what we call the MMAPP Act--H.R.7296--and H.R.7288, which is called the TRACK Act, to prevent price gouging at this time of the COVID-19 virus and prohibiting monopolies that no one company can control the remedies or the vaccines and to ensure transparency on taxpayer-funded COVID-19 drugs. </p><p>So, Dr. Harris and Dr. Jones, I'm wondering if you could discuss why people of color and black Americans in particular may be severely or even fatally impacted by high drug prices and if this is something that you see in your practices in your lives. </p><p>HARRIS: This is--am I unmuted? Can you hear me? </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Yes. </p><p>HARRIS: Thank you. This is absolutely a critical issue and that's why everyone needs to have access to affordable, meaningful health coverage. And that does include the ability to get help to pay for prescription medications. You ask about my own experience and I have, over the course of my career--for those who had insurance. I've spent a great deal of my career working with children in the foster care system or adults in the substance--with substance use disorders who relied on Medicaid or our state mental health system to pay for their services.  </p><p>And if they were able to access that, they were often not able to access the medications that I wanted to prescribe. And so, as we move forward on making sure that everyone has access to affordable, meaningful coverage, of course the affordability of prescription drugs has to be a part of that equation. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you. (INAUDIBLE) prescriptions sometimes that weren't filled probably, right? </p><p>HARRIS: Yes. That is a significant problem. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Yup. Dr. Harris, do you w--I mean Dr. Jones, did you want to respond? </p><p>JONES: Yeah. Well, I would just add briefly that, you know, another dynamic is that black people in the United States and other people of color are less likely to have health insurance coverage. And so, that's definitely going to introduce an additional barrier. And in terms of prescription drug prices, I think another thing to look at is how to make things more competitive. So, how quickly can generic drugs be provided that can help to bring down the price of those prescription drugs once they're made available to the market. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you. You know, we're working on legisla--we're--we've introduced legislation that would stop price gouging during this pandemic because the pharmaceutical companies are prone to try and take advantage of a situation, but also to guarantee that any therapy or any vaccine that is discovered is affordable. And sometimes that may mean free, so that all Americans have access to that. And I think we have to all accept that challenge and make sure all people will have access to the vaccines and therapies. So, thank you very much. I yield back. </p><p>YARMUTH: Gentlewoman yields back. I now recognize the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Meuser, for five minutes. </p><p>MEUSER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all to the witnesses. Appreciate it. It's important hearing. Our economy was in a good place--very good place--up until February of this past year. It had many benefits to the vast majority of Americans.  </p><p>Mr. Roy, let me ask you. The economy--the data from where we were come beginning of 2020, the wage increases, levels of unemployment for all segments of the economy, for low income, for minorities, for rural areas, for our cities always can be better, but would you say that we had some pretty positive trends that were beneficial to solving various inequalities that may have existed before? </p><p>AVIK ROY: There's no doubt, Mr. Meuser. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks and also in my written testimony where I go into this in a lot of detail, the disparity between white and black unemployment, the disparity between white and Hispanic unemployment reached record lows in late 2019. So, we've made remarkable progress in reducing some of these disparities and, obviously, the economic lockdowns have reversed a lot of those gains.  </p><p>And so, the sooner we can get out of lockdown and get the economy back and going again, maybe we can--we can get back on that plane. </p><p>MEUSER: Yeah.  And--and, you know, I'm, you know, a Republican.  But, I'm always interested in a--in a better plan.  This might be a difficult question.  But, are you hearing anything so far in this hearing on--on health and wealth inequities that you think would--would be pursuable for solving the inequity issue? </p><p>AVIK ROY: Well, the most important thing we can do to reduce inequities is drive economic growth--right--so both in terms of reopening the economy and in general, pro-growth policies.  A rising tide does lift all boats.  That's what we've seen throughout the last several decades of the American economic experience.  The better and stronger our economy is, the better it is, particularly for economically vulnerable populations.  So, I would highlight that, in particular. </p><p>MEUSER: There was a $3.3 trillion HEROES Act posed exclusively by the House Democratic Caucus, no input from Republicans whatsoever.  Was there anything in that that would help this--these levels of inequality for--for health and wealth?  Would you see--you see election law change as something that is dealing with--with this crisis?  Do you--you think--do you think allowing state and local taxes being able to be deducted for over $10,000 as something important for--to create better equality within the society, particularly now as we're recovering from this crisis? </p><p>AVIK ROY: Well, I can't say that I've read the HEROES Act line by line.  So, you'll have to forgive me for that.  But, I am aware of several provisions that I've looked at more closely.  One that I'm concerned about is a provision that would basically be a lottery for the trial lawyers to sue on behalf of anyone who was somehow connected, no matter how tenuously, to COVID-19--to sue their employer, sue the federal government, effectively get some sort of federal slush fund relief-- </p><p>MEUSER: --Yeah-- </p><p>AVIK ROY: --For injuries that may or may not be related to COVID-19.  I was very concerned about that. </p><p>And I'm also concerned about the restoration of--of tax breaks for high income individuals living in states with high state and local taxes.  I don't understand why that's good policy. </p><p>MEUSER: Yeah.  Neither do I.  You're not alone.  Would you think--do you think that we can help solve this problem by opening up our schools come September? </p><p>AVIK ROY: I think that's very important, and we would argue, actually, at FREOPP--and we've put out some work on this, and we're going to put out more.  We would argue that actually the school year should start earlier than September to make up for lost time.  It's essential for low income parents and families to be able to get their kids back in school because the disparities in educational outcomes, let alone economic and public health outcomes that come from poor educational attainment are incredibly important. </p><p>MEUSER: Right. </p><p>AVIK ROY: And the good--the good news is children are not vectors of infection, at least we have a lot of evidence that they are--they are not very infectious.  We don't understand exactly why.  There are theories.  But-- </p><p>MEUSER: --Right-- </p><p>AVIK ROY: --There is good reason to believe that reopening schools is--is the most--the safest thing we can do, among all the reopening tools we have. </p><p>MEUSER: That's why liability coverage at the schools talk about as essential for--for their opening? </p><p>AVIK ROY: Yes.  And for all employers.  I think liability coverage protection--that's the most important thing Congress can do.  A lot of reopen decisions are at the state and local level.  But, Congress can take action on liability protection. </p><p>MEUSER: I agree.  Thank you, Chairman.  I yield back. </p><p>YARMUTH: Gentleman yields back.  I now recognize the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Kildee, for five minutes. </p><p>KILDEE: Well, first of all, thank you, Chairman Yarmuth, for hosting this very important hearing.  As you know, I'm from Flint, Michigan.  The residents of my hometown are dealing with back to back crises, the ongoing water crisis and now the coronavirus pandemic.  Both of these crises have disproportionately impacted people of color. </p><p>Michigan currently ranks ninth among the states with the most coronavirus cases in the country.  Genesee County, where my hometown of Flint is located, where I am right now, has had 258 COVID-19 fatalities.  In Genesee County, African Americans account for 47 percent of the fatalities despite making up 20 percent of the county's population.  This kind of disparity is heartbreaking. </p><p>We're also experiencing the loss of social interactions, those interactions that help us cope with--during times of stress, also seeing record levels of unemployment, causing many to wonder how they will pay their own bills, maintain access to healthcare, and feed their families.  And on top of this, of course, people in Flint don't have access to water that they trust or that's affordable, many having to leave home just to get bottled water. </p><p>Because of these compounding stressors and traumas, I am concerned that there may be an additional crisis on the horizon, a mental health crisis that disproportionately impacts our already hard-hit communities.  The House passed HEROES Act, which contains policies that help address inequities like creating an ACA special enrollment period for uninsured Americans and--and also increased federal Medicaid payments and $3 billion to support mental health during this challenging time.  That was what was included in the HEROES Act.  I've also introduced legislation, again, which was included in the HEROES Act, that would extend unemployment benefits to help millions of Americans who are out of work. </p><p>With that as a background, Dr. Harris, I wonder if you might comment on why a special enrollment period and increased access to health coverage is so important to address the resulting racial inequalities, particularly mental health impacts of COVID-19 and what other healthcare policies are important for Congress to consider as we go forward? </p><p>HARRIS: Well, thank you.  And I--and I'll make a couple of quick points.  But, we know that people without health insurance live sicker and die younger.  We also know that Medicaid expansion and the expansion through the Affordable Care Act marketplace has allowed so many individuals who would not have been able to access mental health services to do so.  And--and certainly, it is important to have this coverage so that you can get this--this coverage. </p><p>You also mentioned issues around the water in Flint.  And we know that environmental toxins are another determinant of health.  And we have to make sure that we look at those issues.  And I want to make one more point about language that we use.  And one of the reasons that we use inequities is because we want to talk about avoidable differences, those differences that can be prevented.  And, of course, we've mentioned those structural determinants of health as well that have driven us to these social determinants of this ill health. </p><p>So--and I remember, as a child psychiatrist in training, we used to always check for lead because so many--trained in Atlanta at Emory, large African American population.  So, many children had been exposed to lead--this was several years ago--but, because of where they lived.  And so, all of these issues are critical if we are to address these health inequities.  And clearly, the ability to have insurance is one. </p><p>You mentioned expanding the enrollment period for Medicaid, special open enrollments of Affordable Care Act.  We could also help folks retain their COBRA benefits.  We can also support employers to offer temporary subsidies to preserve their health benefits.  So, those are just a few solutions that we would offer. </p><p>KILDEE: I really appreciate your comments.  My--my initial career was in the child welfare system, working with children who had been traumatized.  And I have a particular concern--particular for the kids of Flint who are experiencing a trauma on top of a trauma, not to mention the daily trauma that they see because of their conditions.  So, I really appreciate the perspective that you bring to this conversation, and thank you so much to all of you for your testimony.  With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. </p><p>YARMUTH: Gentleman yields back.  I now recognize the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Crenshaw, for five minutes. </p><p>CRENSHAW: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you for holding this hearing.  I'll of course say, again--we'll state the obvious--and it's been said many times throughout this--this hearing--that economic lockdowns, in essence, choosing the costliest, most extreme possible option before we went through a series of other options to mitigate the spread of the virus and save our hospital system--that overwhelmingly hurt working class people. </p><p>And while a bunch of city dwelling, teleworking, I'm sure very nice people, advocated for safety and saving lives and continuing to lockdown the economy--because God forbid anybody chooses themselves to go out to a restaurant or chooses themselves to go to work, God forbid.  That hurt the people that we're talking about today overwhelmingly.  And yes, they're hurt by COVID-19 as well disproportionately as--as all the data points to.  Of course, the data--of course doesn't even come close to our elderly population. </p><p>And I hope we do have a hearing about that too and question why governors, such as the governor of New York, could actually implement policy which harmed the elderly population the most by forcing infected patients back into nursing homes.  That's been conveniently ignored.  Because we should always be looking for specific policies that actually help the disparity that we're talking about, things we can actually affect. </p><p>And I've heard a lot of talking out of both sides of the mouth in much of the--on the one hand, the economic devastation of lockdowns harms minority communities.  It does.  I just interviewed a black owned--business owner--black business owner here.  And their main problem right now is that they can't get their workers to come back.  Why?  Well, because the workers are getting paid more on unemployment than they were back--back at work. </p><p>I can't get a single Democrat to cosponsor a bill that would do a simple fix for that.  Not take away benefits, actually let them keep the bonus while the program is still going, keep that $600 a week bonus even if you come back to work.  Seems like a win-win.  I can't get a single Democrat on it.  I don't know why because I don't think there's any actual desire to solve problems here, and it's really frustrating to me.  If we actually care about really helping people you want to help. </p><p>Mr. Roy, is--is there any data comparing minority incomes between states that are still in lockdown or--or came out of lockdown later and those that came out of lockdown earlier? </p><p>AVIK ROY: Mr. Crenshaw, there's preliminary information on that score.  What we do see is that--for example, I was citing in my written testimony, the stuff around how minimum wage or hourly wage jobs--excuse me--hourly wage jobs have been cut significantly.  There's significant state variation.  In the--in the states that have reopened, hourly wage jobs are coming back at much higher rates.  And in states that have continued to lock down, New York, Virginia, the--the hourly wage reducing in employment and in hours and wages is massively lower. </p><p>CRENSHAW: So, I've heard over and over again that the only reason that--the only solution, I mean, that we could possibly have to--to solving the disparities and health outcomes with something like COVID-19 is a single payer healthcare system.  That's got to be the only solution, right?  But, did countries with a single payer healthcare system such as England have health--have health outcome inequalities as well?  I've heard they're almost exactly the same as here. </p><p>AVIK ROY: Well, it's interesting that you mention this, Mr. Crenshaw, because just today at FREOPP, we published a ranking of the 31 wealthiest countries in the world on the basis of their pandemic response, mortality per million residents, the economic stringency of their lockdowns, and the relative isolation of their economies relative to other countries. </p><p>And what we found is just as you said.  There are some countries with single payer healthcare that did well.  Taiwan has single payer healthcare.  They come out number one in our ranking.  But, Italy comes in second to last, if I recall correctly.  And there they also have single payer healthcare.  The U.K. has single payer healthcare.  Their mortality is far higher per million residents than the United States. </p><p>CRENSHAW: But--but--and it's also far higher for minorities too. </p><p>AVIK ROY: Oh, yes.  That's true. </p><p>CRENSHAW: The same disparities that we do.  And yet, they have single payer.  We just have to point these--out these facts.  If we're going to just jump to a single solution, we have to--we have to at least agree on the--a common set of facts. </p><p>Also, what are the public health impacts of lockdowns, especially with low income and minority communities?  Aside from economic and job loss, what about public health? </p><p>AVIK ROY: This is--this is a really important question.  And, you know, we--I mentioned a bit earlier in one of my other responses.  A lot of this is going to be difficult to measure because we don't actually--some of these effects are going to be long term.  The person with chronic disease that didn't have it managed over this period of time--the manifestations that (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>CRENSHAW: And that's what we're seeing in Houston, by the way.  The uptick in cases is--is that.  That's not their lungs being inflamed.  I realize I'm out of time.  And sorry to interrupt you.  But, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for--for--and I yield back. </p><p>YARMUTH: Gentleman yields back.  I now recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. Panetta, for five minutes. </p><p>PANETTA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Womack.  And I appreciate both of you holding today's hearing on the inequalities and dealing with COVID-19 pandemic.  And of course, thank you for the witnesses for all of their expertise, all of the preparation and their time for coming to talk about hopefully not just the problems but some solutions that we can have going forward in this pandemic and addressing the inequalities in our nation. </p><p>As many of you know, over the last three months, what has been highlighted are those inequalities, from healthcare to wealth to education to justices and, yes, to housing as well.  And they've collided clearly with one of the deadliest pandemics the world has faced in a century or more.  But, unfortunately, what we're seeing is the lower income and, yes, the communities of color have borne the brunt of this pandemic.  And we see it right here in where I represent, where I live, where I grew up on the central coast of California.  As my friend, Mr. Kildee, likes to say, here in the salad bowl of the world.  Obviously, we have a lot of agriculture.  But, we have a unique sort of agriculture that doesn't take machines.  It takes human beings to harvest.  And so, we have a large--thankfully, a large immigrant community that has contributed so much to our economy, to our community, and to our culture, who we are. </p><p>In Monterey County alone--look, I'll be the first to admit we're not a hotbed at this point.  We only have about--as of yesterday, about--just over 1,200 cases of COVID-19, and we've endured 12 deaths, unfortunately, because of the disease.  But, within that number, 80 percent of the COVID-19 cases have been found in the Latinx community, and nearly 40 percent have been farm workers.  And so, unlike some parts on the central coast, this community has not had the option to work from home, as you know.  It's our farm workers that continue to work through this pandemic, put food on all of our tables across this country, not just here on the central coast, and, yes, provide this country with the food security that is so needed, especially at this time and even now, as cases spike up in California. </p><p>And so, Dr. Harris, I want to address questions to you if that's alright.  As you probably know, 25 percent of undocumented farm workers in the United States have healthcare--health insurance.  It's only 25 percent of undocumented farm workers, which, unfortunately, I think we know there are--are a significant number of undocumented farm--farm workers.  What do you feel are the ways that we can ensure that farm workers get health--the healthcare that they need despite the obstacle of uninsurance, and are there changes, solutions, like I said, that Congress can make, can put forward to help undocumented immigrants gain access to healthcare providers?  Dr. Harris?  Your microphone--the--the (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>HARRIS: Yes.  Thank you.  Certainly, leave it up to the wisdom of this body, your colleagues in the Senate, to the how.  But, I can tell you that it is important for everyone to have access to insurance because, just like this virus that may have impacted first others in other countries, you know, we saw the pandemic or epidemic anywhere certainly impacts us here in the U.S.</p><p>And so, illnesses don't respect state boundaries, county boundaries.  They don't know who is here and who is documented, who--who does not have proper documentation.  And so, it is really important we--the AMA made a strong statement about making sure that children had access to vaccinations and quality care from their pediatrician.  And so, I will just say it is important for everyone to have access to appropriate healthcare. </p><p>PANETTA: Understood.  Now, obviously, we've heard from a couple of my colleagues.  And I'm seeing it here on the central coast.  Telemedicine has been helping.  Yet, there are some difficulties, obviously, with foreign born and non-English speaking population.  Dr. Harris, are there ways that we can improve that for rural areas and communities of color? </p><p>HARRIS: Absolutely.  And telemedicine certainly--and many, many of us--I know I used telemedicine pre-COVID.  But, certainly COVID did accelerate that use, and we appreciate the relax in--relaxation of the regulations.  But, we need to look at issues around broadband actually in both urban areas and rural areas.  We need to look at the issue of whether or not there is a computer or more than one computer and confidentiality.  You know, when you're talking about private medical needs--so, these are all needs that need to be addressed as we move forward with telemedicine. </p><p>PANETTA: Thank you, Dr. Harris.  Thank you, again, Mr. Chairman.  Appreciate the opportunity.  I yield back. </p><p>YARMUTH: Gentleman yields back.  I now recognize the gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. Burchett, for five minutes. </p><p>BURCHETT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank y'all for being here, Mr. Ranking Member.  I (INAUDIBLE) personal privilege.  I hope we all remember our colleague Andy Barr in our prayers, lost his wife and two beautiful little girls lost their mama.  And that's just--to me, it's just heartbreaking.  My wife was a widow, and I married her and adopted her little girls.  So, I know--and she's talked to me about the impact of that.  So, I hope we all remember Andy in our prayers. </p><p>I appreciate the opportunity to be here.  And Mr. Harris, I would ask if you--when you started talking about telemedicine--I was up in Clayburne County.  And I'm sure you know what Clayburne County is.  Nobody does. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>It's a very small county.  It's about two percent of my district.  But, they actually utilize telemedicine.  And I would encourage you all to reach out to them and some of the folks up there because they had some great success with that up there, especially during this--the outbreak of--of the virus. </p><p>But, Mr. Roy, I was wanting to know--you studied in public some of the failures of Medicaid to improve our care for low income Americans.  How can we leverage some of that to treat and contain and prevent the spread of the coronavirus, and how will this solution actually provide better care to some of our vulnerable populations? </p><p>AVIK ROY: Well, you know, let me go back to something Mr. Crenshaw just was pointing out, which is that the biggest disparity, the single biggest disparity when it comes to the impact-- </p><p>BURCHETT: --Can I--can I stop you--can I stop you one second?  Don't ever refer to Dan Crenshaw because his ego is so big, I don't know if his head's going to fit on the screen much more.  But, please continue-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>AVIK ROY: --Fair enough.  I respect that, Mr. Burchett.  So, apologies.  The biggest disparity is the fact that 0.6 percent of the U.S. population lives in long term care facilities, nursing homes and assisted living facilities, and that's where 43 percent of all U.S. COVID-19 deaths are occurring.  And 81 percent of all deaths from COVID-19 are happening among people aged 65 or older. </p><p>And how does this relate to your question?  It's because Medicaid is one of the biggest drivers of this problem.  Because if you are medically vulnerable and you need help with activities of daily living and you're in Medicaid, you have to go to a nursing home to get the care you need.  You're not allowed to use Medicaid dollars to get that care in your own home.  That's one of the things about Medicaid that's incredibly inflexible.  And that's led to an enormous distortion the way we deliver nursing home care, and it's also put the Medicaid population in disproportionate--disproportionately harm's way. </p><p>BURCHETT: Well, let me ask you also--I know you've done some research on the economy prior to the coronavirus.  What would you suggest that we could do when state, federal, and local elected offices and--and, I guess, just the bureaucracy to make this thing work out better and provide better healthcare for our country? </p><p>AVIK ROY: Well, I think the most important thing we can do--and, as you may know, we have a plan that we've put out at FREOPP called \"Medicare Advantage for All.\"  And the basic idea is that everyone should own their own health insurance, and they should be able to take it from job to job.  And the way you do that is by reforming the market for people who buy insurance on their own, the one that Obamacare made so much more expensive, and improve that market so people really have choices that are high quality coverage but also affordable that allow them, if they lose their job, to then buy insurance that they can keep and then take wherever they go. </p><p>BURCHETT: I yield back the rest of my time unless Jimmy Panetta wants to discuss anything else. </p><p>YARMUTH: Gentleman yields back the rest of his time.  I now recognize the gentleman from California--from New York, Mr. Morelle, for five minutes. </p><p>MORELLE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much, and thank you, once again, for holding a series of important hearings to--to talk about the pandemic and the impact that it's had.  I do just want to state, for the record, that, if the President of the United States had demonstrated half the leadership of my friend, the governor of New York, thousands of Americans might not have contracted COVID-19 in the first place.  But, I'll leave that to another date.  But, I do want to defend my friend from New York. </p><p>I do want to talk about, obviously, the--the wealth and health inequality in America and the devastation that's occurred in the wake of this crisis was made all the worse by the deep seated inequalities that have plagued our country for decades.  Racial and wealth disparity were at the root of our nation's academic achievement gaps before COVID-19. </p><p>I don't have to tell any of you that we know the health and education and intrinsically linked and economically marginalized and segregated neighborhoods are more likely to have less access to resources that help children and adults lead healthier, safer lives.  And the resulting and persistent cycle of systemic disadvantaged--disadvantage, whether it's academic achievement gaps, healthcare disparities, and unjust wage differences for black Americans compared to their white peers has made it near impossible to gain equity in this country. </p><p>The pandemic has not only shined a glaring spotlight on the lack of investment and resources available to black communities and schools, it's exacerbated the health and educational gaps to a breaking point.  So, as we begin to rebuild our communities and regain our footing, we have a very real opportunity and a responsibility to take intentional and preemptive actions to safeguard these communities against further fallout and to address the underlying social determinants of health that we've seen reflected in other diseases for decades and deep seated inequalities have plagued our community.  In my community, we have seen a four times rate of infection, over a five times rate of hospitalization, and a two and a half time mortality rate among black Americans in the Rochester, New York community.  So, I know that we are not alone, and that's being experienced around the country. </p><p>I want to ask Dr. Harris--how has the COVID pandemic worsened preexisting racial inequities in neighborhood quality and in the build environment as well as access to community health support services for people of color? </p><p>HARRIS: I think three overarching areas--and thank you for the opportunity to answer the question.  I think, first of all, again, the preexisting conditions, again, that were already there before COVID-19, the disproportionate impact of diabetes, hypertension, asthma, obesity. </p><p>Secondly, was--you had more members from communities of color who were working those essential jobs.  It's been noted they didn't have the privilege of staying at home.  They had to go out and work actually so many of us who had the privilege could have the food security.  And, of course, that increased their risk of exposure. </p><p>And third, you know, I think it's the misinformation, the disinformation that has been out there.  And then, we really have to talk about 401 years of racism and discrimination and bias that have led us.  And here in Atlanta, I was working with a group, and we were looking at the discriminatory housing policy of redlining.  And we could line up those neighborhoods with the zip codes now that we see with severe health inequities. </p><p>I do want to say something.  I do respect Dr. Roy and, of course, respect a marketplace of ideas.  I do want us to have a closer look to the rising tide lifts all boats.  That is true.  But, that's not sufficient.  I think we need to dig deeper because it may lift all boats.  But, it may not lift everyone up--may not lift every boat up to where it needs--everyone can get an equitable opportunity for health.  So, I think, as we think about that, we have to--at least I would worry about some of these one size fits all solutions. </p><p>MORELLE: Thank you.  I--I want to ask Dr. Deaton--and any of the other panelists might comment as well.  But, how can we, as we begin to move forward, rebuild our economies and our communities in a purposeful way that prevents the further deepening of the academic achievement gap, particularly as we head into the summer months?  Do you have any thoughts on that, sir? </p><p>DEATON: Sorry.  I didn't hear a question.  Was that (INAUDIBLE)? </p><p>MORELLE: Yeah.  I just wanted to know, as we--as we sort of--and I may be running out of time.  So--I just want to--any thoughts you had on rebuilding our economy-- </p><p>UNKNOWN: --(INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>MORELLE: --And communities in a purposeful way to prevent the further deepening of the academic achievement gap, particularly as we head into the summer months when many students are not in school. </p><p>DEATON: Yeah, I think that's going to be one of the hardest problems that we have to deal with, especially as the lockdown of schools, which was probably not a very good idea, has widened these gaps enormously.  So, I'm very much with that. </p><p>MORELLE: I yield back my time.  Thank you, Mr. Chair. </p><p>YARMUTH: Gentleman yields back.  I now recognize the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Flores, for five minutes. </p><p>FLORES: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate the opportunity to participate in today's hearing.  And my broadband service has been a little bit spotty today.  So, I'm hopeful that everybody can hear me and that I don't drop off in the middle of this--in the middle of my five minutes. </p><p>Mr. Roy, in previous testimony, you said \"the association is clear--a strong economy most benefits minorities, and a worsening economy most hurts them.\"  House Democrats have made known their desire for heavy top down structural changes in our economy.  And so, my question is this--in your view, is this top down heavy handed approach the best policy direction for helping minorities, or would you recommend policies more focused on strengthening the economy, thus providing greater opportunities for minorities? </p><p>AVIK ROY: Well, leaving aside the party piece of it, I mean, I would just say we--definitely that economic growth is incredibly important.  And we have to be extremely mindful of policies that would not only suppress economic growth but suppress job growth.  You know, we've talked a little bit today about the $600 bonus that's leading people to basically not get back into the workforce, and that's retarding the economic recovery.  So, I'm very concerned that I hear that Congress is thinking about renewing or restoring or extending that policy.  That's going to make it a lot harder for employers to get back on their feet.  And we're going to see--we already have seen 100,000 or more small businesses close because of lockdowns.  That number could increase considerably if that feature of the CARES Act is extended. </p><p>FLORES: Okay. One of the related features that has come out of the pandemic, and not only in terms of economic impact, but--but it has a follow-on economic impact is the fact that we have several regulations that were found to--to impede our ability to respond to the pandemic, things like hand sanitizer guidelines, truck driving limits, things like this. So, I have a question for all of the panelists, starting with Dr. Deaton. Are there any regulations that you think of that have hindered the ability to respond to challenges of the pandemic? And are there any challenge--any regulations you can think of that disproportionately harm minorities and low-income communities? </p><p>DEATON: Well, I--I'm someone who feels that one of the greatest disasters in America these days is the health care system. And much of that is to do with regulation. I have a different view though that I think removing regulations is not the right way to go. I think that what we need is a system that automatically insures everyone from birth. I think we have to have a system that controls costs, which is very important. It's true that our health care system has not done any worse in this pandemic then other countries health care systems. And it's too much really to ask any health care system to deal well with something that only happens--this is only happened 100 years ago, before, but (INAUDIBLE) every other country--. </p><p>FLORES: I--I (INAUDIBLE) theory (INAUDIBLE), Dr. Deaton. </p><p>DEATON: Sorry. </p><p>FLORES: Excuse me. Can I go to Dr. Harris, about the--the regular regulations question? </p><p>DEATON: Sure. </p><p>HARRIS: Well, I think we chatted earlier about the regulations regarding telehealth, and I think that was very important. And I will say this from a broader perspective regarding substance use disorder, not necessarily just communities of color, it was important to reduce a lot of those regulations so that patients who had an opioid use disorder could get the medications that they needed. And we didn't have the dose limit at the time limit, so those were very helpful as well. And there was some loosening of regulations regarding prior authorizations for services and medications, and those were helpful as well during this time. </p><p>FLORES: Okay. Thank you. Dr. Jones, can you give me 30 seconds in terms of regulations that have hindered the ability to respond to the pandemic and regulations that disproportionately harm minority communities?  </p><p>And Mr. Roy, we'll do--we'll get to you when we've got about 30 seconds left. </p><p>JONES: At the--at the moment, there are no specific regulations that are coming to my mind to me, so I will pass it on. </p><p>FLORES: Okay. Mr. Roy, briefly. </p><p>AKIV ROY: Well, I'd love--well, I'd love, Mr. Flores, for Congress to make permanent some of the regulatory relief that's been temporary around telemedicine, telehealth, practicing medicine across state lines, allowing your license to be used if you move states without having to get recertified. Those are some of the simple things we can do, not just for physicians, but also for nurses.  </p><p>FLORES: Right. </p><p>AKIV ROY: Broadly speaking, I should mention that the regulatory reforms of the last several years are a big driver of the record low unemployment that we enjoyed prior to the pandemic. That's worth noting as well, right? </p><p>FLORES: Right. I appreciate it. And I agree with you. I think the--the--the regulations that we've modified in light of this pandemic should be extended permanently. I yield back, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>YARMUTH: (INAUDIBLE) back. I now recognize the gentleman from Nevada, Mr. Horsford, for five minutes. </p><p>HORSFORD: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and to the ranking member for holding this hearing. And to all of our panelists for joining us today.  </p><p>Dr. Harris, it's great to see you again. Thank you for your tremendous leadership over the years at the American Medical Association, and--and then your practice. </p><p>As many of you may be aware, Nevada, my home state, is the hardest hit state economically in our nation and has the worst unemployment rate at over 25.2 percent as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic. Few places were hit harder than Las Vegas, where a full one-third of the Las Vegas economy is in the leisure and hospitality industry, more than any other major metropolitan area in the country. Most of those jobs cannot be done from home. </p><p>The New York Times did an article back in April that was titled How Las Vegas Became Ground Zero for the American Jobs Crisis. And they brought to light the devastating impacts that this virus has on African American families and--and those Latinx and other communities throughout southern Nevada. The article highlighted how Mr. and Mrs. Anderson both lost their jobs at a restaurant and a call center respectfully and immediately began to worry about how they would pay rent and provide food for their daughter. </p><p>This is one of the many examples as to how COVID-19 has dramatically impacted African American households. In 2018, the poverty rate for African American families was more than two and a half times the poverty rate for whites. In the poverty right--rate for Latinx families was more than twice that of whites.  </p><p>Disparities in the child poverty rate are even more stark. The child poverty rate for African Americans in 2018 was more than three times the child poverty rate for whites, up from about two and a half times the rate for whites in 2013. But none of this is a coincidence. The inequities we see today were not caused by COVID-19. They are a result of systemic racism that is impacted every aspect from health, education, financial, housing and other institutions, and it has affected the opportunities across the board. </p><p>Now, there's data that I just read yesterday from the Center on Poverty and Social Policy that indicates how the child poverty rate could be cut in half if Congress would approve the American Family Act, which expands the child tax credit that would provide $3600 for kids under six years of age and $3000 for older kids. That poverty rate among black children would drop by 52 percent and among Latinx children by 41 percent.  </p><p>Dr. Harris, what long term effects might the COVID-19 pandemic have on children? And how might it affect their physical and mental health as well as their economic potential in the long term? </p><p>HARRIS: Well, certainly many areas there. But let me just highlight one or two, and the first is the issue around trauma. We have burgeoning evidence that trauma experience early in childhood, many may be familiar with the adverse childhood experience survey, leads to both short term and long term health impacts and not just mental health, not just psychological help, but also long term cardiovascular health, diabetes, as some of these other issues. We certainly think about abuse and--and violence has typical trauma. </p><p>But certainly, the day to day traumatic experience of racism and perhaps living in poverty and some of these other issues can also have a cumulative effect. It's known in some papers as weathering effect on African Americans. And so, again, and earlier I talked to previous housing discriminatory--discriminatory housing policy. So, all of these impacts, both short- and long-term health.  </p><p>HORSFORD: Thank you. Dr. Jones, briefly, how does structural racism affect health outcomes in the United States, and how does it affect the quality of care that people of color receive? Some of the health behaviors relating to housing and food availability and other social determinants. </p><p>JONES: Yeah. I think that there are a number of ways in which structural racism can affect these health outcomes. I think that when we look at the United States and compare it to other countries in terms of health outcomes, we have relatively high rates of maternal mortality--maternal mortality, for example, during childbirth. And some of this could be linked to discrimination or biases among doctors and how they view, for example, black women. </p><p>And so, these deep-seated issues of racism, they are--they are prevalent when doctors are being trained among--it feeds into the composition of doctors that we have. And then it can spillover into the types of services that are delivered. That's just one example.  </p><p>HORSFORD: Thank you very much. And I yield back. </p><p>YARMUTH: (INAUDIBLE) yields back. I now recognize the gentlelady from Texas, Ms. Jackson Lee, for five minutes. </p><p>JACKSON LEE: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I'm in the office with one or two staff. I'll take off my mask because obviously, in Texas we have been hitting a spike of--of enormous proportion. Our hospital beds are now overwhelmed. Our emergency rooms are overwhelmed with COVID-19. And I think this is certainly an appropriate hearing as it deals with wealth and equality in America. </p><p>And really, as I've been listening. The lack of access to health care. So I'm going to, if I might--Dr. Harris, if I might focus on you and my focus will hopefully be an area that you have had some exposure to just by hearing the word, but I'm going to articulate it in a more definitive manner. And I'd really like--first of all, let me congratulate you, Dr. Harris, for your leadership of the American Medical Association and--and really the innovative work that you have been doing as it relates to health care disparities. It is very distinguished and--and well appreciated. </p><p>So, I would like to as well comment on this inequity in wealth. I heard someone attacking the Affordable Care Act. If all of the states, the red states had accepted the Medicare expansion, we would have included more persons. If we had allowed the Affordable Care Act to take its will and to be able to develop the body politic and to include young people, we would have had a very strong health care system. But it's been--attacked and--and stripped and--and strained and--and it is an outrage.  </p><p>I do believe that Medicare should be modified to include the opportunities for individuals to be in their homes and still have the ability to have care as persons who are in need of care. But my question to you is that we have experienced over the last couple of weeks the recognition by many of systemic racism. We've introduced a legislation for over 30 years called the Commission to Develop Proposals for Reparations and Proposals. It is a thoughtful, articulate expression of addressing the question of systemic racism and presenting a commission that will look at the issues of health care, the economy, psychological issues, social logical issues, scientific issues. And I think we have a vehicle that can address what we're trying to do piecemeal, meaning that we have people's focus on the over 200 years of slavery that have obviously had an impact in the denial of wealth, the inability to transfer wealth.  </p><p>So, you're a doctor. I'd appreciate your commentary on looking at it through the eyes of a commission to deal with and develop real proposal on the question of the plight of African Americans as relates to any number of issues. And you may speak to the issue of access to health care. I believe another witness is Dr. Jones from the Chicago--University of Chicago, but Dr. Harris, could you please answer the question? </p><p>HARRIS: Choose that you mention. And that might be addressed in that legislation are critically important issues. For many years, I think we looked at health through a narrow lens and now we really have to open up that lens. And--and when we are talking about these health inequities, we do have to go back to the 400 years of slavery and Jim Crow and all of those issues.  </p><p>I will say something that the AMA has done regarding reconciliation. Many of the audience, and many of the members of Congress may know that for decades the AMA did not allow black physicians to belong to the--to the AMA. And we do believe that that probably impacted where we are today. So, we are looking internally as we move forward.  </p><p>But in 2008, the AMA went on record to apologize for that. Now, that was a necessary step. Not sufficient. We have done things since then. We have a new Center for Health Equity. But--but critically an--an important note in reconciliation is--is admitting your past mistakes. </p><p>JACKSON LEE: So, you understand reparations is repair and it's different from reconciliation. So, I'm talking about. </p><p>HARRIS: I do. </p><p>JACKSON LEE: (INAUDIBLE) 40. And do you believe we--we need reparations, repair and restoration as well? </p><p>HARRIS: Well, I have to say, I'm here everything that AMA today. I don't think we have taken an official position, but I am a black woman in this country, and I do think we need to look at that issue seriously and particularly how those issues impacted health. </p><p>JACKSON LEE: Thank you. Is Dr. Jones there? Dr. Damon Jones? Thank you very much, Madam President. Hello? </p><p>HARRIS: Thank you. </p><p>JONES: Yeah. Yes, yes.  </p><p>JACKSON LEE: Could you respond to that as well? </p><p>JONES: Yes. So, I think that, as I mentioned, I think that--that we should move forward with that bill to create a committee. One of the steps has to do with reconciliation and get--getting closure. But as you mentioned, there's also redress for what has happened in the past. And so material reparations, I think, as well, should be included. </p><p>Both of those are important because we continuous--continually see ourselves back at the same point with racial strife in this country. And so, we're not going to get past that without looking deeply into this country's history and trying to repair some of those harms. </p><p>JACKSON LEE: I commend H.R. 40 to both of you, in terms of looking at it from your perspective on health care. The commission appointed by members of the United States Congress leadership and the president of the United States would then be tasked with developing a--a repairing and restoring of the seismic impact of slavery, the original sin on--on African Americans who don't have the inherited wealth, who are impacted by health disparities in a very severe manner and are impacted more severely by COVID-19 both economically and health wise. We need a systemic change dealing with systemic racism.  </p><p>And I think as we look at it from the budget perspective, all of our committees could look at this extensively. And I'm just going to you, Dr. Jones, I know have a second or two, but we have to look at it holistically (INAUDIBLE) as a way to do so. Dr. Jones? </p><p>YARMUTH: You are--you're way over time.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>You're way over time all right. I'm sorry. The gentlewoman's time is expired.  </p><p>JACKSON LEE: Thank you. Thank you. I yield back. </p><p>YARMUTH: I--I now yield five minutes to the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Scott.  </p><p>SCOTT: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr.--Mr. Roy--let me ask Mr. Roy a question first, and I thank you for testifying in the Education and Labor Committee yesterday. When you say liability protection on coming back, on reopening, are you talking about liability insurance coverage so that victims can get covered? Or are you talking immunity where the victim is stuck with his own bills? </p><p>AKIV ROY: Well, I don't know if I'm exactly talking either of those things. What I'm talking about as employers are very reluctant to reopen their workplaces because they're concerned that if a single worker at their place of employment eventually gets COVID-19 and that--that COVID-19 was contracted somewhere else but outside the workplace--. </p><p>SCOTT: The--the--but--but who--if the people get sick and the employer could pay under president law? </p><p>AKIV ROY: Oh, well, that's different, right? So, if the--if the employer--if the employer is paying for their health insurance and the health insurance should cover COVID-19, of course. </p><p>SCOTT: Okay. So--so when you talk about liability protection, are you talking about insurance company to cover the liability or are you talking about immunity where the employer is home free? </p><p>AKIV ROY: Well, I'm talking about legal protection for employers so that they are--are not at risk of bankruptcy due to someone who contracts COVID-19 outside of the workplace. </p><p>SCOTT: And you could do--you could do that--you could do that--you could do that with--with--insurance?  </p><p>AKIV ROY: You could (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>SCOTT: (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>AKIV ROY: But the employer pays for the insurance, right? So, if the employer pays for the insurance, that increases the cost of employment. </p><p>SCOTT: Okay. Well, I don't think you had an answer to that. Let me ask Dr. Harris a question. We've heard a lot of disparaging remarks about the Affordable Care Act. Dr. Harris, you are aware that when the Republicans tried to replace the Affordable Care Act, their replacement was scored by the CBO and it concluded that the costs would go up 20 percent the first year, 20 some million fewer people would have insurance. Those with pre-existing conditions would lose their insurance and the insurance you get is worse than what you got. </p><p>And you say--so we know that ACA repealed and replaced, but repeal just generally. And Medicaid expansion, can you just say how--how Medicaid expansion would be helpful to reduce the disparities and how ACA repeal would be harmful and make the disparities worse?  </p><p>Dr. Harris? Unmute. </p><p>HARRIS: Can you hear me? Thank you.  </p><p>SCOTT: Yeah, I can hear you now. </p><p>HARRIS: Thank you. Yes. And as you know, the American Medical Association did support the Affordable Care Act. Certainly, it was not a perfect piece of legislation, but it did move us further in reducing the number of uninsured in this country. And at this point, we believe that the best path forward is to strengthen and enhance the Affordable Care Act, and that does include the expansion of Medicaid.  </p><p>Certainly, I know so many, and I am a psychiatrist, but--but in all disciplines of medicine, so many previously uninsured patients were able to gain access to health care through the Affordable Care Act. And we also know that if you don't have insurance and of course, for other--many other reasons, lack of access, all of that, social determinants of health, you live sicker and die younger. And so, we at the AMA continue to support strengthening and enhancing the Affordable Care Act. We continue to support a bipartisan and bicameral solution to getting us to a point where everyone has affordable, meaningful coverage in this country. </p><p>SCOTT: Thank you. And I'll ask our other witnesses. We--we can talk about the problem or we can come up with solutions. We're talking about a lot of solutions about income and wealth inequality. Some of the things we're working on are increasing the minimum wage, making it easier to form--form a union so you can negotiate for higher wages, investments in education, particularly higher education, and making that affordable, housing, homeownership initiatives, because that's where most middle class families get their wealth and fighting discrimination in everything from employment to business loans to housing so that equally postured people will get--well the--the minorities will not be worse off. Can you--say anything about which of those initiatives are most important or anything else that we ought to be actually working on? </p><p>DEATON: This is Agnes Deaton here. Yeah. I mean, I think I made a case for all of these in some of my writings. The one I would emphasize that you didn't emphasize is I think we have to somehow rein in the cost of health care. I mean, the cost of entitlements as we've heard are bankrupting the nation. But the cost the entitlements are so large because healthcare costs so much. And we've got to bring those costs down. </p><p>The waste in health care is 50 percent more than we spend on national defense, and that is just a completely crazy number. And other countries manage to do this, not necessarily any better than that, but they do it at less than half the cost. And that would stop the leading of employment for less skilled Americans, for African Americans. And it would give us a chance to get back a reasonable chance of prosperity for less fortunate Americans who've really been suffering over the past 50 years. And it's okay to say the economy was doing pretty well up until February, but people were dying in droves and there were 158,000 deaths of despair last year. That's not something that happens in a well-functioning economy. Thank you. </p><p>SCOTT: Thank you. </p><p>YARMUTH: (INAUDIBLE) Time has expired. I now recognize the ranking member-- </p><p>UNKNOWN: Thank you, Mr. chair. </p><p>YARMUTH: I now recognize the ranking member, Mr. Womack, for ten minutes. </p><p>WOMACK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to all of our panelists today. Let me begin with part of my thesis. When I opened in my opening remarks in talking about deficits and debt and the need for certainty, the need for--I didn't talk necessarily about budget reform, but the chairman and I have a long history on promoting some kind of reform so that we can get to the business of doing the people's work without CRs, omnibus packages and those kinds, and I've just kind of put all that in the category of bringing certainty to the governmental process.  </p><p>But in--in my thesis, I talk about the pressure that deficit and debt and--and in particular the net interest on the debt, which is rising exponentially and the impact it's going to have on programs that benefit largely the vulnerable population and whether it's in the minority communities or vulnerable seniors or this sort of thing. So here's my question for each of the four panelists and be very brief in your response, because I don't have a lot of time and I'm--and I hope not to use all of my time, but we'll start with Mr. Deaton. </p><p>Does deficit and debt matter? And is it a concern of yours? Because we've had a lot of proposals thrown out in this last couple of hours. All of them have a price tag to them. Do deficits and debt matter? And--and if so, when should we be serious about it? </p><p>DEATON: I think deficits and debts do matter. They matter in a somewhat complicated way, and it's a very lively topic of discussion among my colleagues. But let me go back to something I said a minute or two ago. Before COVID came, COVID is a whole special case because we've never had budget deficits. We've never a pandemic like this before.  </p><p>Before COVID, all the red ink added into the future is driven by the high costs of medical care. If we can bring that under control, then we wouldn't have this problem. So, this problem is important. And that's the key to getting it under control.  </p><p>WOMACK: Dr. Jones. </p><p>JONES: Yeah, I would say that definite--it is important to think about deficits and debt. I don't think now is the time to place the most weight on that. I think we are in an emergency situation. We're in a crisis, and that is the time where you draw into the deep pockets of the federal government to bail people out because there are people in deep need and they're in need of relief.  </p><p>I think that if interest rates were rising or we thought that there was not enough capital flowing around for people to borrow, then you may think more about these things. But I don't think that that's the case right now. </p><p>WOMACK: Dr. Harris. </p><p>HARRIS: (INAUDIBLE) feel qualified to talk about deficits and--and debt, but I--but I do want you to know that as physicians in the physician community, we do think that we need to continue to have fair minded debates around the cost of health care, the value of health care and health care financing. So, I can commit that we'll be a part of that conversation and I'll leave it to the economists for the deficit and the debt. </p><p>WOMACK: Okay. So, Dr. Roy, as you get ready to answer the question and I'm--I'm--I'm paging through some of your testimony, but you said early on, if I can--and I may not be able to find it. But you said--you--you made a case early on in your testimony, in your opening remarks about the impact of deficits and debt and the pressure it's going to have on all of the programs, particularly the social safety net programs. But in addition to a lot of other programs that affect specific communities that we're talking about here today. So, I'm assuming that you believe that deficits and debt do matter. </p><p>AKIV ROY: Absolutely. I completely agree with what you were describing earlier about how a fiscal reckoning will particularly harm economically vulnerable populations. And I do describe that in my testimony.  </p><p>One thing I'd mention is that we've actually put out a comprehensive plan called Medicare Advantage for All that involves universal private insurance like that in Medicare Advantage for everyone. And there's actually a bill that's been introduced in Congress by one of your colleagues from Arkansas, Bruce Westerman, that's based on--on that bill. And one thing I should mention that we talk about extensively in that report is how to reduce the high cost of U.S. health care.  </p><p>One thing I should mention in--in this hearing, in particular, is the fact that one of the ways--the way in which Medicare pays physicians for their care and the prices that Medicare pays for that care are determined by physicians. There's a secret committee of specialty societies called the--the RUC Committee that basically determines what prices the taxpayer pay through Medicare for those services. That's one of the most egregious examples of conflict of interest in the federal budget. It's something that I hope Congress can revisit as it tries to find ways to reduce the high cost of health care. </p><p>WOMACK: Well, and back to your testimony. I--see, I subscribe to the notion that deficits and debt do matter because eventually we're going to become a credit risk. And when you become a credit risk, you're going to be paying more in interest for the people that are buying your paper. And if that's the case, then the more interest you pay--and let's face it, 20--I don't know what the--the deficit or the debt is today.  </p><p>I know the deficit we're going to rack up is somewhere in the vicinity of $4 trillion, but the--the--the net interest on the debt that we're going to pay for--and I'm an appropriator, too, so I can speak to this, is going to put a lot more pressure on our ability to fund a lot of the things that most of the panelists, all of the panelists, my colleagues on this panel believe are important to our country on the discretionary side. It's going to put an enormous amount of pressure on it. We're going to pay more in net interest. And I believe that eventually net interest on the debt is probably going to exceed what we spend on national security, which would be unheard of, in my opinion.  </p><p>So, I--I subscribe to the notion that deficits and debt do matter. And we've got to be careful when throwing around a whole lot of other programs that are going to cost an extraordinarily amount of money, not necessarily intent on raising the revenue that--that would need to go to support it.  </p><p>I said in my opening statement that before COVID, this country was clicking along at a pretty good pace, and specifically to our minority communities, black, Hispanic, Asian unemployment, 5.4, 3.9, 2.1 percent, respectively. Now they've gone higher because of--of COVID. It makes sense to me, Dr. Roy, that when we climb out of this COVID hole, that we need to go back to the policies that had us on track and had historic lows of unemployment and economic prosperity before COVID hit. Would you agree? </p><p>AKIV ROY: Well, there's--there's no doubt that it--the quicker we can get back to that policy mix, that would be great. I'm very concerned that we won't. And I'm very concerned that Congress is on the verge of making it worse, because if Congress gives states a powerful incentive to stay locked down than that is going to continue to retard the recovery, retard the ability of those lower income, economically vulnerable populations to get back to work. </p><p>WOMACK: In my remaining time, one of the--one of the things that an emergency like COVID forces a country to do is to become less dependent on the way we've always done things and start looking for innovative ways. And so, in the area, particularly of health care and education, we've had to rely a lot more on what we're all doing on--on computers, kind of like what we're doing here today.  </p><p>And--and so I would assume I would get an affirmative response from every single one of you that in a future infrastructure package, the ability for this country to get rural broadband, and--and maybe I--I shouldn't just say rural broadband. I think one of you said earlier, even on the inner city, we have--we have some connectivity issues. But this country does have the capacity to become very innovative in the way we teach, in the way we do research and in the way we do, particularly telemedicine using these devices that we're all on here today. Do you agree with that, Dr. Deaton? </p><p>DEATON: Yes, I do. I mean, I'm not sure I--I would--we would agree on all the details, but for sure, fast Internet access for everybody is incredibly important. And then we can let us grow from there and take advantage of this. </p><p>WOMACK: Dr. Jones--Dr. Jones, would you not agree that one of the things that we could be doing to boost the opportunities for particularly--for everybody, but particularly the minority community, is get Chromebooks or--or iPads or the connective devices attached to the worldwide web for the express purpose of helping educate and better treat people with other under--underlying medical conditions? Would you not agree that broadband is important? </p><p>JONES: I would agree that it's important, especially now when we need to be socially distant and we need to replace our usual interactions with Internet access. That access is uneven for a number of reasons and making broadband widely available would be. </p><p>WOMACK: Dr. Harris, from the AMA perspective, obviously we've come a long way with telehealth and probably could go a lot further, could we not? </p><p>HARRIS: Absolutely. And broadband is critical and so is innovation. </p><p>WOMACK: Dr. Roy.  </p><p>AKIV ROY: Agreed. </p><p>WOMACK: All right. Chairman Yarmuth, I'm going to yield back. It looks like I'm down to zero.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>So, I have nothing to yield back to my friend from the Commonwealth. Thanks to all of you. Appreciate it. Thank you so much. </p><p>YARMUTH: I--I think the Ranking Member.  </p><p>Before I get into my questioning, I ask unanimous consent to submit statements from America's Essential Hospitals and the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids into the record.  </p><p>Without objection. So ordered.  </p><p>I now yield myself 10 minutes.  </p><p>First of all, let me once again thank all of our panel. Your responses have been very helpful and--and insightful, and--and your prepared statements as well. I enjoyed reading all of them, and there was a lot of really, really good food for thought in all of--all of the statements.  </p><p>One of the things that I've been doing a lot of recently, and I think probably most people who are in--in this hearing have, is what happens after we get through this current challenge, what happens when we're on a more stable economic footing and what happens once we can at least control the coronavirus? And it seems to me that there are a couple of things that we probably have learned or are learning, and one of those is that there are a lot of jobs in this economy that nobody really gave much thinking to, but now have become pretty important jobs.  </p><p>And I was on a phone call several weeks ago with a group of union members and friends indeed, and I really appreciate your discussion of unions in--in your testimony, and the importance of--of revitalizing unions. But anyway, there was a guy on the phone called named Greg, and I don't know whether Greg was black or white, but Greg is a--a maintenance worker in one of the public high schools in my district. And it occurred to me that six months ago, there was not a person in the country who would have given any thought to Greg.  </p><p>But now, as we start thinking about sending our kids back to school and worrying about their safety, all of a sudden Greg is a very important person. As are the people who stocked the grocery shelves and the people who drive the buses, and a lot of people who have never really been valued and compensated as commensurate with the role that they play.  </p><p>And so it occurs to me that one of the things that's going to happen as again, as--as again, as we get through this and we--we know particularly if there's a Democratic Senate and a Democratic president after this next election, that there's going to be a serious conversation about universal basic income. There is going to be a very serious conversation, as has been mentioned here before, about reparations. There are going to be very serious discussions about Medicare for All or some kind of single payer system. And there--these--all of these programs absolutely do come with a cost.  </p><p>On the other hand, as I think we all recognize and I'm getting to a question for you, Professor Deaton, is that--when programs by themselves are not going to end systemic racism and get federal government, no matter what we do, is never going to end that. It's--it's a responsibility of the entire society. Corporate America has a role and so forth.  </p><p>But the idea that the only way to--the primary way to address the systemic racism and inequities in the country is to create a stronger economy that--where the ships all rise, seems to me to be--to defy history. We basically relied on that theory for a long time, and it's not really helped. Could you elaborate? Could you comment on--on that, Professor? </p><p>DEATON: I'd love to. Thank you very much, Chairman.  </p><p>It's certainly true that growth is good. I mean, we would all like more economic growth than much growth. And when growth is high, there's--there's--you can give someone to everyone--something for everybody, and it's much easier to deal with social conflict. I think those days have, by in large, gone. And while there's been a lot of growth in the American economy over the last 30 years, it's not equally distributed.  </p><p>And I don't really care that much about inequalities. I'm saying a horrible thing here. But what I really care about is the people--the large number of people who are being left behind by this economic growth. And this economic growth is going to the top. It's not going to the bottom whether you're talking about African Americans or you're talking about less educated whites.  </p><p>And, you know, for a long time, people are saying, well, the numbers aren't really right. People are getting a lot more economic growth than the government is measuring, and you should use these measures rather than these other measures. But, you know, that's not really right. And when you see people actually destroying themselves in huge numbers, 158,000 people who've destroyed themselves through drug addiction, through suicide, we're the only rich country in the world whose suicide rates are actually rising.  </p><p>Everybody else in the world--and all those people who are killing themselves or doing away with themselves are the less educated Americans. And it's true that their wages were rising up in February. Their unemployment was lowest rated had been for a very long time. But they're still worse off than any time they were in the 1980s. And this economy is just not delivering for them. I mean, it may be rising, but it's only raising about (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>And it's very hard for me to see how anyone with a serious straight face can continued to talk about trickle down and how if the economy goes up, everyone goes with it. The factual record is just hundred percent against that. Thank you. </p><p>YARMUTH: And It seems like we also have a very recent experience with--kind of the systemic disadvantages that--that blacks are--face in this country when the PPP program came out in CARES, and one of the first things that we realized after--and it got off to a rocky start, but that was understandable. We--we--we didn't have agencies that were prepared to deal with millions of applications.  </p><p>But one thing we found out was none of this money was going to black entrepreneurs, black business owners, very little of it, and partially because they didn't have banking relationships significant enough to get help. They didn't have--opportunity to go out and get legal counsel to help them navigate through it. And so, we actually set aside some more money in the HEROES Act to go specifically to black and women owned and minority owned businesses.  </p><p>But to me, that seems to me one of the big arguments against--relying on economy wide initiatives to actually attack the inequities, because there are--there are these fundamental disadvantages that many people in--in the country, largely--and most--many of them are black, face in trying to even deal with the systems that we set up that might help them if we can--if they had access to them.  </p><p>One of the things I want to talk about briefly, and I hate to get into healthcare debates, because you can talk about it forever. But Mr. Roy talked about Medicare for All that was--that was trans--transferable and encourage mobility. And--and one of the things that occurs to me is that employer based insurance, and we are the only country in the world that has that, the only industrialized nation that has employer based insurance, also exacerbates the--the--the disparities because you have so many people in the category--in black America and poor whites, and so forth who are working in jobs where there is no coverage through their employer, or they're going to be the first ones that are going to be let go and lose their coverage, or the coverage is so expensive that they get no growth in their--in their wages. I would--would love to see, Dr.--Dr. Harris, Dr. Jones, if--how do you think about--if you see that as a huge problem, this--the idea that employer based insurance has a problem with exacerbating in--inequities? </p><p>JONES: Yeah, maybe if I can comment first. I would just say a couple of things on that. I think that right now, as we're going into a recession, we're seeing that there's a huge cost to having your insurance tied with your employer. There are a lot of people who are losing their job. And that's going to provide--that's going to create a break in the continuity of their care and their access to health care. </p><p>I also think that the--the other thing is that when I talked about the labor market and workers bargaining power and a lot--a lot of what you're seeing in terms of workers not being covered by health insurance is related to their inability to have collective bargaining and to--to command better compensation and benefit packages from their employers. So, in the meantime, I think that increasing the ability for people to collectively bargain is going to allow them to have higher quality jobs and compensation packages. </p><p>YARMUTH: Good. I appreciate that. I apologize, I attributed the union comments to Professor Deaton. They were--they were yours in your testimony.  </p><p>Well, my time's running out, so I--I just want to close and say I think Fed Chair Jay Powell had it--said it best when he acknowledged that those least able to withstand the downturn have been affected the most. And the impact of this virus on the health and economic security of the American people has been brutal and it's hit black and Latino families particularly hard. And we can't move forward with a full recovery without addressing the underlying racial inequality--inequities in our system.  </p><p>I think we do have the fiscal space right now, and I--I believe the public will to make those systemic and long overdue changes. We have some bold policies that are ready to go like the HEROES Act and the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act that we'll vote on later this week. And if we're going to reunite this country and come out on the other side of this crisis as a better nation, Congress must ensure that our recovery efforts include proactive policies to spur not only an inclusive recovery, but inclusive growth and opportunities for all. </p><p>And with that, I will thank the panel once again for your time and your--your insights and your expertise. And with--if there's no further business before the committee, this hearing is adjourned. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:606S-7VB1-JDPT-T4H0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Good afternoon, and welcome to the Budget Committee's Hearing on Machines, Artificial Intelligence, &amp; the Workforce: Recovering and Readying our Economy for the Future. Before we begin, I want to welcome the newest member of the Budget Committee, Chris Jacobs. Welcome, Chris. Before coming to Congress, Chris was a member of--was a New York State Senator and the committee is happy to have you here. Now, before I welcome our witnesses, I will go over a few housekeeping matters. At the outset, I ask unanimous consent that the chair be authorized to declare a recess at any time to address technical difficulties that may arise with such remote proceedings. Without objection, so ordered. </p><p>As a reminder, we are holding this hearing virtually in compliance with the regulations for committee proceedings pursuant to House Resolutions 965. First, consistent with regulations, the chair or staff designated by the chair, may mute participants' microphones when they are not under recognition for the purpose of eliminating inadvertent background noise. Members are responsible for unmuting themselves when they seek recognition or when they are recognized for their five minutes. We are not permitted to unmute members unless they explicitly request assistance. If I notice that you have not unmuted yourself, I will ask you if you would like staff to unmute you. If you indicate approval by nodding, staff will unmute your microphone. They will not unmute you under any other circumstances. </p><p>Second, members must have their cameras on throughout this proceeding and must be visible on screen in order to be recognized. As a reminder, members may not participate in more than one committee proceeding simultaneously.  Seeing--for those members not wanting to wear a mask, the House rules provide a way to participate remotely from your office without being physically present in the hearing room.  Now, I will introduce our witnesses. This afternoon, we'll be hearing from Dr. Susan Athey, economics of technology professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business and associate director at the Stanford Institute for Human-Center Artificial Intelligence. </p><p>Dr. Daron Acemoglu, institute professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dr. Darrell West, vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. And Dr. Jason Matheny, director for the Center for Security and Emerging Technology at Georgetown University and commissioner for the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, who, I might add, has just informed he is from Louisville, Kentucky. So, we're especially glad to have him here with us. </p><p>Thank you all for being with us today. </p><p>I will now yield myself five minutes for an opening statement. </p><p>This year, Labor Day felt different than previous years. While most of us still honored our workers and celebrated their vital contributions to our nation, especially our frontline workers, we also recognize the hardships faced by millions of laid-off Americans and their families, struggling to get by amid a global pandemic--pandemic and the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Yet these twin crises have amplified problems that existed long before the coronavirus: devastating health care inequities, the loss of stable, well-paying jobs, and stagnating wages. While our economy has slowed, exacerbating these underlying issues, technological change has marched on, creating even more challenges. </p><p>As we look to the future, artificial intelligence, or AI, has significant potential to disrupt the world. It presents opportunities to improve lives, livelihoods, productivity, and equality. However, it also poses serious risks of large-scale economic changes. Today's hearing--hearing will help us ground our thinking in facts and better prepare for this impending economic transition. Like the arrival of the steam engine, electricity, and computers, AI will reshape a broad swath of industries and jobs. However, history shows us that while technological advancements can create new jobs and increase productivity and growth, these benefits have been paired with the elimination of old jobs and increased inequality as some workers are left behind.  </p><p>Today we are losing jobs because of the administration's failed response to the pandemic and economic crisis. But, as the economy eventually recovers, workers may find it difficult to get their job back as companies replace jobs with new AI-enabled automation.  So, while advancements in AI technologies could create more opportunities for workers with advanced education or specialized skills, workers without these skills could see fewer opportunities in the near future. And it's low and middle-wage jobs that are most at risk. </p><p>Since the mid-1980s, but prior to the pandemic, 88 percent of mid--of middle-skill job losses, associated with the automation of routine tasks, took place within 12 months of a recession. Absent concerted efforts to foster an inclusive recovery, AI and automation could exacerbate income inequality, widen racial and gender in--in--and gender income gaps, and push more people into poverty when we eventually emerge from this recession.  There is already a large and persistent racial wealth gap in America, and, since black and Latino Americans are overrepresented in occupations at high risk for automation, they are disproportionately at risk of job and wage losses.  Additionally, there are 40 percent more women than men who work in occupations at high risk for automation. The Organ--Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that AI and automation could eliminate upwards of 14 percent of today's jobs and disrupt an additional 32 percent. </p><p>Current AI technologies have also raised concerns around replicating human biases and discrimination in algorithms. Given the range of AI applications emerging in employment, housing, health care, financial services, and criminal justice, improved transparency and oversight are needed to ensure AI tools do not replicate or expand discriminatory practices. Just like previous technological breakthroughs, AI will broadly impact the federal budget. Along with IT modernization, AI can directly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government operations, leading to savings.  With the industry set to generate additional economic activity of up to $13 trillion worldwide by 2030, federal R&amp;D investments will remain essential to U.S. leadership and competitiveness in AI technology. However, the benefits will only be available to all Americans if paired with strategic investments to support our workforce--force through this impending evolution. </p><p>The pandemic and economic crisis have already shown that income security and related programs are crucial for supporting Americans during challenging times. The shifting job landscape expected with widespread AI implementation further demonstrate this need. This will require strong federal investments in social programs, in affordable health care, childcare, and housing, as well as new approaches for retraining and--and up--upskilling our workforce. IBM estimates that between 2019 and 2022, more than 120 million workers in the world's 12 largest economies may need to be retrained and reskilled as a result of AI-enabled automation. </p><p>If we fail to plan ahead, the underlying problems illuminated by the pandemic and recession will continue to create barriers to success for American workers. We have a responsibility to get Americans through the COVID crisis, but we also must address the long-term economic challenges we know are coming. These issues are complicated and nuanced, but that's why we are here today. With the help of our expert witnesses, we can begin to chart a path forward that leads to inclusive economic growth, broad social benefits, and a better-prepared workforce. I look forward to learning more about the magnitude of the potential changes to our economy and job market, and the federal policies that will be needed in response. </p><p>I now yield five minutes to the ranking member, Mr. Womack, of Arkansas. </p><p>WOMACK: And I thank the chairman for holding this hearing and my thanks to the witnesses who will be with us today. </p><p>I'd like to also add my--a bit of welcome to Chris Jacobs, the newest member of the committee. Native of Buffalo, New York. Long history of public service; Erie County clerk, state senator, and now joining us as a member of Congress. This isn't his first tour of duty on--at--at the Capitol. He began his career working for former congressman and Buffalo Bill quarterback Jack Kemp. Chris, welcome to the Budget Committee. To your wife and daughter, Martina and Anna, thank you for allowing your husband and father to continue his public service career by spending time in Washington with all of us. </p><p>Chris, we welcome you to the committee. </p><p>We're here to talk about AI capabilities, both current and future, and the impacts on the economy and the federal budget. It's a critical technology, to be sure, that will benefit the lives of many Americans and touch nearly ever sector of the U.S. economy. While it will likely change the way many jobs are performed, as technological advances have for many decades, we must harness the capabilities of AI to help drive our economy and society forward. Congress has to ensure that its actions do not stifle innovation. Rather, government should work in partnership with the private sector to move our country forward in AI research and development. By making strategic federal investments in AI R&amp;D, Washington can help unleash America's pioneering and entrepreneurial spirit. It also means creating a regulatory environment that supports, not hinders, private industry by allowing technological advancements to flourish in a safe, trustworthy, and effective way. </p><p>Congress should also move to encourage more American high-tech manufacturing in general. The U.S. currently relies on countries located in geopolitical hotspots for many critical components. And as the coronavirus pandemic has shown with medical supplies, we need to ensure we have reliable, secure, and diverse supply chains for vital materials. Now, while this is an interesting and important topic, it should not be the reason why the budget committee is convening this afternoon, in my strong opinion. The dire fiscal outlook, notably the recent deficit and debt projections, and a discussion on how to tackle these challenges should be the focus of today's committee meeting. Last week, the Congressional Budget Office released its budget outlook update, and, let me tell you, the findings are incredibly sobering but not surprising. </p><p>We did not do our job when this pandemic--before the pandemic hit. This committee is charged with writing a budget to put our country on a responsible fiscal path, but we failed in that duty. Once COVID hit, we were obligated to respond to the crisis. For those of you who don't know, let me summarize where our nation stands fiscally. And let me just warn you, it isn't good. The deficit for Fiscal '20 is projected to be $3.3 trillion, more than triple the previous year's deficit and by far the highest in American history. Every single year, for the next 10 years, CBO is projecting that annual deficits will exceed a trillion dollars and total $13 trillion over this period. </p><p>The public debt is projected to be larger than the size of the entire economy by next year. It is 104 percent of GDP, and will continue to increase to more than $33 trillion by Fiscal 2030. That's 109 percent of projected GDP. Once again, CBO confirmed the driver of the fiscal problem: federal spending, particularly mandatory spending. Mandatory spending, including interest payments on the debt, is expected to account for 75 percent of total federal spending by 2030. And I don't need to be the guy to tell you, you already know, that's squeezing resources for many discretionary priorities. The job of this committee is to write a budget resolution that sets a fiscal path for the government to follow. We didn't write one; we don't have one. Instead of considering a budget resolution, we're talking about artificial intelligence, which, as I mentioned before, while an interesting topic and an important topic, it's not the mandate of this committee. </p><p>The democrat majority has neglected to do a budget resolution for the past two years. CBO's projections illustrate the necessity for the democrat majority to do its job: write and pass a budget resolution that provides a responsible fiscal framework to correct this current fiscal trajectory. With that, I look forward to hearing from our witnesses, and always look forward to the discussion. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll yield back the balance of my time. </p><p>And you'll need to unmute, I think. </p><p>YARMUTH: Thank you. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Should be up to that by now. In the interest of time, once again, if any member has--additional member has an opening statement, you may submit those statements electronically to the clerk for the record. </p><p>Once again, I want to thank our witnesses for being here this afternoon. The committee has received your written statements and they will be made a part of the formal hearing record. </p><p>Each of you will have five minutes to give your oral remarks. As a reminder, please unmute your microphone before speaking. </p><p>I now introduce and yield five minutes to Dr. Susan Athey. Please unmute your mic and begin when you are ready. </p><p>ATHEY: Hello, Chairman Yarmuth, Ranking Member Womack, and members of the committee. Thank you so much for inviting me to speak today. </p><p>Artificial intelligence seems to inspire extreme views. Some focus on a future where robots take all the jobs, while others point out that so far its effects on the economy are barely detectable. My own view is that AI has enormous positive potential for society and for the efficiency and finances of government. And that governments and universities have a crucial role to play in ensuring that the potential is realized. </p><p>AI, of course, also creates challenges, contributing to an era where workers transition more frequently and require more reskilling throughout their careers. So, we need to ensure that our institutions are prepared to meet this reality, especially in light of the many fiscal and labor market challenges created by an aging population and workforce. But, when R&amp;D is directed at technology that augments human workers and supports citizens and their lives and health, we may be able to expand the circumstances in which people engage in rewarding work, while experiencing a high quality of life in areas with a more moderate cost of living. Some of the most promising areas where technology can be part of the solution include education, training, remote work, medicine, and government services. In each case, digital technology and--powered by AI can be used to make services cheaper to provide, higher quality, more tailored to the individual need, and substantially more accessible and convenient. </p><p>The accessibility matters particularly to people with limited time, like working people with caregiving responsibilities and especially rural residents who face the dual burden of high transportation cost and insufficient density to support specialized services and job opportunities in their local communities. One reason the potential is so great for these problems is that digitization and the adoption of AI can lead to low marginal cost scalable and thus more efficient services. Digitization and AI are inextricably linked to measurement and optimization, which naturally improves the accountability and effectiveness of the organizations who adopt them, including the government.  In addition, general trends that have led to the rapid diffusion of AI relate to the lowered fix cost and time required to adopt it. One trend is just a digitization of everything, from consumer interactions to supply chains. That creation of data is what powers and makes possible AI to be an optimization. </p><p>The way IT is implemented has also changed. Cloud computing allows companies to rank computing as they need it, rather than buy, allowing infrastructure to be shared across firms and that reduces cost. Software as a service lets companies subscribe to services and purchase the best products use case by use case. And that software as a service then can also make available AI and machine learning innovation without firms having to do that R&amp;D themselves. </p><p>Finally, we've seen a big expansion of open source software. And in general, data management analytics tools are widely available. They're shared across firms and across academia and thus diffused very quickly. </p><p>The latest machine learning algorithms are typically free. For example, for my class, we use algorithms that we downloaded that were trained using Facebook's image data setting computing infrastructure, allowing the students to move on to the analytics on top of the image recognition. It's custom--it's--the reason that firms are willing to share those types of--of algorithms is that it's customer relationships and data as well as know-how to optimize the algorithms at large scale that give companies their competitive advantage. And the general purpose technologies and algorithms have actually been--been barely widely available. That means the cost of developing services to reduce as these general purpose innovations from academia and--and for-profit organizations can be repurposed by entrepreneurs, governments, and social impact organizations. </p><p>Now, an important pre-cursor to a policy discussion is demystifying the technology. In practice rather than sort of general intelligence, most of what we've seen in the past 15 years can be thought of as more automation on steroids. For software, automation is, like, following pre-specified rules without real-time human direction. But, the latest innovations have concerned implementing automation using decision rules that are learned from past data using machine learning. </p><p>In a common example of machine learning, an algorithm might take the input to digital photo, an output a guess of what animal's in the photo. Traditionally, analysts had to do a lot of manual work to customize these statistical models. The models were simplified. But, modern machine learning allows the analyst to just feed in raw data and the algorithm does a lot of work to determine what's important for the task. This makes things general purpose, but the fact that they're general purpose also means they're black box and sometimes even the engineers building them don't understand them. Thus, we need a lot more research to invest practices to make sure that this technology is implemented safely and without unintended consequences. </p><p>Just to--to close, machine learning is diffusing across the economy use case by use case, but in most case, this has led to an incremental--innovation and incremental changes over time rather than sudden shifts. </p><p>So, I look forward to continuing the discussion in the question and answer. Thank you. </p><p>YARMUTH: Thank you for your testimony. I now recognize Dr. Acemoglu for five minutes. Please unmute and the floor is yours. </p><p>ACEMOGLU: Chairman Yarmuth, Ranking Member Womack, and members of the committee, thank you for inviting me to testify on this important subject.  </p><p>The U.S. economy today and U.S. workers are suffering from what I view as excessive automation. The extent of automation is excessive in that it is not leading to sufficient productivity growth, creating new tasks for humans, or increasing wages.  Automation, the substitution of machines and algorithms for tasks previously performed by labor, is nothing new. It has often been an engine of economic growth but in the past, for example, during the year of the mechanism of agriculture, it was part of a broad technology portfolio and its potentially negative effects on labor were counter-balanced by other technologies. Not today. </p><p>Recent advances in AI and machine learning are not responsible for these trends. In fact, AI, as a broad technological platform with great promise, can be used for helping human productivity and creating new human tasks. But, it could exacerbate the same trends if we use it just for automation.  The COVID-19 pandemic will also contribute to this predicament as there are now more reasons for employers to look for ways of substituting machines for workers, and recent evidence suggests that they are already doing so. </p><p>Excessive automation has already been a major drag for the U.S. economy. Private sector spending on workers, which increased steadily and rapidly almost every year in the four decades following World War II, has been essentially stagnant over the last 20 years. The decline in the share of labor and national income, the stag--stagnation of middle class wages and the huge increase in inequality are all connected to our recent unbalanced technology portfolio, prioritizing automation and not much else. Excessive automation is not an inexorable development. It is a result of choices, and we can make different choices. While there is no consensus on exactly what brought us to this state, we know the number of factors that have encouraged greater automation. Chief among these has been the transformation in the technology strategies of leading companies. </p><p>American and world technology is shaped by the decisions of a handful of very large and very successful tech companies, with tiny workforces, and business models centered on the substitution of algorithms for humans. There is, of course, nothing wrong with successful companies pushing their vision, but when this becomes the only game in town, we have to watch out for. Past technological successes have often been fueled by a diversity of perspectives and approaches. The dominance of the paradigm of a handful of companies has been exacerbated by the dwindling support of the U.S. government for fundamental research. The transformative technologies of the 20th century, such as antibiotics, sensors, modern engines, and the internet have the fingerprints of the government all over them. The government funded and purchased these technologies and often set the agenda, but no longer. </p><p>Last, but not least, government policy is encouraging automation excessively through its tax code. The U.S. tax system has always treated capital more favorably than labor. My own research estimates that over the last 40 years, via payroll and federal income taxes, labor has paid an effective tax rate of over 25 percent. Even 20 years ago, capital was taxed more lightly, with equipment and software facing tax rates around 15 percent. This differential has significantly widened with tax cuts on high incomes, the shift of many businesses to S Corporation status that are exempt from corporate income taxes, and very generous depreciation allowances. Software and equipment are now taxed at about 5 percent. And in some cases, corporations can get a net subsidy when they invest in capital. This generates a powerful motive for excessive automation. </p><p>One result of this has been the disappearance of good jobs, especially for workers without post-graduate degrees or very specialized skills. The only way to alter this technology is to redirect technological change. That will require changes in federal policy. A first step would be to correct the asymmetric taxation of treatment--asymmetric taxation of capital and labor. This would go a long way but is not sufficient by itself. A second step is to reevaluate the role of big tech companies in our lives, including in the direction of technology. This, of course, goes beyond debates about automation and AI, as it relates to the issue of limiting the size and the dominance of big tech. </p><p>These measures can be strengthened with government R&amp;D policies specifically targeting technologies that help human productivity and increase labor demand. Research policies that target specific classes of technologies are rightly controversial. They may be particularly challenging in the context of choosing between automation and human-friendly technologies, since identifying these is nontrivial. Nevertheless, I would like to end my comments by emphasizing that such policies have been adopted and have had successes in the past. Four decades ago, renewable energy was prohibitively expensive and the basic know-how for green technology was lacking. Today, renewables already make up 19 percent of energy consumption in Europe and 11 percent in the United States and have costs in the ballpark of fossil-fuel based energy. </p><p>This has been achieved thanks to a redirection of technological change away from a singular focus on fossil fuels towards greater efforts for advances in renewables. In the U.S., the primary driver of this redirection has been the government subsidies to green technologies, as well as the changing norms of consumers in society. The same can be done for the balance between automation and human-friendly technologies. </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>YARMUTH: Thank you very much for your testimony. I now recognize Dr. West for five minutes. </p><p>WEST: Chairman Yarmuth, Ranking Member Womack, and members of the committee, thanks for the opportunity to testify. </p><p>I am co-author with Brookings president John Allen of a new AI booked entitled, Turning Point: Policymaking in the Era of Artificial Intelligence and I also am the co-editor of the Brookings Technology policy blog TechTank and co-producer of the TechTank Podcast.  In my testimony, I'm going to argue that artificial intelligence is one of the transformative technologies of our time and likely to have major ramifications for the workforce. AI is being deployed in a number of different sectors and its usage will accelerate in coming years. Its development is going to necessitate rethinking our policies in the areas of budgeting, infrastructure, healthcare, education, workforce development, and economic development. </p><p>As AI and other emerging technologies become widely deployed, there are several possible ramifications for the workforce: job loss, job dislocation, job redefinition, job mismatch, and job churn. For example, there can be job losses in entry-level positions as firms automate routine tasks. There can be geographical dislocations as positions migrate to urban population centers and there can be job churn as people move from company to company. In an economy where benefits are tied to full-time employment, any increase in job churn will create instability in people's ability to maintain income and benefits. Most of the issues noted above have grown worse with the advent of COVID-19. The pandemic has revealed stark inequities in access to online education, telemedicine, and opportunities for remote work. As an illustration, African Americans are far less likely than whites to access online educational resources, but far more likely to suffer from the coronavirus. </p><p>It's hard to estimate the precise impact of technology innovation on the federal budget because there are so many ramifications for government revenues and expenses. But one thing that appears clear is we're going to need greater investment by both the private and the public sectors. One area is digital infrastructure.  Right now, there are around 18 million Americans who lack sufficient access to the internet. You need an online connection to apply for many jobs. A number of people do not have the connectivity required for online education, telemedicine, and remote work. So, it's vital that we close that gap so that all can benefit from the digital economy. The emerging economy presents challenges with respect to ensuring health and retirement benefits. Any increases in unemployment or people having part-time jobs will create some hardships. In today's digital world, workers need benefit portability to survive a turbulent working environment.  </p><p>Organizations need to shorten their vesting periods for people to become eligible for company retirement contributions. Right now, many organizations do not vest employees until they've worked at the firm for one or two years. And if there is increased joblessness, lengthy vesting periods will lead to shortfalls in retirement. The world of rapid change, it is imperative that people engage in lifelong learning. The traditional model, in which people focus their learning on the years before age 25 and then get a job and devote little attention to education thereafter, is becoming obsolete.  In the contemporary world, people can expect to see whole sectors disrupted and they will need to develop additional skills. The type of work that people do at age 30 is going to be very different from what they will be doing at ages 40, 50, and 60. </p><p>One possibility to encourage continuing education is through the establishment of lifelong learning accounts. They would be analogous to individual retirement accounts or state government run 529 college savings plans. But, the owner of the account could draw on that account to finance online learning, certificate programs, or job retraining expenses. As America deploys AI and moves to a digital economy, its two coasts have fared much better economically than the heartland. According to research by my Brookings colleague, senior fellow Mark Moro, only about 15 percent of American counties generate 64 percent of GDP. Far too many parts of the United States are being left behind. </p><p>One way to address this is through regional innovation districts. These are public-private partnerships that boost innovation in heartland cities. And the districts include regulatory relief, tax benefits, workforce development, and infrastructure. To summarize, it's crucial to think proactively as tech changes unfold. The longer we wait, the more painful the transition will be. Now is a time to start having the discussions required to make meaningful changes. And I applaud the committee for providing a platform for this important conversation.  </p><p>YARMUTH: And thank you, Dr. West, for your testimony. I now recognize Dr. Matheny from Louisville, Kentucky. </p><p>MATHENY: Thank you. </p><p>YARMUTH: You're recognized for five minutes. </p><p>MATHENY: Thank you, Chairman Yarmuth. Thank you, Ranking Member Womack, and members of the committee. And thanks also to my colleagues at the Center for Security and Emergency Technology at Georgetown whose research I'll be drawing from today. </p><p>AI is a general purpose technology with a broad range of applications in healthcare, agriculture, energy, transportation, national security, and scientific discovery. Advances in AI are likely to be applied across many sectors of the economy, spurring growth and enabling new technologies.  Policies to strengthen U.S. leadership in AI have enjoyed bipartisan support, at least during the decade that I've worked on the topic. I worked on AI strategies for both the current administration and the last administration, and there are more similarities than there are differences.  </p><p>Both administrations emphasized the points that I'll make here today, and each had a positive outlook on the potential for AI to improve American health and prosperity. As Michael Kratsios, the U.S. chief technology officer, recently said, our future rests on getting AI right. AI will support the jobs of the future. Jason Furman, the previous chair of the Council of Economic Advisors in the last administration, said that his biggest worry about AI is that we do not have enough of AI. So, while AI will cause changes to the labor market, this has been true of every technology since the Industrial Revolution, and this country has adapted. I believe we will adapt to AI and we'll be helped by more economic research on the likely effects of AI and automation on the labor force, and by benchmarking to assess progress in various applications of AI.  </p><p>The United States is in a strong position globally. By most measures, we lead the world in AI and our lead is key--is due to key structural advantages. We have an open society that attracts the world's top scientists and engineers. The National Science Foundation shows that over half of the master's and PhD-level computer scientists who are employed in the United States were born abroad. We have a--a competitive private sector that spurs innovation. And we maintain strong international partnerships. While the U.S. alone funds only 28 percent of global R&amp;D, with our allies we fund more than half. </p><p>We should double down on these strengths. We should ensure that we remain an attractive destination for global talent by broadening and accelerating the pathways to permanent residency for scientists and engineers. Most research suggests that increases in high-skilled immigration yield increases in jobs and wages for Americans, due to immigrants' contributions to economic growth and the creation of new companies. </p><p>We should also ensure that small and mid-sized businesses have access to the computing power needed for AI applications. We can leverage the purchasing power of the federal government to buy commercial cloud computing credits in the private market and award them through federal grants and contracts competitively, as the National Science Foundation has done through its CloudBank program.  </p><p>We should also strengthen our alliances and foster the responsible use of AI through organizations, such as the Global Partnership on AI, of which the United States is a founding member. China has made extraordinary technological progress in recent decades, and its future prospects should not be underestimated. But, U.S. policy should be based on an appreciation of the strengths that have driven our leadership in AI thus far, and how they can be leveraged in the future.  </p><p>While our private sector leads in AI, the federal government plays a key supporting role. Federal research funding laid the foundation for the current wave of AI progress. Federal funding should continue to focus on areas where the private sector is likely to underinvest. That includes basic research, safety and security, testing and evaluation, and verification and validation.  </p><p>The National Institute for Standards and Technology should be given the resources needed to lead interagency and public-private collaborations on AI testing and evaluation, including establishment of a national AI test bed, a digital platform containing public and non-public datasets, code, and testing environments on which AI systems from industry, academia, and the government can be developed, stored, and tested.  </p><p>Fourth and last, the United States should ensure that it has access to leading-edge microelectronics. This country is the birthplace of microelectronics, and we continue to design most of the world's leading-edge systems, but most devices are now manufactured elsewhere.  </p><p>Offshoring most of our semiconductor industry has increased the risk of supply chain disruptions during crises. The United States should strengthen U.S.-based semiconductor manufacturing to reduce supply chain risks and to increase the number of high-quality jobs at home.  </p><p>At the same time, we should work with our allies to ensure that democracies remain at the leading edge of microelectronics by investing in joint research programs and by enforcing multilateral export controls on the manufacturing equipment needed to produce advanced chips. The United States and our allies produce more than 90 percent of this equipment, so we are in a particularly strong position.  Legislation, such as the bipartisan proposals, or the CHIPS for America Act, and the American Foundries Act can help maintain that position. </p><p>With these four points on the benefits of AI as a general purpose technology, the sources of U.S. leadership in AI, the federal government's role in supporting the private sector, and the importance of microelectronics, I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak with you today. And I look forward to your questions. </p><p>YARMUTH: Thank you for your testimony. Once again, thanks to all the witnesses for those statements. We'll now begin our Q&amp;A session. </p><p>As a reminder, members can submit questions to be answered later in writing. Those questions and their responses will be made part of the formal hearing record. Any members who wish to submit questions for the record may do so by sending them to the clerk electronically within seven days. </p><p>As we usually do, the ranking member and I will hold our question periods until the end. So, I now yield five minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Boyle. </p><p>BOYLE: Thank you. I hope you can hear me okay, Mr. Chairman. All right. </p><p>YARMUTH: Yes. </p><p>BOYLE: Thank you. So, whoever said this in the very beginning was--was right. The no topic perhaps more, while exciting some people, I would say, inspires more fear, consternation/paranoia than--than AI.  </p><p>One of--so, all of the presentations were--were very interesting. I want to go back, though, to a point that was made very early on by one of the witnesses. Because something that I learned, certainly today if you look at our tax code, we treat capital and labor very differently and certainly make it much more attractive for capital versus labor. I didn't realize that that has not just been a recent tendency, which was always my impression, but one of the witnesses stated that that goes back a ways. So, I was wondering what any of the witnesses would think about constructive ways that we could bring a quality to our tax code, ideas like treating capital gains as ordinary income. There's a discussion right now obviously, perhaps started unintentionally by the president in terms of the--the use of the payroll tax for funding social security and--and Medicare. </p><p>I--I'm curious about these ideas because as my line of question probably suggests, I'm certainly one who things that at the very least labor and capital should be treated equally in our tax code and we shouldn't have our thumb on the scale, which, in my view, we heavily do in treating capital more favorably. And thus, making it actually more attractive for companies to replace the McDonald's worker with the touchscreen that--that I now use. I'm advertising my bad eating habits, but now, we have at so many of our fast-food restaurants. </p><p>So, I'll open that up to any of--of the witnesses and certainly any ideas for proposals you would have and if you agree with--with my view that capital and labor should be treated more equally in our tax code. </p><p>YARMUTH: Who wants to take that? Dr. Acemoglu. Unmute, please. </p><p>ACEMOGLU: Okay. Yes. Somehow, I was muting and unmuting and muting myself at the same time. Thanks for that question.  </p><p>Yes, I was the one who talked about the taxation of capital and labor and it's a complex topic. Economists actually differ, in all full disclosure. There are some economists who passionately think that capital should be taxed very--at the very low rate or not at all.  But--but--but, I think in--in the age of automation, the asymmetric treatment of capital and labor in the tax code has a lot of costs. If you live in a world where every piece of capital needs to be combined with some human operator, there are still problems with asymmetric treatment of capital and labor, certainly distributional consequences. But, there is a better case that increase demand for capital equipment is going to trickle down to workers. But, during our current year, our automation is so prevalent from the McDonald's checkout kiosks to customer service to machinery, numerically controlled machinery, robots and algorithms everywhere, I think the asymmetric treatment of capital and labor does create more severe problems. </p><p>Now, if that wanted to be reversed--for example, going back to the--to the--to the 1980s or the 1990s when capital and labor were still treated asymmetrically but the gap was smaller, you know, a couple of items would help a lot. For example, reversing the very generous depreciation allowances, which were often introduced during recessionary times as temporary measures and then weren't completely reversed later, that would be a very major step. </p><p>Then, there is also the issue of, you know, why we have corporations that choose their own tax status, S Corporations versus C Corporations, and that has changed a lot over recent decades. And often, that's a way of reducing the tax base for capital through some sort of tax arbitrage and I think that's something that needs to be thought through, especially since Ranking Member Womack said this committee is going to look for ways of increasing tax revenues. And exactly like you have expressed, Representative Boyle, one has to also consider the taxation of capital gains and--and--and other items. </p><p>If you wanted to go on the other side, there have been--there has been a long line of argument in economics going back several decades that payroll taxes are particularly problematic. And in the United States, that's actually a very important part of the taxes that labor faces. But, of course, I recognize that right now, with the budget deficient, makes more sense to think of, you know, creating that symmetry by increasing the taxation of capital, especially broadening the tax base for capital rather than eliminating taxes, but certainly payroll taxes are something to think about in the future as well. Thank you. </p><p>YARMUTH: All right. Gentleman's time is expired. I now recognize the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Woodall, for five minutes. Is Mr. Woodall on? Unmute if you're on. Not answering. </p><p>Well, then, I will recognize the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Johnson, for five minutes. </p><p>JOHNSON: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I appreciate you holding this hearing today. And--and many thanks to our witnesses, too. I'm in my car. So, I apologize if--if things are jumping around. </p><p>But, I'm an IT guy. I was in undergraduate and graduate school in the late '70s, early '80s when AI first came on the horizon. And--and today, there is no doubt, we all know it, technology spans every sector of our economy.  Investments and emerging technology, such as AI, blockchain, and the internet of things have the exciting potential to drastically improve our economy, national security, and our very way of life through greater efficiency, increased global competitiveness, and creating countless other applications. </p><p>In addition to domestic uses for AI, the Department of Defense has been developing and utilizing AI applications for a range of military capabilities, including intelligence collection and analysis, cyber and information operations, logistics, command and control, and also for semi or fully autonomous vehicles. But, we all know, the United States is not the only country developing AI capabilities. China, in particular, is investing billions in AI. The--it's imperative to our national security that the United States continues to be the leader in developing AI and other emerging technologies. </p><p>However, China resorts to stealing innovation or subsidizing state-owned enterprises. This is not the role of America's federal government, nor should it be, given the innovative spirit of the American people and the exciting advances in technology already occurring right here at home. Rather, it's imperative that our federal government enable the private sector to flourish by removing barriers to innovation, something that President Trump and his administration has taken important steps to do so. And--and supporting private sector research and development, collaboratively, through strategic federal investments and agencies, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology. </p><p>So, I'm very pleased to have introduced H.R. 6940, the Advancing Tech Startups Act, which is part of a larger public energy tech agenda to create policies that foster American innovation, secure our supply chains, and protect American consumers. Specifically, my legislation promotes a national strategy for encouraging more tech-focused startups and small businesses in all parts of the United States. It's vital to our national security to reduce our alliance on other countries, such as China.  And as I've stated, we don't need to rely on any other country. We should, once again, tap into American ingenuity and unleash the American innovation and entrepreneurship that we're famous for. </p><p>So, Dr. Matheny, some suggest that the United States may be at risk of falling behind in AI development. For example, some experts predict China could in the near future surpass (AUDIO GAP) and take the lead in AI development.  In your opinion, where does the U.S. currently stand globally on AI? Are we leading the way or falling behind? </p><p>MATHENY: Thank you, Congressman Johnson. I think that the U.S. has a strong lead, but that we can maintain it by drawing on our structural advantages compared to China. </p><p>First, most scientists and engineers in the world weren't born in either the U.S. or China. And many more of those scientists and engineers would prefer to work and live in the United States than they would like to live or work in China. That's a great advantage to the United States. </p><p>High-skilled immigration was key to our victory during World War II and during the Cold War. We were simply able to get more scientists and engineers on our side to win. </p><p>The second-- </p><p>JOHNSON: --Okay-- </p><p>MATHENY: --Is we--we do have a more competitive private sector. And--and sir, I think your efforts to empower small businesses where there's so much innovation is really key to our success. Thank you. </p><p>JOHNSON: Are--are there some actions that we in Congress can take or--or do we need to do more to maintain our global competitive edge in AI, especially given where China's going and--and the major investments that--that (AUDIO GAP) the space? </p><p>MATHENY: I think there are two things that I would--I would emphasize. The first is just how important our immigration policy is to allowing us to lead globally. Given that this is one of the asymmetric strengths that the United States has compared to China.  </p><p>And the second is our lead in microelectronics. It'll be very difficult for China to match us if we play our cards right. We shouldn't rest on our laurels, but if we pursue policies that strengthen our semiconductor industry, we'll also place in the appropriate controls on the manufacturing equipment that China doesn't have and that China currently doesn't have the ability to produce itself.  And it's probably a decade away from being able to produce itself. We'll be in a very strong position. Thank you. </p><p>JOHNSON: Okay. Okay. Well, thanks. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. </p><p>YARMUTH: Yeah. Gentleman's time is expired. And now, I recognize the gentlewoman from Illinois, Ms. Schakowsky, for five minutes. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thanks to our witnesses.  </p><p>So, technology has certainly addressed some of the isolation problems that people have felt during the--the pandemic. And look how we're communicating today. So, there's been a lot of important changes that technology and opportunities that technology has provided for us. </p><p>But, even before the pandemic, I think there were many, many consumers that reporting feelings of helplessness when it comes--with respect to the--the digital economy.  </p><p>You know, I--on my subcommittee on energy and commerce, which is the consumer protection and--subcommittee, we've talked a lot about technology and--and its ups and downs. And we know that big tech has actually allowed fraud and fake news and fake reviews and counterfeit and stolen products that are thriving in--on their--on their platforms.  </p><p>And we've talked about the--they--they come in and talk about self-regulation and I think it's pretty clear that we need--that that isn't working very well. </p><p>But, here's the other question. They ask about--consumers are concerned about privacy.  </p><p>So, Dr. West, I want to ask you. a functioning AI needs data, but we also need to protect consumer privacy. So, in your view, what are the main issues related to consumer privacy and control and ownership of data that we need to consider through--as we--as we think through the use of AI technology? </p><p>WEST: Thank you, congresswoman, for that question. It's a great question. Privacy is very important to consumers. You can look at any set of public opinion surveys and that often ranks very high on the list, next to security.  </p><p>The problem with our current approach to policy at the national level is it's mainly based on what's called notice and consent. Like, when you download software or even install an app, you get, you know, this 20 page document that nobody reads and at the bottom, if you want to use the app, you basically have to agree to it. </p><p>Nobody reads these. We did a national public opinion survey and basically found that that to be the case. </p><p>So, my Brookings colleague Cam Herring (PH) has been doing a lot of work on thinking about new privacy legislation. And what he proposes is basically get rid of the notice and consent because it's not effective in protecting peoples' privacy and basically holding companies responsible for their data sharing practices. Improving transparency so consumers know more about what is going on, improve everybody's sense of how--what kind of data practices are being deployed.  </p><p>I mean, there are all sorts of geolocation features that are now built into apps. Like, you know, if you check the weather, basically the weather app is localized to you. So, there's a geolocation feature there. There's all sorts of privacy problems that get developed there. </p><p>So, basically, we suggest greater accountability for companies. California, of course, at the state level has adopted a much tougher law than what we've had nationally.  </p><p>We really encourage Congress to embrace the issue of privacy at the national level. We don't want to end up in a situation where there are 50 different privacy laws. I mean, that creates havoc for the tech companies, makes it difficult for them to innovate. </p><p>We need a national privacy law that can really address the concerns that consumers have. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you. And remaining time that I have, I wanted to really ask any of you who wanted to comment on--on this. You know that AI is used in policing, in social work, and banking, and--and--and healthcare. And we also know that this is a time of racial reckoning in this country, disparities that--that we see.  </p><p>And we had a--a hearing in my subcommittee on the issue of discrimination built into algorithms, built into our technology, built into AI. And I wanted to just ask whoever to talk about how we can ensure that there's accountability to make sure that there is not the kind of built in bias that discriminates against man--many in our population. Someone grab this. </p><p>YARMUTH: Anybody want to handle that real quickly? </p><p>ATHEY: I can speak quickly. I think that--that we have to consider what the algorithms are replacing. And in some cases, they're replacing human decisions which have, perhaps, a different set of biases sometimes driven by the fact that the humans are using less information or don't have a full view of someone's circumstance. Like, in resume screening, being too superficial. </p><p>So, in principal, when well designed--when training data is carefully selected and when best practices are used, actually digitization can improve the situation and reduce bias. But, it has to be done well and it has to be done carefully. </p><p>So, I believe that we need more research, we need more best practices. And whenever they're used in government situations or regulated situations, we do need to include accountability and ongoing monitoring in order to make sure there are no unintended consequences. </p><p>Often engineers themselves don't understand the source of the problem and they won't look for it unless they're asked to. But, they also like to use best practices if those are delineated and available. And so, this is partly just a maturation of the industry and a maturation of the best practices. </p><p>So, I'm a long-term optimistic, but we have to do the hard work that can make it improve things rather than make them worse. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you so much. I yield back. </p><p>YARMUTH: Gentlewoman's time is expired. And I yield five minutes to the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Woodall. </p><p>WOODALL: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me a second chance. You've always been-- </p><p>YARMUTH: --Yeah, absolutely-- </p><p>WOODALL: --Gracious in that--in that way. </p><p>YARMUTH: Of course. </p><p>WOODALL: The--Mr. Matheny, I wanted to thank you for mentioning the stability in--in national AI policy between the two administrations that you've had an opportunity to serve. We tend to focus on the chaos, which I think leads to less confidence, as opposed to--to the--to the leaders in the room who are working hand in hand, administration to administration. </p><p>Could you talk a little bit about that? We're about to come up on another major election. Do you anticipate that stability in policy continuing, whether it's into a second term of the Trump administration or the first term of a Biden administration? </p><p>MATHENY: Thank you, Congressman Woodall. I would expect there to be continuity in the U.S. strategy on AI. I think there really has been bipartisan consensus that I've seen and a lot of continuity at the Office of Science and Technology Policy, in particular, which I think has done a great job both in the last administration and in this administration, continuing much of the--the strategic work that was laid out. Michael Kratsios and Lynne Parker in particular at the office have been outstanding in coordinating the interagency. They've led a smart and ambitious AI strategy, which I hope to see continued. </p><p>It's--it's, I think, one of the best cases of--of--of bipartisan coordination around a key technology topic. Thank you. </p><p>WOODALL: Very much appreciate that. Dr. Athey, you mentioned not just in your response to Ms. Schakowsky, but also in your opening statement a need to be aware of unintended consequences. Are there particular unintended consequences that weigh on you while in your--in your work? Or is that just a general admonition as we plow new ground? </p><p>ATHEY: Well, I think maybe one--one answer relates back also to the question about labor versus capital and--and excessive automation. In general, firms are--are going to be thinking primarily about their bottom line and they're often short-term. So, it's going to be--you know, a firm might be indifferent between a worker and a machine from a cost perspective. And if they're indifferent, they'll go with the machine. </p><p>But, of course, from society's perspective, we care about the jobs and we care about the people and we care about their transitions. So, we do want to think about how are we investing in this R&amp;D generally? Are--we can't always count on companies to take the longer term perspective and our national innovation strategy and R&amp;D strategy can, in principal, develop this general purpose technology in a way that--that focuses more on augmentation of humans. </p><p>So, one--one thing about this general purpose technology is that somebody makes better AI and then lots of people adopt it. And so, if somebody makes AI that helps replace humans, lots of other people can copy it.  </p><p>But, if--if universities or a particular company or government invests in AI that augments humans, it's also the case that that can diffuse. So, I think that we can--we need to be intentional about our strategies and recognize the places where we as a society care about the direction of technological innovation so that it pushes more and makes it cheaper and easier for the private sector to then pick up augmenting technologies. </p><p>A second thing that--that I worry a lot about is just that the most recent innovation has been in black box technology. It's--it's powerful in general purpose because it does the work for you. An engineer who doesn't know anything about a domain can plop down, you know, modern machine learning and the machine learning will--will spit something out. </p><p>But, if it's just applied without a context, without domain experts, without ethical experts or legal experts or people who are thinking about, you know, national security consequences, we might end up in--in dangerous situations.  </p><p>And so, actually, like, the--the privacy and security issues, I think, are--are especially concerning when we realize that all of us are being observed and monitored sort of 24/7 by our phones and by everything that we do as it all gets digitized. That can create national security issues in that somebody always does something wrong, you know? So, we're--we're available for blackmail.  </p><p>And we're also going to see in the future, because it's so easy and cheap, a lot more worker monitoring, which can be good for safety. We can make sure people are driving safely. We can make sure, you know, truck drivers aren't to sleep. We can make sure that workers aren't going to be injured on an assembly line if we use video to monitor them. </p><p>But, again, we're creating this massive corpus of information about people and we also need to make sure that that information is applied in a fair way and--and for benefit rather than be exploiting in various ways. </p><p>WOODALL: Mr. Chairman, I know Dr. Acemoglu referenced companies that were doing it wrong. I hope as this hearing continues, we'll have an opportunity to talk about some of those companies that are doing it right so that we can benefit from that experience. </p><p>I--I yield back, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>YARMUTH: Absolutely. I'll make sure we do that. Thank you, Mr. Woodall. I now recognize the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Kildee, for five minutes. </p><p>KILDEE: Oh. Well, first of all, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I assume you can hear me okay. </p><p>YARMUTH: We can. </p><p>KILDEE: Appreciate--very much appreciate you holding this hearing. It's a very interesting and obviously very important topic.  </p><p>I represent an area that's seen a pretty drastic drop in manufacturing jobs over the last 30 or so years. Often, and almost exclusively, attributed to trade policy. And while trade has clearly contributed to the loss of manufacturing jobs in my region of east central Michigan, Flint, Saginaw-based city area, clearly technology has played a pretty significant role in that job loss. </p><p>We've gone from, in my hometown, about 80,000 direct manufacturing employees in the auto sector to something around 10,000 right now. But, we still produce about half the cars that we used to produce. </p><p>So, that technology disruption obviously has had a pretty dramatic infa--impact on my community. And now, we are trying to imagine in your thinking and--and researching about how AI may have that same disruptive effect. </p><p>So, I'm curious about any thoughts that any of you have about the pace of development of AI as it relates to manufacturing and specifically around the production of automobiles. I know this might--might require some speculation, but I think it's really important that we engage in that speculation. </p><p>And I'm particularly interested, Dr. West, your references to the work of--of Mike Moro. I have a past relationship with Brookings and did a lot of work around this space, particularly around communities being left behind. </p><p>So, I'm curious if--if--maybe starting with you, Dr. West, but others might comment on those two aspects. The pace of these trends as they might relate to heavy manufacturing, particularly the auto sector and then any thoughts you have on sort of compensating interventions that we can deal with that--that might add to the way we typically deal with trade disruption through trade adjustment assistance or something like that. </p><p>How we might think about support for those communities that are being disproportionately impacted by these trends. So, maybe starting with Dr. West. </p><p>WEST: Thank you, congressman. I do worry about job losses. And manufacturing is one of the areas where there's already a lot of automation and AI that's being introduced and we fully expect that to accelerate. When you look around the world, there are countries that have almost fully automated factories right now where it's basically a bunch of robots driven by AI technology and a handful of humans just monitoring the computer control panels. </p><p>But, it's not just manufacturing. Finance is going to be disrupted. The retail sector. Amazon already has opened a number of stores with basically no retail clerks. They basically use computer vision to see what you have put in your bag or, you know, what it is that you're purchasing and they automatically charge you as you are exiting it. </p><p>So, there certainly are--is going to be, I believe, an acceleration of job losses. </p><p>And in terms of the geographic thing, the thing I would worry about here is if you look at venture capital investment, three-quarters of it now is going into New York, California, and Massachusetts. So, if anything, the geographical inequity is going to accelerate. </p><p>Already, you know, much of the high-tech industry is centered on the East Coast and the West Coast and a few metropolitan areas in-between. But, much of the country is being left behind.  </p><p>My Brookings colleagues in our metro program have a lot of work on this. This is very worrisome. You know, it creates political anger. People get upset, they feel the system is rigged. They feel like they're being left behind. </p><p>So, we do need to think about public policies that will address the geographic aspects. Now, one positive development is the growing tenancy to move towards remote work. It turns out, you no longer have to live in Seattle or San Francisco or Boston or New York in order to work for these tech companies. </p><p>In fact, you know, the real estate has grown so expensive in those areas, they're kind of pricing a lot of employees out of that market. So, they are starting to rely more on remote work and telework. And so, I think public policy can contribute to that.  </p><p>There is a real digital divide where people who live in the country have less access to broadband and less access to high speed broadband. They are less able to take advantage of these remote work things. So, Congress should definitely invest in infrastructure development in the broadband area just to reduce that digital divide so that as companies start to move to telework and remote work, that everybody can take advantage of that, including people living in the heartland. </p><p>KILDEE: Thank you. It's fascinating subject. I look forward to pursuing it further. My time's expired. So, I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. </p><p>YARMUTH: I thank the gentleman. Gentleman's time is expired. I now recognize the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Flores, for five minutes. </p><p>FLORES: Thank you, Chairman Yarmuth. And I appreciate you holding this informative hearing today. I want to note something that you said at the beginning and that government moves at the--10 miles an hour when the rest of the economy is moving at 100 miles an hour. And I'll--I'll talk about that in a minute. </p><p>I personally am excited about the opportunities that AI brings moving forward. I know that several people are apprehensive about it, but I think that we as policymakers need to be excited about it. </p><p>A couple of things I want to comment on before I go into my questions. Number one is I think that there's been a lot of discussion about R&amp;D and I think one of the essential roles of the federal government is a robust investment in basic research and development. And I say this from the perspective that I represent two large, chair one research and education institutions and I also have a great high tech footprint in the--in several parts of my district that rely on that in--those--those discoveries that come out of the search for carr--or the search for basic knowledge from basic R&amp;D. </p><p>The second thing is I think we as policymakers need to be very careful about trying to get into adjusting the--the mix of capital versus labor because, as--as you said early on, Chairman Yarmuth, government moves slowly. And I think we as policymakers could wind up being well behind where the economy is if we're not careful with that. </p><p>I'd like to thank all the witnesses for--for participating. Dr. Matheny, I have a couple of questions for you.  </p><p>As we're all aware, Taiwan, through its TSMC foundry, as a leading semiconductor manufacturer for many countries. And particularly, we in the U.S. rely on them for AI development. </p><p>Does the U.S.--the first question is this, does the U.S. rely too heavily on other countries for AI development? And what can the U.S. do to rely--less of this, rely on some other countries? </p><p>MATHENY: Thank you. Thank you, Congressman Flores. And first, thanks also for your emphasis on--on research. I think one of the most exciting opportunities is for AI to be applied to (AUDIO GAP) to accelerate science and engineering. </p><p>I think some of the more exciting demonstrations that we've seen on this include (INAUDIBLE) use of AI to solve protein folding problems, which are very important for biomedical research. So, I hope we'll see more of that in ways that can expand the economy and--and produce jobs. </p><p>FLORES: Sure. </p><p>MATHENY: Very good question about Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation. I think the U.S. does rely too much on imported semiconductors, which introduces at least three risks.  </p><p>The first is that our dependence on manufacturing in Taiwan means that we have a supply chain that could be disrupted by a conflict with China. The second is that Taiwan is vulnerable to having its workforce and its IP poached because of its proximity to China. And third is we risk having our own know-how vanish in a key industry the more we import. </p><p>I think Intel's recent announcement that they were considering outsourcing their most advanced manufacturing, which would be really the only U.S. based advanced manufacturing of semiconductors, is extremely worrying.  </p><p>So, I think it's prudent to reshore some semiconductor manufacturing to the United States, particularly the leading-edge chips that are used to power many of the AI applications that'll be valuable in the future. </p><p>And beyond the security benefits, this would also create new manufacturing jobs for Americans. Thank you. </p><p>FLORES: Thank you. You, you know what, actually, answered the second part of my question that--that talked about the economic and national security threats that exist, that we rely on other regions and other countries. </p><p>Let me ask a second question. As you're aware, AI development requires talented workers with particular skill sets in order for the U.S. to continue leading the way in AI development, it's critical that we continue to domestic talent in addition to attracting talent from abroad. </p><p>When you talk--answered Mr. Johnson's question a minute ago, you talked about attracting the best talent from abroad. What policymaker recommendations do you have to ensure that the U.S. successfully cultivates a domestic talent supply for AI? </p><p>And--and for instance, talk in particular about what the education system will look like for that group of--of persons. </p><p>MATHENY: Thank you for asking the question. My sister's a--a school teacher and a great one. And so, I have a--a deep sympathy for school teachers who are trying to teach computer science and mathematics. These are difficult topics to teach, but we need to find ways of teaching more of our students the strong math skills that they're going to need. </p><p>Mathematics is really the discipline that is most useful to succeeding in AI, and we simply need to find better ways of teaching math to our students and finding ways to teach more of it. </p><p>We also need to address the AI labor needs that aren't in research and development. I know discussions around tech talent often center on the scarcest and most educated parts of the workforce. But a critical talent gap also sits in skilled labor. And for our skilled labor to compete globally, it will need help from technology.  </p><p>China enjoys a manufacturing advantage due to its vast workforce, which is about 11 times the size of the U.S. manufacturing workforce. But despite its larger size, the Chinese manufacturing sector only produces about twice the amount of value add. So the average U.S. manufacturing worker is about six times as productive as the average Chinese manufacturing worker. </p><p>So re-shoring manufacturing will require that we both increase the parts of our labor force while also increasing the productivity per worker, which is going to have to be achieved through both training and technology. One example is Cobots, robotic systems that complement human workers in order to increase their productivity per person. Thank you. </p><p>FLORES: Okay. Thank you, Dr. Matheny, and my time has expired. </p><p>YARMUTH: The gentlemen's time has expired. I now recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. Panetta, for five minutes. </p><p>PANETTA: Great, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate this hearing, appreciate this opportunity, Ranking Member Womack. I apologize if my connection is spotty, but I have two daughters who are learning remotely, sucking up a lot of the bandwidth. I guess that would be in more ways than one, not just virtually but mentally for their parents, but that's a whole 'nother story. </p><p>Let me just say I appreciate this opportunity to have this type of hearing, especially when it comes to the risk of automation for workers, especially for those jobs where automation only provides a marginal cost and productivity benefit over the human worker. </p><p>Now, I think we all sort of agree that we need to focus on these workers and how such changes will affect them. But we need to be very careful not to discourage automation or technological progress, because I think all of us agree that automation and, yeah, AI hold tremendous promise when it comes to improving our lives and our economy.  </p><p>Now, it can also eliminate, as we know, some very tedious tasks, so that workers can focus on being more productive. And it does lower prices for consumers, improving our daily lives and raising the standard of living for low-income families. So because automation has that ability to increase worker productivity, it's our responsibility to ensure that workers benefit from their increased value.  </p><p>But taxing or otherwise disincentivizing automation, I don't think will save jobs. And I do think it will make our economy less nimble and risk us falling further behind our competitors like China. That's why I believe we need to continue to invest in automation and cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence. That's why we should continue to keep the U.S. competitive in these areas for the sake of our security.  </p><p>And yet, if the successes in these areas do lead to displacement, it is our responsibility to help those workers. And we should be prepared to support those workers, rethinking our social safety net, how we retrain those workers, bolstering their workers' rights, strengthening collective bargaining for higher wages and job security, so that the productivity increases. </p><p>That also means we need to study how workers can best complement automation and artificial intelligence. But we should not, we should not shy away from these fundamental challenges by stunting progress and protections for our national economic and food security. Now, here on the central coast when it comes to food security, we live up to our job. We live up to our responsibilities. We have a lot of farms, farmers, and farm workers. And as Dan Kildee will tell you, I live in the salad bowl of the world because of it. </p><p>We have a lot of specialty crops that cannot be harvested like traditional row crops in the Midwest, concerning corn, soy, and wheat. We have crops where human discernment as to what's a ripe, safe, and aesthetically pleasing product is really difficult to replace. But our ag workforce is very necessary right now. Unfortunately, though, it's aging and it's shrinking. And the pandemic is highlighting not just how valuable that workforce is, but how vulnerable they are. </p><p>Now, obviously, it's a two-prong solution. Yes, one is immigration reform, looking at the Farm Workforce Modernization Act that passed (INAUDIBLE) the House this year. The other, though, is investment in specialty crop mechanization, dealing with how you can harvest those types of very difficult to harvest crops. </p><p>Now, obviously, the private industry is working more to develop these technologies and to fill that labor gap, but I believe the federal government has a critical role to play in helping oversee and scale up these investments, if I may say so. </p><p>Now, my first question, Dr. Athey, is as we develop these types of technologies to save labor, to save our food security, what steps do you think are necessary to protect existing farmworkers and for them to transition and adapt to these new types of existing circumstances? </p><p>ATHEY: Thank you for that question. I believe that historically, we have not really done the greatest job in dealing with displaced workers in general. You know, in economics class we teach about all the benefits from trade and more efficient production of products. But then as a society, we forget about that second step where you actually get the redistribution done and deal with the consequences.  </p><p>But where I'm optimistic is that I think we have a lot more tools at our disposal now to reach people, to use data to figure out what is the best next step for a worker? What types of upscaling will actually work for a person in this circumstance? </p><p>And that, in turn, can help people feel comfortable in the investment. Because, of course, for a worker to take their scarce time and invest in trying to acquire a skill, they need to have confidence that if they do make that effort and take that scarce time and money, they will be able to use that to get a new job.  </p><p>And so I think we've just had services in the past that haven't really responded to the individual worker, to the individual worker's circumstance, and then provided them with effective training and relocation services. But I believe that we can do better.  </p><p>I'm collaborating with a project in Rhode Island working with the state government to try to improve both the data to evaluate training programs, and as well try to help workers have better information for making choices. And I think that with technology and data, we can do better, and we can also reduce the cost of delivery by bringing services to people remotely in their homes at the time that's convenient for them. So they don't have to get in their car, they don't have to hire a babysitter and sacrifice income in order to receive the training that they need. </p><p>So I'm optimistic about the future, but we have to be intentional about it and we actually have to execute and follow through on those types of promises. </p><p>PANETTA: Agreed. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. </p><p>YARMUTH: The gentleman's time has expired. I now recognize the gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Hern, for five minutes. Mr. Hern, unmute your--unmute. Oh, you need to be helped? </p><p>HERN: No, I did it twice. It's good. Okay, we're good to go. </p><p>YARMUTH: There you go. </p><p>HERN: Thank you, Chairman, Ranking Member Womack, for holding this important hearing today, and thanks to all our witnesses for being here today. This is a topic that I find quite fascinating, being an engineer myself. You know, unfortunately, due to the unforeseen spread of a particular virus from China, economic growth has been stunted, and so this really gets to be a real exacerbated issue right now that it's up to us really to fix. </p><p>The U.S. economy has been forced--force built by hard-working, first starting Americans, and we only move forward as a country if we continue to support innovation and encourage workers to get back into the workforce. AI can act as a great catalyst to both needs, and the U.S. government should create a regulatory environment which enables growth and innovation, rather than creating hurdles to both; if we want and would like to be China and others in this space, as our own available workforce declines. </p><p>My question now--there's been many answers to the questions I had. But one of the witnesses really is pretty fascinating as we get into the--we talk a lot about the technical aspects of this. But Dr. Athey, you know, let's just talk about the workforce. There's been a lot of talk about workforce replacement, but we haven't talked at all about the lack of workforce.  </p><p>And for the first time in at least a generation, government figures show a larger number of open jobs than people out of work. Obviously, this was pre-COVID, but it was only six months ago. And certainly a lot of us, probably all of us, hope we get back there very quickly. </p><p>And part of that problem is demographics, labor and market growth. The U.S. birthrate has been falling, and it is at a 30-year low. And simultaneously, baby boomers have hit retirement age and being forced behind a falling number of unemployed. Some would argue it's a real problem of our Medicare issues and our social security issues. We don't have enough people working to fund those programs, along with the aging population.  </p><p>In fact, the McKinsey Global Institute research on the automation potential of the global economy focuses on 46 countries representing about 80 percent of the global workforce, and has examined more than 2000 work activities and quantified the technical feasibility of automating each of them. But the proportion of occupations that can be fully automated using current technology is actually pretty small, only about 5 percent.  </p><p>And you can speak--if you could speak to that AI as our workforce continues and declines and our need for consumption grows, I'd like to get what your thoughts are on policies. And I'm being flippant of this, but if you go back to the McKinsey Group, they'd force higher fertility and prevent us all from getting older, which are two driving forces.  </p><p>And while that's ridiculous, you can't, there leaves one, and I would like to piggyback off on my colleague from California when he talks about immigration. You know, there is a big push and the president's pushed for this for merit-based immigration, bringing people in that can add to where we need to go from a technology standpoint, to help us continue our drive for AI. </p><p>So as you're aware, AI requires talented workers and particular skill sets, so we can continue to lead the way as our witnesses have testified. So what policy recommendations do you have to ensure the U.S. successfully cultivates a domestic talent supply in this space? Will students need a different education to pursue careers in AI versus what they're doing right now? </p><p>ATHEY: Thank you, congressman, for the question. And you've raised a number of really crucial issues. Of course, everyone on the Budget Committee I'm sure is acutely aware that the amount of our budget that we're spending on older Americans is increasing dramatically. So we need to really think about how we're going to deliver services to our aging population more efficiently, and also what can we do to keep people in the workforce happily in the workforce longer, which might be in a second career or a part-time job that looks very different than how work looked in the past. </p><p>So I think a first important consideration is to think about what will all these elderly people need and how can we help them live independently, live fulfilling lives, and get the services they need.  </p><p>I think AI and automation can actually help quite a bit, because some of the things that make it difficult to work as you age include, you know, physical challenges as well as memory challenges and sort of certain cognitive aspects of a job, all of which can be alleviated through augmenting AI or physical robots, which might allow humans to work longer and focus on the aspects of the job that involve interpersonal relationships, comforting seniors, helping them get their psychological needs met. So you might have seniors helping seniors.  </p><p>It's also the case that--actually there's a lot of service work at that time that in the end may not fully be replaced by automation. So I see this aging population is a challenge, but it's also--points our way towards solutions for those people.  </p><p>And more broadly, the demographic crisis highlights for us that immigration will be important, because we see a shortage of workers on the horizon and a shortage of taxpayers in the working age, and when you look at the demographics. It's much harder to predict what's exactly going to happen to automation in 10 years, but we already know how many 20-year-olds we have in the country who will be 40 in 20 years. And unless we bring in more 40-year-olds, we're kind of stuck with what we've got. </p><p>So we can expand immigration, but we can also think about how to most effectively use the people we have and allow our aging population to contribute in meaningful ways as they age. Thank you. </p><p>HERN: Thank you so much. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. </p><p>YARMUTH: The gentleman's time has expired. I now recognize the gentleman from New York, Mr. Morelle, for five minutes. </p><p>MORELLE: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for holding another really, really important issue facing the country. Before I begin, I do want to also add my welcome to Representative Jacobs who I had the privilege of serving with in the New York State legislature, and I'm delighted that he's joined this committee. I'm looking forward to continuing to work with my neighbor to the west in Upstate New York. </p><p>I just want to say a couple points. I think some of the comments by the other members have been really, really provocative, and there are a ton of questions here. To me, this isn't a question of whether or not AI, machine learning, robotics, and innovative technology will reshape the landscape economically and as it relates to the workforce. It is doing it. It will continue to do it.  </p><p>It's happening in many respects at breakneck speed, and I think then the question for us, we've always marketed ourselves as a nation of opportunity and a nation of innovation. So the question is, as public policy challenges emerge because of it, what do we do? How do we think through this? So I think that's why this hearing is so critical. </p><p>The way I see AI, I guess I think about it in a couple different buckets. One is to the extent it could displace human beings in some jobs and in some occupations. More I see it as ways to create tools that will allow people to do their jobs faster, better, more efficiently. But there's no question it's going to have an impact, and we need to think about it. </p><p>One of the things that--as it relates to the budget, and perhaps people can talk about this. You know, the president has talked about elimination or deferral of payroll taxes. Obviously, that has an impact on Social Security. It has an impact on Medicare. But even beyond the call for reduction in payroll taxes, to the extent that there's a displacement of workers or a lessening of wages because jobs become a focus of commodity-like activities, what I'm struck by is so much of what we've built on the safety net, Medicare and social security being two of the most obvious, built into a system where we get revenues based on payroll. </p><p>So, you know, there've been suggestions by some folks looking at this to the extent that we look at displacement. Should there be alternative ways of looking at taxation so we can continue to provide resources to Social Security, to Medicare, to make sure that particularly as the baby boom generation starts to move into some of these programs--and you're going to see a significant percentage of the population in Medicare, in social security; and given the production rate in the United States is at an all-time low. You mix that in with AI and machine learning, robotics.  </p><p>Could anyone--and perhaps, Dr. West, maybe you could help answer this. Is there something we should be looking at in terms of a replacement for payroll taxes that's based on--I know people have talked about the difference between capital and people when it comes to investment and tax treatment. Can you talk a little bit about how we can make sure that our revenue base doesn't decline if we see jobs displaced by either AI, robotics, machines, et cetera? </p><p>WEST: That's a great question, Congressman. I think we do need to think about the tax system, both in terms of tax rates, tax credits, but possibly also new types of taxes. You know, if you go back 100 years to the start of the Industrial Revolution, we found our tax system to be inadequate at that time. So we developed new taxes, developed new social programs. And I think now as we're moving into the digital economy, we need to be asking big questions like that. </p><p>So I'm not sure exactly what the kind of new taxes could be. Like people have proposed a financial transactions tax that would kind of help with income inequality in general. Other countries are implementing digital services taxes. So there is a lot of new ideas that are being formulated there. </p><p>And on the first part of your question, you're right about the importance of market competition, and the key innovation always has been small and medium-size enterprises. We're worried about a loss of market competition. And so I think Congress should really think about ways to promote small and medium-size enterprises, just so we can maintain the startup economy that has fueled American prosperity for several decades. </p><p>MORELLE: Yeah, thank you. I think that's a really important comment. And I would just say in the few seconds I have left, what I do worry about is we don't want to create disincentive for investment in innovative technologies. We also don't want to put ourselves in a position where, as a result of that, we've displaced workers and the payroll taxes that support much of our social infrastructure.  </p><p>So I want to thank the panelists. Thank you, Mr. Chair, for a great hearing. I yield back. </p><p>YARMUTH: Thank you. The gentleman's time has expired. And now I recognize in his debut Budget Committee appearance, Mr. Jacobs from New York. </p><p>JACOBS: Can you hear me? No. </p><p>YARMUTH: You're live. </p><p>JACOBS: Having some problems here. </p><p>YARMUTH: Well, you may have muted yourself. Now you're fine. You should be good. </p><p>JACOBS: Can you hear me? </p><p>YARMUTH: Yes. </p><p>JACOBS: Okay, sorry about that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, everybody, great to be on. And I guess I need a little AI to help me with unmuting here.  </p><p>I just wanted to first comment on, Dr. Matheny, on some things you talked about regarding semiconductors. I have an area in Batavia, New York, in my district where they've been working for a number of years in developing an advanced manufacturing park. One of their hopes would be to lure a semiconductor facility there because of the inherent assets we have in terms of low-cost power, due to the proximity of the Niagara Falls powerplant, and also abundant water.  </p><p>And in talking with them, they discussed this issue of the loss of our semiconductor industry nationally. And one statistic--I just wanted to echo why this is so important what you're talking about. In the year 2000, the United States had 24 percent of the semiconductor production in the world. Now, we are at 12 percent. In the year 2000, China had 0 percent of the production, and now they have 16 percent. And they are investing another $1 trillion in this sector in the next decade.  </p><p>So this is a major issue, and look forward to pushing for policy nationally that will help level the playing field so we can make sure that we maintain and grow this sector for the important reasons that are mentioned here. </p><p>I wanted to ask a question of Dr. West. My district, as we talk about inequalities, would be geographic. My district is rather rural, and we definitely--we have major issues with lack of high-speed Internet access, and it's being more pronounced right now with the needs for distance learning and telehealth, but in an effort to be economically competitive in the future. And I was just curious--so clearly, I am all in for any additional money and programs to push for rural broadband, because it's as important as any other piece of infrastructure right now for our area. </p><p>But in terms of you mentioned innovation districts as the model of something to kind of--to try to allow areas that are not on the coast to be competitive in the new day here. And I was wondering if there's examples of success that you have of innovation districts. Thank you. </p><p>WEST: Well, it's funny you should ask that. And the chairman will love this, because Louisville is actually an example. Louisville is an example where they have developed a pretty successful regional innovation district. Brookings actually is helping advise some of the organizations there. It's a public-private partnership. So you can talk to the chair about how they did that. </p><p>On the rural part of your question, I can really appreciate this because I grew up on a dairy farm in rural Ohio many years ago. And rural areas are really being left behind right now, and so we really need to address the infrastructure part and especially the broadband part. Because as I mentioned earlier, like there are opportunities for remote work, like you don't have to live in San Francisco. You could live in your district and still work for any of these tech companies, but you need high-speed broadband. </p><p>Just this week my Brookings colleague, Tom Wheeler, had a short report where he gave a couple of very specific ideas for the Federal Communications Commission, which he used to head. One is a reform of the E-Rate Program, which was set up to connect classrooms. It turns out there is a $2 billion surplus in that fund, meaning there is unspent money that was designed to connect classrooms. </p><p>Now that so many people are engaged in homeschooling, you know, we could actually redirect some of that $2 billion to improve rural broadband in order to facilitate homeschooling. It's very consistent with the purpose of that program. So you should talk to people at the FCC about that. </p><p>And then secondly, with the Lifeline Program which the FCC also runs, including cable companies, not just phone companies, in rolling out digital services and broadband. Just because today, people are almost as likely to get their broadband via a cable company as a phone company. So if we could broaden the Lifeline Program to basically address the ways people are ordering broadband, that would help. And also making--including companies that offer prepaid services. </p><p>So in the Tom Wheeler post, he talked about all these ideas. But I think they're particularly relevant for your district and other rural areas across America. </p><p>JACOBS: Great, thank you very much. I yield back the rest of my time. </p><p>YARMUTH: The gentleman yields back. I now recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. Khanna, for five minutes. </p><p>KHANNA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Dr. West. I highly recommend Mark Morrow's (PH) paper. It's not just the chairman's Louisville district, but even in Paintsville, Kentucky, they've had quite a lot of success in bringing technology to rural communities. And I appreciate your work and Brookings' work on that. </p><p>I had a question for Professor Acemoglu, whose work I admire very much. I was struck by this idea of excessive automation. And I understand the tax incentives that may be off. But bracketing that aside, what explains the move towards excessive automation? Is it a sense that there is some kind of market failure where companies are actually making irrational decisions to automate in ways that aren't profitable? Or is it that it's marginally profitable, but it's not having aggregate productivity gains for society? </p><p>ACEMOGLU: Thank you very much, Congressman Khanna. I think that's a great question, and it's a variety of factors. First of all, it is indeed the tax incentives, so we cannot ignore that. You know, there is no natural rate at which capital and labor are going to be taxed, so it's a policy choice, and that policy choice is going to have consequences. </p><p>A second important factor is that labor and capital use may have social consequences and economic consequences that go beyond what companies calculate. So, for example, if people are better citizens or they contribute more to their communities or to their families when they are employed, that's not going to be part of the calculation of companies. And it is part of policymakers to actually decide that.  </p><p>So do we (INAUDIBLE) the same GDP? Would we be happy when that is produced by humans partly, versus when a lot of it is produced by capital? I think a lot of policymakers would say actually for the same GDP, we would like it if--we would like it quite a bit if humans are part of that equation, which means that we actually value as a community, as a society, humans being part of that calculation. And technology has gone in the way that makes it possible for greater substitution of machines and algorithms, so some of those external effects that were less relevant now become more relevant. </p><p>And a third factor is that it is not necessarily irrational, but different companies have different business models. So if you look at different periods in which the American economy has done very well while it was also automating, this diversity of perspective, diversity of approaches, was very important.  </p><p>Let me give one example, mechanization of agriculture. That's an even more transformative automation event than the ones that we are talking about right now. More than half of the U.S. economy was in agriculture, and there was a huge tremendous decline in labor share in agriculture as machines started performing tasks that were previously done by humans. </p><p>But during that period, American growth didn't just come from agriculture. It also came from other sectors that picked up labor that was displaced, or the children of the labor that were displaced often, because some greater human capital was necessary. So the manufacturing sector introduced a lot of both production and nonproduction jobs. A lot of the nonmanufacturing sector expanded. So it is sort of diversity of approaches, diversity of technologies, was quite critical. </p><p>So one of the things that may be less active today is that we are not using the enormous technological platform that AI presents us in ways that can create jobs, tasks, opportunities for labor, in other sectors of the economy. So, for example, when earlier on there was a discussion of robots and what was going on in Flint, Michigan, you know, that is absolutely central that there were a lot of production jobs that were eliminated. </p><p>The same has happened in everywhere. If you look at South Korea, if you look at Germany, other countries that have introduced a lot of robots; production jobs were eliminated in more or less the same numbers as in the United States. But in many of these cases, there were also nonproduction jobs that were created more or less simultaneously, sometimes in the same companies, sometimes in the same markets. And that's what we haven't seen in the United States. </p><p>So when you look at Flint, when you look at Saginaw or other parts of the industrial heartland, you have these production jobs disappearing, but we're not using the technology to create other jobs to compensate for these. </p><p>KHANNA: (INAUDIBLE) you do create other jobs, what would be one or two bullet points of what we could have done in Flint to create those other jobs? </p><p>ACEMOGLU: Well, I think in Flint, you know, it's a little bit hard for me to say from here what exactly the skills that would be easily transferable. But when you look at broadly, you know, there are many applications of AI--in education, in healthcare, in manufacturing--that are completely capable of creating jobs. </p><p>For instance, automation in manufacturing also enables job creation, because it reduces offshoring. So there's mounting evidence that--you know, not the jobs that were destroyed to trade with China or to the first wave of automation are not going to come back. But there are certainly opportunities for many jobs to come back, offshore jobs to come back as automation process continues, because it is a cost-saving possibility. </p><p>So many of those are not in the production line. They are in the supporting capacities. But they are very, very important and potentially high-wage jobs. And again, the evidence from Germany suggests that many of the jobs that were created, even in the same companies that were automating at the same time, were paying higher wages or comparable wages to the production jobs that were destroyed. </p><p>KHANNA: Thank you. </p><p>YARMUTH: The gentleman's time has expired. I now recognize the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Scott, for five minutes. Unmute. </p><p>SCOTT: Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I had to find it. I'm sorry, I came on a little late, so let me just ask a couple general questions. First, to any of the panelists, how real is the threat to laid-off workers that their employers might decide to increase artificial intelligence rather than rehire their workers? </p><p>YARMUTH: Any takers? </p><p>ACEMOGLU: I can give a quick answer to that. We don't know. We don't know for sure. But in recent surveys, about 75 percent of companies are saying that they are either taking steps to increase automation or they're planning to do so. So there is a real possibility that some of those jobs will not come back, even as the economy picks up.  </p><p>The other issue that we need to think about is that the sectoral composition of the economy is going to change in a post-COVID world. The hospitality sector will probably be much slower to come back. So there will be a natural reallocation. Some of that reallocation is obviously healthy and efficient, but it will still have great costs on some of the poorer communities and some of the poorer segments of U.S. society. So I think those are, as some of the earlier comments indicated, questions related to the social safety net. </p><p>But broadly, and this has been one of the main themes that I've tried to emphasize, it's not just a social safety net issue. If we think that displacement is just a social safety net issue, that would mean that we would be happy to have a lot of workers being displaced and then find ways of providing good social services and a decent standard of living to them. But again, I don't think that would be a healthy economy or a healthy society.  </p><p>That's why it's important for us to find ways of using our existing and--technology know-how and our technological capabilities in order to find ways of deploying our enormously productive, our very well-skilled workforce, in other activities. Thank you. </p><p>SCOTT: Let me ask you a follow-up question to that. If there are going to be fewer workers, does that have budget implications on fewer people having taxes and therefore lower revenues? </p><p>ACEMOGLU: Oh, I'm glad you asked that. That's a very, very important question as well. So if you--one of the themes that I emphasize is that our tax system is asymmetric--taxes capital less than labor. and it has become more so. That has major budgetary implications because if you look at the U.S. distributional income, the share of labor has gone down from around 67 percent of national income to less than 58 percent. So that means that income is shifting away from the more heavily tax factor to the more likely tax factor, and it will have budgetary implications. </p><p>And another theme that I've tried to emphasize, but it was very quick so this gives me an opportunity to underscore it one more time, is that part of the reason is because our capital tax base is very narrow. It's not just a question of jacking tax rates on capital and introducing huge wealth taxes or anything like that. There's just a big chunk of capital income that we don't tax. And that means it's costly, it's asymmetric. It may distort the allocation of capital and labor in workplaces, but increasingly it also has major budgetary implications. Thank you. </p><p>SCOTT: Does that include--we have tax credits for investments and machines, but not in education. Is that  something that we have to address? </p><p>ACEMOGLU: Absolutely, 100 percent. If you look at decline in the tax rates facing (PH) capital that went from over 15 percent to less than 5 percent in the last 20 years, about half of that is because of the very generous investments tax credits, which are so generous that if you have debt-financed capital investment in software or S-corporations, you may actually be getting a small net subsidy. We have nothing similar to that for education or training. Thank you. </p><p>SCOTT: We're talking about education and training. To get into an AI job, you don't sign up for an education for AI. I think I heard math is important. But what should the committee on education and labor be doing for higher education? </p><p>MATHENY: I could take a piece of this. One thing that I think would be especially useful is a tithe, a 10 percent allocation for federal research grants to go towards teaching. Because otherwise, we're eating our seed corn. We're spending all of our federal R&amp;D on the research rather than on the teaching. In most of the major universities where AI is being taught, there's a natural tension for the professors to focus on research, as opposed to allocating time to teaching. We need to make sure that we're training the next generation. And a tithe, particularly on NSF grants, could help with that. Turn it over to others. </p><p>SCOTT: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. My time has expired. Thank you so much (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>YARMUTH: The gentleman's time has expired. I now recognize the gentlewoman from Texas, Ms. Jackson Lee, for five minutes. </p><p>JACKSON LEE: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you very much for the hearing, both with you and the ranking member. And thank you to the panelists. Let me just add a description that should not be taken at offense, but we are all speaking now to the haves, because the have-nots are not in the room. And I think this is a very important basis upon which we are responding, because that's the focus that I will have, along with maybe a more definitive question about a tax scheme that would work to help AI. </p><p>And I'm going to start with Dr. West who early in his testimony mentioned the question of income inequality and worker dislocation. Those people today are not in the room. And we, as members of Congress, represent a wide landscape of individuals. Can you pointedly, Dr. West, talk about what should be our response on the apparent and existing income inequality and the potential worker dislocation? </p><p>WEST: That's a great question, Congresswoman, and you're exactly right. There are income disparities. There are racial disparities. This is a huge problem. We're almost in a situation where technology is helping to fuel the inequality in the sense that the haves are doing better and getting tax breaks and programs that support them, and people at the lower end aren't even in the game. They don't have access to the digital economy.  </p><p>There are 18 million Americans who do not have broadband. A large number doesn't have a high speed of broadband. So the way that we need to address these issues, certainly infrastructure investment, the things we've talked about earlier, rural broadband in underserved urban areas as well, putting more money into education, especially opportunities for online education. Because that would be a way to help overcome the disparities, but you need the broadband in order to be able to access that.  </p><p>The same thing applies in terms of telemedicine. One of the features of COVID is it has jumpstarted what already was in existence, a trend towards telemedicine. It has really accelerated it, but not everybody is able to share in the benefits of that. And given the racial disparities in the incidence and fatality rates of COVID, like that's a scandal that people who need it the most are not getting access. So there are a lot of different things we need to do, and we certainly need to address the inequities in the tax system. </p><p>JACKSON LEE: Well, clearly it means that out of the budget committee, we should be focusing on just the infrastructure that you've mentioned. It's a shame that in 2020, we are still fighting to get broadband everywhere. And for those of us who are watching our schools open and they are hybrid or virtual, to see people standing in line trying to simply get laptops because they don't even have that, and as well hotspots or the hot boxes so they can have the opportunity to have access. </p><p>Let me do a round-robin question dealing with COVID-19. We've heard a stark, a very stark admission of the knowledge of how deadly COVID-19 was, as early as February 7, 2020, if I might. Let me ask all of you to comment how COVID-19 could have been attacked, if I might, starting with Dr. Athey and going to Dr. Matheny, with artificial intelligence in terms of treatment, in terms of outreach, in terms of saving lives? </p><p>Doctor--is it pronounced correctly--Dr. Athey? </p><p>ATHEY: Yes, Dr. Athey. Thank you very much for the question. And I think the telemedicine point is super important. We were a little slow getting started in trying to get information to people, getting people in touch with their doctors without broadband access. And without good access to medicine, we weren't always making good decisions for patients early. </p><p>Another thing is that actually using AI and machine learning to understand what treatments work best was actually very limited in the United States by our disjointed medical system and the inability to do analysis that incorporates data from multiple sources. Because as the epidemic happens, patients are being treated in hospitals. The insurance companies only get the data later once bills have gone out, and that's not fast enough. </p><p>So it turned out that we were just unprepared to be able to do analysis that spanned multiple medical centers and give real-time intelligence. We also missed opportunities to have a more coordinated approach to clinical trials and R&amp;D that was really focused on getting the most information and the best treatment decisions possible, given the patient flow that we had. There was just a lack of coordination. </p><p>And I really hope that if anything like this ever happens again, we are prepared to be able to do the right analysis and coordinate the studies and the research. And that just requires really advanced preparedness and a lot of kind of air traffic control from the federal government. And AI and machine learning can only do their work if they're given the opportunity to access data and really influence decisions. Thank you. </p><p>JACKSON LEE: Thank you. </p><p>YARMUTH: The woman's time has expired. I now recognize the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Sires, for five minutes.  </p><p>SIRES: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Can you hear me? </p><p>YARMUTH: Hear you fine, yes. </p><p>SIRES: Good. I want to thank the panelists for being here today. You know, I always think of a job as a--something that creates self-worth in a person. And we seem to be obsessed with this productivity word, and obviously, artificial intelligence creates a lot of productivity. But you have countries like China and you have countries like India who have such large populations. And as artificial intelligence is more productive, more and more people are left behind. </p><p>Do you think that these countries with such large population will ever come to a point and they say, okay, artificial intelligence is great, but we have passed beyond the ability to provide jobs for the people in my country? Maybe we should slow down this artificial intelligence that is creating so much automation and leaving so many people behind. Because as you know, if there's no work in a country, it leads to unrest. </p><p>I was just wondering if any of the panelists would want to address that, where a country would say, hey, let's put little brakes on this, because our population is staying behind, is being left behind. Can anybody talk to that a little bit? </p><p>ACEMOGLU: I'll be happy to comment on that. You know, I think--first of all, I completely agree a job is much more than just productivity. I think self-worth important for the community, important for society. I think these are critical. But the tragedy in some sense is that, at least on the current measurements, we are not even doing that well on productivity. Despite the bewildering array of technologies all around us and all this excitement that goes on, we are actually during one of the eras in our history where productivity growth is lowest. </p><p>This goes to underscore what I was trying to emphasize, that it's not a question of AI versus non-AI. It's a question of how we are using AI technology. And if we're not using it well, we would destroy jobs and all of the self-worth and community contributions that we're talking about, and also not reap all the benefits in terms of productivity.  </p><p>I think that's exactly the sort of situation we are in right now. So if a lot of AI goes into marginal activities such as self-checkout kiosks or things that humans can do very well, then it will not bring the productivity gain. </p><p>I don't think that China is ever going to turn back from AI, partly because they have made a huge investment in that. But also because part of the AI's appeal to authoritarian regimes is that it actually provides a much better monitoring system, facial recognition, snooping on communications, control of the Internet. But those are exactly the sorts of things that are not going to bring huge productivity gains, and they're not going to contribute to making jobs more meaningful. </p><p>But if you look at what American companies invest in, it's not that different that we pour a lot of money into facial recognition and monitoring aspects of AI as well. So that, again, goes to my broader point that I think there are ways of making use of the AI platforms in a manner that's going to bring much better social benefits and jobs and productivity than we are doing currently. </p><p>SIRES: So productivity worker for United States is 6 to 1, somebody mentioned before. And in China, it's 1 to 1. So I was just wondering if China does not want a 6 to 1 or an 8 to 1 productivity ratio. </p><p>ACEMOGLU: I would say China definitely wants that and has made huge progress. </p><p>SIRES: But doesn't that leave a lot of people behind? I mean--if you reach that kind of a productivity like the United States? </p><p>ACEMOGLU: Well, it may or may not. If consumption keeps up with it and that productivity gain is broadly distributed in society, it may not. In China, it hasn't taken that form. Inequality has actually increased a lot, the gap between cities and rural areas, and even within cities between migrant workers and non-migrant workers have opened up hugely.  </p><p>But sure, I think there's a huge drive in China towards increasing labor productivity, but they are also willing to invest an enormous amount of resources in order to monitor these workers better, in order to monitor communications, civil society participation, and other social activities, even if those things are not productive, because they do need to maintain the current political system. Thank you. </p><p>SIRES: Thank you. Thank you, chairman. </p><p>YARMUTH: The gentleman's time has expired. I now recognize the Ranking Member, Mr. Womack from Arkansas, for 10 minutes. </p><p>WOMACK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to all of my colleagues who have participated; and to the witnesses, thank you very much. A very interesting discussion. I'm going to start where I kind of left off in my opening remarks, and that was about matters of fiscal accountability at the federal level. And I don't need to tell anybody engaged in this forum this afternoon that we are in some very difficult circumstances right now. COVID has exacerbated three times more so than what we would've otherwise had, in terms of a deficit goes. </p><p>And to my colleagues on this call today, I'll sound a bit like a broken record. I'm an appropriator by nature. I just happen to be the ranking member of the committee and had formerly chaired the committee. But as in appropriator, I'm very concerned about the escalating cost associated with mandatory spending, how much of the federal budget it is commanding.  </p><p>And the squeeze, as I call it, that crowding out effect that it's having on the matters of the discretionary budget that we appropriators are in charge of--should be in charge of, last few years as an exception, but that's a whole 'nother story. But the fact is that if we're going to invest in anything in our country, if we're going to ask the federal government to have a role in resourcing a lot of this R&amp;D, then it is going to face continued and escalating pressure from the mandatory outlays that continue to consume a larger and larger share of federal resources. </p><p>So here's my question, and I'm going to pose this to Dr. Matheny. And that is, with that in mind if we can all agree that there is this crowding out effect, how would the federal government prioritize spending on matters of research and development and so forth in the AI spectrum? And what have you seen from your federal government, if anything, that has worked? So help me understand how we would prioritize the spending that goes toward a more robust AI circumstance in our country? </p><p>MATHENY: Thank you, it's a great question. And I think that the federal government can most cost-effectively focus on basic research, on testing and evaluation, and on safety and security, areas that suffer market failure so that the commercial sector is likely to underinvest. Much of the current wave of AI research that we see right now is due to federal investments in basic research, particularly by the National Science Foundation and by the Office of Naval Research and DARPA, dating back to the mid-1980s, which funded early work on deep learning, provided training grants, much of the current generation of AI researchers. </p><p>And that work in basic research really does need to continue, so that we fund the next generation of breakthroughs that will fuel future AI systems. Equally important is the work of the National Institute for Standards and Technology in its benchmarking and its testing and evaluation. That has been critical for actors in both the private sector and the public sector to be able to bring their tools to have them tested on a level playing field, understand where they work and where they break. And just as important also has been the federal government's investments in microelectronics. In the 1960s, NASA effectively started our microelectronics industry. </p><p>But we also have examples of less successful programs, very large projects, overly broad goals like the Strategic Computing Initiative which ran from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, is an example of that. So where the government can help is really on the cases where the commercial sector isn't going to invest on its own, where the goals, though, can be clearly defined and where we can lift up and address those market failures. Thank you. </p><p>WOMACK: You bet. Dr. Acemoglu, am I even close on the name? Okay good. Thanks for the thumbs up. And Mr. Sires reiterated the points you made early--I think it was you that made the point early on in your testimony that China had 11 times as many people in the workforce, but they were only two times as productive.  </p><p>That the American worker has proven to be the most productive worker, I guess, on the planet says a lot about our ability and about our capacity. One of my concerns has been is that the pace of the private sector in virtually every area is a lot faster than our education system seems to be trying to deliver. Is that a fair statement? </p><p>ACEMOGLU: Yes, I believe so. I think it is definitely true that our education system has lagged behind. AI, for all the reasons that we have discussed today, has already started changing the labor market, and it will change it even more. But our education system, both at the university level but also at middle school and high school level, is very backward looking.  </p><p>We continue to teach in the way that we used to, for the most part, 30, 40, 50, 60 years ago. AI actually provides--I think Susan mentioned this already--provides tremendous opportunities for revolutionizing some of the key sectors such as healthcare and education. AI can be used for taking over some of the tasks that educators do that are quite boring, such as grading. But even more importantly, it can create a much more interactive classroom, enable teachers to understand specific challenges and needs of students, and cater their teaching and curriculum to their needs in real time.  </p><p>It can enrich what we teach and how we teach it. There are already companies that have completely transformed their training systems using AI. So I think there are a lot of opportunities, but sure, we are lagging behind. And it is absolutely critical, as you have pointed out, for our success that the American worker maintains their productivity edge over other nations. But we have not done very well in that regard either.  </p><p>So if you look at an inclusive measure of productivity growth, what economists call total factor productivity growth, in the three or so decades following World War II, that was growing over 2, 2.5 percent a year, and it's around 1 percent for the last 20 years. So we are not really doing enough to keep our productivity edge relative to other nations, many of whom have faster productivity growth rates. </p><p>WOMACK: Mr. Chairman, my final question--and I'm going to throw this on the table--I don't know really who to direct it to. But we've seen some challenges in recent years of building government industry partnerships. And what's to me even more disconcerting is that a lot of the companies that we're talking about are now not only not building those partnerships, but they are just unwilling to work with the federal government. Or work with, you know, partner nations or--you can pick from the spectrum of issues. Just last year, Google pulled out of a major AI project called Project Maven with the Department of Defense. It's my strong opinion that we need to see some change in this area. </p><p>Why is this occurring and what are the long-term consequences of not having the proper relationships between government and industry? Is it the slow pace of government in general, because we all know that we don't operate with a lot of speed? </p><p>WEST: Congressman, I would be happy to jump in on that question. I agree it's important for a government to work with industry. I think the Google thing, there were some idiosyncrasies to that decision. Other tech companies are embracing the role of working with the federal government.  </p><p>But I do think as part of your concern about debt and deficit issues, we do need to think about agency modernization, just because we have to get the federal government acting much more efficiently than it is right now, just in terms of the administration of services. And the way to cut some of the program costs without hurting the beneficiaries is to make the organization more effective. And so the public sector still lags the private sector in using AI.  </p><p>Just one quick example, every federal agency should be using AI for fraud detection. It's something that's very common in private companies. We know that there's waste and fraud in the federal government. The AI looks for outliers, it looks for unusual activities. Like this is one tool federal government agencies should be using to try and get a better handle on the spending side. I think that's an example of where technology can be part of the solution. </p><p>WOMACK: Yeah. And in the budget that--when I was chairman that we prepared for FY '19, a key component of trying to do the deficit reduction was the fact that we had billions and billions of dollars of improper payments. And there has to be a way that we can get after those without unnecessarily burdening ourselves.  </p><p>Anyway, my time is expired. Thanks again to all the panelists. Thanks to my colleagues. Chris, welcome again to the Budget Committee. And Mr. Chairman, as always, I'm going to yield back my time, and with regrets that you didn't get to see Authentic win the race there on your home track. But nonetheless, a good Derby. </p><p>YARMUTH: I thank you, Ranking Member. I did watch on television. Fortunately, I tried to set up a betting account and they were so swamped with people trying to do that, I couldn't get on, so I didn't lose anything. </p><p>WOMACK: Well, AI--if we had had a little better AI platform, we could've probably fixed that. </p><p>YARMUTH: Probably so. Thank you for that, and I yield myself 10 minutes for my questions. Once again, thanks to all the witnesses. It's been an extremely enlightening conversation and I think a very valuable one.  </p><p>I'm going to kind of segue off where the ranking member was, because we spent most of the hearing talking about impact on jobs, and I think that's kind of the natural topic, and how that might impact tax revenues and so forth. But we really didn't focus much on how AI might help reduce expenses for the government. </p><p>And I can see--I think, Dr. Athey, you mentioned telemedicine and I think there's a lot of potential, as you mentioned, for reducing costs in Medicaid, transportation costs, as well as probably getting better diagnoses and drug interactions and so forth. I think there's a lot of possibilities there. Where might be some other areas in which there actually could be a positive impact of AI on expenses for the government? </p><p>ATHEY: Thank you for that question, Chairman, and I think that really does pick up from the ranking member's comments as well that government can be much more efficient than it is. Now, I would've actually been pretty scared 10 or 15 years ago to suggest governments invest more in IT, because IT projects are--often fail in private sector, frankly. And when governments take them out, we have a lot of problems with procurement, procurement of large IT projects. </p><p>But one of the things that I think has been really impactful in how AI and machine learning have been diffusing through the economy in the last few years is the way in which IT services delivered has changed. We're having more software as a service. We're having more cloud computing, so that you don't have to, say, take on this huge project which has use risk and then you're kind of locked into the software for the next 20 years. But rather, you're getting services that meet your needs that are updated automatically, and where a lot of R&amp;D can be centralized and focused on use cases. So I do believe that it is a good time to start thinking about modernizing the federal government infrastructure.  </p><p>And then alongside of that, again, these very common AI applications like fraud detection was mentioned, also security. Cyber security is a huge problem and, again, because of its antiquated infrastructure, the federal government and all of its employees are vulnerable. And so if we can start modernizing and we can put in best practices, we can deliver services more efficiently and effectively. </p><p>Now, I also want to pick up on another comment that you made which we really didn't talk enough about today, I think, which is that when labor is used as an input, then that's affecting the cost of a product. Daron and I have both mentioned that there are some cases where the worker and the machine are sort of creating similar cost structures. But there are other settings where investments can really lower the marginal cost of providing services, as well as the marginal cost of receiving services.  </p><p>And actually, especially for state and local governments, that's very true. You know, people are standing in line and wasting their time and taking off of work to get needs met, and a person is sitting behind the counter doing something where all of this would just be so much faster and better if you could just get your--do it electronically and get your needs met. </p><p>YARMUTH: Yeah. </p><p>ATHEY: So while that loses a piece of employment for the worker sitting behind the counter, you know, maybe there's other things that your government could be doing; more childcare, more eldercare. You know, there are other services that are under-provided where those human workers could be better deployed if we used technology to do things where the human time is getting wasted on both sides of the table. </p><p>YARMUTH: I appreciate that. And even though we're focused--we are the U.S. Congress; we're focused on the federal budget. We also need to think about impacts on state and local budgets. These are all tax dollars, and we do have a federal system.  </p><p>As I said before the hearing started off the air, that this is something I've been planning to do for about a year and a half now. And when people would come to my office, different groups would come to my office when they were still doing that, I would invariably ask them at the end of the meeting what impact artificial intelligence is having on their profession or their activity.  </p><p>And I never forget, I had the Kentucky CPAs in the office and they were there to lobby about tax policy, which is understandable. At the end of the meeting I asked them, in your professional meetings do you ever talk about artificial intelligence? And their eyes all opened wide and they said, that's the number one topic at all of our meetings, because they see a dramatic reduction in the need for accountants because of artificial intelligence. </p><p>I had the War College, people from the War College in my office. I asked them that, and one high-ranking soldier said, we don't think that there'll ever be a battlefield decision made by a human being again. And I'm sure he was exaggerating somewhat, but the idea was that AI can consider all the hundreds if not more variables that would go into a decision as to when or where to stage a military action. </p><p>So when I--particularly about--IBM, I talk to IBM people and they say Watson, at least in their analysis, can now do 70 percent of what lawyers do with greater accuracy. They can read MRIs. Watson can read MRIs and CT scans more accurately than radiologists can.  </p><p>All of these things lead me to say this is--the impact is not necessarily just going to be on the routine type of jobs, that there are going to be some very high-level jobs that are going to be changed or eliminated in many cases, which connects me back to the education issue.  </p><p>When you look at professional jobs that require years and years and years of education and hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of tuition, and you're seeing the possibility that those jobs might be eliminated, how do you think this is going to change the future of even professional education? Dr. West, do you want to try that one? </p><p>WEST: I think you're right. It certainly is not just entry-level jobs that are going to be affected by AI and automation, but higher level jobs including the example you gave of radiologists. Accountants should be worried; they're exactly right. Because there's a lot of really good finance AI that is out there. Financial advisors, the same thing. So I do think that we need to keep our eye on the education process. </p><p>When I talk to young people today, I tell them one of the most important skills they need to develop is adaptability. Because they are going to face such a changing economy, a changing workforce and changing job needs and job skill needs, that whatever knowledge and skill they have at age 21 when they are graduating from college, it's probably going to be completely inadequate 10 years later. It certainly is going to be inadequate 20 and 30 years later. </p><p>So they're going to need to constantly upgrade their job skills. It's the reason in my testimony I talked about lifelong learning. I think the adult education aspect is going to end up being as big as higher education today. So the education component is very important. </p><p>YARMUTH: I'm glad to hear you say that. That's exactly what I tell students when I talk to them, too. You're going to have to be adaptable; that's the number one talent. I promised Mr. Woodall, Dr. Acemoglu, that I would let you answer about--he asked about companies, corporations, that are doing the right thing. So in the time I have left, do you want to expand on those that are good examples for us? </p><p>ACEMOGLU: Sure. I think--let me say two things. One is in answer to Congressman Woodall's question. But before I do that, I want to sort of build on what Dr. West has said. I think adaptability is extremely important, and it's going to become more important. But I also think that there's a lot of uncertainty about which types of jobs AI is going to be more threatening to, and there is some disagreement. </p><p>But if you look at the current users of AI, which are still sort of limited, they are still more geared towards more low-paying jobs. And part of the reason for that is because when you look at higher-paying jobs, they involve a variety of tasks, and only some subset of those tasks can be automated. And when the rest aren't, then the adaptable workers especially benefit a lot. So I expect AI technology, in whatever direction it goes, to add to our concerns about inequality. So that I think is a very important thing. </p><p>When it comes to which companies are using AI, I think there are many companies in Silicon Valley that are using AI in extremely creative ways. I think the problem is that some of those are not very, very good when you take their social implications into account.  </p><p>So, for instance, I think you can use AI as sort of a niche sort of industry right now, but there are couple of companies that are working on using AI for doing test grading. That's going to be a growth industry, and I think it's going to be very, very useful. But there are many fewer of them that are using AI technology for creating more adaptable classrooms.  </p><p>There are a few, but I would say that's one area that's actually very promising. But because of the complexity of the question, I think one of the concerns is that when I've talked to some of those companies, they think that their technology would not get a hold in many school districts because it would involve hiring more skilled teachers, and school districts are not going to have the resources or the interest in doing that.  </p><p>So I think there's a sort of a chick and an egg problem. There's a lot of creativity that could be put to use AI in very new and inspiring ways, but we may not have the infrastructure to support that completely yet. Thank you. </p><p>YARMUTH: All right. Well, I thank you very much. My time has expired. So as we close, let me once again thank all of you witnesses for your time and your wisdom and knowledge, and all the members for participating. And if there is no further business, this meeting is adjourned. Thank you. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60TK-Y971-JDPT-T01D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

It is a privilege to meet with you at this critical juncture in American history, indeed in world history.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The pandemic is exposing and exaggerating longstanding inequalities in health and wealth. It will worsen the inequalities between black and white, between the more and the less educated, and between ordinary people and the well off. Enlightened policy can moderate these effects, as has already been the case. But we are not done This pandemic, like other pandemics before it, lights up anew the fault lines in society. Inequalities that we knew about, like racial and ethnic inequalities, are more starkly visible. Inequalities in work and in living conditions have become salient in new ways, as people are sorted into essential and inessential workers, as jobs, transportation, and activities that once were safe become unsafe, and as access to the internet becomes the difference between learning or not learning, or working safely or not working at all.</p><p>The pandemic may turn tolerable inequalities into intolerable inequalities. There is a danger of social unrest, but there are also opportunities to address long-standing problems. The need to repair our policing has already become urgent. Other outstanding issues include healthcare, antitrust policy, and our system of unemployment benefits.</p><p>I want to start by describing inequalities in the US before the pandemic struck. I shall then discuss how these inequalities shaped the experience of the pandemic, often amplifying them, and then I shall go on to discuss issues for the future.</p><p>My guess is that, left to itself, the pandemic will worsen inequalities in the US, between blacks and white, between the more and the less educated, and between ordinary people and the very well off. Enlightened policy can moderate the worsening, or there could be serious disruption. But we have been here before; the income and wealth inequalities of 2000, if they had seen from 1960, would have seemed intolerable, but tolerated they were.</p><p>BEFORE THE PANDEMIC</p><p>Educational attainment, race, and unequal lives</p><p>In the past half century, the lives of Americans have become increasingly divided according to whether or not people have a four-year college degree; those with a BA are prospering and living longer, while those without are foundering. Not only are the gaps widening in the outcomes that make for a good life, but for less-educated Americans, life is getting worse. The American economy is not delivering for less-educated Americans.</p><p>In our recent book, Deaths of despair and the future of capitalism, Anne Case and I document the disaster and the divide. Most stunningly, mortality rates in midlife, which had been declining for a century since the last pandemic, began to rise in the mid-1990s, driven by increases in suicides, drug overdoses and alcoholic liver disease (what we call \"deaths of despair\") as well as by a reversal of progress against mortality from heart disease. There were 158,000 deaths of despair in 2018 (the latest year we have data) compared with 65,000 in the mid-1990s. The increase was almost entirely among the two-thirds of white non-Hispanics who do not have a bachelor's degree. Until 2013, black non-Hispanics, who had suffered their own catastrophe in the 1970s and 80s, escaped this epidemic. After 2013, when illegal fentanyl hit the streets of eastern cities, black deaths of despair began to rise too, again almost exclusively among African Americans without a bachelor's degree. Other rich countries appear to be exempt from deaths of despair, at least for now, although here are much smaller epidemics in other English-speaking rich countries, most notably in Britain.</p><p>There has also been a surge of pain, of disability, of difficulty in socializing, and in loneliness, again largely confined to the less-educated. The fraction of men in employment has fallen for many decades and, since 2000, for women too. Yet labor force participation has held steady for educated men and women. Median earnings of less-educated men have fallen for half a century; if benefits are included, especially employer-provided health insurance, the decline is moderated, but, as I argue below, these \"benefits\" are worth much less than they cost, and are harming working people in other ways. The earnings premium between those with at least a BA and those without has now risen to an astonishing 80 percent.</p><p>Community and social lives of the less-educated have deteriorated, creating a widening gap with the more educated. For those without a BA, divorce has risen, as has out of wedlock childbearing, and many never marry, though they participate in serial cohabitations that often bring children, many of whom lose touch with their fathers. The decline in unions has depleted an important social and community resource, and rates of churchgoing have fallen. Again, these dysfunctions are confined to less-educated Americans, whose lives are getting worse, and whose lives are diverging from the third of the population with a BA or more.</p><p>African American mortality rates have long been higher than those of whites; it is true today, and it has been true for as long as we have data. In the 1930s, midlife mortality rates for blacks were two-and-a-half times those for whites. The gap has diminished steadily, closing particularly rapidly when white mortality rates began to rise in the mid-1990s. This convergence came to a halt after 2013, with the rise in fentanyl deaths among blacks; blacks with a BA--22.5 percent of the black population--were largely exempt.</p><p>In our book, we argue that the disintegration of life among inner-city African Americans in the 1960s and 1970s, culminating in the crack epidemic, was echoed forty years later by the epidemic of deaths of despair among whites. Black Americans, then among the least-skilled workers, faced the leading-edge of globalization as manufacturing jobs in cities were lost.</p><p>In the last thirty years, globalization and automation has eliminated many more jobs, especially for less-skilled workers. Wages fell along with employment as good jobs vanished and workers relocated to less well-paying jobs, gig jobs, or jobs in labor supply firms, or dropped out of the labor force altogether. Some of the worst jobs like chicken processing plants in rural America, or meat packing plants--where many immigrants work--have become danger zones in the COVID-19.</p><p>Good, stable, jobs with high wages became scarcer, undermining the foundations of community and social life. In many of the worst-affected communities, where despair ran deep, pharma companies pushed doctors to prescribe huge numbers of opioids--essentially FDA approved heroin--a ladder from despair to addiction and death. Meanwhile, globalization opened up new worlds of opportunities for the educated elite, who prospered as never before, some quite spectacularly so.</p><p>African Americans have long done worse than whites on almost all positive outcomes, in unemployment, wages, wealth, housing, health insurance and access to quality healthcare, and especially in rates of imprisonment. On some indicators, such as self-reported pain, or life-satisfaction, education now appears to be as important a divide as race. However, while a third of white Americans have a BA or more, less than a quarter of blacks Americans do.</p><p>Health insurance and healthcare pre-COVID</p><p>American healthcare played an important role in the disaster even before COVID-19. There are three key facts: American health care is exorbitantly expensive; much of it is financed through employer provided health insurance; and it delivers relatively poor outcomes. It is a major driver of income inequality, because it transfers unnecessarily large sums upward from the general public to providers, some of whom are very wealthy, and it lowers wages and destroys good jobs for lower paid workers. An average family (single) policy cost $20,000 ($10,000) in 2019 which has to come out of what the worker is worth to the firm. This means lower wages, or often for the least skilled, elimination of the job. Outsourcing firms can provide the same work, but often without benefits, and at lower wages; few large firms now hire their own janitors, security guards, drivers, or food-service workers. Those low-level jobs--the proverbial mailroom worker--often provided the sense of being part of an important firm, and for some, the opportunity for promotion. The rapid increase in the cost of healthcare--now twice as expensive as in any other country--has lowered wages, destroyed jobs for the less-educated, and enriched hospital executives, pharmaceutical companies, device manufacturers, insurance executives, and a minority of physicians--the most common occupation among the top one percent.</p><p>All of this harm is over and above the role of the system in the opioid epidemic.</p><p>DURING THE PANDEMIC</p><p>The quick and the dead: age, sex, race, and ethnicity</p><p>Death does not come equally to all, especially not COVID deaths. COVID infections and death are structured by sex, by age, by race and ethnicity, by education, and by geography. Pre-existing inequalities shape who dies and who lives, just as the pandemic itself creates new inequalities.</p><p>In some cases, the odds of dying are approximately (and only approximately) proportionally elevated for everyone so that the epidemic reinforces pre-existing health inequalities. Men are more likely to die than women from COVID; by June 10, 51,397 men had died, and 44,209 women. In 2018, with no COVID, 1.5 million men died and 1.4 million women; the normal disadvantage of men is has been exaggerated by COVID. Older people were more likely to die at baseline, and are more likely to die in the pandemic. By June 10, the ratio of COVID deaths for those aged 85 and over to deaths for those aged 55 to 64 was 2.8 to 1; in 2018, that ratio was 2.3 to 1. Once again, COVID somewhat exaggerates the mortality inequalities by age and sex that while we are used to the fact that the old are more likely to die than the young, and that men are more likely to die than women, we do not fully understand why these differences exist, and if, as seems likely, they are influenced in part by social arrangements, they are potentially correctable. The mechanisms of COVID are even less well understood. It could be that, like a predator in the wild, it singles out the weak. Or it could be something more specific, like older people are less likely to have had another childhood vaccine that is partially protective--like rubella. Old people who live in nursing homes have been heavily affected. There is also evidence that women are more likely than men to accept and observe social distancing restrictions.</p><p>The exaggeration of pre-existing mortalities is much larger for African Americans relative to whites, while, for Hispanics, a pre-existing mortality advantage (the so-called Hispanic paradox) has changed into a mortality disadvantage with more Hispanics dying than their proportion in the population. In 2018, relative to white non-Hispanics, blacks' death rates were 18 percent higher, and white Hispanic death rates a third lower. During the pandemic, and up to June 10, blacks' mortality rates from COVID were 84 percent higher than for whites, and Hispanics four percent higher. It is important to note that these differences have already changed and will change more with time and as the geographic composition of the epidemic changes. As the pandemic spreads to more places that are predominately white, the white advantage will diminish, although it almost certainly will not vanish.</p><p>Death rates have been disturbingly high among native Americans. In Arizona, AIANs account for 22 percent of COVID deaths, but are only four percent of the population. In New Mexico, they are 50 percent of deaths, but are only nine percent of the population.</p><p>What explains these racial and ethnic differentials? We will not have definitive answers for some time, but we know something.</p><p>Where and how people live matters a great deal for any infectious disease, including COVID. The disease has not yet reached some areas, many of them predominately white. Many minorities live in segregated communities, with high population density and multifamily living arrangements. Segregated communities are often less well-served by healthcare. These inequalities have long been known, but have a new significance with COVID.</p><p>Transportation seems to have been important in New York City, as people commuted in crowded subway trains to Manhattan from the ethnic and racially structured communities in which they lived. The patterns of mortality by race and ethnicity are quite different in New Jersey and Massachusetts than in New York, showing less or no white advantage. Geography, transportation, and segregation all help control the spread of an infectious disease.</p><p>Pre-existing conditions make COVID more deadly. Patients who suffer from underlying health conditions, particularly cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or chronic lung disease, are six times more likely to be hospitalized, and once hospitalized twelve times more likely to die from COVID. Because underlying health conditions are more common among the less educated, and among African Americans, they contribute to the COVID mortality differences among those groups.</p><p>Minority workers are disproportionately represented in services and in healthcare. The CDC reports that 25 percent of Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks work in services occupations, compared with only 16 percent of whites. African Americans are 12 percent of all employment but 30 percent of nurses.</p><p>African Americans are disproportionately incarcerated, and prisons have become hotspots for COVID.</p><p>The patterns we document in Deaths of despair, with mortality and income gaps expanding simultaneously, will be further exaggerated by the pandemic, or rather by the measures that have been taken to moderate and control it. Many educated people get to stay at home, continue to earn their salaries, communicate with colleagues and friends electronically. Their health is protected along with their incomes. Their children take zoom classes and their attendance is monitored by their parents.</p><p>People without a college degree keep their jobs, if they are essential workers, but may risk infection, or, if they are not essential, lose their jobs and risk their earnings, but stay safe. Essential occupations include food and agriculture (including retail and the infamous meatpacking jobs) where only 14 percent of workers have a BA, and where about half of workers are people of color. For non-essential workers who lose their jobs, most have been at least temporarily covered by emergency payments. In the longer term, some jobs may never return, and some workers may feel they have to return to work, even when they do not feel safe. Otherwise, they risk not having money to buy food, or to pay rent.</p><p>Under these conditions, the gaps by education in both health and earnings will surely expand.</p><p>Healthcare is supposed to be met by the money paid to hospitals in the CARE act, and insurers are largely foregoing copays and deductibles. But the situation remains murky, and many people may face hospital charges. A quarter of a million people have been hospitalized with COVID since the pandemic began, and that number could more than double by the end. If insurers pay now, they will have to recoup later. There is scope here for enormous popular discontent as this situation unwinds. If so, there will also be demands for reform.</p><p>Other issues and looking forward to post-COVID</p><p>The Constitution of the US embodies sharp inequalities in political representation in the Senate. The largest four states, California, Texas, Florida, and New York, have a third of the population, but only eight percent of the Senate. In contrast, Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, and South Dakota comprise less than one percent of the population but also have eight Senate seats. The distribution of COVID cases, hospitalizations and deaths are more concentrated than population and have even fewer Senate votes. The four states with the highest number of deaths, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Michigan have half of all deaths so far, and, once again, eight percent of Senate votes.</p><p>This inequality will narrow as the pandemic moves across the country and into more rural areas. But, for the present, the inequality of representation makes it harder to provide financial relief to the states that are hardest hit.</p><p>In the gilded age, with vast material inequalities, antitrust laws were introduced to break up trusts and to make capitalism fairer to workers and consumers. Many commentators and researchers have recently been concerned about increasing industrial concentration today: hospitals are an important example, airlines another, though the champion is retail, with Amazon and Walmart. A related but distinct concern is about big tech, their quasi monopoly position, and whether they are a net benefits or threats to society. At the same time, the share of labor in GDP--long thought to be an immutable constant--has been falling, not only in the US but around the world. If there is prolonged unemployment post-COVID, the position of labor will weaken further. Many have argued that government anti-trust enforcers, and the courts, have lost interest in antitrust enforcement. Prices of many goods and services that used to be cheaper in the US than in Europe are now more expensive, arguably because the EC has been a more effective regulator than the US.</p><p>All this can be argued both ways. Big tech, and retailers like Amazon and Walmart have brought great benefits to us all. Yet there is a level of discomfort that is growing to something like alarm as COVID causes greater consolidation. Many bricks and mortar facilities have been closed, whether inessential retail or manufacturing, while anything with an e- in front of it has been open. Many stores have gone bankrupt. Big tech has money to purchase firms in difficulties, as does private equity.</p><p>One thing that I do not worry about is that the unemployment we see now, and that may last for a while, will bring an epidemic of deaths of despair. Our book argues that deaths of despair are the consequence of a prolonged, half-century undermining of the supports of working-class life in America. These deaths do not respond to the ups and downs of employment and unemployment. Deaths of despair were rising before the Great Recession, they rose during the Great Recession, and they continued to rise after the Great Recession. We expect deaths of despair to continue through the pandemic, but not to spike in response to the unemployment that has been generated as a part of social distancing.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>T40-MgEditor-7152261 T40-MgEditor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7152261</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6071-PSK1-DYG2-R2M8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3201\"/><timeReceived>6:20 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 24, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Persimmon, the country's largest housebuilder, has a strong claim to be Britain's Google. No, Persimmon has not developed a world-changing algorithm. It is not experimenting with new technologies. Its business ethic is not to solve problems first and work out how to monetise them later. Persimmon lays bricks and runs copper pipes under floors, just as housebuilders have done for ever.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So what does it have in common with the world's digital pioneer? The answer is in the accounts. Last year Persimmon reported an operating profit margin of 28.2 per cent and had \u00a31.3 billion of cash. Alphabet, Google's parent company, managed a margin of 24 per cent and had $100 billion of cash. The similarities go on. Jeff Fairburn, chief executive of Persimmon, pocketed \u00a375 million while <person><nameText>Sundar Pichai, </nameText></person>Google's boss, made roughly \u00a3270 million.</p><p>It doesn't take a software engineer to see something is wrong with that picture. Housebuilding is not complicated. Builders buy land, secure planning permissions, put up a few boxes and flog them. It's been done for hundreds of years. There should be zero barriers to entry. Instead, the accounts resemble those of the oligopolistic tech giants - complete with offensive bonuses.</p><p>With a cost of capital starting around 5 per cent and margins around 20 per cent, builders today are money-printing machines. Choosing to invest in Googleor Persimmon, on these metrics, would be tough. Or perhaps not. Competition regulators are going after big tech but no one gives two hoots about the builders.</p><p>Last week they were let off the hook again. Sir Oliver Letwin's \"review of build out\" rejected claims that they were causing \"intentional delay\" to prop up prices, despite its finding that build rates are just 6.5 per cent of a site a year. Development is slow, the former Tory minister concluded, due to the \"homogeneity of the tenures on offer\". In other words, builders choose to build expensive homes and develop them no faster than the demand for that limited product can absorb. It may not technically be land-banking, but it is rationing by price selection.</p><p>Sir Oliver's remedy is to require a mix of build-to-rent, shared ownership and affordable housing. Broader appeal would generate more demand and thereby speed up supply, he argued. To ensure diversity, and prevent builders erecting premium houses where smaller homes are needed, local authorities should cap the development value of big sites at ten times \"existing use value\".</p><p>It's a clever proposal but the bureaucracy may play into big builders' hands. Small firms don't have the pockets to absorb the costs of our arcane planning system. So much so, they have been dying off. In the 1980s, 10,000 small builders produced 57 per cent of new homes. Today, 2,800 produce 27 per cent.</p><p>A more frank assessment than Sir Oliver's would be that the housebuilding market has been stitched up since the consolidation of the early 2000s. Mergers concentrated power with the big nine, who used land acquisition efficiencies to lift profits while cutting supply. As planning grew more complicated, and big builders trapped sites under option in their \"strategic\" land banks, smaller developers found it harder to compete.</p><p>Today the big builders are the only game in town and, as Sir Oliver acknowledged, the only way to increase supply is to play their game and raise demand. Hence Help-to-Buy, a subsidised mortgage scheme to attract buyers. Yet, as the Google-type returns attest, the ultimate beneficiaries have been the builders. There is nothing sophisticated going on here. Housebuilding is a plain old oligopoly protected by a backwards planning system that raises barriers to entry, and needs to be shaken up.</p><p>                   Philip Aldrick is Economics Editor of The Times                 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-48935958</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TNB-CJF1-JCJY-G2F6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"640\"/><timeReceived>5:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 5, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Rep. Maxine Waters, the committee's chairwoman, has called for Zuckerberg to testify by January, the source said.</p><p>Members of the committee have for months wanted to hear from Zuckerberg about Libra, a currency that Facebook hopes will become the basis of a new global financial system. They also plan to ask about other Facebook-related topics beyond Libra, such as privacy and fair housing issues, the source said. Zuckerberg spent three days in September visiting Capitol Hill and with lawmakers --- including members of the House Judiciary Committee, which is conducting an antitrust investigation of tech companies --- and President Donald Trump to discuss such issues as avoiding foreign interference in the 2020 elections. </p><p>Announced in June, Libra is a digital currency that would allow users to easily and cheaply send money around the world from digital wallets on their smartphones, with no need for a bank. Facebook has said Libra will be governed by an independent, third-party organization, the Libra Association, though many of that group's member companies have ties to Facebook. </p><p>The project drew almost immediate opposition from regulators around the world, who expressed concerns that Libra could grow to rival government-backed currencies, such as the dollar, and the power of the central banks that control them. They also worry the project could threaten consumer privacy, or enable the financing of terrorism or drug or human trafficking. </p><p>Facebook and the Libra Association have promised not to launch Libra until these regulatory concerns are addressed.</p><p>Facebook's David Marcus testified in July at two contentious hearings before the House Financial Services and Senate Banking committees. He led the Libra effort at Facebook and now runs the company's subsidiary developing a digital wallet for the cryptocurrency. Marcus is also among the few initial leaders of the Libra Association. </p><p>Even after that hearing, many lawmakers were not satisfied. </p><p>\"I think that he skirted some of the most significant questions,\" Waters said in an interview with Bloomberg TV following the July testimony, later adding, \"I don't know what it is, I don't know how it works.\" Waters called on Zuckerberg to testify on the project. </p><p>\"He should be here,\" she said in the interview. \"That's one of the things we have to do. This is a big idea that's borne out of Facebook. If he's big enough to create an idea that's global in nature, then he should be big enough to come and talk to us about it.\"</p><p>Prior to the July Libra hearings, Waters asked Facebook to halt Libra's development until regulators have had a chance to address it, something the company has not agreed to. She also proposed draft legislation that would ban big tech companies from operating cryptocurrencies. </p><p>The project continues to move ahead --- the Libra Association launched a \"bug bounty\" program, inviting the public to identify flaws in its system, and Facebook has hired lobbyists to address crypto-related issues with lawmakers, lobbying disclosure forms show. </p><p>Lawmakers have also advanced their efforts to address the digital currency. In August, Waters led a Congressional delegation to Switzerland, where the Libra Association is headquartered, to learn how it will be regulated. That same month, privacy regulators from around the world --- including FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra --- sent a letter to the Libra Association companies asking how Libra users' privacy will be protected. </p><p>The Libra Association and Facebook declined to comment for this story.</p><p>CNN Business' Donie O'Sullivan contributed reporting. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

He said they were at a critical moment when a handful of dominant companies control 'commerce, content, and communications.' He got specific, pointing out that Google had over 90% of search, Facebook over 80% of social media revenues, and Amazon over half of online commerce.</p><p>He said that anticompetitive consolidation has had devastating effects on a free and diverse press as well as the survival of startups. Both talked of lax merger enforcement in the U.S vs. more muscular oversight overseas.</p><p>Ranking member Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) was concerned but less harsh in his assessment, a view echoed by other Republicans. He said that it was important not to overreach or punish success or suppress innovation or limit consumer power.</p><p>Witnesses for the hearing were Department of Justice antitrust chief Makan Delrahim and Federal Trade Commission Chairman Joseph Simons in the latest hearing Wednesday (Nov. 13) in a series of hearings, Online Platforms and Market Power, Part 4: Perspectives of the Antitrust Agencies.</p><p>Delrahim and Simons both talked about their ongoing, separate, investigations into Big Tech and antitrust, but both talked about the actions they had already taken in the digital space, and would take future action if their investigation warrants.</p><p>On the issue of enforcement, Simons conceded that the FTC was resource-restrained so it focused on cases it had a better likelihood of winning, adding that if it had more money, it could pursue more cases.</p><p>Simons was asked about Europe's opt-in consent regime and whether the U.S should take a similar approach to federal privacy legislation. He said he was concerned that could backfire, entrenching the largest players even more at the expense of newer entrants because with consumers faced with a barrage of opt-in decisions on data use, the larger, more familiar, players are the ones most likely to get that consent in part because users may not want to spread their information so widely.</p><p>Sensenbrenner agreed that the U.S needed to beware the unintended consequences of efforts at protecting privacy or passing federal legislation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2610484</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XH7-SP11-JDG9-Y1G8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"499\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 14, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Now, he says it's time his own industry is more closely watched.</p><p>Good morning, everyone. Welcome to EARLY START. I'm Christine Romans.</p><p>BRIGGS: Good morning. Good morning to all of you. I'm Dave Briggs. Tuesday, June 25th, 5:00 a.m. in the East.</p><p>We start with the immigration battle and you may have seen, but doctors, Christine, have called this child immigrant facilities tortured facilities and that's why this immigration battle is so heated. They say no soap, soiled clothes, poor hygiene, all where children are being held at the southern border.</p><p>Now, emergency funding at the border could be in jeopardy over demands to provide more humanitarian aide. House Democrats emerging from a tense late night meeting with Speaker Pelosi, agreeing to review specific changes to a $4.6 dollar proposal. Why? Democrats in the Progressive and Hispanic Caucuses argue the $4.6 billion proposal does not go far enough addressing humanitarian needs.</p><p>A Democratic source calls it the hardest Nancy Pelosi has had to work on her speakership. The speaker addressed the border issue before the meeting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Families belong together. In America, everyone has rights, immigrants have rights. And we just have to beat that drum for the next couple of weeks. And as we do so, we must also pass legislation that meets the humanitarian needs at the border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Children taking care of children in these facilities.</p><p>The clock is ticking on several fronts here. A vote on the Democratic proposal is set for today. Lawmakers leave Washington for a one-week recess on Thursday. And the president pushed back his timeline but says deportations, there will be deportations in 12 days.</p><p>The chair of the House Democratic Caucus recently outlined leadership's border strategy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): We should provide the humanitarian assistance necessary to change the conditions along the border, particularly as it relates to immigrant children. But we need to make sure that there are guardrails that are erected so that we do not inadvertently fund the reckless Trump deportation machine.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Now, without some version of emergency immigration funding, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar says that the effect on HHS would be like a government shutdown.</p><p>BRIGGS: Help is comes immediately for nearly 250 migrant children held at the Customs and Border Protection facility in Clint, Texas. The Department of Health and Human Services the children will be shifted into its shelter system by today.</p><p>Our Jake Tapper asked Vice President Mike Pence about those conditions on Sunday. Pence quickly pivoted to politics.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: We have money to give toothpaste and soap and blankets to these kids in El Paso County right now.</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Of course we do.</p><p>TAPPER: So, why aren't we?</p><p>PENCE: My point is, it's all a part of the appropriations process. Congress needs to provide additional support to deal with the crisis at our southern border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: As of June 10th, more than 52,000 unaccompanied children have been transferred from DHS to HHS. That's a 60 percent increase over last year.</p><p>ROMANS: An extraordinary denial from President Trump in the face of rape allegation from the mid-1990s. According to the president, writer E. Jean Carroll is, quote, totally lying when she claims he sexually assaulted her in a New York City department store. Mr. Trump tells \"The Hill\", quote, this: I'll say it with great respect, number one, she's not my type. Number two, it never happened. It never happened, OK?</p><p>Watch Carroll's reaction when Anderson Cooper reads her the president's remarks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: He said: I'll say it with great respect. Number one, she's not my type. Number two. It never happened. It never happened, OK?</p><p>E. JEAN CARROLL, COLUMNIST: I love that. I am so glad I am not his type. I am so glad.</p><p>This is -- this was 20 years ago. And I probably was at that moment in that five-minutes the most attractive woman in Bergdorf's, in that one bit of time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Carroll has been an advice columnist for \"Elle\" Magazine for 26 years. She alleges Mr. Trump attacked her in one of the store's dressing rooms. The president has denied accusations of sexual misconduct now by more than a dozen women.</p><p>BRIGGS: President Trump refusing to reveal whether he has confidence in his own FBI Director Chris Wray.</p><p>[05:05:04] Wray and the president recently clashed on whether campaigns should accept dirt on their opponents from foreign governments. He was asked by \"The Hill\" about his confidence with Wray. The president replied: Well, we'll see how it turns out. I mean, I disagree with him on that.</p><p>Here's what President Trump recently told ABC News.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is somebody that said, we have information on your opponent. Oh, let me call the FBI, give me a break. Life doesn't work that way.</p><p>GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS ANCHOR: The FBI director says that's what should happen.</p><p>TRUMP: The FBI director is wrong.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: The FBI has not responded to that comment from the president.</p><p>ROMANS: We're counting down to the first Democratic 2020 debates. Round one tomorrow night features Elizabeth Warren and Beto O'Rourke center stage. O'Rourke just announced a new proposal for a war tax. He wants nonmilitary households, households without member of the military in them to help cover the cost of health care for veterans of new wars.</p><p>Round two Thursday night features Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders centerpiece. Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris will also be headlining.</p><p>These first two debates offer the lower tier candidates an opportunity to break out of the pack and get some attention. Most of them have kept a light campaign schedule over the past few days as they prepare to make what could be their make-or-break moment. That preparation ranges from mock debates to reading up on policy differences.</p><p>BRIGGS: President Trump doesn't think he needs congressional approval for a military strike against Iran.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I like the idea of keeping Congress abreast, but I wouldn't have to do that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nancy Pelosi actually said you must have congressional approval. So, you disagree with her on that?</p><p>TRUMP: I disagree.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Members of Congress have hotly debated the question of president's authority especially in the wake of the attack the president called off last week. He ordered that strike in retaliation for Iran's downing of an unmanned American spy plane.</p><p>ROMANS: Meantime, the president targeted Iran's supreme leader with new sanctions Monday. He warned U.S. restraint is limited. And overnight, the Iranian foreign minister slapped back, saying the new sanctions mean the White House is, quote, closing the channel of diplomacy forever.</p><p>CNN's Frederik Pleitgen is standing by live in Tehran.</p><p>Fred, how did those new sanctions fly?</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Christine.</p><p>Well, the Iranians are essentially saying that these new sanctions are more propaganda than anything else. It was quite interesting because Hassan Rouhani, the country's president, he was on TV and he gave a raging speech for his standards against the United States. He accused the White House of being in a state of mental disability and confusion in not knowing what to do.</p><p>Essentially what the Iranians are saying is they will not affect the supreme leader at all. The country's president saying the supreme leader only owns a modest house and a mosque and has no dealings in the United States, and so therefore would not be affected by any of this.</p><p>We also have to keep in mind, that the others who were sanctioned as well, especially the leadership of the Revolutionary Guard, a lot of them have been sanction before and a lot of them, of course, are some of the most hard line members of the Iran's power structure and certain there's no way to see that these people would change the way that they operate in any way, shape or form.</p><p>But one of the things that Rouhani also said, Christine, was that he said that this essentially closes off any sort of channel to diplomacy. He said that the fact that the United States on the one hand is saying that they want to get Iran back to the negotiating table, but at the same time, also sanctioning also Iran's top diplomat, Javad Zarif, shows, as he put it, that the United States is lying about wanting any new talks.</p><p>And interesting to see Iranian media earlier today, they are downplaying all this, pretty, pretty far down in the newspapers and the newscast as well, Christine.</p><p>ROMANS: I'm so glad you're there to parse it all for us. Fred Pleitgen in Tehran, thanks, Fred.</p><p>BRIGGS: New this morning, House Democrats have found evidence of political motive for adding a new question to the 2020 Census questionnaire. A former top adviser to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told the House Oversight Committee that he sought advice on the issue from conservative law professor John Baker. Democrats say Baker has argued a citizenship question is necessary so House seats can be redistricted without counting noncitizens.</p><p>Commerce Secretary Ross maintains he added the question to help the Justice Department enforce the Voting Rights Act. But Democrats claim the real objective of the citizenship question is to discourage Latinos from responding to the Census. The Supreme Court is set to rule this week on the question's validity. So, it's unclear if the latest revelations will have any effect on whether the action is asked.</p><p>ROMANS: A warning that some commonly prescribed drugs are tied to a nearly 50 percent higher risk of dementia in older people. A new study published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine suggests the link is strongest for a certain type of antidepressants, antipsychotics and epilepsy drugs. The researchers say the increased risk is associated with an adult taking a strong dose of one of these drugs daily for at least three years. [05:10:06] It's unclear whether the drugs caused the dementia or if there was something else at work. The researchers say it's important not to stop taking drugs you're prescribed without consulting a doctor. But certainly, this is getting a lot of attention here this morning.</p><p>Ten minutes past the hour.</p><p>A missing student mystery in Utah. A 23-year-old was dropped off at a park, hasn't been heard from since.</p><p>[05:15:04] BRIGGS: Bill Gates calling on the United States government to step up regulation of big tech. The founder of Microsoft says company like he created have so much influence on culture, business and lifestyle that they must be constantly monitored.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GATES: Well, technology's become so central that government has to think, OK, what does that mean about elections? What does that mean about bullying? Things like privacy I'm sure they'll -- and there should be at some point better regulation as it relates to that. The fact that now this is the way people consume media, you know, has really brought a realm that we need to shape it so that the benefits outweigh the negatives.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Gates' remarks coming on the same day Senators Mark Warner of Virginia and Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a bill that could force companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook to reveal how much they make, how much money they make off your data.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. A new remarkable attack from the president against the Federal Reserve, bashing the Fed for not doing more to help the economy. Yet in the same breath, the president taking credit for a strong economy and the stock market.</p><p>Trump said the Central Bank is acting, quote, like a stubborn child for refusing to pursue easy money policies. Last week, the Fed kept interest rates steady, but hinted it could lower them, partly because of rising concerns over Trump's trade war with China, that that trade war could dampen the U.S. economy.</p><p>The Fed on alert here but stocks are still near record highs. The president with zero evidence claims stocks would even be higher were it not for the Fed. The president is right, June has been great for investors. You could argue it would be better for investors if not for his trade war.</p><p>The Dow is up almost 8 percent. The S&amp;P 500 up 7 percent and the Nasdaq up more than 9 percent in June. And unemployment is at the lowest level in half a century. So the economy is strong, but the president still wants even lower rates, even easier money policy. And after last week's meeting, Goldman Sachs said that the Fed delivered a clear rate cut signal adding the central bank could drop rates next month due to fear of disappointing the market. Many economists have backed Jerome Powell's wait and see approach to interest rates in order to keep inflation and employment near their targets.</p><p>BRIGGS: Police in Salt Lake City say University of Utah student missing for more than a week was last seen at a park before she vanished. Twenty-three-year-old Mackenzie Lueck arrived at the Salt Lake City International Airport in the early morning hours last Monday after visiting family members in California. She then took a Lyft ride to a park in north Salt Lake, miles from where she lived and has not been seen since.</p><p>Lyft and the driver are cooperating with police. The driver confirmed the route she took, telling police Mackenzie met someone after being dropped off.</p><p>ROAMSN: All right. The U.S. women's soccer team cruising through the World Cup until Monday's match-up with Spain. Andy Scholes with this morning's \"Bleacher Report\", next.</p><p>[05:23:06] BRIGGS: All right. Team USA onto the quarterfinals in the Women's World Cup after beating Spain in a nail biter.</p><p>Andy Scholes has that story in the \"Bleacher Report\".</p><p>Good morning, my friend. Some argue questionable decision making by the coach and by the goaltender, but they survived.</p><p>ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, good morning, Dave.</p><p>This game much closer than most thought it was going to be. It was certainly a nail biter. Team USA bailed out by a questionable penalty in the second half. The score tied 1-1, Spanish player narrowly kicks Rose Lavelle in the box. Official calls a penalty. Megan Rapinoe nails down her second penalty of the game. USA squeaking by 2-1, setting up a huge quarterfinal matchup against France on Friday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MEGAN RAPINOE, TEAM USA MIDFIELDER: That's World Cup level great right there. You just -- you can't replicate it. There's no way to express it or teach it. That's what games are all about. Everybody is playing for their lives. So, that's the best part. I love it. This is the best stage.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHOLES: Yes, it's only a quarterfinal but most consider this the final of the World Cup. U.S. and France, favorites to win it all. Tickets for Friday's match-up in Paris have skyrocketed. Cheapest ticket, nearly $700. You can get into the Norway/England quarterfinal, meanwhile, for just 33 bucks.</p><p>All right. The Dodgers announcing they will join the White Sox and Nationals in extending their protective netting down the foul line. The team's president said the plans will be announced in the next couple of weeks. This comes as a young fan was hit in the head by a fouling ball on Sunday. That fan, Kaitlyn Salazar, explained what that felt like.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KAITLYN SALAZAR, HIT BY FOUL BALL: You know those movies where a bomb goes off and you hear an eerie sound and then like the scene starts to get fady and then everyone sounds like mumble?</p><p>[05:25:02] Yes, like that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHOLES: And there's greater scrutiny on fans safety as of late. A woman died last year after being hit by a line drive at Dodgers Stadium. And cries for more netting became louder after a 4-year-old girl was struck in the net after a line drive during a game in Houston last month.</p><p>All right. Finally, the Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo was named the NBA most valuable player last night at the NBA Award Show. Giannis the third youngest ever to win the award.</p><p>It's quite the journey for the 24-year-old. He grew up selling sunglasses in the streets of Greece to try to get by. Now he's the NBA's best player. While accepting the award, Giannis got very emotional thinking of his dad who passed away two years ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO, NBA MVP AWARDEE: Every day that I step on the floor, I always think about my dad and that motivates me and it pushes me to play harder and move forward. Even though when my body sore, even though I don't feel like playing, I always going to show up and I always go do that. As my dad told me, you know, always one more.</p><p>My goal is to win a championship and I'm going to do whatever it takes to make that happen. Thank you, guys.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHOLES: Good stuff from Giannis there. The Mavs' Luka Doncic was named NBA rookie of the year. Definitely a fun on our sister station TNT -- Dave.</p><p>BRIGGS: It's a terrific story, Giannis. He wins the MVP about the same time LeBron did. So, a bright future for that young man.</p><p>And, Andy, you succeeded in sports when Christine Romans has brought the Kleenex by my floor director Jennings.</p><p>SCHOLES: My goal every morning.</p><p>BRIGGS: That's when you succeed, my friend.</p><p>ROMANS: No, such a quintessential American story. You know, the struggle such a --</p><p>BRIGGS: Son of a Nigerian immigrant, born in Athens. No money.</p><p>ROMANS: Exactly, and struggle is such a great motivator. That has been such a great American immigration story.</p><p>BRIGGS: Agree there.</p><p>ROMANS : Thanks, guys. Nice to see you this morning, Andy.</p><p>All right. Deplorable conditions for children held at the border. Billions in emergency funding, the help is on the line. But the liberal wing of the House Democrats want more to address humanitarian needs.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019062503CNV34</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDY-70G1-DXH2-60MX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3093\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 25, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Democratic Party</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Legislation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>E.

The sentiment spurred a sharp sell-off in tech stocks to start the week.</p><p>Cicilline said the investigation won't target one specific tech company, but rather focus on the broad belief that the \"Internet is broken,\" he told reporters. In doing so, he pointed out problematic practices at tech giants such as Google, which has faced sanctions in Europe for prioritizing its services in search over rivals, and Facebook, which Cicilline criticized for cloning and acquiring competitors to ensure its continued dominance in social networking.</p><p>Amazon and Apple also could figure into the committee's early plans, he said, cautioning the goal is a broader look at the industry.</p><p>\"In a lot of ways, there was a reluctance in the early days of the Internet to interfere,\" the Democratic lawmaker said. \"It was creating so much value in the lives of people that [some felt] you should get out of the way and allow it to flourish.\"</p><p>\"Over time,\" Cicilline continued, \"people have recognized there are some real dangers here.\"</p><p>Cicilline said Democrats would hold hearings, seek documents \u2014 even by subpoena, if necessary \u2014 and depose witnesses that could include the leaders of Silicon Valley's largest companies, who might also be asked to testify publicly. His office said that tech companies, for all their innovations, had created \"escalating crises,\" from eroding Americans' privacy rights to depriving ad revenue from cash-strapped local news outlets.</p><p>In recent days, the Trump administration has signaled that it, too, has set its sights on Silicon Valley, taking early steps to divvy up future competition oversight of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. The efforts by the US government's two antitrust enforcement agencies, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, could pave the way for more formal probes of each company's practices, though the agencies' exact interests aren't known.</p><p>Still, the early efforts won support even among Democratic presidential candidates, such as Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who long has called for breaking up big tech. Over the weekend, congressional Republicans also praised the Trump administration for turning its attention to the industry. \"This is very big news, and overdue,\" tweeted Missouri Senator Josh Hawley.</p><p>Amazon, Apple, and Facebook did not respond to requests for comment, and Google declined comment. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>The broad, bipartisan focus on Silicon Valley presents the whole of the tech industry with what could be its greatest political test after years of enjoying relatively smooth sailing in the nation's capital. Even when world regulators had sought to challenge these companies' business practices \u2014 Europe has fined Google $9 billion in just the last three years, for example \u2014 Washington had remained a staunch ally of Facebook, Google, and their peers.</p><p>The 2016 election, however, began to erode that political good will, as members of Congress began to realize the extent to which malicious actors could capitalize on social networks with vast, perhaps unchallenged reach to spread falsehoods in real time. A flood of privacy violations, particularly at Facebook, further reinforced for some lawmakers the feeling that big tech giants had enriched themselves on their users' personal information \u2014 and left people with little option for alternative services to use.</p><p>\"For a while, tech could do no wrong. They were the font of all innovation, and good things, and progress and democracy,\" said Rob Atkinson, the president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank that counts Apple and Microsoft on its board of directors. \"And now the bloom is off the rose.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-e7087b02-8649-11e9-b17f-4c6d0235a5f4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W88-WB91-JC2G-C02Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"752\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 4, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The House Antitrust Sub...</p><p>By Ryan Tracy   WASHINGTON -- Democratic lawmakers are expected to call on Congress to blunt the power of big technology companies, possibly through forced separation of online platforms, as a House panel concludes its Big Tech probe.    The House Antitrust Subcommittee is nearing completion of a report wrapping up its 15-month investigation of Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., and Facebook Inc. The report follows the committee's collection of more than one million documents from the companies and competitors, as well as a July hearing with CEOs of the four tech giants.    Rep. David Cicilline (D., R.I.), who chairs the subcommittee, has indicated the panel is poised to recommend significant measures targeting Big Tech's power, including requiring owners of huge technology platforms to separate those platforms from other businesses.    Mr. Cicilline hasn't released details, but such a law could potentially ban Amazon from competing with sellers on Amazon.com, or Google from offering services that consumers look for on its search engine.    \"You can't set all the rules, control the marketplace and also sell on it, in the way that Amazon does, for example,\" Mr. Cicilline said in a recent podcast for the Brookings Institution think tank.    The committee's final report could include the platform-separation idea among a series of policy options, Mr. Cicilline has said. Others include boosting the budgets of U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies, amending U.S. antitrust laws with an eye toward making them less permissive and mandating \"interoperability\" so that consumers and businesses can more easily move from one tech platform to another.    Republicans say the inquiry left them concerned about the companies' power in digital markets, but differ on how to address the problem.    \"I don't think there's any doubt that both sides think there is a problem,\" said Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R., N.D.), a member of the committee. But broad measures requiring Big Tech to separate lines of business could affect other industries that also operate online, an issue Congress would have to study, he said.    \"We would be better served by attacking very narrow problem sets and seeing if we could come up with a solution,\" he said, pointing to bipartisan concern about Amazon's treatment of third-party sellers on its marketplace, among other issues.    Republicans also say existing antitrust laws are sufficient to bring enforcement actions against large tech companies.    Any proposal to separate big tech platforms' businesses would face stiff opposition from the industry. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, at the committee hearing July 29, said he doesn't believe it is a conflict of interest for Amazon to sell products on the e-marketplace it controls.    \"The consumer is the one ultimately making the decisions. They're making the decisions about what to buy, what price to buy it at, who to buy it from,\" said Mr. Bezos. He appeared before the committee via video along with Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai.    Amazon has also noted that other retailers sell self-made products in their stores and that it faces competition in the sales of many products. Its detractors say its position as the first website many consumers search for products means its power is greater than other retailers.    Mr. Cicilline hasn't explained in detail how the breakup proposal would apply to specific companies, though he has implied it might not be necessary for every platform.    \"It's clear that some of these dominant platforms must be broken up. All of them must be regulated,\" he said during a virtual event with progressive groups on Sept. 1.    The congressman has called the idea \"Glass-Steagall for the Internet,\" invoking a 1933 law that divided traditional banking businesses from Wall Street investment banks.    A different precedent was cited in a May Columbia Law Review article by Lina Khan, one of his top staffers. She invoked the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, a still-effective law that restricts banks from engaging in nonfinancial businesses, and other historical laws requiring business separations in the railroad and telecommunications industries.    \"One feature dominant digital platforms share is that they have integrated across business lines such that they both operate a platform and market their own goods and services on it,\" Ms. Khan wrote. \"This structure places dominant platforms in direct competition with some of the businesses that depend on them, creating a conflict of interest that platforms can exploit to further entrench their dominance, thwart competition, and stifle innovation.\"    Opponents of a Glass-Steagall-like proposal say customers can move on if a platform doesn't offer a diverse, competitive set of options, and that it is fair for companies to make a profit off their creations.    \"A rule separating platforms and commerce doesn't seem to have any actual benefits in terms of innovation and consumer welfare, but it does seem to have the very real cost of making it harder for them to make money on the platforms that we want them to invest in,\" said Sam Bowman, director of competition policy at the International Center for Law &amp; Economics, a think tank that has received funding from companies including Google.    The platform-separation idea is just one of several circulating in Washington to curb Big Tech's power.    The Trump administration is investigating the companies for antitrust violations and could bring lawsuits against Google and Facebook, The Wall Street Journal has reported. One possible outcome of a lawsuit would be a court order breaking up the companies, though President Trump hasn't called for that.    Former Vice President Joe Biden hasn't called for breakups either, even as progressives pressed him to do so during the Democratic primary, but he has said Big Tech's market power warrants scrutiny.    Some former Obama administration officials are advocating a new agency with authority to enforce codes of conduct on the platforms to outlaw self-dealing and anticompetitive behavior. Tom Wheeler, who chaired the Federal Communications Commission during the Obama administration, backed that idea in August and it has been pitched to the Biden campaign, people familiar with the matter say.

See you then.</p><p>BREAM: We begin tonight with a Fox News alert. Breaking tonight, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says President Trump is not worth impeaching. But that sparking a firestorm on the left where some though it is going to happen. It's just a matter of time.</p><p>Tonight's announcement follows a week of internal Democratic Party chaos. And the Democrats struggled with the socialism label heats up as they announce the site of next year's convention, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p><p>A smart Republican say is perfect since its elected three socialist mayors.</p><p>Plus, from socialism to slavery reparations to legalizing prostitution, it is all on the table with a popular hip-hop radio show host who are shaking up the script. Getting personal with the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, the hosts of the powerhouse Breakfast Club join us live to talk about how it is becoming a Democratic campaign trail must-stop.</p><p>Hello and welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT. I'm Shannon Bream in Washington.</p><p>We begin tonight with correspondent Kristin Fisher in tonight's bombshell from Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The top Democrat is saying the president is not worth impeaching. She's not going to support the move, but some other feels very differently about that.</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. This was quite an interview from Speaker Pelosi. We've known for some time that the Democratic leadership has been wary of this rush to impeach from members of their own caucus.</p><p>But now, Speaker Pelosi has finally come out and publicly said that she is not for impeachment. In an interview just released by the Washington Post,\" she says quote, \"Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country, and he's just not worth it.\"</p><p>Democratic congressman, Adam Schiff, is backing up Speaker Pelosi by saying tonight that only graphic evidence would warrant an impeachment gamble against President Trump.</p><p>But that line of thinking will put the Democratic leadership at odds with many members of their own party, including Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib who's already said that she's planning to introduce articles of impeachment against President Trump by the end of this month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D), MICHIGAN: If we don't hold impeachment proceedings today, start them today, and hold him accountable to following the United States constitution. Think about that. This is not going to be the last CEO that runs for president of the United States. This is not going to be the last person that tries to get away with this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FISHER: So President Trump and Speaker Pelosi may finally agree on one thing. No impeachment. But they still disagree on most everything else, especially the new budget proposal put forward by the White House today.</p><p>Pelosi called it cruel and shortsighted. She said, quote, \"The cruel and shortsighted cuts in President Trump's budget request are a roadmap to a sicker, weaker America. House Democrats will reject this toxic, destructive, budget request which would hollow out our national strength and failed to meet the needs of the American people.\"</p><p>The White House says that this budget proposal is aimed at keeping Americans safe by increasing defense spending and including more than $8 billion for the border wall. But it's also slashing funding for many domestic programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSS VOUGHT, ACTING DIRECTOR, OMB: Washington has a spending problem and it endangers the future prosperity of our nation for generations to come. This budget contains nearly $2.7 trillion in savings, more spending reductions proposed than any administration in history.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FISHER: But even with those savings, this budget proposal would still push the federal deficit past $1 trillion. The White House is asking for a huge number for fiscal year 2020, a record $4.7 trillion.</p><p>It's a big number, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: It is. And they've got to answer some questions about that.</p><p>FISHER: And it's just a proposal. Not --</p><p>BREAM: yes.</p><p>FISHER: Just a blueprint.</p><p>BREAM: Yes. And we remember seeing President Obama's proposals voted down like 99 to nothing. So we know that the president's proposal is just a place for Congress to start.</p><p>FISHER: Just a place to start.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Thank you.</p><p>FISHER: Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: Well, Wisconsin Republicans say they are not surprised the Democratic Party picked Milwaukee for next year's National Convention because of the city's strong ties they say to socialism.</p><p>Correspondent David Spunt has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOM BARRETT (D), MAYOR OF MILWAUKEE: I want to welcome to Milwaukee the 2020 Democratic National Convention.</p><p>DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: On a cold Milwaukee afternoon, it became clear July 2020 will be hot.</p><p>TOM PEREZ, CHAIRMAN, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE: Our democracies on fire. It's a five alarm blaze and we have first responders in this room and elsewhere prepared to take back our democracy.</p><p>SPUNT: Milwaukee beat out Houston and Miami for the DNC bid, and it's the only major city that counts three socialist mayors in its history. The Wisconsin Republican Party put out a statement, quote, \"No city in America has stronger ties to socialism than Milwaukee. And with the rise of Bernie Sanders and the embrace of socialism by its newest leaders, the American left has come full circle.\" End quote.</p><p>Speaking of Sanders, he's number two on a new national international Monmouth University poll which tested 20 different candidates. Sanders has been a proud Democratic socialist for decades and he's three percent behind former vice president, Joe Biden, who has yet to announce a run.</p><p>Sanders is at the top of the pack in a recent Emerson Poll focusing on New Hampshire.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT: In 2016, this is where the political revolution took off.

JOHN HICKENLOOPER (D-CO), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Once you get back into these labels, am I a capitalist, am I a socialist? How much of -- how much of a capitalist am I versus how much of a socialist?

He brushes off any criticism that he could hurt the Democrats chance to win the White House.

David, thank you.</p><p>All right. They featured interviews with the nation's most prominent hip- hop stars and celebrities. But now, the popular radio show is also a must- stop media spot for 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. Senators Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Cory Booker among others have all stopped in.</p><p>Joining me now from the nationally syndicated radio show, the Breakfast Club on Power 105.1 in New York City. DJ Envy, Angela Yee, and Charlamagne tha God. Welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT. Great to have you, guys.</p><p>RAASHAUN CASEY, AMERICAN DISC JOCKEY: Hey, thanks for having us.</p><p>ANGELA YEE, AMERICAN RADIO PERSONALITY: Hi, Shannon.</p><p>LENARD LARRY MCKELVEY, AMERICAN RADIO PRESENTER: What's happening?</p><p>BREAM: Listen, I got to read something from the Daily Beast. This how they describe you, saying, \"The world's most dangerous morning show. Charlamagne tha God and his co-host DJ Envy and Angela Yee conduct lengthy interviews with politicians in which the cultural weight of the show and the informality of its interviews often force media train presidential hopeful to let down their guard and get more personal.\"</p><p>Angela, I know you said people are in danger if they come and try to act cool and it's not real. How does that go?</p><p>YEE: Well, I think part of the issue is that we're not political pundits. So people come on the show and they're used to talking about things like their policies and things that are very rehearsed.</p><p>But when you come on the Breakfast Club, we might ask you about anything. And I think for people, they also want to answer for our audience. So they might say things to make them sound like more hip than normal.</p><p>BREAM: Well, and you know, Senator Kamala Harris --</p><p>CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: You know --</p><p>BREAM: I'm sorry. Go ahead.</p><p>MCKELVEY: No. I was going to say, you know, when you talk to a politician, they've got a talking point for everything, especially when you talk to them about politics.</p><p>BREAM: Yes, that's the truth. We find that out every time we have one on.</p><p>Senator Kamala Harris who has gotten a lot of attention, very popular, pulling near the top, even though -- away from the first cluster, but she's definitely in the mix.</p><p>I want to play something that she talked about with you guys that got a lot of attention.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D), CALIFORNIA: I am absolutely in favor of legalizing marijuana.</p><p>MCKELVEY: Have ever smoked?</p><p>HARRIS: I have.</p><p>MCKELVEY: OK. In college or --</p><p>HARRIS: And I inhaled. I did -- I did inhale.</p><p>MCKELVEY: What were you listening to when you were high?</p><p>CASEY: What was on? What song was it? Was it Snoop?</p><p>HARRIS: Oh, my goodness. Oh, yes, definitely Snoop. Tupac, for sure.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: I mean, guys, that was a big moment. You just keep making national news with these interviews.</p><p>CASEY: That question was a little crazy because I asked her what she listened to and my cohost over here was still on the weed question. And it got a little blurry. But she was talking about what she listen to. She says she listened Tupac. She listened to Snoop and it kind of got blurred with Charlamagne's weed question.</p><p>MCKELVEY: Fox News, you did that. You all took that out of context. You all started that.</p><p>BREAM: I will tell you, it wasn't me.</p><p>MCKELVEY: You all did that.</p><p>BREAM: But I can always double-check on that.</p><p>Who do you guys want who hasn't stopped by yet?</p><p>MCKELVEY: I mean, the interesting thing is not like we sit around and we send out these requests for different people. It's just like whoever wants to come. We have a platform. 2020 is wide open. A lot of people are looking to see who they want to vote for in 2020.</p><p>So we're interested in anybody who's running, who wants to get the word out.</p><p>YEE: I wouldn't mind to have Elizabeth Warren on. I think she'd be --</p><p>MCKELVEY: Elizabeth Warren would be great.</p><p>CASEY: Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>CASEY: Anybody on both sides though. Democratic, Republican. It doesn't matter. We would love to talk to anybody.</p><p>MCKELVEY: And I like Julian Castro. I saw him make a very great statement today when he came to reparations. So I would love to have him on.</p><p>BREAM: Yes. I mean, that's something that you've talked about with Bernie -- Senator Bernie Sanders. I mean, he is in the top one or two slots in almost all of the new polls. It's him and the former vice president and who's not technically in.</p><p>What did you make of Bernie's answer on that?</p><p>MCKELVEY: Oh, I didn't like his answer at all because it seemed to be something he wasn't considering or it's just something he wants to -- he wants some type of form of reparations. Well, he seemed like he wasn't for the reparations thing at all.</p><p>CASEY: Kind of avoiding the question a little bit.</p><p>MCKELVEY: Yes.</p><p>YEE: Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY: I wasn't digging his answers.</p><p>YEE: I think it's important to have solutions. Like to see if there's an issue that we have, so here are some solutions, here are some possibilities of how we can make that happen instead of dodging a question.</p><p>MCKELVEY: Absolutely.</p><p>BREAM: Well, and Hillary Clinton back in 2016, she made a lot of news for this exchange when she was on your show. We want to play.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YEE: What's something that you always carry with you?</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: Hot sauce.</p><p>CASEY: Really?</p><p>CLINTON: Yes.</p><p>CASEY: Really?</p><p>MCKELVEY: You're giving information right now?</p><p>CASEY: Hot sauce.</p><p>MCKELVEY: Hot sauce in my bag? What?</p><p>CLINTON: Hot sauce.</p><p>MCKELVEY: Really?</p><p>CLINTON: Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY: Now, listen, I'd want you to know people are going to see this and say, OK. She's pandering to black people.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLINTON: OK. Is it working?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: She got a lot of heat for that. What did you guys make of that exchange? Because that kind of set the bar for stopping by to your show.</p><p>MCKELVEY: I mean, I said it to her in that moment, you know, this is one of those times when people are going to think that you're pandering the black people.</p><p>But she has said that she likes hot sauce in previous interviews decades earlier. So maybe she wasn't pandering.</p><p>But the best part about that exchange was when she looked me in the eye and say --</p><p>YEE: \"Is it working?\"</p><p>MCKELVEY: \"Is it working?\" That's a very honest response.</p><p>YEE: You know, after that, I had to do some research myself and I did go back and see that she talk about it in various other outlets. And she's been talking about it for years. But most people won't do that research to see. This is something real.</p><p>MCKELVEY: Yes. I don't know how much it worked because --</p><p>CASEY: People still think that's pandering.</p><p>MCKELVEY: Well, no, she didn't win.</p><p>CASEY: No, she didn't win.</p><p>YEE: She did not -- well, technically.</p><p>BREAM: OK. Well, that's in the history books.</p><p>Let me ask about the guy who did win. How would you guys handle an interview with President Trump?</p><p>(LAUGHS)</p><p>MCKELVEY: I don't think that'll go well.</p><p>CASEY: I think that will go amazing, actually. He would have to be honest.</p><p>YEE: I don't think that he would be comfortable answering any questions from us. I doubt that he would stay for a full interview with us. Just because there's a lot of issues that I have with things that he says that had been problematic for us and our people.</p><p>Things that we hear that Michael Cohen is even coming forward and saying that he said in private to him, so.</p><p>MCKELVEY: I don't think he would come because I don't think he cares about our audience. I mean, there's nothing about Donald Trump that makes me think he cares about black and brown people.</p><p>YEE: There's a lot of hurtful things that he says. Personally he had offended me.</p><p>BREAM: Yes. I mean, something that he talks about a lot is the low unemployment rate, historically low, for African-Americans and for the Hispanic community. It is something he likes to talk about. If he thought he had a platform with you guys, would he be welcome?</p><p>CASEY: Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY: Yes, he definitely will be welcomed. It's very important to know that started with Barack Obama. It was the policies that Barack Obama implemented that caused the unemployment rate to be so low for African- Americans now and Donald Trump is taking credit for it.</p><p>BREAM: Well, you know, he loves to joust. He loves to fight. He would love to debate that with you guys. So he might actually come and stick around. I think he might enjoy it.</p><p>YEE: Let's have him come on.</p><p>BREAM: He might --</p><p>CASEY: I would love for him to come.</p><p>YEE: Even when he gets asked questions at the White House with reporters. He'll ban you if he doesn't like your questions, so.</p><p>MCKELVEY: Yes. And tell him pull up. We'll get him -- we'll get him some fast food. We'll get him some little White Castle sliders that fit his little hands.</p><p>CASEY: Some McDonald's. Some McDonald's too.</p><p>BREAM: You know he loves the fast food.</p><p>OK. So if he's listening tonight, because sometimes he does watch, go ahead and make your pitch to him.</p><p>MCKELVEY: I'm not --</p><p>CASEY: We're not pitching it.</p><p>YEE: I mean, we're not really excited.</p><p>MCKELVEY: If he's smart, he will come up here.</p><p>CASEY: If he wants to pull up -- he can pull up any time.</p><p>MCKELVEY: It's not something that we want. It's not something that we're requesting. I'm not about to make no pitch.</p><p>CASEY: No, we're not pitching for him. But if he wants to come, he's invited.</p><p>BREAM: OK. And there might be some snacks involved.</p><p>YEE: He should face --</p><p>BREAM: The Breakfast show. World's most dangerous morning show. Keep making news. We'll keep watching.</p><p>MCKELVEY: Yes.</p><p>BREAM: Thank you, guys, very much.</p><p>MCKELVEY: Thank you very much. Thank you for having us.</p><p>BREAM: All right. The speaker says no-go to progressive plans to impeach the president. The Mueller's special counsel reported isn't even in yet. So, why is she taking plan b off the table?</p><p>Our power panel is here to weigh in. They are standing by right there for you. They're next.</p><p>Plus, the latest on the Boeing 737 Max crash. Lawmakers calling for the aircraft to be grounded. Will it affect your travel plans?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JOHN YARMUTH (D), KENTUCKY: To me it's not a question of whether, it's a question of when and probably right now is not the right time but I think at some point it's going to be inevitable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: Reaction still coming in to Speaker Pelosi telling the Washington Post she is not for impeaching President Trump. Time now for tonight's power panel, the President of Open Primaries, John Opdycke, the director of Strategic Communications for Trump 2020, Marc Lotter, and Fox News Contributor, former Utah Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz. Welcome to all of you.</p><p>JOHN OPDYCKE, PRESIDENT, OPEN PRIMARIES: Good evening.</p><p>MARC LOTTER, DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS FOR TRUMP 2020: Hi, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: OK. So just to remind, folks, this is the quote from Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker. She says impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country and he's just not worth it. Marc?</p><p>LOTTER: What took her so long? It's been two years, 300,000 documents, hundreds of hours of interviews, and she's come to the same conclusion that President Trump said day one. No collusion. So I'm surprised that it took her that long to get there.</p><p>BREAM: All right. I want to read something from Politico today, it says, Dems have started the years of impeachment. Can they still turn back? It says interviews with more than a dozen key Democratic lawmakers revealed deep division within the caucus about whether their efforts could end up helping Trump win a second term in office. John, we've heard that from a lot of folks who worry that it will just mobilize his base.</p><p>OPDYCKE: Yes. I don't agree with Speaker Pelosi on much but I take her side on this. I think that moving in the impeachment direction will be a real disservice to the rich, robust political conversation that's taking place in the country right now. On a whole range of issues from Green New Deal, to Medicare for All, to immigration and so forth. And I think in some ways, the American people are deeply distrustful of Congress.</p><p>And to take this decision about who the next President is going to be out of the hands of the American people and put it in the hand of an institution the people don't have a lot of trust in right now, I think it's the wrong direction to go. I agree with Speaker Pelosi. Leave it up to the people.</p><p>BREAM: Well, Tom Steyer who is a billionaire, who has talked a lot about the political game. He's not running this time but he's supporting lot of other causes and folks and he has been all about impeachment from day one. He says this, he says Speaker Pelosi thinks he's just not worth it, well, is defending our legal system worth it? Is holding the President accountable for his crimes and cover ups worth it?</p><p>Is doing what's right worth it or shall America just stop fighting for our principles and so what's politically convenient, Jason?</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think Speaker Pelosi was right, other than the last part of the phrase that she offered there but our founders put up an exceptionally high bar. If she had an inkling, if she had some evidence, I think she would go for it. I think it's an admission that she doesn't have that evidence but she has a problem with their caucus because she's got 60 or so people that have already signed up for impeachment.</p><p>They've been promising this from the day Donald Trump was sworn in. The problem for the Democrats is they just don't have any evidence, and they don't have any facts to actually back something up and make the case because it would be a loser and the country knows that and she is smart enough to recognize that.</p><p>BREAM: Well, you know the committees that are coordinating in the 81 letters that went out last week looking into any number of things, from the Trump organization, to family members, to Russia, to everything else even though the special counsel were still waiting on that formal proceeding to close out. So it's clear that they're casting a net to look for some things. Aaron Blake at the Washington Post writes after the news of Speaker Pelosi today, he says, Pelosi's ability to tamp down impeachment fever could be one of the most significant battles of her speakership and these new comments are a line in the sand.</p><p>I mean, Marc, we're hearing a number of Democrats out tonight and saying or in recent days saying they still think and you hear Congressman Yarmuth, it's just a matter of time.</p><p>LOTTER: Yes. I mean, the number of investigations they're launching completely egregious but when you look at what were actually getting to and this is another bad week that is showing the Democrat Party is breaking apart right in front of our very eyes. I don't see where any of the 2020 Democratic candidates are out there rallying the base and inspiring their liberal donors with no impeachment. The radicals have taken over.</p><p>That's who controls their party right now and I am going to be very interested to see how their Presidential candidates try to balance what Speaker Pelosi is saying with the realities on the ground and trying to win in a very polarized, very radical party.</p><p>BREAM: OK. We're just getting in some news here, the New York Attorney General and we know that the President is facing a lot of trouble at the state level with the southern district of New York. Actually a Federal but they're in New York -- but there are -- the state A.G. has made a lot of noise too about conducting some investigations. The attorney general's office in New York late Monday issuing subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank for records relating to the financing of four major Trump organization projects at a failed effort to buy the buffalo bills of the National Football League.</p><p>John, what do you make about that? I mean, it seems like the President, it's going to be a long time before all these various investigations for multiple agencies are ever wrapped up.</p><p>OPDYCKE: Yes, and everybody knows that President Trump is a ruffian. That is beyond dispute. I think the tactical question, the political question that the Democrats have to take seriously is why not allow the people of this country to weigh in on that question? Why do you want to shortchange that with politically motivated investigations that even if they're correct, set up a situation that furthers the divisions in this country.</p><p>And frankly hold the Democrats back from pushing a lot of the issues that they're having a lot of traction with right now.</p><p>BREAM: Yes. And Jason, it seems like there is this internal split about some of these really big issues. We saw last week that it took them a week to put together the resolution that ended up condemning not only anti- Semitism but Islamophobia and white supremacy and all kinds of things. We thought it was ready for the floor then it's back then they're fighting again and now we understand that there is -- this internal split.</p><p>And some of it has gone public about this issue of impeachment but the Speaker also said that \"the party is unified.\"</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I don't think so. I think the Democrats are an absolute chaos. I mean, think about it. Bernie Sanders is the leader of the Democratic Party. He's not a member of the Democratic Party. He is registered as an Independent and really a socialist, so the leader of the Presidential candidates isn't even a member of their own party. And then they can't decide whether or not they hate the Jewish people are not and how are they going to actually articulate that in a pace, in a resolution instead of calling out the actual individual.</p><p>I don't think that all the -- all the Democrats hate Jews but you do have some that need to be called out specifically. The way Republicans did, like I did, with Mr. King when he stepped over the line. So again, it's a -- it's a -- it's a campaign that's in chaos, a party that can't define itself. And they're totally off message. And they have to explain to the American people why they think these socialist views are the right solution for America because America is not buying it.</p><p>BREAM: Well, Senator Elizabeth Warren is officially in the race said this weekend it is wrong to call her socialist. She doesn't support that. But we're going to talk more about and coming up how she's also wants to go after some big tech companies and break them up, so there's a lot there to digest. Power panel, thank you.</p><p>OPDYCKE: Just to say one thing in response to Congressman Chaffetz is that you say the American people are buying these things, I think the American people are deeply interested in having an honest conversation about many of the issues that progressives and socialists like Bernie Sanders and AOC are putting on the table. It doesn't mean they agree with them on everything but they want to talk about these things.</p><p>BREAM: Well, to leave it there. The keyword --</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Oh, I would love to talk about those issues.</p><p>BREAM: The keyword is honest --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Bring it on. Bring it on. You will drive the Democratic Party into the grave.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREAM: OK. I think the key there is honest and we can talk -- keep it factual. I think that it's important for the American people. They do want to talk about these things. But in the meantime, thank you gentlemen. Come back soon.</p><p>LOTTER: Thank you.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Coming up, caught in the act, dramatic surveillance footage of a transsexual woman accused of pepper spray attacks all across New York. We'll tell you what that's about. And Liz Warren breaking ranks with socialist Democrats but also vowing to take on big tech. We told you about that. She's proposing to break up some giant social media companies. Trace on the case.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WARREN: The giant tech companies right now are eating up little tiny businesses, start-ups, and competing unfairly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: A transgender woman has been arrested in New York. Police say, she might be behind a series of pepper spray attacks in Upper Manhattan. One couple says, the attacker allegedly approached them on the street, asked the woman if she was white, and then pepper sprayed her. The man tried to intervene, the attacker pulled out a knife, he says. Authorities say, 11 people were attacked over the weekend in suspected hate crimes.</p><p>We're awaiting information from the Black Box of the Ethiopian Airlines plane, the Boeing 737 Max 8 that crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all 157 people aboard, including at least eight Americans. The FAA says that planes are still air-worthy after two fatal crashes in less than six months. Correspondent Doug McKelway has the latest.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: At the United Nations today, a flag at half-staff, an honor of the 157 people killed, 21 of them U.N. staffers in Sunday's crash of an Ethiopian Airlines, Boeing 737.</p><p>ABBY AHMED, ETHIOPIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator): As we all know Ethiopian Airlines is a well-known airline that has not experienced such accidents for a long time.</p><p>MCKELWAY: It was the second Boeing 737 Max 8 to crash in the last five months. In the first, the like Lion Air Max 8 plane dove vertically into the sea, killing all 189 on board. In both cases, radar data showed there were similar violent oscillations, pitching up and down, before the planes crashed. But in the Lion Air case, there were other problems. That plane had maintenance issues with airspeed, altimeter and other gauges. The Max 8 is the latest generation Boeing's 737 with more power, more fuel- efficient engines. The bigger engines necessitated the redesign of the plane's trim controls. When the two trim control switches are turned off, and the plane is powered up, it causes a different reaction than in earlier models.</p><p>JOHN GOGLIA, FORMER NTSB INVESTIGATOR: When you apply full power to the airplane, it's going to drive the nose up. So, what Boeing did to counter that is they automated it.</p><p>MCKELWAY: But if the trim switch is turned off or malfunctioning, a poorly trained pilot might have problems. Over correcting for the nose up with a pitch down. It can produce what's called pilot induced oscillation, as seen in this 1978 NASA video. The first officer in the Ethiopian air crash had 200 hours of flying time, compared to a minimum of 1500 hours for U.S. first officers.</p><p>The flight and voice data recorders have been recovered. Ethiopian, Cayman Airways, and China have all grounded the Max 8, but neither the Boeing, the FAA nor Domestic Carriers United, American, or Southwest have. In December Boeing took a risk amid the ongoing trade war, opening a finishing facility in China, the world's largest growing airplane market. The first plane to roll out of that facility was a 737 Max 8. Shannon?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM: Doug McKelway, thank you very much. Two progressives, two different views, of what to do about big technology. Well, Senator Elizabeth Warren wants to better regulate big tech, Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez see's technology as a means to a post-capitalist end. Trace is on the case from our L.A. Newsroom. Trace.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Shannon. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren is well-aware that her views often draw comparisons to her Senate colleague Bernie Sanders, but Warren wants to make it clear unlike Sanders she's not a Democratic socialist. She supports capitalism, albeit with the right regulations. And in the process of building her campaign and defining her positions, the Massachusetts senator has laid out her plan to break up big technology -- a goal she shares with President Trump. For example, Warren would require regulators to go after massive mergers like Amazon buying Whole Foods and Facebook's ownership of Instagram. Watch.</p><p>WARREN: We want to keep that market place competitive, not let a giant who has an incredible information advantage, and a manipulative advantage, be able to snuff you out.</p><p>GALLAGHER: Oddly, today, Facebook took down a number of Warren's campaign ads saying she misused its company logo. Warren responded by citing Facebook's power to shut down debate. The ads have now been restored. Then, there's Democratic freshman Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who doesn't seem nearly as worried about big technology expanding or the rise of workplace robots. In fact, Ocasio-Cortez says, Americans should be excited to have their jobs automated, quoting: \"The reason we're not excited by it is because we live in a society where if you don't have a job, you are left to die. And that is, at its core, our problem.\" She points out that not having a job gives you more time.</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), NEW YORK: We should be excited about automation because what it could potentially mean is more time educating ourselves, more time creating art, more time investing and investigating in the sciences, more time focused on invention, more time going to space, more time enjoying the world that we live in.</p><p>GALLAGHER: In case you're wondering, the 29-year-old Ocasio-Cortez drew bigger crowds at South by Southwest than any other presidential candidates. Shannon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM: All right, Trace Gallagher, thank you very much. There is a new face of terror. Hamza bin Laden, the son of Osama bin Laden, has a giant bounty now on his head.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: As released audio and video messages on the Internet, calling on his followers to want to attack against the United States and its western allies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM: All right. So, will the man who killed Osama bin Laden, his father, Rob O'Neill, take a shot at finding his son? Rob joins us live to tell us what he thinks, next.</p><p>BREAM: Terror has a new face and he wants revenge on America. Officials are warning that Osama bin Laden's son is actively engaging in terrorism and is emerging as the leader of al-Qaeda. The State Department is offering a million-dollar reward for information on Hamza bin Laden's whereabouts, so let's talk to the guy who killed his dad, Osama bin Laden, former Navy SEAL Rob O'Neill. Good to have you with us again, Rob.</p><p>ROB O'NEILL, FORMER NAVY SEAL: Thank you, Shannon, for having me. I appreciate it.</p><p>BREAM: It may have been in jest, but we've got to put up on Twitter, there was a group that reached out to you and said, you know, we're assembling crew to go claim the $1 million bounty, are you in? You say maybe not legitimately, but you do think it's a worthy mission at this point.</p><p>O'NEILL: This is definitely a worthy mission, just to continue to prove that if terror rears its ugly head, we have men and women who are willing to go do it. You know, on a serious note, I would do everything asked of me to do, but we have younger, more seasoned guys that are out there right now. Some guys that were on the actual raid -- I don't know if we would risk that kind of a cross-border type thing that we did with Osama bin Laden, but something along the lines of the good men and women from the three letter agencies that find some intel on where he is and hit him with a drone strike. I think that Hamza bin Laden, at least, is smart enough to know that gets too cute and too cocky, he's going to stick his head out and he's going to get gotten.</p><p>BREAM: Well, apparently, he has reached out and started to make some noise over the last couple of years. He obviously is. We've talked about it. I mean, there are a number of his family members who have been taken out of this al-Qaeda fight and he's got a lot of skin in the game, as you've said. John Gambrell back in March, he says this, talking about Hamza bin Laden, began appearing in militant videos back as far as 2015. And he said this apparently, if you think that your sinful crime that you committed in Abbottabad has passed without punishment, then you thought wrong.\"</p><p>O'NEILL: Right, and the way that Hamza thinks, because of his brand of Islam that he follows, they're not going to worship of false idols, so it's not going to be revenge for the death of his father and his brother, and his other brother before them. It would be more to avenge the deaths of the defenders of Islam, as they call it. You know, because they're obviously very religious, in their own psychotic version of Islam. Yes, he's making it apparent that he's there and he remembers what happened and what's been going on.</p><p>And he thinks that we've oppressed everyone in Iraq, and in Iran, and in Pakistan and all that stuff. Al-Qaeda -- they're just on a strategic pause right now. This isn't an end. And they're going to sit there -- and like I've always said, ISIS loved the big headline and they stab in the front. Al-Qaeda is going to wait around and stab you in the back. They hit New York in 2003, tried to knock down the Trade Towers; and they didn't forget, they came back in 2001 and succeeded. So, you can't get complacent with these guys, because complacency will get you killed.</p><p>BREAM: What do you make of the price tag? Is it enough in the scenario to get people to turn him in?</p><p>O'NEILL: I mean, it could be but he is surrounded by some hardliners -- everyone, Taliban, and al-Qaeda guys are all around him. It's going to take a little bit of money for an outsider to sort of see in, especially considering what happened with the doctor in Abbottabad, Pakistan that sort of helped us try to locate Osama bin Laden. You know, he's not in a good place right now. And it's going to take five or 10 million which wouldn't be much for us. It worked with a lot of the Ba'ath party and (INAUDIBLE) Hussein in Iraq. It could work here again, but like, al-Qaeda is a lot more -- they're a lot more loyal to each other than the Ba'ath party was.</p><p>BREAM: Well -- and very quickly, we just have a few seconds, do you think he's probably in Pakistan?</p><p>O'NEILL: I would say pretty much in Pakistan. Yes, probably, in Pakistan or at least in the tribal regions where there's not a lot of law and they kind of protect him there. And weirdly enough, he's been cooperating with the Iranians. I believe he was pretty much raised in Iran under the cover of Iran, because that government can, even with the travel ban, probably help him travel certain places. So, it is scary, but he's in the area. I'm thinking right near (INAUDIBLE) of Pakistan.</p><p>BREAM: Well, as you said, and others have noted, don't mistake their pause for inactivity. They saying, you know, experts very much that they have the ability and the intent to come after the U.S. again.</p><p>O'NEILL: Oh, they definitely have the intent. That's what happens when you raise people from the time, they're infants to the time, the like, Hamza -- they're in their 30s, just to hate people because they don't believe what you believe. You get this kind of stuff.</p><p>BREAM: All right, Rob O'Neill, always great to see you. Thank you so much.</p><p>O'NEILL: Thanks, Shannon. I appreciate it.</p><p>BREAM: All right, the Supreme Court made it clear, public employees can no longer be forced to pay dues to a union they don't support. But five California public school teachers say, that is exactly what's happening to them and now, they are suing. We'll hear from their lawyer, we're going to debate both sides. Plus, the president joins the daylight savings time debate, should it stay or should it go?</p><p>BREAM: On the heels of six-day teachers strike in California, five teachers are now suing the state's top union over collecting dues through mandatory paycheck deductions. A practice that the Supreme Court calls on unconstitutional less than a year ago. All right, let's bring in former Aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, Chris Hahn; and the lawyer representing the teachers, you recognize her, Harmeet Dhillon. Thank you both for joining us.</p><p>HARMEET DHILLION, LAWYER: Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>CHRIS HAHN, FORMER AIDE TO SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER: Thanks for having us.</p><p>BREAM: All right. Harmeet, I just want you to clarify because Justice Alito was very clear. He said this, in the decision last year, we conclude that this arrangement violates the free-speech rights of nonmembers by compelling them to subsidize private speech on matters of substantial public concern, and he said, unless these people affirmatively consent to giving the money, the unions can't take it. Are you claiming that's what happening in California?</p><p>DHILLON: Exactly what's happening. So, our five clients working in conjunction with the freedom foundation, which has filed this type of lawsuit in other West Coast states as well, are claiming that they have opted out of their union card contracts. And despite having opted out, the union is not letting them out until the anniversary of their one-year contract. So, every pay period that their paychecks are being deducted, significant money in the case of the lead plaintiff, Bethany Mendez, $1500 a year on a pretty meager teacher's salary, a constitutional violation is occurring. And so, the Supreme Court was very clear that you cannot take this money unless there is a knowing and voluntary waiver of the First Amendment. And so, none of these teachers have made a voluntary waiver of the First Amendment rights.</p><p>BREAM: So, Chris, even if you didn't like the ruling from the Supreme Court, it was a tight 15-4 last year. Why shouldn't these teachers have the right to put their foot down over this?</p><p>HAHN: Well, they are. They signed a contract and they agreed to have these dues taken out. I always wonder where you find teachers who are willing to go against their own interests and fight their union which basically gives them a much better salary, much better benefits and much better working conditions than they would've gotten on their own, especially given the market where there are thousands of teachers coming out of colleges every single day for every single opening. These unions actually strengthen teachers and give them a better life at a fraction for what they are paying for these unions. So, I am shocked that these people are willing to be used this way. I hope that the kids that they teach are learning something because, god, these people don't seem to have learned much when they were in college.</p><p>DHILLON: Wow!</p><p>BREAM: But Chris, you know, like the plaintiffs in a couple of these big cases, before the Supreme Court have said, they're going out on -- and supporting political candidates and messages with my dues money that I 100 percent disagree with, and they don't feel like they should have to subsidize that speech. Does that make them terrible people?</p><p>HAHN: You know, it's funny. It's a slippery slope and, you know, when -- you know, we all pay for things we don't want going to support things we don't like. For example, I'd buy gasoline every day. Do I have a right to determine what we're going to -- what the gasoline company is going to do with the money I spend on it? You know, it's a very slippery slope. The Supreme Court got it wrong and it will be overturned when we get some reasonable members on that court.</p><p>BREAM: OK. Harmeet, the California Teachers Association, by the way, very brave statement, only responding this way, saying: \"It's another lawsuit from the Freedom Foundation to continue the attack on public education and public employees.\" Harmeet?</p><p>DHILLION: So, Chris just called these teachers stupid and said that their students are going to learn nothing, and he also ignore the fact that this is a constitutional violation. That's the difference between your gas analogy and what's going on here. And if you think about it in terms of a term that choice -- that the left loves which is freedom of choice, that's what these teachers are really looking for here. They're looking for the choice to be part of a union or not. And by the way, the sky doesn't fall when people aren't part of a union. Chris, as you know in the federal system, people are --</p><p>HAHN: They can opt out at the end of their contract. They opted in and now they're opting out.</p><p>DHILLON: Please don't interrupt me, Chris, I didn't interrupt you. In the federal system, people do not -- people are not required to be part of the union and the unions go on just fine. And so, no, when you have a constitutional right, it is not sufficient to you can opt out when we tell you can. After they opted out, Shannon, union sent thugs into the classroom to try to intimidate them into revoking their opt out.</p><p>HAHN: Stop. Thugs. Kindergarten teachers.</p><p>DHILLON: And so, this is not acceptable. And it is time for the state of California to follow the constitution as the Supreme Court says.</p><p>BREAM: Chris, you don't think that's OK, coercion, do you, Chris?</p><p>HAHN: No, of course not. But I also don't think that these teachers who are her clients understand how much they're being used by extreme right- wing groups that just want to break unions all over the country.</p><p>DHILLION: Yes, they're so dumb and you know better.</p><p>HANH: Well, look, they are clearly unaware of how they're being used, you know. So, it is a shame and I feel bad for them, because they're going to learn very soon if they their union does collapse, what their salaries would be in a free market, and it won't be good for them.</p><p>DHILLON: I think they're going to be just fine without all the coerced speech.</p><p>BREAM: Yes, a lot of people felt after the ruling last year that there would be a big threat to the unions falling apart, that kind of thing. We haven't seen that yet. So, we'll see and we'll watch this case and see who is right in their predictions.</p><p>HAHN: Not for trying of these groups, though, that's for sure.</p><p>BREAM: Chris and Harmeet, thank you both. Good to see you.</p><p>DHILLON: Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>HAHN: Thank you, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM: All right, coming up, is New York Mayor Bill de Blasio losing the forest for the trees, as the mayor tells kids to have meatless Mondays? Economists are warning the city is about to head into a financial crisis. That stories are in our \"REAL NEWS ROUND UP\", next.</p><p>BREAM: Well, a woman gets booted from a hearing on gun control after apparently texting about going on a shooting spree of her own. That story tops tonight's \"REAL NEWS ROUNDUP.\" The unidentified woman was ejected from a Connecticut State Senate hearing after she was reportedly spotted sending a text saying: if she had a gun, she'd \"blow away a Republican state lawmaker and a large group of NRAs.\" Connecticut capital police determined there was no threat. The woman was not arrested.</p><p>New York City implementing meatless Mondays in public schools, a move supporter say, promotes healthy, environmentally friendly meal options. The mayor says, cutting back on a little meat will help down on greenhouse gases and help save the planet. Meanwhile, some top economists are warning the city needs to focus instead on its financial health. One saying, New York is already in a difficult financial spot, but it would be in an impossible situation if we had any kind of setbacks.</p><p>President Trump lending support to do the push to do away with Daylight Savings Times. Arizona and Hawaii are the only states that do not observe the time change. The president tweeting today: \"Making Daylight Savings Time permanent is OK with me.\"</p><p>And the Supreme Court agreeing to hear the case of Eric (INAUDIBLE), who were denied a trademark for their line of street clothes by the Patent and Trademark Office because their brand is a variation of the F-word. That denial is based on an old federal law that requires the rejection of trademarks that are scandalous or immoral.</p><p>All right. Time now for our \"MIDNIGHT HERO\". 94-year-old, Mary Bochanis, was the longest-serving American Red Cross volunteer. She started volunteering in 1943 when she met her husband, Gus, and she never stopped volunteering. After her husband died in 2006, she just started volunteering more, she says. A Red Cross volunteer for 76 years.</p><p>Mary Bochanis died Thursday. She leaves behind an amazing legacy. So, she is our \"MIDNIGHT HERO\" tonight. Thank you for all those years of service to so many people. Most-watched, most trusted, and most grateful you spent your evening with us. Good night from Washington. I'm Shannon Bream.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019031101cb259</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMC-FV31-DXH2-62RN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7915\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 11, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>ST000CUQR</classCode><className>AL-QAEDA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

A new podcast drops tomorrow.  Subscribe at podcastone.com.  Shannon Bream and the FOX NEWS @ NIGHT team take it from here.  I'll be in New York tomorrow night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I will too.  I'll see you there, Laura.  Thank you so much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INGRAHAM:  All right.  See you then.</p><p>BREAM:  We begin tonight with a Fox News alert.  Breaking tonight, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says President Trump is not worth impeaching.  But that sparking a firestorm on the left where some though it is going to happen.  It's just a matter of time.</p><p>Tonight's announcement follows a week of internal Democratic Party chaos.  And the Democrats struggled with the socialism label heats up as they announce the site of next year's convention, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p><p>A smart Republican say is perfect since its elected three socialist mayors.</p><p>Plus, from socialism to slavery reparations to legalizing prostitution, it is all on the table with a popular hip-hop radio show host who are shaking up the script.  Getting personal with the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, the hosts of the powerhouse Breakfast Club join us live to talk about how it is becoming a Democratic campaign trail must-stop.</p><p>Hello and welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT.  I'm Shannon Bream in Washington.</p><p>We begin tonight with correspondent Kristin Fisher in tonight's bombshell from Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  The top Democrat is saying the president is not worth impeaching.  She's not going to support the move, but some other feels very differently about that.</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  This was quite an interview from Speaker Pelosi.  We've known for some time that the Democratic leadership has been wary of this rush to impeach from members of their own caucus.</p><p>But now, Speaker Pelosi has finally come out and publicly said that she is not for impeachment.  In an interview just released by the Washington Post,\" she says quote, \"Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country, and he's just not worth it.\"</p><p>Democratic congressman, Adam Schiff, is backing up Speaker Pelosi by saying tonight that only graphic evidence would warrant an impeachment gamble against President Trump.</p><p>But that line of thinking will put the Democratic leadership at odds with many members of their own party, including Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib who's already said that she's planning to introduce articles of impeachment against President Trump by the end of this month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D), MICHIGAN:  If we don't hold impeachment proceedings today, start them today, and hold him accountable to following the United States constitution.  Think about that.  This is not going to be the last CEO that runs for president of the United States.  This is not going to be the last person that tries to get away with this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FISHER:  So President Trump and Speaker Pelosi may finally agree on one thing.  No impeachment.  But they still disagree on most everything else, especially the new budget proposal put forward by the White House today.</p><p>Pelosi called it cruel and shortsighted.  She said, quote, \"The cruel and shortsighted cuts in President Trump's budget request are a roadmap to a sicker, weaker America.  House Democrats will reject this toxic, destructive, budget request which would hollow out our national strength and failed to meet the needs of the American people.\"</p><p>The White House says that this budget proposal is aimed at keeping Americans safe by increasing defense spending and including more than $8 billion for the border wall.  But it's also slashing funding for many domestic programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSS VOUGHT, ACTING DIRECTOR, OMB:  Washington has a spending problem and it endangers the future prosperity of our nation for generations to come.  This budget contains nearly $2.7 trillion in savings, more spending reductions proposed than any administration in history.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FISHER:  But even with those savings, this budget proposal would still push the federal deficit past $1 trillion.  The White House is asking for a huge number for fiscal year 2020, a record $4.7 trillion.</p><p>It's a big number, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  It is.  And they've got to answer some questions about that.</p><p>FISHER:  And it's just a proposal.  Not --</p><p>BREAM:  yes.</p><p>FISHER:  Just a blueprint.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  And we remember seeing President Obama's proposals voted down like 99 to nothing.  So we know that the president's proposal is just a place for Congress to start.</p><p>FISHER:  Just a place to start.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Thank you.</p><p>FISHER:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Wisconsin Republicans say they are not surprised the Democratic Party picked Milwaukee for next year's National Convention because of the city's strong ties they say to socialism.</p><p>Correspondent David Spunt has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOM BARRETT (D), MAYOR OF MILWAUKEE:  I want to welcome to Milwaukee the 2020 Democratic National Convention.</p><p>DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  On a cold Milwaukee afternoon, it became clear July 2020 will be hot.</p><p>TOM PEREZ, CHAIRMAN, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE:  Our democracies on fire.  It's a five alarm blaze and we have first responders in this room and elsewhere prepared to take back our democracy.</p><p>SPUNT:  Milwaukee beat out Houston and Miami for the DNC bid, and it's the only major city that counts three socialist mayors in its history.  The Wisconsin Republican Party put out a statement, quote, \"No city in America has stronger ties to socialism than Milwaukee.  And with the rise of Bernie Sanders and the embrace of socialism by its newest leaders, the American left has come full circle.\"  End quote.</p><p>Speaking of Sanders, he's number two on a new national international Monmouth University poll which tested 20 different candidates.  Sanders has been a proud Democratic socialist for decades and he's three percent behind former vice president, Joe Biden, who has yet to announce a run.</p><p>Sanders is at the top of the pack in a recent Emerson Poll focusing on New Hampshire.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT:  In 2016, this is where the political revolution took off.  Thank you, New Hampshire.</p><p>SPUNT:  Whether or not a candidate is a socialist is now a key question, a question that some candidates dismissed.</p><p>GOV. JOHN HICKENLOOPER (D-CO), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Once you get back into these labels, am I a capitalist, am I a socialist?  How much of -- how much of a capitalist am I versus how much of a socialist?  It becomes kind of silly, doesn't it?</p><p>SPUNT:  While others distanced themselves completely from the socialist label.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS:  Bernie has to speak to what Democratic socialism is.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And you are not one.</p><p>WARREN:  And I'm not.</p><p>HOWARD SCHULTZ, FORMER CHAIRMAN AND CEO, STARBUCKS:  We don't want a government takeover of our lives.</p><p>SPUNT:  Independent, Howard Schultz, thought he got a negative reaction from the crowd when he talked socialism.</p><p>SCHULTZ:  If you want a good description for socialism, I think just look at Venezuela.  It's a -- you don't like that?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SPUNT:  Howard Schultz said he'll make up his mind about a run by the summer.  He brushes off any criticism that he could hurt the Democrats chance to win the White House.  The convention in Wisconsin, Shannon, a state President Trump won in 2016.</p><p>BREAM:  I'm a -- Schultz will continue causing a lot of heartburn for folks out there, waiting for that decision.  David, thank you.</p><p>All right.  They featured interviews with the nation's most prominent hip-hop stars and celebrities.  But now, the popular radio show is also a must-stop media spot for 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.  Senators Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Cory Booker among others have all stopped in.</p><p>Joining me now from the nationally syndicated radio show, the Breakfast Club on Power 105.1 in New York City.  DJ Envy, Angela Yee, and Charlamagne tha God.  Welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT.  Great to have you, guys.</p><p>RAASHAUN CASEY, AMERICAN DISC JOCKEY:  Hey, thanks for having us.</p><p>ANGELA YEE, AMERICAN RADIO PERSONALITY:  Hi, Shannon.</p><p>LENARD LARRY MCKELVEY, AMERICAN RADIO PRESENTER:  What's happening?</p><p>BREAM:  Listen, I got to read something from the Daily Beast.  This how they describe you, saying, \"The world's most dangerous morning show.  Charlamagne tha God and his co-host DJ Envy and Angela Yee conduct lengthy interviews with politicians in which the cultural weight of the show and the informality of its interviews often force media train presidential hopeful to let down their guard and get more personal.\"</p><p>Angela, I know you said people are in danger if they come and try to act cool and it's not real.  How does that go?</p><p>YEE:  Well, I think part of the issue is that we're not political pundits.  So people come on the show and they're used to talking about things like their policies and things that are very rehearsed.</p><p>But when you come on the Breakfast Club, we might ask you about anything.  And I think for people, they also want to answer for our audience.  So they might say things to make them sound like more hip than normal.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, and you know, Senator Kamala Harris --</p><p>CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD:  You know --</p><p>BREAM:  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  No.  I was going to say, you know, when you talk to a politician, they've got a talking point for everything, especially when you talk to them about politics.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes, that's the truth.  We find that out every time we have one on.</p><p>Senator Kamala Harris who has gotten a lot of attention, very popular, pulling near the top, even though -- away from the first cluster, but she's definitely in the mix.</p><p>I want to play something that she talked about with you guys that got a lot of attention.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D), CALIFORNIA:  I am absolutely in favor of legalizing marijuana.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Have ever smoked?</p><p>HARRIS:  I have.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  OK.  In college or --</p><p>HARRIS:  And I inhaled.  I did -- I did inhale.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  What were you listening to when you were high?</p><p>CASEY:  What was on?  What song was it?  Was it Snoop?</p><p>HARRIS:  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, yes, definitely Snoop.  Tupac, for sure.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  I mean, guys, that was a big moment.  You just keep making national news with these interviews.</p><p>CASEY:  That question was a little crazy because I asked her what she listened to and my cohost over here was still on the weed question.  And it got a little blurry.  But she was talking about what she listen to.  She says she listened Tupac.  She listened to Snoop and it kind of got blurred with Charlamagne's weed question.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Fox News, you did that.  You all took that out of context.  You all started that.</p><p>BREAM:  I will tell you, it wasn't me.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  You all did that.</p><p>BREAM:  But I can always double-check on that.</p><p>Who do you guys want who hasn't stopped by yet?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I mean, the interesting thing is not like we sit around and we send out these requests for different people.  It's just like whoever wants to come.  We have a platform.  2020 is wide open.  A lot of people are looking to see who they want to vote for in 2020.</p><p>So we're interested in anybody who's running, who wants to get the word out.</p><p>YEE:  I wouldn't mind to have Elizabeth Warren on.  I think she'd be --</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Elizabeth Warren would be great.</p><p>CASEY:  Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>CASEY:  Anybody on both sides though.  Democratic, Republican.  It doesn't matter.  We would love to talk to anybody.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  And I like Julian Castro.  I saw him make a very great statement today when he came to reparations.  So I would love to have him on.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  I mean, that's something that you've talked about with Bernie -- Senator Bernie Sanders.  I mean, he is in the top one or two slots in almost all of the new polls.  It's him and the former vice president and who's not technically in.</p><p>What did you make of Bernie's answer on that?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Oh, I didn't like his answer at all because it seemed to be something he wasn't considering or it's just something he wants to -- he wants some type of form of reparations.  Well, he seemed like he wasn't for the reparations thing at all.</p><p>CASEY:  Kind of avoiding the question a little bit.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.</p><p>YEE:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I wasn't digging his answers.</p><p>YEE:  I think it's important to have solutions.  Like to see if there's an issue that we have, so here are some solutions, here are some possibilities of how we can make that happen instead of dodging a question.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Absolutely.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, and Hillary Clinton back in 2016, she made a lot of news for this exchange when she was on your show.  We want to play.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YEE:  What's something that you always carry with you?</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES:  Hot sauce.</p><p>CASEY:  Really?</p><p>CLINTON:  Yes.</p><p>CASEY:  Really?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  You're giving information right now?</p><p>CASEY:  Hot sauce.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Hot sauce in my bag?  What?</p><p>CLINTON:  Hot sauce.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Really?</p><p>CLINTON:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Now, listen, I'd want you to know people are going to see this and say, OK.  She's pandering to black people.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLINTON:  OK.  Is it working?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  She got a lot of heat for that.  What did you guys make of that exchange?  Because that kind of set the bar for stopping by to your show.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I mean, I said it to her in that moment, you know, this is one of those times when people are going to think that you're pandering the black people.</p><p>But she has said that she likes hot sauce in previous interviews decades earlier.  So maybe she wasn't pandering.</p><p>But the best part about that exchange was when she looked me in the eye and say --</p><p>YEE:  \"Is it working?\"</p><p>MCKELVEY:  \"Is it working?\"  That's a very honest response.</p><p>YEE:  You know, after that, I had to do some research myself and I did go back and see that she talk about it in various other outlets.  And she's been talking about it for years.  But most people won't do that research to see.  This is something real.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.  I don't know how much it worked because --</p><p>CASEY:  People still think that's pandering.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Well, no, she didn't win.</p><p>CASEY:  No, she didn't win.</p><p>YEE:  She did not -- well, technically.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  Well, that's in the history books.</p><p>Let me ask about the guy who did win.  How would you guys handle an interview with President Trump?</p><p>(LAUGHS)</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I don't think that'll go well.</p><p>CASEY:  I think that will go amazing, actually.  He would have to be honest.</p><p>YEE:  I don't think that he would be comfortable answering any questions from us.  I doubt that he would stay for a full interview with us.  Just because there's a lot of issues that I have with things that he says that had been problematic for us and our people.</p><p>Things that we hear that Michael Cohen is even coming forward and saying that he said in private to him, so.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I don't think he would come because I don't think he cares about our audience.  I mean, there's nothing about Donald Trump that makes me think he cares about black and brown people.</p><p>YEE:  There's a lot of hurtful things that he says.  Personally he had offended me.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  I mean, something that he talks about a lot is the low unemployment rate, historically low, for African-Americans and for the Hispanic community.  It is something he likes to talk about.  If he thought he had a platform with you guys, would he be welcome?</p><p>CASEY:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes, he definitely will be welcomed.  It's very important to know that started with Barack Obama.  It was the policies that Barack Obama implemented that caused the unemployment rate to be so low for African-Americans now and Donald Trump is taking credit for it.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, you know, he loves to joust.  He loves to fight.  He would love to debate that with you guys.  So he might actually come and stick around.  I think he might enjoy it.</p><p>YEE:  Let's have him come on.</p><p>BREAM:  He might --</p><p>CASEY:  I would love for him to come.</p><p>YEE:  Even when he gets asked questions at the White House with reporters.  He'll ban you if he doesn't like your questions, so.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.  And tell him pull up.  We'll get him -- we'll get him some fast food.  We'll get him some little White Castle sliders that fit his little hands.</p><p>CASEY:  Some McDonald's.  Some McDonald's too.</p><p>BREAM:  You know he loves the fast food.</p><p>OK.  So if he's listening tonight, because sometimes he does watch, go ahead and make your pitch to him.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I'm not --</p><p>CASEY:  We're not pitching it.</p><p>YEE:  I mean, we're not really excited.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  If he's smart, he will come up here.</p><p>CASEY:  If he wants to pull up -- he can pull up any time.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  It's not something that we want.  It's not something that we're requesting.  I'm not about to make no pitch.</p><p>CASEY:  No, we're not pitching for him.  But if he wants to come, he's invited.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  And there might be some snacks involved.</p><p>YEE:  He should face --</p><p>BREAM:  The Breakfast show.  World's most dangerous morning show.  Keep making news.  We'll keep watching.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.</p><p>BREAM:  Thank you, guys, very much.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Thank you very much.  Thank you for having us.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  The speaker says no-go to progressive plans to impeach the president.  The Mueller's special counsel reported isn't even in yet.  So, why is she taking plan b off the table?</p><p>Our power panel is here to weigh in.  They are standing by right there for you.  They're next.</p><p>Plus, the latest on the Boeing 737 Max crash.  Lawmakers calling for the aircraft to be grounded.  Will it affect your travel plans?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JOHN YARMUTH (D), KENTUCKY:  To me it's not a question of whether, it's a question of when and probably right now is not the right time but I think at some point it's going to be inevitable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  Reaction still coming in to Speaker Pelosi telling the Washington Post she is not for impeaching President Trump.  Time now for tonight's power panel, the President of Open Primaries, John Opdycke, the director of Strategic Communications for Trump 2020, Marc Lotter, and Fox News Contributor, former Utah Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz.  Welcome to all of you.</p><p>JOHN OPDYCKE, PRESIDENT, OPEN PRIMARIES:  Good evening.</p><p>MARC LOTTER, DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS FOR TRUMP 2020:  Hi, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  So just to remind, folks, this is the quote from Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker.  She says impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country and he's just not worth it.  Marc?</p><p>LOTTER:  What took her so long?  It's been two years, 300,000 documents, hundreds of hours of interviews, and she's come to the same conclusion that President Trump said day one.  No collusion.  So I'm surprised that it took her that long to get there.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  I want to read something from Politico today, it says, Dems have started the years of impeachment.  Can they still turn back?  It says interviews with more than a dozen key Democratic lawmakers revealed deep division within the caucus about whether their efforts could end up helping Trump win a second term in office.  John, we've heard that from a lot of folks who worry that it will just mobilize his base.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Yes.  I don't agree with Speaker Pelosi on much but I take her side on this.  I think that moving in the impeachment direction will be a real disservice to the rich, robust political conversation that's taking place in the country right now.  On a whole range of issues from Green New Deal, to Medicare for All, to immigration and so forth.  And I think in some ways, the American people are deeply distrustful of Congress.</p><p>And to take this decision about who the next President is going to be out of the hands of the American people and put it in the hand of an institution the people don't have a lot of trust in right now, I think it's the wrong direction to go.  I agree with Speaker Pelosi.  Leave it up to the people.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Tom Steyer who is a billionaire, who has talked a lot about the political game.  He's not running this time but he's supporting lot of other causes and folks and he has been all about impeachment from day one.  He says this, he says Speaker Pelosi thinks he's just not worth it, well, is defending our legal system worth it?  Is holding the President accountable for his crimes and cover ups worth it?</p><p>Is doing what's right worth it or shall America just stop fighting for our principles and so what's politically convenient, Jason?</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I think Speaker Pelosi was right, other than the last part of the phrase that she offered there but our founders put up an exceptionally high bar.  If she had an inkling, if she had some evidence, I think she would go for it.  I think it's an admission that she doesn't have that evidence but she has a problem with their caucus because she's got 60 or so people that have already signed up for impeachment.</p><p>They've been promising this from the day Donald Trump was sworn in.  The problem for the Democrats is they just don't have any evidence, and they don't have any facts to actually back something up and make the case because it would be a loser and the country knows that and she is smart enough to recognize that.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, you know the committees that are coordinating in the 81 letters that went out last week looking into any number of things, from the Trump organization, to family members, to Russia, to everything else even though the special counsel were still waiting on that formal proceeding to close out.  So it's clear that they're casting a net to look for some things.  Aaron Blake at the Washington Post writes after the news of Speaker Pelosi today, he says, Pelosi's ability to tamp down impeachment fever could be one of the most significant battles of her speakership and these new comments are a line in the sand.</p><p>I mean, Marc, we're hearing a number of Democrats out tonight and saying or in recent days saying they still think and you hear Congressman Yarmuth, it's just a matter of time.</p><p>LOTTER:  Yes.  I mean, the number of investigations they're launching completely egregious but when you look at what were actually getting to and this is another bad week that is showing the Democrat Party is breaking apart right in front of our very eyes.  I don't see where any of the 2020 Democratic candidates are out there rallying the base and inspiring their liberal donors with no impeachment.  The radicals have taken over.</p><p>That's who controls their party right now and I am going to be very interested to see how their Presidential candidates try to balance what Speaker Pelosi is saying with the realities on the ground and trying to win in a very polarized, very radical party.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  We're just getting in some news here, the New York Attorney General and we know that the President is facing a lot of trouble at the state level with the southern district of New York.  Actually a Federal but they're in New York -- but there are -- the state A.G. has made a lot of noise too about conducting some investigations.  The attorney general's office in New York late Monday issuing subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank for records relating to the financing of four major Trump organization projects at a failed effort to buy the buffalo bills of the National Football League.</p><p>John, what do you make about that?  I mean, it seems like the President, it's going to be a long time before all these various investigations for multiple agencies are ever wrapped up.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Yes, and everybody knows that President Trump is a ruffian.  That is beyond dispute.  I think the tactical question, the political question that the Democrats have to take seriously is why not allow the people of this country to weigh in on that question?  Why do you want to shortchange that with politically motivated investigations that even if they're correct, set up a situation that furthers the divisions in this country.</p><p>And frankly hold the Democrats back from pushing a lot of the issues that they're having a lot of traction with right now.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  And Jason, it seems like there is this internal split about some of these really big issues.  We saw last week that it took them a week to put together the resolution that ended up condemning not only anti-Semitism but Islamophobia and white supremacy and all kinds of things.  We thought it was ready for the floor then it's back then they're fighting again and now we understand that there is -- this internal split.</p><p>And some of it has gone public about this issue of impeachment but the Speaker also said that \"the party is unified.\"</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I don't think so.  I think the Democrats are an absolute chaos.  I mean, think about it.  Bernie Sanders is the leader of the Democratic Party.  He's not a member of the Democratic Party.  He is registered as an Independent and really a socialist, so the leader of the Presidential candidates isn't even a member of their own party.  And then they can't decide whether or not they hate the Jewish people are not and how are they going to actually articulate that in a pace, in a resolution instead of calling out the actual individual.</p><p>I don't think that all the -- all the Democrats hate Jews but you do have some that need to be called out specifically.  The way Republicans did, like I did, with Mr. King when he stepped over the line.  So again, it's a -- it's a -- it's a campaign that's in chaos, a party that can't define itself.  And they're totally off message.  And they have to explain to the American people why they think these socialist views are the right solution for America because America is not buying it.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Senator Elizabeth Warren is officially in the race said this weekend it is wrong to call her socialist.  She doesn't support that.  But we're going to talk more about and coming up how she's also wants to go after some big tech companies and break them up, so there's a lot there to digest.  Power panel, thank you.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Just to say one thing in response to Congressman Chaffetz is that you say the American people are buying these things, I think the American people are deeply interested in having an honest conversation about many of the issues that progressives and socialists like Bernie Sanders and AOC are putting on the table.  It doesn't mean they agree with them on everything but they want to talk about these things.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, to leave it there.  The keyword --</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Oh, I would love to talk about those issues.</p><p>BREAM:  The keyword is honest --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Bring it on.  Bring it on.  You will drive the Democratic Party into the grave.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  I think the key there is honest and we can talk -- keep it factual.  I think that it's important for the American people.  They do want to talk about these things.  But in the meantime, thank you gentlemen.  Come back soon.</p><p>LOTTER:  Thank you.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Coming up, caught in the act, dramatic surveillance footage of a transsexual woman accused of pepper spray attacks all across New York.  We'll tell you what that's about.  And Liz Warren breaking ranks with socialist Democrats but also vowing to take on big tech.  We told you about that.  She's proposing to break up some giant social media companies.  Trace on the case.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WARREN:  The giant tech companies right now are eating up little tiny businesses, start-ups, and competing unfairly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  A transgender woman has been arrested in New York.  Police say, she might be behind a series of pepper spray attacks in Upper Manhattan.  One couple says, the attacker allegedly approached them on the street, asked the woman if she was white, and then pepper sprayed her.  The man tried to intervene, the attacker pulled out a knife, he says.  Authorities say, 11 people were attacked over the weekend in suspected hate crimes.</p><p>We're awaiting information from the Black Box of the Ethiopian Airlines plane, the Boeing 737 Max 8 that crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all 157 people aboard, including at least eight Americans.  The FAA says that planes are still air-worthy after two fatal crashes in less than six months.  Correspondent Doug McKelway has the latest.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  At the United Nations today, a flag at half-staff, an honor of the 157 people killed, 21 of them U.N. staffers in Sunday's crash of an Ethiopian Airlines, Boeing 737.</p><p>ABBY AHMED, ETHIOPIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  As we all know Ethiopian Airlines is a well-known airline that has not experienced such accidents for a long time.</p><p>MCKELWAY:  It was the second Boeing 737 Max 8 to crash in the last five months.  In the first, the like Lion Air Max 8 plane dove vertically into the sea, killing all 189 on board.  In both cases, radar data showed there were similar violent oscillations, pitching up and down, before the planes crashed.  But in the Lion Air case, there were other problems.  That plane had maintenance issues with airspeed, altimeter and other gauges.  The Max 8 is the latest generation Boeing's 737 with more power, more fuel-efficient engines.  The bigger engines necessitated the redesign of the plane's trim controls.  When the two trim control switches are turned off, and the plane is powered up, it causes a different reaction than in earlier models.</p><p>JOHN GOGLIA, FORMER NTSB INVESTIGATOR:  When you apply full power to the airplane, it's going to drive the nose up.  So, what Boeing did to counter that is they automated it.</p><p>MCKELWAY:  But if the trim switch is turned off or malfunctioning, a poorly trained pilot might have problems.  Over correcting for the nose up with a pitch down.  It can produce what's called pilot induced oscillation, as seen in this 1978 NASA video.  The first officer in the Ethiopian air crash had 200 hours of flying time, compared to a minimum of 1500 hours for U.S. first officers.</p><p>The flight and voice data recorders have been recovered.  Ethiopian, Cayman Airways, and China have all grounded the Max 8, but neither the Boeing, the FAA nor Domestic Carriers United, American, or Southwest have.  In December Boeing took a risk amid the ongoing trade war, opening a finishing facility in China, the world's largest growing airplane market.  The first plane to roll out of that facility was a 737 Max 8.  Shannon?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM:  Doug McKelway, thank you very much.  Two progressives, two different views, of what to do about big technology.  Well, Senator Elizabeth Warren wants to better regulate big tech, Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez see's technology as a means to a post-capitalist end.  Trace is on the case from our L.A. Newsroom.  Trace.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Shannon.  Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren is well-aware that her views often draw comparisons to her Senate colleague Bernie Sanders, but Warren wants to make it clear unlike Sanders she's not a Democratic socialist.  She supports capitalism, albeit with the right regulations.  And in the process of building her campaign and defining her positions, the Massachusetts senator has laid out her plan to break up big technology -- a goal she shares with President Trump.  For example, Warren would require regulators to go after massive mergers like Amazon buying Whole Foods and Facebook's ownership of Instagram.  Watch.</p><p>WARREN:  We want to keep that market place competitive, not let a giant who has an incredible information advantage, and a manipulative advantage, be able to snuff you out.</p><p>GALLAGHER:  Oddly, today, Facebook took down a number of Warren's campaign ads saying she misused its company logo.  Warren responded by citing Facebook's power to shut down debate.  The ads have now been restored.  Then, there's Democratic freshman Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who doesn't seem nearly as worried about big technology expanding or the rise of workplace robots.  In fact, Ocasio-Cortez says, Americans should be excited to have their jobs automated, quoting: \"The reason we're not excited by it is because we live in a society where if you don't have a job, you are left to die.  And that is, at its core, our problem.\"  She points out that not having a job gives you more time.</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), NEW YORK:  We should be excited about automation because what it could potentially mean is more time educating ourselves, more time creating art, more time investing and investigating in the sciences, more time focused on invention, more time going to space, more time enjoying the world that we live in.</p><p>GALLAGHER:  In case you're wondering, the 29-year-old Ocasio-Cortez drew bigger crowds at South by Southwest than any other presidential candidates.  Shannon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM:  All right, Trace Gallagher, thank you very much.  There is a new face of terror.  Hamza bin Laden, the son of Osama bin Laden, has a giant bounty now on his head.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  As released audio and video messages on the Internet, calling on his followers to want to attack against the United States and its western allies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  So, will the man who killed Osama bin Laden, his father, Rob O'Neill, take a shot at finding his son?  Rob joins us live to tell us what he thinks, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  Terror has a new face and he wants revenge on America.  Officials are warning that Osama bin Laden's son is actively engaging in terrorism and is emerging as the leader of al-Qaeda.  The State Department is offering a million-dollar reward for information on Hamza bin Laden's whereabouts, so let's talk to the guy who killed his dad, Osama bin Laden, former Navy SEAL Rob O'Neill.  Good to have you with us again, Rob.</p><p>ROB O'NEILL, FORMER NAVY SEAL:  Thank you, Shannon, for having me.  I appreciate it.</p><p>BREAM:  It may have been in jest, but we've got to put up on Twitter, there was a group that reached out to you and said, you know, we're assembling crew to go claim the $1 million bounty, are you in?  You say maybe not legitimately, but you do think it's a worthy mission at this point.</p><p>O'NEILL:  This is definitely a worthy mission, just to continue to prove that if terror rears its ugly head, we have men and women who are willing to go do it.  You know, on a serious note, I would do everything asked of me to do, but we have younger, more seasoned guys that are out there right now.  Some guys that were on the actual raid -- I don't know if we would risk that kind of a cross-border type thing that we did with Osama bin Laden, but something along the lines of the good men and women from the three letter agencies that find some intel on where he is and hit him with a drone strike.  I think that Hamza bin Laden, at least, is smart enough to know that gets too cute and too cocky, he's going to stick his head out and he's going to get gotten.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, apparently, he has reached out and started to make some noise over the last couple of years.  He obviously is.  We've talked about it.  I mean, there are a number of his family members who have been taken out of this al-Qaeda fight and he's got a lot of skin in the game, as you've said.  John Gambrell back in March, he says this, talking about Hamza bin Laden, began appearing in militant videos back as far as 2015.  And he said this apparently, if you think that your sinful crime that you committed in Abbottabad has passed without punishment, then you thought wrong.\"</p><p>O'NEILL:  Right, and the way that Hamza thinks, because of his brand of Islam that he follows, they're not going to worship of false idols, so it's not going to be revenge for the death of his father and his brother, and his other brother before them.  It would be more to avenge the deaths of the defenders of Islam, as they call it.  You know, because they're obviously very religious, in their own psychotic version of Islam.  Yes, he's making it apparent that he's there and he remembers what happened and what's been going on.</p><p>And he thinks that we've oppressed everyone in Iraq, and in Iran, and in Pakistan and all that stuff.  Al-Qaeda -- they're just on a strategic pause right now.  This isn't an end.  And they're going to sit there -- and like I've always said, ISIS loved the big headline and they stab in the front.  Al-Qaeda is going to wait around and stab you in the back.  They hit New York in 2003, tried to knock down the Trade Towers; and they didn't forget, they came back in 2001 and succeeded.  So, you can't get complacent with these guys, because complacency will get you killed.</p><p>BREAM:  What do you make of the price tag?  Is it enough in the scenario to get people to turn him in?</p><p>O'NEILL:  I mean, it could be but he is surrounded by some hardliners -- everyone, Taliban, and al-Qaeda guys are all around him.  It's going to take a little bit of money for an outsider to sort of see in, especially considering what happened with the doctor in Abbottabad, Pakistan that sort of helped us try to locate Osama bin Laden.  You know, he's not in a good place right now.  And it's going to take five or 10 million which wouldn't be much for us.  It worked with a lot of the Ba'ath party and (INAUDIBLE) Hussein in Iraq.  It could work here again, but like, al-Qaeda is a lot more -- they're a lot more loyal to each other than the Ba'ath party was.</p><p>BREAM:  Well -- and very quickly, we just have a few seconds, do you think he's probably in Pakistan?</p><p>O'NEILL:  I would say pretty much in Pakistan.  Yes, probably, in Pakistan or at least in the tribal regions where there's not a lot of law and they kind of protect him there.  And weirdly enough, he's been cooperating with the Iranians.  I believe he was pretty much raised in Iran under the cover of Iran, because that government can, even with the travel ban, probably help him travel certain places.  So, it is scary, but he's in the area.  I'm thinking right near (INAUDIBLE) of Pakistan.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, as you said, and others have noted, don't mistake their pause for inactivity.  They saying, you know, experts very much that they have the ability and the intent to come after the U.S. again.</p><p>O'NEILL:  Oh, they definitely have the intent.  That's what happens when you raise people from the time, they're infants to the time, the like, Hamza -- they're in their 30s, just to hate people because they don't believe what you believe.  You get this kind of stuff.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, Rob O'Neill, always great to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>O'NEILL:  Thanks, Shannon.  I appreciate it.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, the Supreme Court made it clear, public employees can no longer be forced to pay dues to a union they don't support.  But five California public school teachers say, that is exactly what's happening to them and now, they are suing.  We'll hear from their lawyer, we're going to debate both sides.  Plus, the president joins the daylight savings time debate, should it stay or should it go?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  On the heels of six-day teachers strike in California, five teachers are now suing the state's top union over collecting dues through mandatory paycheck deductions.  A practice that the Supreme Court calls on unconstitutional less than a year ago.  All right, let's bring in former Aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, Chris Hahn; and the lawyer representing the teachers, you recognize her, Harmeet Dhillon.  Thank you both for joining us.</p><p>HARMEET DHILLION, LAWYER:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>CHRIS HAHN, FORMER AIDE TO SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER:  Thanks for having us.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Harmeet, I just want you to clarify because Justice Alito was very clear.  He said this, in the decision last year, we conclude that this arrangement violates the free-speech rights of nonmembers by compelling them to subsidize private speech on matters of substantial public concern, and he said, unless these people affirmatively consent to giving the money, the unions can't take it.  Are you claiming that's what happening in California?</p><p>DHILLON:  Exactly what's happening.  So, our five clients working in conjunction with the freedom foundation, which has filed this type of lawsuit in other West Coast states as well, are claiming that they have opted out of their union card contracts.  And despite having opted out, the union is not letting them out until the anniversary of their one-year contract.  So, every pay period that their paychecks are being deducted, significant money in the case of the lead plaintiff, Bethany Mendez, $1500 a year on a pretty meager teacher's salary, a constitutional violation is occurring.  And so, the Supreme Court was very clear that you cannot take this money unless there is a knowing and voluntary waiver of the First Amendment.  And so, none of these teachers have made a voluntary waiver of the First Amendment rights.</p><p>BREAM:  So, Chris, even if you didn't like the ruling from the Supreme Court, it was a tight 15-4 last year.  Why shouldn't these teachers have the right to put their foot down over this?</p><p>HAHN:  Well, they are.  They signed a contract and they agreed to have these dues taken out.  I always wonder where you find teachers who are willing to go against their own interests and fight their union which basically gives them a much better salary, much better benefits and much better working conditions than they would've gotten on their own, especially given the market where there are thousands of teachers coming out of colleges every single day for every single opening.  These unions actually strengthen teachers and give them a better life at a fraction for what they are paying for these unions.  So, I am shocked that these people are willing to be used this way.  I hope that the kids that they teach are learning something because, god, these people don't seem to have learned much when they were in college.</p><p>DHILLON: Wow!</p><p>BREAM:  But Chris, you know, like the plaintiffs in a couple of these big cases, before the Supreme Court have said, they're going out on -- and supporting political candidates and messages with my dues money that I 100 percent disagree with, and they don't feel like they should have to subsidize that speech.  Does that make them terrible people?</p><p>HAHN:  You know, it's funny.  It's a slippery slope and, you know, when -- you know, we all pay for things we don't want going to support things we don't like.  For example, I'd buy gasoline every day.  Do I have a right to determine what we're going to -- what the gasoline company is going to do with the money I spend on it?  You know, it's a very slippery slope.  The Supreme Court got it wrong and it will be overturned when we get some reasonable members on that court.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  Harmeet, the California Teachers Association, by the way, very brave statement, only responding this way, saying: \"It's another lawsuit from the Freedom Foundation to continue the attack on public education and public employees.\"  Harmeet?</p><p>DHILLION:  So, Chris just called these teachers stupid and said that their students are going to learn nothing, and he also ignore the fact that this is a constitutional violation.  That's the difference between your gas analogy and what's going on here.  And if you think about it in terms of a term that choice -- that the left loves which is freedom of choice, that's what these teachers are really looking for here.  They're looking for the choice to be part of a union or not.  And by the way, the sky doesn't fall when people aren't part of a union.  Chris, as you know in the federal system, people are --</p><p>HAHN:  They can opt out at the end of their contract.  They opted in and now they're opting out.</p><p>DHILLON:  Please don't interrupt me, Chris, I didn't interrupt you.  In the federal system, people do not -- people are not required to be part of the union and the unions go on just fine.  And so, no, when you have a constitutional right, it is not sufficient to you can opt out when we tell you can.  After they opted out, Shannon, union sent thugs into the classroom to try to intimidate them into revoking their opt out.</p><p>HAHN:  Stop.  Thugs.  Kindergarten teachers.</p><p>DHILLON:  And so, this is not acceptable.  And it is time for the state of California to follow the constitution as the Supreme Court says.</p><p>BREAM:  Chris, you don't think that's OK, coercion, do you, Chris?</p><p>HAHN:  No, of course not.  But I also don't think that these teachers who are her clients understand how much they're being used by extreme right-wing groups that just want to break unions all over the country.</p><p>DHILLION:  Yes, they're so dumb and you know better.</p><p>HANH:  Well, look, they are clearly unaware of how they're being used, you know.  So, it is a shame and I feel bad for them, because they're going to learn very soon if they their union does collapse, what their salaries would be in a free market, and it won't be good for them.</p><p>DHILLON:  I think they're going to be just fine without all the coerced speech.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes, a lot of people felt after the ruling last year that there would be a big threat to the unions falling apart, that kind of thing.  We haven't seen that yet.  So, we'll see and we'll watch this case and see who is right in their predictions.</p><p>HAHN:  Not for trying of these groups, though, that's for sure.</p><p>BREAM:  Chris and Harmeet, thank you both.  Good to see you.</p><p>DHILLON:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>HAHN:  Thank you, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, coming up, is New York Mayor Bill de Blasio losing the forest for the trees, as the mayor tells kids to have meatless Mondays?  Economists are warning the city is about to head into a financial crisis.  That stories are in our \"REAL NEWS ROUND UP\", next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  Well, a woman gets booted from a hearing on gun control after apparently texting about going on a shooting spree of her own.  That story tops tonight's \"REAL NEWS ROUNDUP.\"  The unidentified woman was ejected from a Connecticut State Senate hearing after she was reportedly spotted sending a text saying: if she had a gun, she'd \"blow away a Republican state lawmaker and a large group of NRAs.\"  Connecticut capital police determined there was no threat.  The woman was not arrested.</p><p>New York City implementing meatless Mondays in public schools, a move supporter say, promotes healthy, environmentally friendly meal options.  The mayor says, cutting back on a little meat will help down on greenhouse gases and help save the planet.

A new podcast drops tomorrow.  Subscribe at podcastone.com.  Shannon Bream and the FOX NEWS @ NIGHT team take it from here.  I'll be in New York tomorrow night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I will too.  I'll see you there, Laura.  Thank you so much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INGRAHAM:  All right.  See you then.</p><p>BREAM:  We begin tonight with a Fox News alert.  Breaking tonight, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says President Trump is not worth impeaching.  But that sparking a firestorm on the left where some though it is going to happen.  It's just a matter of time.</p><p>Tonight's announcement follows a week of internal Democratic Party chaos.  And the Democrats struggled with the socialism label heats up as they announce the site of next year's convention, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p><p>A smart Republican say is perfect since its elected three socialist mayors.</p><p>Plus, from socialism to slavery reparations to legalizing prostitution, it is all on the table with a popular hip-hop radio show host who are shaking up the script.  Getting personal with the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, the hosts of the powerhouse Breakfast Club join us live to talk about how it is becoming a Democratic campaign trail must-stop.</p><p>Hello and welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT.  I'm Shannon Bream in Washington.</p><p>We begin tonight with correspondent Kristin Fisher in tonight's bombshell from Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  The top Democrat is saying the president is not worth impeaching.  She's not going to support the move, but some other feels very differently about that.</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  This was quite an interview from Speaker Pelosi.  We've known for some time that the Democratic leadership has been wary of this rush to impeach from members of their own caucus.</p><p>But now, Speaker Pelosi has finally come out and publicly said that she is not for impeachment.  In an interview just released by the Washington Post,\" she says quote, \"Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country, and he's just not worth it.\"</p><p>Democratic congressman, Adam Schiff, is backing up Speaker Pelosi by saying tonight that only graphic evidence would warrant an impeachment gamble against President Trump.</p><p>But that line of thinking will put the Democratic leadership at odds with many members of their own party, including Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib who's already said that she's planning to introduce articles of impeachment against President Trump by the end of this month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D), MICHIGAN:  If we don't hold impeachment proceedings today, start them today, and hold him accountable to following the United States constitution.  Think about that.  This is not going to be the last CEO that runs for president of the United States.  This is not going to be the last person that tries to get away with this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FISHER:  So President Trump and Speaker Pelosi may finally agree on one thing.  No impeachment.  But they still disagree on most everything else, especially the new budget proposal put forward by the White House today.</p><p>Pelosi called it cruel and shortsighted.  She said, quote, \"The cruel and shortsighted cuts in President Trump's budget request are a roadmap to a sicker, weaker America.  House Democrats will reject this toxic, destructive, budget request which would hollow out our national strength and failed to meet the needs of the American people.\"</p><p>The White House says that this budget proposal is aimed at keeping Americans safe by increasing defense spending and including more than $8 billion for the border wall.  But it's also slashing funding for many domestic programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSS VOUGHT, ACTING DIRECTOR, OMB:  Washington has a spending problem and it endangers the future prosperity of our nation for generations to come.  This budget contains nearly $2.7 trillion in savings, more spending reductions proposed than any administration in history.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FISHER:  But even with those savings, this budget proposal would still push the federal deficit past $1 trillion.  The White House is asking for a huge number for fiscal year 2020, a record $4.7 trillion.</p><p>It's a big number, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  It is.  And they've got to answer some questions about that.</p><p>FISHER:  And it's just a proposal.  Not --</p><p>BREAM:  yes.</p><p>FISHER:  Just a blueprint.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  And we remember seeing President Obama's proposals voted down like 99 to nothing.  So we know that the president's proposal is just a place for Congress to start.</p><p>FISHER:  Just a place to start.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Thank you.</p><p>FISHER:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Wisconsin Republicans say they are not surprised the Democratic Party picked Milwaukee for next year's National Convention because of the city's strong ties they say to socialism.</p><p>Correspondent David Spunt has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOM BARRETT (D), MAYOR OF MILWAUKEE:  I want to welcome to Milwaukee the 2020 Democratic National Convention.</p><p>DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  On a cold Milwaukee afternoon, it became clear July 2020 will be hot.</p><p>TOM PEREZ, CHAIRMAN, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE:  Our democracies on fire.  It's a five alarm blaze and we have first responders in this room and elsewhere prepared to take back our democracy.</p><p>SPUNT:  Milwaukee beat out Houston and Miami for the DNC bid, and it's the only major city that counts three socialist mayors in its history.  The Wisconsin Republican Party put out a statement, quote, \"No city in America has stronger ties to socialism than Milwaukee.  And with the rise of Bernie Sanders and the embrace of socialism by its newest leaders, the American left has come full circle.\"  End quote.</p><p>Speaking of Sanders, he's number two on a new national international Monmouth University poll which tested 20 different candidates.  Sanders has been a proud Democratic socialist for decades and he's three percent behind former vice president, Joe Biden, who has yet to announce a run.</p><p>Sanders is at the top of the pack in a recent Emerson Poll focusing on New Hampshire.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT:  In 2016, this is where the political revolution took off.  Thank you, New Hampshire.</p><p>SPUNT:  Whether or not a candidate is a socialist is now a key question, a question that some candidates dismissed.</p><p>GOV. JOHN HICKENLOOPER (D-CO), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Once you get back into these labels, am I a capitalist, am I a socialist?  How much of -- how much of a capitalist am I versus how much of a socialist?  It becomes kind of silly, doesn't it?</p><p>SPUNT:  While others distanced themselves completely from the socialist label.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS:  Bernie has to speak to what Democratic socialism is.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And you are not one.</p><p>WARREN:  And I'm not.</p><p>HOWARD SCHULTZ, FORMER CHAIRMAN AND CEO, STARBUCKS:  We don't want a government takeover of our lives.</p><p>SPUNT:  Independent, Howard Schultz, thought he got a negative reaction from the crowd when he talked socialism.</p><p>SCHULTZ:  If you want a good description for socialism, I think just look at Venezuela.  It's a -- you don't like that?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SPUNT:  Howard Schultz said he'll make up his mind about a run by the summer.  He brushes off any criticism that he could hurt the Democrats chance to win the White House.  The convention in Wisconsin, Shannon, a state President Trump won in 2016.</p><p>BREAM:  I'm a -- Schultz will continue causing a lot of heartburn for folks out there, waiting for that decision.  David, thank you.</p><p>All right.  They featured interviews with the nation's most prominent hip-hop stars and celebrities.  But now, the popular radio show is also a must-stop media spot for 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.  Senators Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Cory Booker among others have all stopped in.</p><p>Joining me now from the nationally syndicated radio show, the Breakfast Club on Power 105.1 in New York City.  DJ Envy, Angela Yee, and Charlamagne tha God.  Welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT.  Great to have you, guys.</p><p>RAASHAUN CASEY, AMERICAN DISC JOCKEY:  Hey, thanks for having us.</p><p>ANGELA YEE, AMERICAN RADIO PERSONALITY:  Hi, Shannon.</p><p>LENARD LARRY MCKELVEY, AMERICAN RADIO PRESENTER:  What's happening?</p><p>BREAM:  Listen, I got to read something from the Daily Beast.  This how they describe you, saying, \"The world's most dangerous morning show.  Charlamagne tha God and his co-host DJ Envy and Angela Yee conduct lengthy interviews with politicians in which the cultural weight of the show and the informality of its interviews often force media train presidential hopeful to let down their guard and get more personal.\"</p><p>Angela, I know you said people are in danger if they come and try to act cool and it's not real.  How does that go?</p><p>YEE:  Well, I think part of the issue is that we're not political pundits.  So people come on the show and they're used to talking about things like their policies and things that are very rehearsed.</p><p>But when you come on the Breakfast Club, we might ask you about anything.  And I think for people, they also want to answer for our audience.  So they might say things to make them sound like more hip than normal.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, and you know, Senator Kamala Harris --</p><p>CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD:  You know --</p><p>BREAM:  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  No.  I was going to say, you know, when you talk to a politician, they've got a talking point for everything, especially when you talk to them about politics.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes, that's the truth.  We find that out every time we have one on.</p><p>Senator Kamala Harris who has gotten a lot of attention, very popular, pulling near the top, even though -- away from the first cluster, but she's definitely in the mix.</p><p>I want to play something that she talked about with you guys that got a lot of attention.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D), CALIFORNIA:  I am absolutely in favor of legalizing marijuana.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Have ever smoked?</p><p>HARRIS:  I have.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  OK.  In college or --</p><p>HARRIS:  And I inhaled.  I did -- I did inhale.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  What were you listening to when you were high?</p><p>CASEY:  What was on?  What song was it?  Was it Snoop?</p><p>HARRIS:  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, yes, definitely Snoop.  Tupac, for sure.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  I mean, guys, that was a big moment.  You just keep making national news with these interviews.</p><p>CASEY:  That question was a little crazy because I asked her what she listened to and my cohost over here was still on the weed question.  And it got a little blurry.  But she was talking about what she listen to.  She says she listened Tupac.  She listened to Snoop and it kind of got blurred with Charlamagne's weed question.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Fox News, you did that.  You all took that out of context.  You all started that.</p><p>BREAM:  I will tell you, it wasn't me.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  You all did that.</p><p>BREAM:  But I can always double-check on that.</p><p>Who do you guys want who hasn't stopped by yet?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I mean, the interesting thing is not like we sit around and we send out these requests for different people.  It's just like whoever wants to come.  We have a platform.  2020 is wide open.  A lot of people are looking to see who they want to vote for in 2020.</p><p>So we're interested in anybody who's running, who wants to get the word out.</p><p>YEE:  I wouldn't mind to have Elizabeth Warren on.  I think she'd be --</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Elizabeth Warren would be great.</p><p>CASEY:  Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>CASEY:  Anybody on both sides though.  Democratic, Republican.  It doesn't matter.  We would love to talk to anybody.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  And I like Julian Castro.  I saw him make a very great statement today when he came to reparations.  So I would love to have him on.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  I mean, that's something that you've talked about with Bernie -- Senator Bernie Sanders.  I mean, he is in the top one or two slots in almost all of the new polls.  It's him and the former vice president and who's not technically in.</p><p>What did you make of Bernie's answer on that?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Oh, I didn't like his answer at all because it seemed to be something he wasn't considering or it's just something he wants to -- he wants some type of form of reparations.  Well, he seemed like he wasn't for the reparations thing at all.</p><p>CASEY:  Kind of avoiding the question a little bit.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.</p><p>YEE:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I wasn't digging his answers.</p><p>YEE:  I think it's important to have solutions.  Like to see if there's an issue that we have, so here are some solutions, here are some possibilities of how we can make that happen instead of dodging a question.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Absolutely.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, and Hillary Clinton back in 2016, she made a lot of news for this exchange when she was on your show.  We want to play.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YEE:  What's something that you always carry with you?</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES:  Hot sauce.</p><p>CASEY:  Really?</p><p>CLINTON:  Yes.</p><p>CASEY:  Really?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  You're giving information right now?</p><p>CASEY:  Hot sauce.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Hot sauce in my bag?  What?</p><p>CLINTON:  Hot sauce.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Really?</p><p>CLINTON:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Now, listen, I'd want you to know people are going to see this and say, OK.  She's pandering to black people.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLINTON:  OK.  Is it working?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  She got a lot of heat for that.  What did you guys make of that exchange?  Because that kind of set the bar for stopping by to your show.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I mean, I said it to her in that moment, you know, this is one of those times when people are going to think that you're pandering the black people.</p><p>But she has said that she likes hot sauce in previous interviews decades earlier.  So maybe she wasn't pandering.</p><p>But the best part about that exchange was when she looked me in the eye and say --</p><p>YEE:  \"Is it working?\"</p><p>MCKELVEY:  \"Is it working?\"  That's a very honest response.</p><p>YEE:  You know, after that, I had to do some research myself and I did go back and see that she talk about it in various other outlets.  And she's been talking about it for years.  But most people won't do that research to see.  This is something real.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.  I don't know how much it worked because --</p><p>CASEY:  People still think that's pandering.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Well, no, she didn't win.</p><p>CASEY:  No, she didn't win.</p><p>YEE:  She did not -- well, technically.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  Well, that's in the history books.</p><p>Let me ask about the guy who did win.  How would you guys handle an interview with President Trump?</p><p>(LAUGHS)</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I don't think that'll go well.</p><p>CASEY:  I think that will go amazing, actually.  He would have to be honest.</p><p>YEE:  I don't think that he would be comfortable answering any questions from us.  I doubt that he would stay for a full interview with us.  Just because there's a lot of issues that I have with things that he says that had been problematic for us and our people.</p><p>Things that we hear that Michael Cohen is even coming forward and saying that he said in private to him, so.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I don't think he would come because I don't think he cares about our audience.  I mean, there's nothing about Donald Trump that makes me think he cares about black and brown people.</p><p>YEE:  There's a lot of hurtful things that he says.  Personally he had offended me.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  I mean, something that he talks about a lot is the low unemployment rate, historically low, for African-Americans and for the Hispanic community.  It is something he likes to talk about.  If he thought he had a platform with you guys, would he be welcome?</p><p>CASEY:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes, he definitely will be welcomed.  It's very important to know that started with Barack Obama.  It was the policies that Barack Obama implemented that caused the unemployment rate to be so low for African-Americans now and Donald Trump is taking credit for it.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, you know, he loves to joust.  He loves to fight.  He would love to debate that with you guys.  So he might actually come and stick around.  I think he might enjoy it.</p><p>YEE:  Let's have him come on.</p><p>BREAM:  He might --</p><p>CASEY:  I would love for him to come.</p><p>YEE:  Even when he gets asked questions at the White House with reporters.  He'll ban you if he doesn't like your questions, so.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.  And tell him pull up.  We'll get him -- we'll get him some fast food.  We'll get him some little White Castle sliders that fit his little hands.</p><p>CASEY:  Some McDonald's.  Some McDonald's too.</p><p>BREAM:  You know he loves the fast food.</p><p>OK.  So if he's listening tonight, because sometimes he does watch, go ahead and make your pitch to him.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I'm not --</p><p>CASEY:  We're not pitching it.</p><p>YEE:  I mean, we're not really excited.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  If he's smart, he will come up here.</p><p>CASEY:  If he wants to pull up -- he can pull up any time.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  It's not something that we want.  It's not something that we're requesting.  I'm not about to make no pitch.</p><p>CASEY:  No, we're not pitching for him.  But if he wants to come, he's invited.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  And there might be some snacks involved.</p><p>YEE:  He should face --</p><p>BREAM:  The Breakfast show.  World's most dangerous morning show.  Keep making news.  We'll keep watching.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.</p><p>BREAM:  Thank you, guys, very much.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Thank you very much.  Thank you for having us.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  The speaker says no-go to progressive plans to impeach the president.  The Mueller's special counsel reported isn't even in yet.  So, why is she taking plan b off the table?</p><p>Our power panel is here to weigh in.  They are standing by right there for you.  They're next.</p><p>Plus, the latest on the Boeing 737 Max crash.  Lawmakers calling for the aircraft to be grounded.  Will it affect your travel plans?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JOHN YARMUTH (D), KENTUCKY:  To me it's not a question of whether, it's a question of when and probably right now is not the right time but I think at some point it's going to be inevitable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  Reaction still coming in to Speaker Pelosi telling the Washington Post she is not for impeaching President Trump.  Time now for tonight's power panel, the President of Open Primaries, John Opdycke, the director of Strategic Communications for Trump 2020, Marc Lotter, and Fox News Contributor, former Utah Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz.  Welcome to all of you.</p><p>JOHN OPDYCKE, PRESIDENT, OPEN PRIMARIES:  Good evening.</p><p>MARC LOTTER, DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS FOR TRUMP 2020:  Hi, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  So just to remind, folks, this is the quote from Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker.  She says impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country and he's just not worth it.  Marc?</p><p>LOTTER:  What took her so long?  It's been two years, 300,000 documents, hundreds of hours of interviews, and she's come to the same conclusion that President Trump said day one.  No collusion.  So I'm surprised that it took her that long to get there.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  I want to read something from Politico today, it says, Dems have started the years of impeachment.  Can they still turn back?  It says interviews with more than a dozen key Democratic lawmakers revealed deep division within the caucus about whether their efforts could end up helping Trump win a second term in office.  John, we've heard that from a lot of folks who worry that it will just mobilize his base.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Yes.  I don't agree with Speaker Pelosi on much but I take her side on this.  I think that moving in the impeachment direction will be a real disservice to the rich, robust political conversation that's taking place in the country right now.  On a whole range of issues from Green New Deal, to Medicare for All, to immigration and so forth.  And I think in some ways, the American people are deeply distrustful of Congress.</p><p>And to take this decision about who the next President is going to be out of the hands of the American people and put it in the hand of an institution the people don't have a lot of trust in right now, I think it's the wrong direction to go.  I agree with Speaker Pelosi.  Leave it up to the people.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Tom Steyer who is a billionaire, who has talked a lot about the political game.  He's not running this time but he's supporting lot of other causes and folks and he has been all about impeachment from day one.  He says this, he says Speaker Pelosi thinks he's just not worth it, well, is defending our legal system worth it?  Is holding the President accountable for his crimes and cover ups worth it?</p><p>Is doing what's right worth it or shall America just stop fighting for our principles and so what's politically convenient, Jason?</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I think Speaker Pelosi was right, other than the last part of the phrase that she offered there but our founders put up an exceptionally high bar.  If she had an inkling, if she had some evidence, I think she would go for it.  I think it's an admission that she doesn't have that evidence but she has a problem with their caucus because she's got 60 or so people that have already signed up for impeachment.</p><p>They've been promising this from the day Donald Trump was sworn in.  The problem for the Democrats is they just don't have any evidence, and they don't have any facts to actually back something up and make the case because it would be a loser and the country knows that and she is smart enough to recognize that.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, you know the committees that are coordinating in the 81 letters that went out last week looking into any number of things, from the Trump organization, to family members, to Russia, to everything else even though the special counsel were still waiting on that formal proceeding to close out.  So it's clear that they're casting a net to look for some things.  Aaron Blake at the Washington Post writes after the news of Speaker Pelosi today, he says, Pelosi's ability to tamp down impeachment fever could be one of the most significant battles of her speakership and these new comments are a line in the sand.</p><p>I mean, Marc, we're hearing a number of Democrats out tonight and saying or in recent days saying they still think and you hear Congressman Yarmuth, it's just a matter of time.</p><p>LOTTER:  Yes.  I mean, the number of investigations they're launching completely egregious but when you look at what were actually getting to and this is another bad week that is showing the Democrat Party is breaking apart right in front of our very eyes.  I don't see where any of the 2020 Democratic candidates are out there rallying the base and inspiring their liberal donors with no impeachment.  The radicals have taken over.</p><p>That's who controls their party right now and I am going to be very interested to see how their Presidential candidates try to balance what Speaker Pelosi is saying with the realities on the ground and trying to win in a very polarized, very radical party.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  We're just getting in some news here, the New York Attorney General and we know that the President is facing a lot of trouble at the state level with the southern district of New York.  Actually a Federal but they're in New York -- but there are -- the state A.G. has made a lot of noise too about conducting some investigations.  The attorney general's office in New York late Monday issuing subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank for records relating to the financing of four major Trump organization projects at a failed effort to buy the buffalo bills of the National Football League.</p><p>John, what do you make about that?  I mean, it seems like the President, it's going to be a long time before all these various investigations for multiple agencies are ever wrapped up.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Yes, and everybody knows that President Trump is a ruffian.  That is beyond dispute.  I think the tactical question, the political question that the Democrats have to take seriously is why not allow the people of this country to weigh in on that question?  Why do you want to shortchange that with politically motivated investigations that even if they're correct, set up a situation that furthers the divisions in this country.</p><p>And frankly hold the Democrats back from pushing a lot of the issues that they're having a lot of traction with right now.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  And Jason, it seems like there is this internal split about some of these really big issues.  We saw last week that it took them a week to put together the resolution that ended up condemning not only anti-Semitism but Islamophobia and white supremacy and all kinds of things.  We thought it was ready for the floor then it's back then they're fighting again and now we understand that there is -- this internal split.</p><p>And some of it has gone public about this issue of impeachment but the Speaker also said that \"the party is unified.\"</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I don't think so.  I think the Democrats are an absolute chaos.  I mean, think about it.  Bernie Sanders is the leader of the Democratic Party.  He's not a member of the Democratic Party.  He is registered as an Independent and really a socialist, so the leader of the Presidential candidates isn't even a member of their own party.  And then they can't decide whether or not they hate the Jewish people are not and how are they going to actually articulate that in a pace, in a resolution instead of calling out the actual individual.</p><p>I don't think that all the -- all the Democrats hate Jews but you do have some that need to be called out specifically.  The way Republicans did, like I did, with Mr. King when he stepped over the line.  So again, it's a -- it's a -- it's a campaign that's in chaos, a party that can't define itself.  And they're totally off message.  And they have to explain to the American people why they think these socialist views are the right solution for America because America is not buying it.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Senator Elizabeth Warren is officially in the race said this weekend it is wrong to call her socialist.  She doesn't support that.  But we're going to talk more about and coming up how she's also wants to go after some big tech companies and break them up, so there's a lot there to digest.  Power panel, thank you.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Just to say one thing in response to Congressman Chaffetz is that you say the American people are buying these things, I think the American people are deeply interested in having an honest conversation about many of the issues that progressives and socialists like Bernie Sanders and AOC are putting on the table.  It doesn't mean they agree with them on everything but they want to talk about these things.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, to leave it there.  The keyword --</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Oh, I would love to talk about those issues.</p><p>BREAM:  The keyword is honest --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Bring it on.  Bring it on.  You will drive the Democratic Party into the grave.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  I think the key there is honest and we can talk -- keep it factual.  I think that it's important for the American people.  They do want to talk about these things.  But in the meantime, thank you gentlemen.  Come back soon.</p><p>LOTTER:  Thank you.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Coming up, caught in the act, dramatic surveillance footage of a transsexual woman accused of pepper spray attacks all across New York.  We'll tell you what that's about.  And Liz Warren breaking ranks with socialist Democrats but also vowing to take on big tech.  We told you about that.  She's proposing to break up some giant social media companies.  Trace on the case.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WARREN:  The giant tech companies right now are eating up little tiny businesses, start-ups, and competing unfairly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  A transgender woman has been arrested in New York.  Police say, she might be behind a series of pepper spray attacks in Upper Manhattan.  One couple says, the attacker allegedly approached them on the street, asked the woman if she was white, and then pepper sprayed her.  The man tried to intervene, the attacker pulled out a knife, he says.  Authorities say, 11 people were attacked over the weekend in suspected hate crimes.</p><p>We're awaiting information from the Black Box of the Ethiopian Airlines plane, the Boeing 737 Max 8 that crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all 157 people aboard, including at least eight Americans.  The FAA says that planes are still air-worthy after two fatal crashes in less than six months.  Correspondent Doug McKelway has the latest.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  At the United Nations today, a flag at half-staff, an honor of the 157 people killed, 21 of them U.N. staffers in Sunday's crash of an Ethiopian Airlines, Boeing 737.</p><p>ABBY AHMED, ETHIOPIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  As we all know Ethiopian Airlines is a well-known airline that has not experienced such accidents for a long time.</p><p>MCKELWAY:  It was the second Boeing 737 Max 8 to crash in the last five months.  In the first, the like Lion Air Max 8 plane dove vertically into the sea, killing all 189 on board.  In both cases, radar data showed there were similar violent oscillations, pitching up and down, before the planes crashed.  But in the Lion Air case, there were other problems.  That plane had maintenance issues with airspeed, altimeter and other gauges.  The Max 8 is the latest generation Boeing's 737 with more power, more fuel-efficient engines.  The bigger engines necessitated the redesign of the plane's trim controls.  When the two trim control switches are turned off, and the plane is powered up, it causes a different reaction than in earlier models.</p><p>JOHN GOGLIA, FORMER NTSB INVESTIGATOR:  When you apply full power to the airplane, it's going to drive the nose up.  So, what Boeing did to counter that is they automated it.</p><p>MCKELWAY:  But if the trim switch is turned off or malfunctioning, a poorly trained pilot might have problems.  Over correcting for the nose up with a pitch down.  It can produce what's called pilot induced oscillation, as seen in this 1978 NASA video.  The first officer in the Ethiopian air crash had 200 hours of flying time, compared to a minimum of 1500 hours for U.S. first officers.</p><p>The flight and voice data recorders have been recovered.  Ethiopian, Cayman Airways, and China have all grounded the Max 8, but neither the Boeing, the FAA nor Domestic Carriers United, American, or Southwest have.  In December Boeing took a risk amid the ongoing trade war, opening a finishing facility in China, the world's largest growing airplane market.  The first plane to roll out of that facility was a 737 Max 8.  Shannon?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM:  Doug McKelway, thank you very much.  Two progressives, two different views, of what to do about big technology.  Well, Senator Elizabeth Warren wants to better regulate big tech, Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez see's technology as a means to a post-capitalist end.  Trace is on the case from our L.A. Newsroom.  Trace.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Shannon.  Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren is well-aware that her views often draw comparisons to her Senate colleague Bernie Sanders, but Warren wants to make it clear unlike Sanders she's not a Democratic socialist.  She supports capitalism, albeit with the right regulations.  And in the process of building her campaign and defining her positions, the Massachusetts senator has laid out her plan to break up big technology -- a goal she shares with President Trump.  For example, Warren would require regulators to go after massive mergers like Amazon buying Whole Foods and Facebook's ownership of Instagram.  Watch.</p><p>WARREN:  We want to keep that market place competitive, not let a giant who has an incredible information advantage, and a manipulative advantage, be able to snuff you out.</p><p>GALLAGHER:  Oddly, today, Facebook took down a number of Warren's campaign ads saying she misused its company logo.  Warren responded by citing Facebook's power to shut down debate.  The ads have now been restored.  Then, there's Democratic freshman Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who doesn't seem nearly as worried about big technology expanding or the rise of workplace robots.  In fact, Ocasio-Cortez says, Americans should be excited to have their jobs automated, quoting: \"The reason we're not excited by it is because we live in a society where if you don't have a job, you are left to die.  And that is, at its core, our problem.\"  She points out that not having a job gives you more time.</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), NEW YORK:  We should be excited about automation because what it could potentially mean is more time educating ourselves, more time creating art, more time investing and investigating in the sciences, more time focused on invention, more time going to space, more time enjoying the world that we live in.</p><p>GALLAGHER:  In case you're wondering, the 29-year-old Ocasio-Cortez drew bigger crowds at South by Southwest than any other presidential candidates.  Shannon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM:  All right, Trace Gallagher, thank you very much.  There is a new face of terror.  Hamza bin Laden, the son of Osama bin Laden, has a giant bounty now on his head.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  As released audio and video messages on the Internet, calling on his followers to want to attack against the United States and its western allies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  So, will the man who killed Osama bin Laden, his father, Rob O'Neill, take a shot at finding his son?  Rob joins us live to tell us what he thinks, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  Terror has a new face and he wants revenge on America.  Officials are warning that Osama bin Laden's son is actively engaging in terrorism and is emerging as the leader of al-Qaeda.  The State Department is offering a million-dollar reward for information on Hamza bin Laden's whereabouts, so let's talk to the guy who killed his dad, Osama bin Laden, former Navy SEAL Rob O'Neill.  Good to have you with us again, Rob.</p><p>ROB O'NEILL, FORMER NAVY SEAL:  Thank you, Shannon, for having me.  I appreciate it.</p><p>BREAM:  It may have been in jest, but we've got to put up on Twitter, there was a group that reached out to you and said, you know, we're assembling crew to go claim the $1 million bounty, are you in?  You say maybe not legitimately, but you do think it's a worthy mission at this point.</p><p>O'NEILL:  This is definitely a worthy mission, just to continue to prove that if terror rears its ugly head, we have men and women who are willing to go do it.  You know, on a serious note, I would do everything asked of me to do, but we have younger, more seasoned guys that are out there right now.  Some guys that were on the actual raid -- I don't know if we would risk that kind of a cross-border type thing that we did with Osama bin Laden, but something along the lines of the good men and women from the three letter agencies that find some intel on where he is and hit him with a drone strike.  I think that Hamza bin Laden, at least, is smart enough to know that gets too cute and too cocky, he's going to stick his head out and he's going to get gotten.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, apparently, he has reached out and started to make some noise over the last couple of years.  He obviously is.  We've talked about it.  I mean, there are a number of his family members who have been taken out of this al-Qaeda fight and he's got a lot of skin in the game, as you've said.  John Gambrell back in March, he says this, talking about Hamza bin Laden, began appearing in militant videos back as far as 2015.  And he said this apparently, if you think that your sinful crime that you committed in Abbottabad has passed without punishment, then you thought wrong.\"</p><p>O'NEILL:  Right, and the way that Hamza thinks, because of his brand of Islam that he follows, they're not going to worship of false idols, so it's not going to be revenge for the death of his father and his brother, and his other brother before them.  It would be more to avenge the deaths of the defenders of Islam, as they call it.  You know, because they're obviously very religious, in their own psychotic version of Islam.  Yes, he's making it apparent that he's there and he remembers what happened and what's been going on.</p><p>And he thinks that we've oppressed everyone in Iraq, and in Iran, and in Pakistan and all that stuff.  Al-Qaeda -- they're just on a strategic pause right now.  This isn't an end.  And they're going to sit there -- and like I've always said, ISIS loved the big headline and they stab in the front.  Al-Qaeda is going to wait around and stab you in the back.  They hit New York in 2003, tried to knock down the Trade Towers; and they didn't forget, they came back in 2001 and succeeded.  So, you can't get complacent with these guys, because complacency will get you killed.</p><p>BREAM:  What do you make of the price tag?  Is it enough in the scenario to get people to turn him in?</p><p>O'NEILL:  I mean, it could be but he is surrounded by some hardliners -- everyone, Taliban, and al-Qaeda guys are all around him.  It's going to take a little bit of money for an outsider to sort of see in, especially considering what happened with the doctor in Abbottabad, Pakistan that sort of helped us try to locate Osama bin Laden.  You know, he's not in a good place right now.  And it's going to take five or 10 million which wouldn't be much for us.  It worked with a lot of the Ba'ath party and (INAUDIBLE) Hussein in Iraq.  It could work here again, but like, al-Qaeda is a lot more -- they're a lot more loyal to each other than the Ba'ath party was.</p><p>BREAM:  Well -- and very quickly, we just have a few seconds, do you think he's probably in Pakistan?</p><p>O'NEILL:  I would say pretty much in Pakistan.  Yes, probably, in Pakistan or at least in the tribal regions where there's not a lot of law and they kind of protect him there.  And weirdly enough, he's been cooperating with the Iranians.  I believe he was pretty much raised in Iran under the cover of Iran, because that government can, even with the travel ban, probably help him travel certain places.  So, it is scary, but he's in the area.  I'm thinking right near (INAUDIBLE) of Pakistan.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, as you said, and others have noted, don't mistake their pause for inactivity.  They saying, you know, experts very much that they have the ability and the intent to come after the U.S. again.</p><p>O'NEILL:  Oh, they definitely have the intent.  That's what happens when you raise people from the time, they're infants to the time, the like, Hamza -- they're in their 30s, just to hate people because they don't believe what you believe.  You get this kind of stuff.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, Rob O'Neill, always great to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>O'NEILL:  Thanks, Shannon.  I appreciate it.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, the Supreme Court made it clear, public employees can no longer be forced to pay dues to a union they don't support.  But five California public school teachers say, that is exactly what's happening to them and now, they are suing.  We'll hear from their lawyer, we're going to debate both sides.  Plus, the president joins the daylight savings time debate, should it stay or should it go?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  On the heels of six-day teachers strike in California, five teachers are now suing the state's top union over collecting dues through mandatory paycheck deductions.  A practice that the Supreme Court calls on unconstitutional less than a year ago.  All right, let's bring in former Aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, Chris Hahn; and the lawyer representing the teachers, you recognize her, Harmeet Dhillon.  Thank you both for joining us.</p><p>HARMEET DHILLION, LAWYER:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>CHRIS HAHN, FORMER AIDE TO SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER:  Thanks for having us.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Harmeet, I just want you to clarify because Justice Alito was very clear.  He said this, in the decision last year, we conclude that this arrangement violates the free-speech rights of nonmembers by compelling them to subsidize private speech on matters of substantial public concern, and he said, unless these people affirmatively consent to giving the money, the unions can't take it.  Are you claiming that's what happening in California?</p><p>DHILLON:  Exactly what's happening.  So, our five clients working in conjunction with the freedom foundation, which has filed this type of lawsuit in other West Coast states as well, are claiming that they have opted out of their union card contracts.  And despite having opted out, the union is not letting them out until the anniversary of their one-year contract.  So, every pay period that their paychecks are being deducted, significant money in the case of the lead plaintiff, Bethany Mendez, $1500 a year on a pretty meager teacher's salary, a constitutional violation is occurring.  And so, the Supreme Court was very clear that you cannot take this money unless there is a knowing and voluntary waiver of the First Amendment.  And so, none of these teachers have made a voluntary waiver of the First Amendment rights.</p><p>BREAM:  So, Chris, even if you didn't like the ruling from the Supreme Court, it was a tight 15-4 last year.  Why shouldn't these teachers have the right to put their foot down over this?</p><p>HAHN:  Well, they are.  They signed a contract and they agreed to have these dues taken out.  I always wonder where you find teachers who are willing to go against their own interests and fight their union which basically gives them a much better salary, much better benefits and much better working conditions than they would've gotten on their own, especially given the market where there are thousands of teachers coming out of colleges every single day for every single opening.  These unions actually strengthen teachers and give them a better life at a fraction for what they are paying for these unions.  So, I am shocked that these people are willing to be used this way.  I hope that the kids that they teach are learning something because, god, these people don't seem to have learned much when they were in college.</p><p>DHILLON: Wow!</p><p>BREAM:  But Chris, you know, like the plaintiffs in a couple of these big cases, before the Supreme Court have said, they're going out on -- and supporting political candidates and messages with my dues money that I 100 percent disagree with, and they don't feel like they should have to subsidize that speech.  Does that make them terrible people?</p><p>HAHN:  You know, it's funny.  It's a slippery slope and, you know, when -- you know, we all pay for things we don't want going to support things we don't like.  For example, I'd buy gasoline every day.  Do I have a right to determine what we're going to -- what the gasoline company is going to do with the money I spend on it?  You know, it's a very slippery slope.  The Supreme Court got it wrong and it will be overturned when we get some reasonable members on that court.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  Harmeet, the California Teachers Association, by the way, very brave statement, only responding this way, saying: \"It's another lawsuit from the Freedom Foundation to continue the attack on public education and public employees.\"  Harmeet?</p><p>DHILLION:  So, Chris just called these teachers stupid and said that their students are going to learn nothing, and he also ignore the fact that this is a constitutional violation.  That's the difference between your gas analogy and what's going on here.  And if you think about it in terms of a term that choice -- that the left loves which is freedom of choice, that's what these teachers are really looking for here.  They're looking for the choice to be part of a union or not.  And by the way, the sky doesn't fall when people aren't part of a union.  Chris, as you know in the federal system, people are --</p><p>HAHN:  They can opt out at the end of their contract.  They opted in and now they're opting out.</p><p>DHILLON:  Please don't interrupt me, Chris, I didn't interrupt you.  In the federal system, people do not -- people are not required to be part of the union and the unions go on just fine.  And so, no, when you have a constitutional right, it is not sufficient to you can opt out when we tell you can.  After they opted out, Shannon, union sent thugs into the classroom to try to intimidate them into revoking their opt out.</p><p>HAHN:  Stop.  Thugs.  Kindergarten teachers.</p><p>DHILLON:  And so, this is not acceptable.  And it is time for the state of California to follow the constitution as the Supreme Court says.</p><p>BREAM:  Chris, you don't think that's OK, coercion, do you, Chris?</p><p>HAHN:  No, of course not.  But I also don't think that these teachers who are her clients understand how much they're being used by extreme right-wing groups that just want to break unions all over the country.</p><p>DHILLION:  Yes, they're so dumb and you know better.</p><p>HANH:  Well, look, they are clearly unaware of how they're being used, you know.  So, it is a shame and I feel bad for them, because they're going to learn very soon if they their union does collapse, what their salaries would be in a free market, and it won't be good for them.</p><p>DHILLON:  I think they're going to be just fine without all the coerced speech.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes, a lot of people felt after the ruling last year that there would be a big threat to the unions falling apart, that kind of thing.  We haven't seen that yet.  So, we'll see and we'll watch this case and see who is right in their predictions.</p><p>HAHN:  Not for trying of these groups, though, that's for sure.</p><p>BREAM:  Chris and Harmeet, thank you both.  Good to see you.</p><p>DHILLON:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>HAHN:  Thank you, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, coming up, is New York Mayor Bill de Blasio losing the forest for the trees, as the mayor tells kids to have meatless Mondays?  Economists are warning the city is about to head into a financial crisis.  That stories are in our \"REAL NEWS ROUND UP\", next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  Well, a woman gets booted from a hearing on gun control after apparently texting about going on a shooting spree of her own.  That story tops tonight's \"REAL NEWS ROUNDUP.\"  The unidentified woman was ejected from a Connecticut State Senate hearing after she was reportedly spotted sending a text saying: if she had a gun, she'd \"blow away a Republican state lawmaker and a large group of NRAs.\"  Connecticut capital police determined there was no threat.  The woman was not arrested.</p><p>New York City implementing meatless Mondays in public schools, a move supporter say, promotes healthy, environmentally friendly meal options.  The mayor says, cutting back on a little meat will help down on greenhouse gases and help save the planet.  Meanwhile, some top economists are warning the city needs to focus instead on its financial health.  One saying, New York is already in a difficult financial spot, but it would be in an impossible situation if we had any kind of setbacks.</p><p>President Trump lending support to do the push to do away with Daylight Savings Times.  Arizona and Hawaii are the only states that do not observe the time change.  The president tweeting today: \"Making Daylight Savings Time permanent is OK with me.\"</p><p>And the Supreme Court agreeing to hear the case of Eric (INAUDIBLE), who were denied a trademark for their line of street clothes by the Patent and Trademark Office because their brand is a variation of the F-word.  That denial is based on an old federal law that requires the rejection of trademarks that are scandalous or immoral.</p><p>All right.  Time now for our \"MIDNIGHT HERO\".  94-year-old, Mary Bochanis, was the longest-serving American Red Cross volunteer.  She started volunteering in 1943 when she met her husband, Gus, and she never stopped volunteering.  After her husband died in 2006, she just started volunteering more, she says.  A Red Cross volunteer for 76 years.</p><p>Mary Bochanis died Thursday.  She leaves behind an amazing legacy.  So, she is our \"MIDNIGHT HERO\" tonight.  Thank you for all those years of service to so many people.  Most-watched, most trusted, and most grateful you spent your evening with us.  Good night from Washington.  I'm Shannon Bream.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2190201341</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMN-8FH1-JBHT-D4K1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8024\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Thank you so much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INGRAHAM:  All right.  See you then.</p><p>BREAM:  We begin tonight with a Fox News alert.  Breaking tonight, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says President Trump is not worth impeaching.  But that sparking a firestorm on the left where some though it is going to happen.  It's just a matter of time.</p><p>Tonight's announcement follows a week of internal Democratic Party chaos.  And the Democrats struggled with the socialism label heats up as they announce the site of next year's convention, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p><p>A smart Republican say is perfect since its elected three socialist mayors.</p><p>Plus, from socialism to slavery reparations to legalizing prostitution, it is all on the table with a popular hip-hop radio show host who are shaking up the script.

I'm Shannon Bream in Washington.</p><p>We begin tonight with correspondent Kristin Fisher in tonight's bombshell from Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  The top Democrat is saying the president is not worth impeaching.  She's not going to support the move, but some other feels very differently about that.</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  This was quite an interview from Speaker Pelosi.  We've known for some time that the Democratic leadership has been wary of this rush to impeach from members of their own caucus.</p><p>But now, Speaker Pelosi has finally come out and publicly said that she is not for impeachment.  In an interview just released by the Washington Post,\" she says quote, \"Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country, and he's just not worth it.\"</p><p>Democratic congressman, Adam Schiff, is backing up Speaker Pelosi by saying tonight that only graphic evidence would warrant an impeachment gamble against President Trump.</p><p>But that line of thinking will put the Democratic leadership at odds with many members of their own party, including Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib who's already said that she's planning to introduce articles of impeachment against President Trump by the end of this month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D), MICHIGAN:  If we don't hold impeachment proceedings today, start them today, and hold him accountable to following the United States constitution.  Think about that.  This is not going to be the last CEO that runs for president of the United States.  This is not going to be the last person that tries to get away with this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FISHER:  So President Trump and Speaker Pelosi may finally agree on one thing.  No impeachment.  But they still disagree on most everything else, especially the new budget proposal put forward by the White House today.</p><p>Pelosi called it cruel and shortsighted.  She said, quote, \"The cruel and shortsighted cuts in President Trump's budget request are a roadmap to a sicker, weaker America.  House Democrats will reject this toxic, destructive, budget request which would hollow out our national strength and failed to meet the needs of the American people.\"</p><p>The White House says that this budget proposal is aimed at keeping Americans safe by increasing defense spending and including more than $8 billion for the border wall.  But it's also slashing funding for many domestic programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSS VOUGHT, ACTING DIRECTOR, OMB:  Washington has a spending problem and it endangers the future prosperity of our nation for generations to come.  This budget contains nearly $2.7 trillion in savings, more spending reductions proposed than any administration in history.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FISHER:  But even with those savings, this budget proposal would still push the federal deficit past $1 trillion.  The White House is asking for a huge number for fiscal year 2020, a record $4.7 trillion.</p><p>It's a big number, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  It is.  And they've got to answer some questions about that.</p><p>FISHER:  And it's just a proposal.  Not --</p><p>BREAM:  yes.</p><p>FISHER:  Just a blueprint.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  And we remember seeing President Obama's proposals voted down like 99 to nothing.  So we know that the president's proposal is just a place for Congress to start.</p><p>FISHER:  Just a place to start.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Thank you.</p><p>FISHER:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Wisconsin Republicans say they are not surprised the Democratic Party picked Milwaukee for next year's National Convention because of the city's strong ties they say to socialism.</p><p>Correspondent David Spunt has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOM BARRETT (D), MAYOR OF MILWAUKEE:  I want to welcome to Milwaukee the 2020 Democratic National Convention.</p><p>DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  On a cold Milwaukee afternoon, it became clear July 2020 will be hot.</p><p>TOM PEREZ, CHAIRMAN, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE:  Our democracies on fire.  It's a five alarm blaze and we have first responders in this room and elsewhere prepared to take back our democracy.</p><p>SPUNT:  Milwaukee beat out Houston and Miami for the DNC bid, and it's the only major city that counts three socialist mayors in its history.  The Wisconsin Republican Party put out a statement, quote, \"No city in America has stronger ties to socialism than Milwaukee.  And with the rise of Bernie Sanders and the embrace of socialism by its newest leaders, the American left has come full circle.\"  End quote.</p><p>Speaking of Sanders, he's number two on a new national international Monmouth University poll which tested 20 different candidates.  Sanders has been a proud Democratic socialist for decades and he's three percent behind former vice president, Joe Biden, who has yet to announce a run.</p><p>Sanders is at the top of the pack in a recent Emerson Poll focusing on New Hampshire.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT:  In 2016, this is where the political revolution took off.

JOHN HICKENLOOPER (D-CO), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Once you get back into these labels, am I a capitalist, am I a socialist?  How much of -- how much of a capitalist am I versus how much of a socialist?

David, thank you.</p><p>All right.  They featured interviews with the nation's most prominent hip-hop stars and celebrities.  But now, the popular radio show is also a must-stop media spot for 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.  Senators Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Cory Booker among others have all stopped in.</p><p>Joining me now from the nationally syndicated radio show, the Breakfast Club on Power 105.1 in New York City.  DJ Envy, Angela Yee, and Charlamagne tha God.  Welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT.  Great to have you, guys.</p><p>RAASHAUN CASEY, AMERICAN DISC JOCKEY:  Hey, thanks for having us.</p><p>ANGELA YEE, AMERICAN RADIO PERSONALITY:  Hi, Shannon.</p><p>LENARD LARRY MCKELVEY, AMERICAN RADIO PRESENTER:  What's happening?</p><p>BREAM:  Listen, I got to read something from the Daily Beast.  This how they describe you, saying, \"The world's most dangerous morning show.  Charlamagne tha God and his co-host DJ Envy and Angela Yee conduct lengthy interviews with politicians in which the cultural weight of the show and the informality of its interviews often force media train presidential hopeful to let down their guard and get more personal.\"</p><p>Angela, I know you said people are in danger if they come and try to act cool and it's not real.  How does that go?</p><p>YEE:  Well, I think part of the issue is that we're not political pundits.  So people come on the show and they're used to talking about things like their policies and things that are very rehearsed.</p><p>But when you come on the Breakfast Club, we might ask you about anything.  And I think for people, they also want to answer for our audience.  So they might say things to make them sound like more hip than normal.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, and you know, Senator Kamala Harris --</p><p>CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD:  You know --</p><p>BREAM:  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  No.  I was going to say, you know, when you talk to a politician, they've got a talking point for everything, especially when you talk to them about politics.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes, that's the truth.  We find that out every time we have one on.</p><p>Senator Kamala Harris who has gotten a lot of attention, very popular, pulling near the top, even though -- away from the first cluster, but she's definitely in the mix.</p><p>I want to play something that she talked about with you guys that got a lot of attention.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D), CALIFORNIA:  I am absolutely in favor of legalizing marijuana.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Have ever smoked?</p><p>HARRIS:  I have.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  OK.  In college or --</p><p>HARRIS:  And I inhaled.  I did -- I did inhale.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  What were you listening to when you were high?</p><p>CASEY:  What was on?  What song was it?  Was it Snoop?</p><p>HARRIS:  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, yes, definitely Snoop.  Tupac, for sure.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  I mean, guys, that was a big moment.  You just keep making national news with these interviews.</p><p>CASEY:  That question was a little crazy because I asked her what she listened to and my cohost over here was still on the weed question.  And it got a little blurry.  But she was talking about what she listen to.  She says she listened Tupac.  She listened to Snoop and it kind of got blurred with Charlamagne's weed question.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Fox News, you did that.  You all took that out of context.  You all started that.</p><p>BREAM:  I will tell you, it wasn't me.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  You all did that.</p><p>BREAM:  But I can always double-check on that.</p><p>Who do you guys want who hasn't stopped by yet?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I mean, the interesting thing is not like we sit around and we send out these requests for different people.  It's just like whoever wants to come.  We have a platform.  2020 is wide open.  A lot of people are looking to see who they want to vote for in 2020.</p><p>So we're interested in anybody who's running, who wants to get the word out.</p><p>YEE:  I wouldn't mind to have Elizabeth Warren on.  I think she'd be --</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Elizabeth Warren would be great.</p><p>CASEY:  Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>CASEY:  Anybody on both sides though.  Democratic, Republican.  It doesn't matter.  We would love to talk to anybody.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  And I like Julian Castro.  I saw him make a very great statement today when he came to reparations.  So I would love to have him on.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  I mean, that's something that you've talked about with Bernie -- Senator Bernie Sanders.  I mean, he is in the top one or two slots in almost all of the new polls.  It's him and the former vice president and who's not technically in.</p><p>What did you make of Bernie's answer on that?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Oh, I didn't like his answer at all because it seemed to be something he wasn't considering or it's just something he wants to -- he wants some type of form of reparations.  Well, he seemed like he wasn't for the reparations thing at all.</p><p>CASEY:  Kind of avoiding the question a little bit.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.</p><p>YEE:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I wasn't digging his answers.</p><p>YEE:  I think it's important to have solutions.  Like to see if there's an issue that we have, so here are some solutions, here are some possibilities of how we can make that happen instead of dodging a question.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Absolutely.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, and Hillary Clinton back in 2016, she made a lot of news for this exchange when she was on your show.  We want to play.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YEE:  What's something that you always carry with you?</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES:  Hot sauce.</p><p>CASEY:  Really?</p><p>CLINTON:  Yes.</p><p>CASEY:  Really?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  You're giving information right now?</p><p>CASEY:  Hot sauce.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Hot sauce in my bag?  What?</p><p>CLINTON:  Hot sauce.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Really?</p><p>CLINTON:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Now, listen, I'd want you to know people are going to see this and say, OK.  She's pandering to black people.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLINTON:  OK.  Is it working?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  She got a lot of heat for that.  What did you guys make of that exchange?  Because that kind of set the bar for stopping by to your show.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I mean, I said it to her in that moment, you know, this is one of those times when people are going to think that you're pandering the black people.</p><p>But she has said that she likes hot sauce in previous interviews decades earlier.  So maybe she wasn't pandering.</p><p>But the best part about that exchange was when she looked me in the eye and say --</p><p>YEE:  \"Is it working?\"</p><p>MCKELVEY:  \"Is it working?\"  That's a very honest response.</p><p>YEE:  You know, after that, I had to do some research myself and I did go back and see that she talk about it in various other outlets.  And she's been talking about it for years.  But most people won't do that research to see.  This is something real.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.  I don't know how much it worked because --</p><p>CASEY:  People still think that's pandering.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Well, no, she didn't win.</p><p>CASEY:  No, she didn't win.</p><p>YEE:  She did not -- well, technically.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  Well, that's in the history books.</p><p>Let me ask about the guy who did win.  How would you guys handle an interview with President Trump?</p><p>(LAUGHS)</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I don't think that'll go well.</p><p>CASEY:  I think that will go amazing, actually.  He would have to be honest.</p><p>YEE:  I don't think that he would be comfortable answering any questions from us.  I doubt that he would stay for a full interview with us.  Just because there's a lot of issues that I have with things that he says that had been problematic for us and our people.</p><p>Things that we hear that Michael Cohen is even coming forward and saying that he said in private to him, so.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I don't think he would come because I don't think he cares about our audience.  I mean, there's nothing about Donald Trump that makes me think he cares about black and brown people.</p><p>YEE:  There's a lot of hurtful things that he says.  Personally he had offended me.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  I mean, something that he talks about a lot is the low unemployment rate, historically low, for African-Americans and for the Hispanic community.  It is something he likes to talk about.  If he thought he had a platform with you guys, would he be welcome?</p><p>CASEY:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes, he definitely will be welcomed.  It's very important to know that started with Barack Obama.  It was the policies that Barack Obama implemented that caused the unemployment rate to be so low for African-Americans now and Donald Trump is taking credit for it.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, you know, he loves to joust.  He loves to fight.  He would love to debate that with you guys.  So he might actually come and stick around.  I think he might enjoy it.</p><p>YEE:  Let's have him come on.</p><p>BREAM:  He might --</p><p>CASEY:  I would love for him to come.</p><p>YEE:  Even when he gets asked questions at the White House with reporters.  He'll ban you if he doesn't like your questions, so.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.  And tell him pull up.  We'll get him -- we'll get him some fast food.  We'll get him some little White Castle sliders that fit his little hands.</p><p>CASEY:  Some McDonald's.  Some McDonald's too.</p><p>BREAM:  You know he loves the fast food.</p><p>OK.  So if he's listening tonight, because sometimes he does watch, go ahead and make your pitch to him.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I'm not --</p><p>CASEY:  We're not pitching it.</p><p>YEE:  I mean, we're not really excited.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  If he's smart, he will come up here.</p><p>CASEY:  If he wants to pull up -- he can pull up any time.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  It's not something that we want.  It's not something that we're requesting.  I'm not about to make no pitch.</p><p>CASEY:  No, we're not pitching for him.  But if he wants to come, he's invited.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  And there might be some snacks involved.</p><p>YEE:  He should face --</p><p>BREAM:  The Breakfast show.  World's most dangerous morning show.  Keep making news.  We'll keep watching.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.</p><p>BREAM:  Thank you, guys, very much.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Thank you very much.  Thank you for having us.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  The speaker says no-go to progressive plans to impeach the president.  The Mueller's special counsel reported isn't even in yet.  So, why is she taking plan b off the table?</p><p>Our power panel is here to weigh in.  They are standing by right there for you.  They're next.</p><p>Plus, the latest on the Boeing 737 Max crash.  Lawmakers calling for the aircraft to be grounded.  Will it affect your travel plans?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JOHN YARMUTH (D), KENTUCKY:  To me it's not a question of whether, it's a question of when and probably right now is not the right time but I think at some point it's going to be inevitable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  Reaction still coming in to Speaker Pelosi telling the Washington Post she is not for impeaching President Trump.  Time now for tonight's power panel, the President of Open Primaries, John Opdycke, the director of Strategic Communications for Trump 2020, Marc Lotter, and Fox News Contributor, former Utah Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz.  Welcome to all of you.</p><p>JOHN OPDYCKE, PRESIDENT, OPEN PRIMARIES:  Good evening.</p><p>MARC LOTTER, DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS FOR TRUMP 2020:  Hi, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  So just to remind, folks, this is the quote from Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker.  She says impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country and he's just not worth it.  Marc?</p><p>LOTTER:  What took her so long?  It's been two years, 300,000 documents, hundreds of hours of interviews, and she's come to the same conclusion that President Trump said day one.  No collusion.  So I'm surprised that it took her that long to get there.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  I want to read something from Politico today, it says, Dems have started the years of impeachment.  Can they still turn back?  It says interviews with more than a dozen key Democratic lawmakers revealed deep division within the caucus about whether their efforts could end up helping Trump win a second term in office.  John, we've heard that from a lot of folks who worry that it will just mobilize his base.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Yes.  I don't agree with Speaker Pelosi on much but I take her side on this.  I think that moving in the impeachment direction will be a real disservice to the rich, robust political conversation that's taking place in the country right now.  On a whole range of issues from Green New Deal, to Medicare for All, to immigration and so forth.  And I think in some ways, the American people are deeply distrustful of Congress.</p><p>And to take this decision about who the next President is going to be out of the hands of the American people and put it in the hand of an institution the people don't have a lot of trust in right now, I think it's the wrong direction to go.  I agree with Speaker Pelosi.  Leave it up to the people.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Tom Steyer who is a billionaire, who has talked a lot about the political game.  He's not running this time but he's supporting lot of other causes and folks and he has been all about impeachment from day one.  He says this, he says Speaker Pelosi thinks he's just not worth it, well, is defending our legal system worth it?  Is holding the President accountable for his crimes and cover ups worth it?</p><p>Is doing what's right worth it or shall America just stop fighting for our principles and so what's politically convenient, Jason?</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I think Speaker Pelosi was right, other than the last part of the phrase that she offered there but our founders put up an exceptionally high bar.  If she had an inkling, if she had some evidence, I think she would go for it.  I think it's an admission that she doesn't have that evidence but she has a problem with their caucus because she's got 60 or so people that have already signed up for impeachment.</p><p>They've been promising this from the day Donald Trump was sworn in.  The problem for the Democrats is they just don't have any evidence, and they don't have any facts to actually back something up and make the case because it would be a loser and the country knows that and she is smart enough to recognize that.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, you know the committees that are coordinating in the 81 letters that went out last week looking into any number of things, from the Trump organization, to family members, to Russia, to everything else even though the special counsel were still waiting on that formal proceeding to close out.  So it's clear that they're casting a net to look for some things.  Aaron Blake at the Washington Post writes after the news of Speaker Pelosi today, he says, Pelosi's ability to tamp down impeachment fever could be one of the most significant battles of her speakership and these new comments are a line in the sand.</p><p>I mean, Marc, we're hearing a number of Democrats out tonight and saying or in recent days saying they still think and you hear Congressman Yarmuth, it's just a matter of time.</p><p>LOTTER:  Yes.  I mean, the number of investigations they're launching completely egregious but when you look at what were actually getting to and this is another bad week that is showing the Democrat Party is breaking apart right in front of our very eyes.  I don't see where any of the 2020 Democratic candidates are out there rallying the base and inspiring their liberal donors with no impeachment.  The radicals have taken over.</p><p>That's who controls their party right now and I am going to be very interested to see how their Presidential candidates try to balance what Speaker Pelosi is saying with the realities on the ground and trying to win in a very polarized, very radical party.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  We're just getting in some news here, the New York Attorney General and we know that the President is facing a lot of trouble at the state level with the southern district of New York.  Actually a Federal but they're in New York -- but there are -- the state A.G. has made a lot of noise too about conducting some investigations.  The attorney general's office in New York late Monday issuing subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank for records relating to the financing of four major Trump organization projects at a failed effort to buy the buffalo bills of the National Football League.</p><p>John, what do you make about that?  I mean, it seems like the President, it's going to be a long time before all these various investigations for multiple agencies are ever wrapped up.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Yes, and everybody knows that President Trump is a ruffian.  That is beyond dispute.  I think the tactical question, the political question that the Democrats have to take seriously is why not allow the people of this country to weigh in on that question?  Why do you want to shortchange that with politically motivated investigations that even if they're correct, set up a situation that furthers the divisions in this country.</p><p>And frankly hold the Democrats back from pushing a lot of the issues that they're having a lot of traction with right now.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  And Jason, it seems like there is this internal split about some of these really big issues.  We saw last week that it took them a week to put together the resolution that ended up condemning not only anti-Semitism but Islamophobia and white supremacy and all kinds of things.  We thought it was ready for the floor then it's back then they're fighting again and now we understand that there is -- this internal split.</p><p>And some of it has gone public about this issue of impeachment but the Speaker also said that \"the party is unified.\"</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I don't think so.  I think the Democrats are an absolute chaos.  I mean, think about it.  Bernie Sanders is the leader of the Democratic Party.  He's not a member of the Democratic Party.  He is registered as an Independent and really a socialist, so the leader of the Presidential candidates isn't even a member of their own party.  And then they can't decide whether or not they hate the Jewish people are not and how are they going to actually articulate that in a pace, in a resolution instead of calling out the actual individual.</p><p>I don't think that all the -- all the Democrats hate Jews but you do have some that need to be called out specifically.  The way Republicans did, like I did, with Mr. King when he stepped over the line.  So again, it's a -- it's a -- it's a campaign that's in chaos, a party that can't define itself.  And they're totally off message.  And they have to explain to the American people why they think these socialist views are the right solution for America because America is not buying it.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Senator Elizabeth Warren is officially in the race said this weekend it is wrong to call her socialist.  She doesn't support that.  But we're going to talk more about and coming up how she's also wants to go after some big tech companies and break them up, so there's a lot there to digest.  Power panel, thank you.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Just to say one thing in response to Congressman Chaffetz is that you say the American people are buying these things, I think the American people are deeply interested in having an honest conversation about many of the issues that progressives and socialists like Bernie Sanders and AOC are putting on the table.  It doesn't mean they agree with them on everything but they want to talk about these things.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, to leave it there.  The keyword --</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Oh, I would love to talk about those issues.</p><p>BREAM:  The keyword is honest --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Bring it on.  Bring it on.  You will drive the Democratic Party into the grave.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  I think the key there is honest and we can talk -- keep it factual.  I think that it's important for the American people.  They do want to talk about these things.  But in the meantime, thank you gentlemen.  Come back soon.</p><p>LOTTER:  Thank you.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Coming up, caught in the act, dramatic surveillance footage of a transsexual woman accused of pepper spray attacks all across New York.  We'll tell you what that's about.  And Liz Warren breaking ranks with socialist Democrats but also vowing to take on big tech.  We told you about that.  She's proposing to break up some giant social media companies.  Trace on the case.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WARREN:  The giant tech companies right now are eating up little tiny businesses, start-ups, and competing unfairly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  A transgender woman has been arrested in New York.  Police say, she might be behind a series of pepper spray attacks in Upper Manhattan.  One couple says, the attacker allegedly approached them on the street, asked the woman if she was white, and then pepper sprayed her.  The man tried to intervene, the attacker pulled out a knife, he says.  Authorities say, 11 people were attacked over the weekend in suspected hate crimes.</p><p>We're awaiting information from the Black Box of the Ethiopian Airlines plane, the Boeing 737 Max 8 that crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all 157 people aboard, including at least eight Americans.  The FAA says that planes are still air-worthy after two fatal crashes in less than six months.  Correspondent Doug McKelway has the latest.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  At the United Nations today, a flag at half-staff, an honor of the 157 people killed, 21 of them U.N. staffers in Sunday's crash of an Ethiopian Airlines, Boeing 737.</p><p>ABBY AHMED, ETHIOPIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  As we all know Ethiopian Airlines is a well-known airline that has not experienced such accidents for a long time.</p><p>MCKELWAY:  It was the second Boeing 737 Max 8 to crash in the last five months.  In the first, the like Lion Air Max 8 plane dove vertically into the sea, killing all 189 on board.  In both cases, radar data showed there were similar violent oscillations, pitching up and down, before the planes crashed.  But in the Lion Air case, there were other problems.  That plane had maintenance issues with airspeed, altimeter and other gauges.  The Max 8 is the latest generation Boeing's 737 with more power, more fuel-efficient engines.  The bigger engines necessitated the redesign of the plane's trim controls.  When the two trim control switches are turned off, and the plane is powered up, it causes a different reaction than in earlier models.</p><p>JOHN GOGLIA, FORMER NTSB INVESTIGATOR:  When you apply full power to the airplane, it's going to drive the nose up.  So, what Boeing did to counter that is they automated it.</p><p>MCKELWAY:  But if the trim switch is turned off or malfunctioning, a poorly trained pilot might have problems.  Over correcting for the nose up with a pitch down.  It can produce what's called pilot induced oscillation, as seen in this 1978 NASA video.  The first officer in the Ethiopian air crash had 200 hours of flying time, compared to a minimum of 1500 hours for U.S. first officers.</p><p>The flight and voice data recorders have been recovered.  Ethiopian, Cayman Airways, and China have all grounded the Max 8, but neither the Boeing, the FAA nor Domestic Carriers United, American, or Southwest have.  In December Boeing took a risk amid the ongoing trade war, opening a finishing facility in China, the world's largest growing airplane market.  The first plane to roll out of that facility was a 737 Max 8.  Shannon?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM:  Doug McKelway, thank you very much.

Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren is well-aware that her views often draw comparisons to her Senate colleague Bernie Sanders, but Warren wants to make it clear unlike Sanders she's not a Democratic socialist.  She supports capitalism, albeit with the right regulations.  And in the process of building her campaign and defining her positions, the Massachusetts senator has laid out her plan to break up big technology -- a goal she shares with President Trump.  For example, Warren would require regulators to go after massive mergers like Amazon buying Whole Foods and Facebook's ownership of Instagram.  Watch.</p><p>WARREN:  We want to keep that market place competitive, not let a giant who has an incredible information advantage, and a manipulative advantage, be able to snuff you out.</p><p>GALLAGHER:  Oddly, today, Facebook took down a number of Warren's campaign ads saying she misused its company logo.  Warren responded by citing Facebook's power to shut down debate.  The ads have now been restored.  Then, there's Democratic freshman Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who doesn't seem nearly as worried about big technology expanding or the rise of workplace robots.  In fact, Ocasio-Cortez says, Americans should be excited to have their jobs automated, quoting: \"The reason we're not excited by it is because we live in a society where if you don't have a job, you are left to die.  And that is, at its core, our problem.\"  She points out that not having a job gives you more time.</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), NEW YORK:  We should be excited about automation because what it could potentially mean is more time educating ourselves, more time creating art, more time investing and investigating in the sciences, more time focused on invention, more time going to space, more time enjoying the world that we live in.</p><p>GALLAGHER:  In case you're wondering, the 29-year-old Ocasio-Cortez drew bigger crowds at South by Southwest than any other presidential candidates.  Shannon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM:  All right, Trace Gallagher, thank you very much.  There is a new face of terror.  Hamza bin Laden, the son of Osama bin Laden, has a giant bounty now on his head.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  As released audio and video messages on the Internet, calling on his followers to want to attack against the United States and its western allies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  So, will the man who killed Osama bin Laden, his father, Rob O'Neill, take a shot at finding his son?  Rob joins us live to tell us what he thinks, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  Terror has a new face and he wants revenge on America.  Officials are warning that Osama bin Laden's son is actively engaging in terrorism and is emerging as the leader of al-Qaeda.  The State Department is offering a million-dollar reward for information on Hamza bin Laden's whereabouts, so let's talk to the guy who killed his dad, Osama bin Laden, former Navy SEAL Rob O'Neill.  Good to have you with us again, Rob.</p><p>ROB O'NEILL, FORMER NAVY SEAL:  Thank you, Shannon, for having me.  I appreciate it.</p><p>BREAM:  It may have been in jest, but we've got to put up on Twitter, there was a group that reached out to you and said, you know, we're assembling crew to go claim the $1 million bounty, are you in?  You say maybe not legitimately, but you do think it's a worthy mission at this point.</p><p>O'NEILL:  This is definitely a worthy mission, just to continue to prove that if terror rears its ugly head, we have men and women who are willing to go do it.  You know, on a serious note, I would do everything asked of me to do, but we have younger, more seasoned guys that are out there right now.  Some guys that were on the actual raid -- I don't know if we would risk that kind of a cross-border type thing that we did with Osama bin Laden, but something along the lines of the good men and women from the three letter agencies that find some intel on where he is and hit him with a drone strike.  I think that Hamza bin Laden, at least, is smart enough to know that gets too cute and too cocky, he's going to stick his head out and he's going to get gotten.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, apparently, he has reached out and started to make some noise over the last couple of years.  He obviously is.  We've talked about it.  I mean, there are a number of his family members who have been taken out of this al-Qaeda fight and he's got a lot of skin in the game, as you've said.  John Gambrell back in March, he says this, talking about Hamza bin Laden, began appearing in militant videos back as far as 2015.  And he said this apparently, if you think that your sinful crime that you committed in Abbottabad has passed without punishment, then you thought wrong.\"</p><p>O'NEILL:  Right, and the way that Hamza thinks, because of his brand of Islam that he follows, they're not going to worship of false idols, so it's not going to be revenge for the death of his father and his brother, and his other brother before them.  It would be more to avenge the deaths of the defenders of Islam, as they call it.  You know, because they're obviously very religious, in their own psychotic version of Islam.  Yes, he's making it apparent that he's there and he remembers what happened and what's been going on.</p><p>And he thinks that we've oppressed everyone in Iraq, and in Iran, and in Pakistan and all that stuff.  Al-Qaeda -- they're just on a strategic pause right now.  This isn't an end.  And they're going to sit there -- and like I've always said, ISIS loved the big headline and they stab in the front.  Al-Qaeda is going to wait around and stab you in the back.  They hit New York in 2003, tried to knock down the Trade Towers; and they didn't forget, they came back in 2001 and succeeded.  So, you can't get complacent with these guys, because complacency will get you killed.</p><p>BREAM:  What do you make of the price tag?  Is it enough in the scenario to get people to turn him in?</p><p>O'NEILL:  I mean, it could be but he is surrounded by some hardliners -- everyone, Taliban, and al-Qaeda guys are all around him.  It's going to take a little bit of money for an outsider to sort of see in, especially considering what happened with the doctor in Abbottabad, Pakistan that sort of helped us try to locate Osama bin Laden.  You know, he's not in a good place right now.  And it's going to take five or 10 million which wouldn't be much for us.  It worked with a lot of the Ba'ath party and (INAUDIBLE) Hussein in Iraq.  It could work here again, but like, al-Qaeda is a lot more -- they're a lot more loyal to each other than the Ba'ath party was.</p><p>BREAM:  Well -- and very quickly, we just have a few seconds, do you think he's probably in Pakistan?</p><p>O'NEILL:  I would say pretty much in Pakistan.  Yes, probably, in Pakistan or at least in the tribal regions where there's not a lot of law and they kind of protect him there.  And weirdly enough, he's been cooperating with the Iranians.  I believe he was pretty much raised in Iran under the cover of Iran, because that government can, even with the travel ban, probably help him travel certain places.  So, it is scary, but he's in the area.  I'm thinking right near (INAUDIBLE) of Pakistan.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, as you said, and others have noted, don't mistake their pause for inactivity.  They saying, you know, experts very much that they have the ability and the intent to come after the U.S. again.</p><p>O'NEILL:  Oh, they definitely have the intent.  That's what happens when you raise people from the time, they're infants to the time, the like, Hamza -- they're in their 30s, just to hate people because they don't believe what you believe.  You get this kind of stuff.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, Rob O'Neill, always great to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>O'NEILL:  Thanks, Shannon.  I appreciate it.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, the Supreme Court made it clear, public employees can no longer be forced to pay dues to a union they don't support.  But five California public school teachers say, that is exactly what's happening to them and now, they are suing.  We'll hear from their lawyer, we're going to debate both sides.  Plus, the president joins the daylight savings time debate, should it stay or should it go?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  On the heels of six-day teachers strike in California, five teachers are now suing the state's top union over collecting dues through mandatory paycheck deductions.  A practice that the Supreme Court calls on unconstitutional less than a year ago.  All right, let's bring in former Aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, Chris Hahn; and the lawyer representing the teachers, you recognize her, Harmeet Dhillon.  Thank you both for joining us.</p><p>HARMEET DHILLION, LAWYER:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>CHRIS HAHN, FORMER AIDE TO SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER:  Thanks for having us.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Harmeet, I just want you to clarify because Justice Alito was very clear.  He said this, in the decision last year, we conclude that this arrangement violates the free-speech rights of nonmembers by compelling them to subsidize private speech on matters of substantial public concern, and he said, unless these people affirmatively consent to giving the money, the unions can't take it.  Are you claiming that's what happening in California?</p><p>DHILLON:  Exactly what's happening.  So, our five clients working in conjunction with the freedom foundation, which has filed this type of lawsuit in other West Coast states as well, are claiming that they have opted out of their union card contracts.  And despite having opted out, the union is not letting them out until the anniversary of their one-year contract.  So, every pay period that their paychecks are being deducted, significant money in the case of the lead plaintiff, Bethany Mendez, $1500 a year on a pretty meager teacher's salary, a constitutional violation is occurring.  And so, the Supreme Court was very clear that you cannot take this money unless there is a knowing and voluntary waiver of the First Amendment.  And so, none of these teachers have made a voluntary waiver of the First Amendment rights.</p><p>BREAM:  So, Chris, even if you didn't like the ruling from the Supreme Court, it was a tight 15-4 last year.  Why shouldn't these teachers have the right to put their foot down over this?</p><p>HAHN:  Well, they are.  They signed a contract and they agreed to have these dues taken out.  I always wonder where you find teachers who are willing to go against their own interests and fight their union which basically gives them a much better salary, much better benefits and much better working conditions than they would've gotten on their own, especially given the market where there are thousands of teachers coming out of colleges every single day for every single opening.  These unions actually strengthen teachers and give them a better life at a fraction for what they are paying for these unions.  So, I am shocked that these people are willing to be used this way.  I hope that the kids that they teach are learning something because, god, these people don't seem to have learned much when they were in college.</p><p>DHILLON: Wow!</p><p>BREAM:  But Chris, you know, like the plaintiffs in a couple of these big cases, before the Supreme Court have said, they're going out on -- and supporting political candidates and messages with my dues money that I 100 percent disagree with, and they don't feel like they should have to subsidize that speech.  Does that make them terrible people?</p><p>HAHN:  You know, it's funny.  It's a slippery slope and, you know, when -- you know, we all pay for things we don't want going to support things we don't like.  For example, I'd buy gasoline every day.  Do I have a right to determine what we're going to -- what the gasoline company is going to do with the money I spend on it?  You know, it's a very slippery slope.  The Supreme Court got it wrong and it will be overturned when we get some reasonable members on that court.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  Harmeet, the California Teachers Association, by the way, very brave statement, only responding this way, saying: \"It's another lawsuit from the Freedom Foundation to continue the attack on public education and public employees.\"  Harmeet?</p><p>DHILLION:  So, Chris just called these teachers stupid and said that their students are going to learn nothing, and he also ignore the fact that this is a constitutional violation.  That's the difference between your gas analogy and what's going on here.  And if you think about it in terms of a term that choice -- that the left loves which is freedom of choice, that's what these teachers are really looking for here.  They're looking for the choice to be part of a union or not.  And by the way, the sky doesn't fall when people aren't part of a union.  Chris, as you know in the federal system, people are --</p><p>HAHN:  They can opt out at the end of their contract.  They opted in and now they're opting out.</p><p>DHILLON:  Please don't interrupt me, Chris, I didn't interrupt you.  In the federal system, people do not -- people are not required to be part of the union and the unions go on just fine.  And so, no, when you have a constitutional right, it is not sufficient to you can opt out when we tell you can.  After they opted out, Shannon, union sent thugs into the classroom to try to intimidate them into revoking their opt out.</p><p>HAHN:  Stop.  Thugs.  Kindergarten teachers.</p><p>DHILLON:  And so, this is not acceptable.  And it is time for the state of California to follow the constitution as the Supreme Court says.</p><p>BREAM:  Chris, you don't think that's OK, coercion, do you, Chris?</p><p>HAHN:  No, of course not.  But I also don't think that these teachers who are her clients understand how much they're being used by extreme right-wing groups that just want to break unions all over the country.</p><p>DHILLION:  Yes, they're so dumb and you know better.</p><p>HANH:  Well, look, they are clearly unaware of how they're being used, you know.  So, it is a shame and I feel bad for them, because they're going to learn very soon if they their union does collapse, what their salaries would be in a free market, and it won't be good for them.</p><p>DHILLON:  I think they're going to be just fine without all the coerced speech.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes, a lot of people felt after the ruling last year that there would be a big threat to the unions falling apart, that kind of thing.  We haven't seen that yet.  So, we'll see and we'll watch this case and see who is right in their predictions.</p><p>HAHN:  Not for trying of these groups, though, that's for sure.</p><p>BREAM:  Chris and Harmeet, thank you both.  Good to see you.</p><p>DHILLON:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>HAHN:  Thank you, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, coming up, is New York Mayor Bill de Blasio losing the forest for the trees, as the mayor tells kids to have meatless Mondays?  Economists are warning the city is about to head into a financial crisis.  That stories are in our \"REAL NEWS ROUND UP\", next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  Well, a woman gets booted from a hearing on gun control after apparently texting about going on a shooting spree of her own.  That story tops tonight's \"REAL NEWS ROUNDUP.\"  The unidentified woman was ejected from a Connecticut State Senate hearing after she was reportedly spotted sending a text saying: if she had a gun, she'd \"blow away a Republican state lawmaker and a large group of NRAs.\"  Connecticut capital police determined there was no threat.  The woman was not arrested.</p><p>New York City implementing meatless Mondays in public schools, a move supporter say, promotes healthy, environmentally friendly meal options.  The mayor says, cutting back on a little meat will help down on greenhouse gases and help save the planet.  Meanwhile, some top economists are warning the city needs to focus instead on its financial health.  One saying, New York is already in a difficult financial spot, but it would be in an impossible situation if we had any kind of setbacks.</p><p>President Trump lending support to do the push to do away with Daylight Savings Times.  Arizona and Hawaii are the only states that do not observe the time change.  The president tweeting today: \"Making Daylight Savings Time permanent is OK with me.\"</p><p>And the Supreme Court agreeing to hear the case of Eric (INAUDIBLE), who were denied a trademark for their line of street clothes by the Patent and Trademark Office because their brand is a variation of the F-word.  That denial is based on an old federal law that requires the rejection of trademarks that are scandalous or immoral.</p><p>All right.  Time now for our \"MIDNIGHT HERO\".  94-year-old, Mary Bochanis, was the longest-serving American Red Cross volunteer.  She started volunteering in 1943 when she met her husband, Gus, and she never stopped volunteering.  After her husband died in 2006, she just started volunteering more, she says.  A Red Cross volunteer for 76 years.</p><p>Mary Bochanis died Thursday.  She leaves behind an amazing legacy.  So, she is our \"MIDNIGHT HERO\" tonight.  Thank you for all those years of service to so many people.  Most-watched, most trusted, and most grateful you spent your evening with us.  Good night from Washington.  I'm Shannon Bream.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2190201295</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMN-8FH1-JBHT-D4JX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8024\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

A new podcast drops tomorrow.  Subscribe at podcastone.com.  Shannon Bream and the FOX NEWS @ NIGHT team take it from here.  I'll be in New York tomorrow night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I will too.  I'll see you there, Laura.  Thank you so much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INGRAHAM:  All right.  See you then.</p><p>BREAM:  We begin tonight with a Fox News alert.  Breaking tonight, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says President Trump is not worth impeaching.  But that sparking a firestorm on the left where some though it is going to happen.  It's just a matter of time.</p><p>Tonight's announcement follows a week of internal Democratic Party chaos.  And the Democrats struggled with the socialism label heats up as they announce the site of next year's convention, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p><p>A smart Republican say is perfect since its elected three socialist mayors.</p><p>Plus, from socialism to slavery reparations to legalizing prostitution, it is all on the table with a popular hip-hop radio show host who are shaking up the script.  Getting personal with the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, the hosts of the powerhouse Breakfast Club join us live to talk about how it is becoming a Democratic campaign trail must-stop.</p><p>Hello and welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT.  I'm Shannon Bream in Washington.</p><p>We begin tonight with correspondent Kristin Fisher in tonight's bombshell from Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  The top Democrat is saying the president is not worth impeaching.  She's not going to support the move, but some other feels very differently about that.</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  This was quite an interview from Speaker Pelosi.  We've known for some time that the Democratic leadership has been wary of this rush to impeach from members of their own caucus.</p><p>But now, Speaker Pelosi has finally come out and publicly said that she is not for impeachment.  In an interview just released by the Washington Post,\" she says quote, \"Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country, and he's just not worth it.\"</p><p>Democratic congressman, Adam Schiff, is backing up Speaker Pelosi by saying tonight that only graphic evidence would warrant an impeachment gamble against President Trump.</p><p>But that line of thinking will put the Democratic leadership at odds with many members of their own party, including Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib who's already said that she's planning to introduce articles of impeachment against President Trump by the end of this month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D), MICHIGAN:  If we don't hold impeachment proceedings today, start them today, and hold him accountable to following the United States constitution.  Think about that.  This is not going to be the last CEO that runs for president of the United States.  This is not going to be the last person that tries to get away with this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FISHER:  So President Trump and Speaker Pelosi may finally agree on one thing.  No impeachment.  But they still disagree on most everything else, especially the new budget proposal put forward by the White House today.</p><p>Pelosi called it cruel and shortsighted.  She said, quote, \"The cruel and shortsighted cuts in President Trump's budget request are a roadmap to a sicker, weaker America.  House Democrats will reject this toxic, destructive, budget request which would hollow out our national strength and failed to meet the needs of the American people.\"</p><p>The White House says that this budget proposal is aimed at keeping Americans safe by increasing defense spending and including more than $8 billion for the border wall.  But it's also slashing funding for many domestic programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSS VOUGHT, ACTING DIRECTOR, OMB:  Washington has a spending problem and it endangers the future prosperity of our nation for generations to come.  This budget contains nearly $2.7 trillion in savings, more spending reductions proposed than any administration in history.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FISHER:  But even with those savings, this budget proposal would still push the federal deficit past $1 trillion.  The White House is asking for a huge number for fiscal year 2020, a record $4.7 trillion.</p><p>It's a big number, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  It is.  And they've got to answer some questions about that.</p><p>FISHER:  And it's just a proposal.  Not --</p><p>BREAM:  yes.</p><p>FISHER:  Just a blueprint.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  And we remember seeing President Obama's proposals voted down like 99 to nothing.  So we know that the president's proposal is just a place for Congress to start.</p><p>FISHER:  Just a place to start.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Thank you.</p><p>FISHER:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Wisconsin Republicans say they are not surprised the Democratic Party picked Milwaukee for next year's National Convention because of the city's strong ties they say to socialism.</p><p>Correspondent David Spunt has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOM BARRETT (D), MAYOR OF MILWAUKEE:  I want to welcome to Milwaukee the 2020 Democratic National Convention.</p><p>DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  On a cold Milwaukee afternoon, it became clear July 2020 will be hot.</p><p>TOM PEREZ, CHAIRMAN, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE:  Our democracies on fire.  It's a five alarm blaze and we have first responders in this room and elsewhere prepared to take back our democracy.</p><p>SPUNT:  Milwaukee beat out Houston and Miami for the DNC bid, and it's the only major city that counts three socialist mayors in its history.  The Wisconsin Republican Party put out a statement, quote, \"No city in America has stronger ties to socialism than Milwaukee.  And with the rise of Bernie Sanders and the embrace of socialism by its newest leaders, the American left has come full circle.\"  End quote.</p><p>Speaking of Sanders, he's number two on a new national international Monmouth University poll which tested 20 different candidates.  Sanders has been a proud Democratic socialist for decades and he's three percent behind former vice president, Joe Biden, who has yet to announce a run.</p><p>Sanders is at the top of the pack in a recent Emerson Poll focusing on New Hampshire.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT:  In 2016, this is where the political revolution took off.  Thank you, New Hampshire.</p><p>SPUNT:  Whether or not a candidate is a socialist is now a key question, a question that some candidates dismissed.</p><p>GOV. JOHN HICKENLOOPER (D-CO), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Once you get back into these labels, am I a capitalist, am I a socialist?  How much of -- how much of a capitalist am I versus how much of a socialist?  It becomes kind of silly, doesn't it?</p><p>SPUNT:  While others distanced themselves completely from the socialist label.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS:  Bernie has to speak to what Democratic socialism is.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And you are not one.</p><p>WARREN:  And I'm not.</p><p>HOWARD SCHULTZ, FORMER CHAIRMAN AND CEO, STARBUCKS:  We don't want a government takeover of our lives.</p><p>SPUNT:  Independent, Howard Schultz, thought he got a negative reaction from the crowd when he talked socialism.</p><p>SCHULTZ:  If you want a good description for socialism, I think just look at Venezuela.  It's a -- you don't like that?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SPUNT:  Howard Schultz said he'll make up his mind about a run by the summer.  He brushes off any criticism that he could hurt the Democrats chance to win the White House.  The convention in Wisconsin, Shannon, a state President Trump won in 2016.</p><p>BREAM:  I'm a -- Schultz will continue causing a lot of heartburn for folks out there, waiting for that decision.  David, thank you.</p><p>All right.  They featured interviews with the nation's most prominent hip-hop stars and celebrities.  But now, the popular radio show is also a must-stop media spot for 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.  Senators Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Cory Booker among others have all stopped in.</p><p>Joining me now from the nationally syndicated radio show, the Breakfast Club on Power 105.1 in New York City.  DJ Envy, Angela Yee, and Charlamagne tha God.  Welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT.  Great to have you, guys.</p><p>RAASHAUN CASEY, AMERICAN DISC JOCKEY:  Hey, thanks for having us.</p><p>ANGELA YEE, AMERICAN RADIO PERSONALITY:  Hi, Shannon.</p><p>LENARD LARRY MCKELVEY, AMERICAN RADIO PRESENTER:  What's happening?</p><p>BREAM:  Listen, I got to read something from the Daily Beast.  This how they describe you, saying, \"The world's most dangerous morning show.  Charlamagne tha God and his co-host DJ Envy and Angela Yee conduct lengthy interviews with politicians in which the cultural weight of the show and the informality of its interviews often force media train presidential hopeful to let down their guard and get more personal.\"</p><p>Angela, I know you said people are in danger if they come and try to act cool and it's not real.  How does that go?</p><p>YEE:  Well, I think part of the issue is that we're not political pundits.  So people come on the show and they're used to talking about things like their policies and things that are very rehearsed.</p><p>But when you come on the Breakfast Club, we might ask you about anything.  And I think for people, they also want to answer for our audience.  So they might say things to make them sound like more hip than normal.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, and you know, Senator Kamala Harris --</p><p>CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD:  You know --</p><p>BREAM:  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  No.  I was going to say, you know, when you talk to a politician, they've got a talking point for everything, especially when you talk to them about politics.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes, that's the truth.  We find that out every time we have one on.</p><p>Senator Kamala Harris who has gotten a lot of attention, very popular, pulling near the top, even though -- away from the first cluster, but she's definitely in the mix.</p><p>I want to play something that she talked about with you guys that got a lot of attention.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D), CALIFORNIA:  I am absolutely in favor of legalizing marijuana.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Have ever smoked?</p><p>HARRIS:  I have.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  OK.  In college or --</p><p>HARRIS:  And I inhaled.  I did -- I did inhale.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  What were you listening to when you were high?</p><p>CASEY:  What was on?  What song was it?  Was it Snoop?</p><p>HARRIS:  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, yes, definitely Snoop.  Tupac, for sure.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  I mean, guys, that was a big moment.  You just keep making national news with these interviews.</p><p>CASEY:  That question was a little crazy because I asked her what she listened to and my cohost over here was still on the weed question.  And it got a little blurry.  But she was talking about what she listen to.  She says she listened Tupac.  She listened to Snoop and it kind of got blurred with Charlamagne's weed question.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Fox News, you did that.  You all took that out of context.  You all started that.</p><p>BREAM:  I will tell you, it wasn't me.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  You all did that.</p><p>BREAM:  But I can always double-check on that.</p><p>Who do you guys want who hasn't stopped by yet?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I mean, the interesting thing is not like we sit around and we send out these requests for different people.  It's just like whoever wants to come.  We have a platform.  2020 is wide open.  A lot of people are looking to see who they want to vote for in 2020.</p><p>So we're interested in anybody who's running, who wants to get the word out.</p><p>YEE:  I wouldn't mind to have Elizabeth Warren on.  I think she'd be --</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Elizabeth Warren would be great.</p><p>CASEY:  Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>CASEY:  Anybody on both sides though.  Democratic, Republican.  It doesn't matter.  We would love to talk to anybody.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  And I like Julian Castro.  I saw him make a very great statement today when he came to reparations.  So I would love to have him on.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  I mean, that's something that you've talked about with Bernie -- Senator Bernie Sanders.  I mean, he is in the top one or two slots in almost all of the new polls.  It's him and the former vice president and who's not technically in.</p><p>What did you make of Bernie's answer on that?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Oh, I didn't like his answer at all because it seemed to be something he wasn't considering or it's just something he wants to -- he wants some type of form of reparations.  Well, he seemed like he wasn't for the reparations thing at all.</p><p>CASEY:  Kind of avoiding the question a little bit.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.</p><p>YEE:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I wasn't digging his answers.</p><p>YEE:  I think it's important to have solutions.  Like to see if there's an issue that we have, so here are some solutions, here are some possibilities of how we can make that happen instead of dodging a question.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Absolutely.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, and Hillary Clinton back in 2016, she made a lot of news for this exchange when she was on your show.  We want to play.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YEE:  What's something that you always carry with you?</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES:  Hot sauce.</p><p>CASEY:  Really?</p><p>CLINTON:  Yes.</p><p>CASEY:  Really?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  You're giving information right now?</p><p>CASEY:  Hot sauce.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Hot sauce in my bag?  What?</p><p>CLINTON:  Hot sauce.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Really?</p><p>CLINTON:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Now, listen, I'd want you to know people are going to see this and say, OK.  She's pandering to black people.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLINTON:  OK.  Is it working?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  She got a lot of heat for that.  What did you guys make of that exchange?  Because that kind of set the bar for stopping by to your show.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I mean, I said it to her in that moment, you know, this is one of those times when people are going to think that you're pandering the black people.</p><p>But she has said that she likes hot sauce in previous interviews decades earlier.  So maybe she wasn't pandering.</p><p>But the best part about that exchange was when she looked me in the eye and say --</p><p>YEE:  \"Is it working?\"</p><p>MCKELVEY:  \"Is it working?\"  That's a very honest response.</p><p>YEE:  You know, after that, I had to do some research myself and I did go back and see that she talk about it in various other outlets.  And she's been talking about it for years.  But most people won't do that research to see.  This is something real.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.  I don't know how much it worked because --</p><p>CASEY:  People still think that's pandering.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Well, no, she didn't win.</p><p>CASEY:  No, she didn't win.</p><p>YEE:  She did not -- well, technically.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  Well, that's in the history books.</p><p>Let me ask about the guy who did win.  How would you guys handle an interview with President Trump?</p><p>(LAUGHS)</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I don't think that'll go well.</p><p>CASEY:  I think that will go amazing, actually.  He would have to be honest.</p><p>YEE:  I don't think that he would be comfortable answering any questions from us.  I doubt that he would stay for a full interview with us.  Just because there's a lot of issues that I have with things that he says that had been problematic for us and our people.</p><p>Things that we hear that Michael Cohen is even coming forward and saying that he said in private to him, so.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I don't think he would come because I don't think he cares about our audience.  I mean, there's nothing about Donald Trump that makes me think he cares about black and brown people.</p><p>YEE:  There's a lot of hurtful things that he says.  Personally he had offended me.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  I mean, something that he talks about a lot is the low unemployment rate, historically low, for African-Americans and for the Hispanic community.  It is something he likes to talk about.  If he thought he had a platform with you guys, would he be welcome?</p><p>CASEY:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes, he definitely will be welcomed.  It's very important to know that started with Barack Obama.  It was the policies that Barack Obama implemented that caused the unemployment rate to be so low for African-Americans now and Donald Trump is taking credit for it.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, you know, he loves to joust.  He loves to fight.  He would love to debate that with you guys.  So he might actually come and stick around.  I think he might enjoy it.</p><p>YEE:  Let's have him come on.</p><p>BREAM:  He might --</p><p>CASEY:  I would love for him to come.</p><p>YEE:  Even when he gets asked questions at the White House with reporters.  He'll ban you if he doesn't like your questions, so.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.  And tell him pull up.  We'll get him -- we'll get him some fast food.  We'll get him some little White Castle sliders that fit his little hands.</p><p>CASEY:  Some McDonald's.  Some McDonald's too.</p><p>BREAM:  You know he loves the fast food.</p><p>OK.  So if he's listening tonight, because sometimes he does watch, go ahead and make your pitch to him.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I'm not --</p><p>CASEY:  We're not pitching it.</p><p>YEE:  I mean, we're not really excited.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  If he's smart, he will come up here.</p><p>CASEY:  If he wants to pull up -- he can pull up any time.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  It's not something that we want.  It's not something that we're requesting.  I'm not about to make no pitch.</p><p>CASEY:  No, we're not pitching for him.  But if he wants to come, he's invited.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  And there might be some snacks involved.</p><p>YEE:  He should face --</p><p>BREAM:  The Breakfast show.  World's most dangerous morning show.  Keep making news.  We'll keep watching.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.</p><p>BREAM:  Thank you, guys, very much.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Thank you very much.  Thank you for having us.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  The speaker says no-go to progressive plans to impeach the president.  The Mueller's special counsel reported isn't even in yet.  So, why is she taking plan b off the table?</p><p>Our power panel is here to weigh in.  They are standing by right there for you.  They're next.</p><p>Plus, the latest on the Boeing 737 Max crash.  Lawmakers calling for the aircraft to be grounded.  Will it affect your travel plans?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JOHN YARMUTH (D), KENTUCKY:  To me it's not a question of whether, it's a question of when and probably right now is not the right time but I think at some point it's going to be inevitable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  Reaction still coming in to Speaker Pelosi telling the Washington Post she is not for impeaching President Trump.  Time now for tonight's power panel, the President of Open Primaries, John Opdycke, the director of Strategic Communications for Trump 2020, Marc Lotter, and Fox News Contributor, former Utah Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz.  Welcome to all of you.</p><p>JOHN OPDYCKE, PRESIDENT, OPEN PRIMARIES:  Good evening.</p><p>MARC LOTTER, DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS FOR TRUMP 2020:  Hi, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  So just to remind, folks, this is the quote from Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker.  She says impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country and he's just not worth it.  Marc?</p><p>LOTTER:  What took her so long?  It's been two years, 300,000 documents, hundreds of hours of interviews, and she's come to the same conclusion that President Trump said day one.  No collusion.  So I'm surprised that it took her that long to get there.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  I want to read something from Politico today, it says, Dems have started the years of impeachment.  Can they still turn back?  It says interviews with more than a dozen key Democratic lawmakers revealed deep division within the caucus about whether their efforts could end up helping Trump win a second term in office.  John, we've heard that from a lot of folks who worry that it will just mobilize his base.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Yes.  I don't agree with Speaker Pelosi on much but I take her side on this.  I think that moving in the impeachment direction will be a real disservice to the rich, robust political conversation that's taking place in the country right now.  On a whole range of issues from Green New Deal, to Medicare for All, to immigration and so forth.  And I think in some ways, the American people are deeply distrustful of Congress.</p><p>And to take this decision about who the next President is going to be out of the hands of the American people and put it in the hand of an institution the people don't have a lot of trust in right now, I think it's the wrong direction to go.  I agree with Speaker Pelosi.  Leave it up to the people.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Tom Steyer who is a billionaire, who has talked a lot about the political game.  He's not running this time but he's supporting lot of other causes and folks and he has been all about impeachment from day one.  He says this, he says Speaker Pelosi thinks he's just not worth it, well, is defending our legal system worth it?  Is holding the President accountable for his crimes and cover ups worth it?</p><p>Is doing what's right worth it or shall America just stop fighting for our principles and so what's politically convenient, Jason?</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I think Speaker Pelosi was right, other than the last part of the phrase that she offered there but our founders put up an exceptionally high bar.  If she had an inkling, if she had some evidence, I think she would go for it.  I think it's an admission that she doesn't have that evidence but she has a problem with their caucus because she's got 60 or so people that have already signed up for impeachment.</p><p>They've been promising this from the day Donald Trump was sworn in.  The problem for the Democrats is they just don't have any evidence, and they don't have any facts to actually back something up and make the case because it would be a loser and the country knows that and she is smart enough to recognize that.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, you know the committees that are coordinating in the 81 letters that went out last week looking into any number of things, from the Trump organization, to family members, to Russia, to everything else even though the special counsel were still waiting on that formal proceeding to close out.  So it's clear that they're casting a net to look for some things.  Aaron Blake at the Washington Post writes after the news of Speaker Pelosi today, he says, Pelosi's ability to tamp down impeachment fever could be one of the most significant battles of her speakership and these new comments are a line in the sand.</p><p>I mean, Marc, we're hearing a number of Democrats out tonight and saying or in recent days saying they still think and you hear Congressman Yarmuth, it's just a matter of time.</p><p>LOTTER:  Yes.  I mean, the number of investigations they're launching completely egregious but when you look at what were actually getting to and this is another bad week that is showing the Democrat Party is breaking apart right in front of our very eyes.  I don't see where any of the 2020 Democratic candidates are out there rallying the base and inspiring their liberal donors with no impeachment.  The radicals have taken over.</p><p>That's who controls their party right now and I am going to be very interested to see how their Presidential candidates try to balance what Speaker Pelosi is saying with the realities on the ground and trying to win in a very polarized, very radical party.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  We're just getting in some news here, the New York Attorney General and we know that the President is facing a lot of trouble at the state level with the southern district of New York.  Actually a Federal but they're in New York -- but there are -- the state A.G. has made a lot of noise too about conducting some investigations.  The attorney general's office in New York late Monday issuing subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank for records relating to the financing of four major Trump organization projects at a failed effort to buy the buffalo bills of the National Football League.</p><p>John, what do you make about that?  I mean, it seems like the President, it's going to be a long time before all these various investigations for multiple agencies are ever wrapped up.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Yes, and everybody knows that President Trump is a ruffian.  That is beyond dispute.  I think the tactical question, the political question that the Democrats have to take seriously is why not allow the people of this country to weigh in on that question?  Why do you want to shortchange that with politically motivated investigations that even if they're correct, set up a situation that furthers the divisions in this country.</p><p>And frankly hold the Democrats back from pushing a lot of the issues that they're having a lot of traction with right now.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  And Jason, it seems like there is this internal split about some of these really big issues.  We saw last week that it took them a week to put together the resolution that ended up condemning not only anti-Semitism but Islamophobia and white supremacy and all kinds of things.  We thought it was ready for the floor then it's back then they're fighting again and now we understand that there is -- this internal split.</p><p>And some of it has gone public about this issue of impeachment but the Speaker also said that \"the party is unified.\"</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I don't think so.  I think the Democrats are an absolute chaos.  I mean, think about it.  Bernie Sanders is the leader of the Democratic Party.  He's not a member of the Democratic Party.  He is registered as an Independent and really a socialist, so the leader of the Presidential candidates isn't even a member of their own party.  And then they can't decide whether or not they hate the Jewish people are not and how are they going to actually articulate that in a pace, in a resolution instead of calling out the actual individual.</p><p>I don't think that all the -- all the Democrats hate Jews but you do have some that need to be called out specifically.  The way Republicans did, like I did, with Mr. King when he stepped over the line.  So again, it's a -- it's a -- it's a campaign that's in chaos, a party that can't define itself.  And they're totally off message.  And they have to explain to the American people why they think these socialist views are the right solution for America because America is not buying it.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Senator Elizabeth Warren is officially in the race said this weekend it is wrong to call her socialist.  She doesn't support that.  But we're going to talk more about and coming up how she's also wants to go after some big tech companies and break them up, so there's a lot there to digest.  Power panel, thank you.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Just to say one thing in response to Congressman Chaffetz is that you say the American people are buying these things, I think the American people are deeply interested in having an honest conversation about many of the issues that progressives and socialists like Bernie Sanders and AOC are putting on the table.  It doesn't mean they agree with them on everything but they want to talk about these things.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, to leave it there.  The keyword --</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Oh, I would love to talk about those issues.</p><p>BREAM:  The keyword is honest --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Bring it on.  Bring it on.  You will drive the Democratic Party into the grave.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  I think the key there is honest and we can talk -- keep it factual.  I think that it's important for the American people.  They do want to talk about these things.  But in the meantime, thank you gentlemen.  Come back soon.</p><p>LOTTER:  Thank you.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Coming up, caught in the act, dramatic surveillance footage of a transsexual woman accused of pepper spray attacks all across New York.  We'll tell you what that's about.  And Liz Warren breaking ranks with socialist Democrats but also vowing to take on big tech.  We told you about that.  She's proposing to break up some giant social media companies.  Trace on the case.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WARREN:  The giant tech companies right now are eating up little tiny businesses, start-ups, and competing unfairly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  A transgender woman has been arrested in New York.  Police say, she might be behind a series of pepper spray attacks in Upper Manhattan.  One couple says, the attacker allegedly approached them on the street, asked the woman if she was white, and then pepper sprayed her.  The man tried to intervene, the attacker pulled out a knife, he says.  Authorities say, 11 people were attacked over the weekend in suspected hate crimes.</p><p>We're awaiting information from the Black Box of the Ethiopian Airlines plane, the Boeing 737 Max 8 that crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all 157 people aboard, including at least eight Americans.  The FAA says that planes are still air-worthy after two fatal crashes in less than six months.  Correspondent Doug McKelway has the latest.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  At the United Nations today, a flag at half-staff, an honor of the 157 people killed, 21 of them U.N. staffers in Sunday's crash of an Ethiopian Airlines, Boeing 737.</p><p>ABBY AHMED, ETHIOPIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  As we all know Ethiopian Airlines is a well-known airline that has not experienced such accidents for a long time.</p><p>MCKELWAY:  It was the second Boeing 737 Max 8 to crash in the last five months.  In the first, the like Lion Air Max 8 plane dove vertically into the sea, killing all 189 on board.  In both cases, radar data showed there were similar violent oscillations, pitching up and down, before the planes crashed.  But in the Lion Air case, there were other problems.  That plane had maintenance issues with airspeed, altimeter and other gauges.  The Max 8 is the latest generation Boeing's 737 with more power, more fuel-efficient engines.  The bigger engines necessitated the redesign of the plane's trim controls.  When the two trim control switches are turned off, and the plane is powered up, it causes a different reaction than in earlier models.</p><p>JOHN GOGLIA, FORMER NTSB INVESTIGATOR:  When you apply full power to the airplane, it's going to drive the nose up.  So, what Boeing did to counter that is they automated it.</p><p>MCKELWAY:  But if the trim switch is turned off or malfunctioning, a poorly trained pilot might have problems.  Over correcting for the nose up with a pitch down.  It can produce what's called pilot induced oscillation, as seen in this 1978 NASA video.  The first officer in the Ethiopian air crash had 200 hours of flying time, compared to a minimum of 1500 hours for U.S. first officers.</p><p>The flight and voice data recorders have been recovered.  Ethiopian, Cayman Airways, and China have all grounded the Max 8, but neither the Boeing, the FAA nor Domestic Carriers United, American, or Southwest have.  In December Boeing took a risk amid the ongoing trade war, opening a finishing facility in China, the world's largest growing airplane market.  The first plane to roll out of that facility was a 737 Max 8.  Shannon?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM:  Doug McKelway, thank you very much.  Two progressives, two different views, of what to do about big technology.  Well, Senator Elizabeth Warren wants to better regulate big tech, Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez see's technology as a means to a post-capitalist end.  Trace is on the case from our L.A. Newsroom.  Trace.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Shannon.  Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren is well-aware that her views often draw comparisons to her Senate colleague Bernie Sanders, but Warren wants to make it clear unlike Sanders she's not a Democratic socialist.  She supports capitalism, albeit with the right regulations.  And in the process of building her campaign and defining her positions, the Massachusetts senator has laid out her plan to break up big technology -- a goal she shares with President Trump.  For example, Warren would require regulators to go after massive mergers like Amazon buying Whole Foods and Facebook's ownership of Instagram.  Watch.</p><p>WARREN:  We want to keep that market place competitive, not let a giant who has an incredible information advantage, and a manipulative advantage, be able to snuff you out.</p><p>GALLAGHER:  Oddly, today, Facebook took down a number of Warren's campaign ads saying she misused its company logo.  Warren responded by citing Facebook's power to shut down debate.  The ads have now been restored.  Then, there's Democratic freshman Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who doesn't seem nearly as worried about big technology expanding or the rise of workplace robots.  In fact, Ocasio-Cortez says, Americans should be excited to have their jobs automated, quoting: \"The reason we're not excited by it is because we live in a society where if you don't have a job, you are left to die.  And that is, at its core, our problem.\"  She points out that not having a job gives you more time.</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), NEW YORK:  We should be excited about automation because what it could potentially mean is more time educating ourselves, more time creating art, more time investing and investigating in the sciences, more time focused on invention, more time going to space, more time enjoying the world that we live in.</p><p>GALLAGHER:  In case you're wondering, the 29-year-old Ocasio-Cortez drew bigger crowds at South by Southwest than any other presidential candidates.  Shannon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM:  All right, Trace Gallagher, thank you very much.  There is a new face of terror.  Hamza bin Laden, the son of Osama bin Laden, has a giant bounty now on his head.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  As released audio and video messages on the Internet, calling on his followers to want to attack against the United States and its western allies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  So, will the man who killed Osama bin Laden, his father, Rob O'Neill, take a shot at finding his son?  Rob joins us live to tell us what he thinks, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  Terror has a new face and he wants revenge on America.  Officials are warning that Osama bin Laden's son is actively engaging in terrorism and is emerging as the leader of al-Qaeda.  The State Department is offering a million-dollar reward for information on Hamza bin Laden's whereabouts, so let's talk to the guy who killed his dad, Osama bin Laden, former Navy SEAL Rob O'Neill.  Good to have you with us again, Rob.</p><p>ROB O'NEILL, FORMER NAVY SEAL:  Thank you, Shannon, for having me.  I appreciate it.</p><p>BREAM:  It may have been in jest, but we've got to put up on Twitter, there was a group that reached out to you and said, you know, we're assembling crew to go claim the $1 million bounty, are you in?  You say maybe not legitimately, but you do think it's a worthy mission at this point.</p><p>O'NEILL:  This is definitely a worthy mission, just to continue to prove that if terror rears its ugly head, we have men and women who are willing to go do it.  You know, on a serious note, I would do everything asked of me to do, but we have younger, more seasoned guys that are out there right now.  Some guys that were on the actual raid -- I don't know if we would risk that kind of a cross-border type thing that we did with Osama bin Laden, but something along the lines of the good men and women from the three letter agencies that find some intel on where he is and hit him with a drone strike.  I think that Hamza bin Laden, at least, is smart enough to know that gets too cute and too cocky, he's going to stick his head out and he's going to get gotten.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, apparently, he has reached out and started to make some noise over the last couple of years.  He obviously is.  We've talked about it.  I mean, there are a number of his family members who have been taken out of this al-Qaeda fight and he's got a lot of skin in the game, as you've said.  John Gambrell back in March, he says this, talking about Hamza bin Laden, began appearing in militant videos back as far as 2015.  And he said this apparently, if you think that your sinful crime that you committed in Abbottabad has passed without punishment, then you thought wrong.\"</p><p>O'NEILL:  Right, and the way that Hamza thinks, because of his brand of Islam that he follows, they're not going to worship of false idols, so it's not going to be revenge for the death of his father and his brother, and his other brother before them.  It would be more to avenge the deaths of the defenders of Islam, as they call it.  You know, because they're obviously very religious, in their own psychotic version of Islam.  Yes, he's making it apparent that he's there and he remembers what happened and what's been going on.</p><p>And he thinks that we've oppressed everyone in Iraq, and in Iran, and in Pakistan and all that stuff.  Al-Qaeda -- they're just on a strategic pause right now.  This isn't an end.  And they're going to sit there -- and like I've always said, ISIS loved the big headline and they stab in the front.  Al-Qaeda is going to wait around and stab you in the back.  They hit New York in 2003, tried to knock down the Trade Towers; and they didn't forget, they came back in 2001 and succeeded.  So, you can't get complacent with these guys, because complacency will get you killed.</p><p>BREAM:  What do you make of the price tag?  Is it enough in the scenario to get people to turn him in?</p><p>O'NEILL:  I mean, it could be but he is surrounded by some hardliners -- everyone, Taliban, and al-Qaeda guys are all around him.  It's going to take a little bit of money for an outsider to sort of see in, especially considering what happened with the doctor in Abbottabad, Pakistan that sort of helped us try to locate Osama bin Laden.  You know, he's not in a good place right now.  And it's going to take five or 10 million which wouldn't be much for us.  It worked with a lot of the Ba'ath party and (INAUDIBLE) Hussein in Iraq.  It could work here again, but like, al-Qaeda is a lot more -- they're a lot more loyal to each other than the Ba'ath party was.</p><p>BREAM:  Well -- and very quickly, we just have a few seconds, do you think he's probably in Pakistan?</p><p>O'NEILL:  I would say pretty much in Pakistan.  Yes, probably, in Pakistan or at least in the tribal regions where there's not a lot of law and they kind of protect him there.  And weirdly enough, he's been cooperating with the Iranians.  I believe he was pretty much raised in Iran under the cover of Iran, because that government can, even with the travel ban, probably help him travel certain places.  So, it is scary, but he's in the area.  I'm thinking right near (INAUDIBLE) of Pakistan.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, as you said, and others have noted, don't mistake their pause for inactivity.  They saying, you know, experts very much that they have the ability and the intent to come after the U.S. again.</p><p>O'NEILL:  Oh, they definitely have the intent.  That's what happens when you raise people from the time, they're infants to the time, the like, Hamza -- they're in their 30s, just to hate people because they don't believe what you believe.  You get this kind of stuff.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, Rob O'Neill, always great to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>O'NEILL:  Thanks, Shannon.  I appreciate it.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, the Supreme Court made it clear, public employees can no longer be forced to pay dues to a union they don't support.  But five California public school teachers say, that is exactly what's happening to them and now, they are suing.  We'll hear from their lawyer, we're going to debate both sides.  Plus, the president joins the daylight savings time debate, should it stay or should it go?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  On the heels of six-day teachers strike in California, five teachers are now suing the state's top union over collecting dues through mandatory paycheck deductions.  A practice that the Supreme Court calls on unconstitutional less than a year ago.  All right, let's bring in former Aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, Chris Hahn; and the lawyer representing the teachers, you recognize her, Harmeet Dhillon.  Thank you both for joining us.</p><p>HARMEET DHILLION, LAWYER:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>CHRIS HAHN, FORMER AIDE TO SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER:  Thanks for having us.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Harmeet, I just want you to clarify because Justice Alito was very clear.  He said this, in the decision last year, we conclude that this arrangement violates the free-speech rights of nonmembers by compelling them to subsidize private speech on matters of substantial public concern, and he said, unless these people affirmatively consent to giving the money, the unions can't take it.  Are you claiming that's what happening in California?</p><p>DHILLON:  Exactly what's happening.  So, our five clients working in conjunction with the freedom foundation, which has filed this type of lawsuit in other West Coast states as well, are claiming that they have opted out of their union card contracts.  And despite having opted out, the union is not letting them out until the anniversary of their one-year contract.  So, every pay period that their paychecks are being deducted, significant money in the case of the lead plaintiff, Bethany Mendez, $1500 a year on a pretty meager teacher's salary, a constitutional violation is occurring.  And so, the Supreme Court was very clear that you cannot take this money unless there is a knowing and voluntary waiver of the First Amendment.  And so, none of these teachers have made a voluntary waiver of the First Amendment rights.</p><p>BREAM:  So, Chris, even if you didn't like the ruling from the Supreme Court, it was a tight 15-4 last year.  Why shouldn't these teachers have the right to put their foot down over this?</p><p>HAHN:  Well, they are.  They signed a contract and they agreed to have these dues taken out.  I always wonder where you find teachers who are willing to go against their own interests and fight their union which basically gives them a much better salary, much better benefits and much better working conditions than they would've gotten on their own, especially given the market where there are thousands of teachers coming out of colleges every single day for every single opening.  These unions actually strengthen teachers and give them a better life at a fraction for what they are paying for these unions.  So, I am shocked that these people are willing to be used this way.  I hope that the kids that they teach are learning something because, god, these people don't seem to have learned much when they were in college.</p><p>DHILLON: Wow!</p><p>BREAM:  But Chris, you know, like the plaintiffs in a couple of these big cases, before the Supreme Court have said, they're going out on -- and supporting political candidates and messages with my dues money that I 100 percent disagree with, and they don't feel like they should have to subsidize that speech.  Does that make them terrible people?</p><p>HAHN:  You know, it's funny.  It's a slippery slope and, you know, when -- you know, we all pay for things we don't want going to support things we don't like.  For example, I'd buy gasoline every day.  Do I have a right to determine what we're going to -- what the gasoline company is going to do with the money I spend on it?  You know, it's a very slippery slope.  The Supreme Court got it wrong and it will be overturned when we get some reasonable members on that court.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  Harmeet, the California Teachers Association, by the way, very brave statement, only responding this way, saying: \"It's another lawsuit from the Freedom Foundation to continue the attack on public education and public employees.\"  Harmeet?</p><p>DHILLION:  So, Chris just called these teachers stupid and said that their students are going to learn nothing, and he also ignore the fact that this is a constitutional violation.  That's the difference between your gas analogy and what's going on here.  And if you think about it in terms of a term that choice -- that the left loves which is freedom of choice, that's what these teachers are really looking for here.  They're looking for the choice to be part of a union or not.  And by the way, the sky doesn't fall when people aren't part of a union.  Chris, as you know in the federal system, people are --</p><p>HAHN:  They can opt out at the end of their contract.  They opted in and now they're opting out.</p><p>DHILLON:  Please don't interrupt me, Chris, I didn't interrupt you.  In the federal system, people do not -- people are not required to be part of the union and the unions go on just fine.  And so, no, when you have a constitutional right, it is not sufficient to you can opt out when we tell you can.  After they opted out, Shannon, union sent thugs into the classroom to try to intimidate them into revoking their opt out.</p><p>HAHN:  Stop.  Thugs.  Kindergarten teachers.</p><p>DHILLON:  And so, this is not acceptable.  And it is time for the state of California to follow the constitution as the Supreme Court says.</p><p>BREAM:  Chris, you don't think that's OK, coercion, do you, Chris?</p><p>HAHN:  No, of course not.  But I also don't think that these teachers who are her clients understand how much they're being used by extreme right-wing groups that just want to break unions all over the country.</p><p>DHILLION:  Yes, they're so dumb and you know better.</p><p>HANH:  Well, look, they are clearly unaware of how they're being used, you know.  So, it is a shame and I feel bad for them, because they're going to learn very soon if they their union does collapse, what their salaries would be in a free market, and it won't be good for them.</p><p>DHILLON:  I think they're going to be just fine without all the coerced speech.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes, a lot of people felt after the ruling last year that there would be a big threat to the unions falling apart, that kind of thing.  We haven't seen that yet.  So, we'll see and we'll watch this case and see who is right in their predictions.</p><p>HAHN:  Not for trying of these groups, though, that's for sure.</p><p>BREAM:  Chris and Harmeet, thank you both.  Good to see you.</p><p>DHILLON:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>HAHN:  Thank you, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, coming up, is New York Mayor Bill de Blasio losing the forest for the trees, as the mayor tells kids to have meatless Mondays?  Economists are warning the city is about to head into a financial crisis.  That stories are in our \"REAL NEWS ROUND UP\", next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  Well, a woman gets booted from a hearing on gun control after apparently texting about going on a shooting spree of her own.  That story tops tonight's \"REAL NEWS ROUNDUP.\"  The unidentified woman was ejected from a Connecticut State Senate hearing after she was reportedly spotted sending a text saying: if she had a gun, she'd \"blow away a Republican state lawmaker and a large group of NRAs.\"  Connecticut capital police determined there was no threat.  The woman was not arrested.</p><p>New York City implementing meatless Mondays in public schools, a move supporter say, promotes healthy, environmentally friendly meal options.  The mayor says, cutting back on a little meat will help down on greenhouse gases and help save the planet.

A new podcast drops tomorrow.  Subscribe at podcastone.com.  Shannon Bream and the FOX NEWS @ NIGHT team take it from here.  I'll be in New York tomorrow night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I will too.  I'll see you there, Laura.  Thank you so much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INGRAHAM:  All right.  See you then.</p><p>BREAM:  We begin tonight with a Fox News alert.  Breaking tonight, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says President Trump is not worth impeaching.  But that sparking a firestorm on the left where some though it is going to happen.  It's just a matter of time.</p><p>Tonight's announcement follows a week of internal Democratic Party chaos.  And the Democrats struggled with the socialism label heats up as they announce the site of next year's convention, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p><p>A smart Republican say is perfect since its elected three socialist mayors.</p><p>Plus, from socialism to slavery reparations to legalizing prostitution, it is all on the table with a popular hip-hop radio show host who are shaking up the script.  Getting personal with the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, the hosts of the powerhouse Breakfast Club join us live to talk about how it is becoming a Democratic campaign trail must-stop.</p><p>Hello and welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT.  I'm Shannon Bream in Washington.</p><p>We begin tonight with correspondent Kristin Fisher in tonight's bombshell from Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  The top Democrat is saying the president is not worth impeaching.  She's not going to support the move, but some other feels very differently about that.</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  This was quite an interview from Speaker Pelosi.  We've known for some time that the Democratic leadership has been wary of this rush to impeach from members of their own caucus.</p><p>But now, Speaker Pelosi has finally come out and publicly said that she is not for impeachment.  In an interview just released by the Washington Post,\" she says quote, \"Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country, and he's just not worth it.\"</p><p>Democratic congressman, Adam Schiff, is backing up Speaker Pelosi by saying tonight that only graphic evidence would warrant an impeachment gamble against President Trump.</p><p>But that line of thinking will put the Democratic leadership at odds with many members of their own party, including Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib who's already said that she's planning to introduce articles of impeachment against President Trump by the end of this month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D), MICHIGAN:  If we don't hold impeachment proceedings today, start them today, and hold him accountable to following the United States constitution.  Think about that.  This is not going to be the last CEO that runs for president of the United States.  This is not going to be the last person that tries to get away with this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FISHER:  So President Trump and Speaker Pelosi may finally agree on one thing.  No impeachment.  But they still disagree on most everything else, especially the new budget proposal put forward by the White House today.</p><p>Pelosi called it cruel and shortsighted.  She said, quote, \"The cruel and shortsighted cuts in President Trump's budget request are a roadmap to a sicker, weaker America.  House Democrats will reject this toxic, destructive, budget request which would hollow out our national strength and failed to meet the needs of the American people.\"</p><p>The White House says that this budget proposal is aimed at keeping Americans safe by increasing defense spending and including more than $8 billion for the border wall.  But it's also slashing funding for many domestic programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSS VOUGHT, ACTING DIRECTOR, OMB:  Washington has a spending problem and it endangers the future prosperity of our nation for generations to come.  This budget contains nearly $2.7 trillion in savings, more spending reductions proposed than any administration in history.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FISHER:  But even with those savings, this budget proposal would still push the federal deficit past $1 trillion.  The White House is asking for a huge number for fiscal year 2020, a record $4.7 trillion.</p><p>It's a big number, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  It is.  And they've got to answer some questions about that.</p><p>FISHER:  And it's just a proposal.  Not --</p><p>BREAM:  yes.</p><p>FISHER:  Just a blueprint.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  And we remember seeing President Obama's proposals voted down like 99 to nothing.  So we know that the president's proposal is just a place for Congress to start.</p><p>FISHER:  Just a place to start.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Thank you.</p><p>FISHER:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Wisconsin Republicans say they are not surprised the Democratic Party picked Milwaukee for next year's National Convention because of the city's strong ties they say to socialism.</p><p>Correspondent David Spunt has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOM BARRETT (D), MAYOR OF MILWAUKEE:  I want to welcome to Milwaukee the 2020 Democratic National Convention.</p><p>DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  On a cold Milwaukee afternoon, it became clear July 2020 will be hot.</p><p>TOM PEREZ, CHAIRMAN, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE:  Our democracies on fire.  It's a five alarm blaze and we have first responders in this room and elsewhere prepared to take back our democracy.</p><p>SPUNT:  Milwaukee beat out Houston and Miami for the DNC bid, and it's the only major city that counts three socialist mayors in its history.  The Wisconsin Republican Party put out a statement, quote, \"No city in America has stronger ties to socialism than Milwaukee.  And with the rise of Bernie Sanders and the embrace of socialism by its newest leaders, the American left has come full circle.\"  End quote.</p><p>Speaking of Sanders, he's number two on a new national international Monmouth University poll which tested 20 different candidates.  Sanders has been a proud Democratic socialist for decades and he's three percent behind former vice president, Joe Biden, who has yet to announce a run.</p><p>Sanders is at the top of the pack in a recent Emerson Poll focusing on New Hampshire.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT:  In 2016, this is where the political revolution took off.  Thank you, New Hampshire.</p><p>SPUNT:  Whether or not a candidate is a socialist is now a key question, a question that some candidates dismissed.</p><p>GOV. JOHN HICKENLOOPER (D-CO), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Once you get back into these labels, am I a capitalist, am I a socialist?  How much of -- how much of a capitalist am I versus how much of a socialist?  It becomes kind of silly, doesn't it?</p><p>SPUNT:  While others distanced themselves completely from the socialist label.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS:  Bernie has to speak to what Democratic socialism is.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And you are not one.</p><p>WARREN:  And I'm not.</p><p>HOWARD SCHULTZ, FORMER CHAIRMAN AND CEO, STARBUCKS:  We don't want a government takeover of our lives.</p><p>SPUNT:  Independent, Howard Schultz, thought he got a negative reaction from the crowd when he talked socialism.</p><p>SCHULTZ:  If you want a good description for socialism, I think just look at Venezuela.  It's a -- you don't like that?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SPUNT:  Howard Schultz said he'll make up his mind about a run by the summer.  He brushes off any criticism that he could hurt the Democrats chance to win the White House.  The convention in Wisconsin, Shannon, a state President Trump won in 2016.</p><p>BREAM:  I'm a -- Schultz will continue causing a lot of heartburn for folks out there, waiting for that decision.  David, thank you.</p><p>All right.  They featured interviews with the nation's most prominent hip-hop stars and celebrities.  But now, the popular radio show is also a must-stop media spot for 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.  Senators Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Cory Booker among others have all stopped in.</p><p>Joining me now from the nationally syndicated radio show, the Breakfast Club on Power 105.1 in New York City.  DJ Envy, Angela Yee, and Charlamagne tha God.  Welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT.  Great to have you, guys.</p><p>RAASHAUN CASEY, AMERICAN DISC JOCKEY:  Hey, thanks for having us.</p><p>ANGELA YEE, AMERICAN RADIO PERSONALITY:  Hi, Shannon.</p><p>LENARD LARRY MCKELVEY, AMERICAN RADIO PRESENTER:  What's happening?</p><p>BREAM:  Listen, I got to read something from the Daily Beast.  This how they describe you, saying, \"The world's most dangerous morning show.  Charlamagne tha God and his co-host DJ Envy and Angela Yee conduct lengthy interviews with politicians in which the cultural weight of the show and the informality of its interviews often force media train presidential hopeful to let down their guard and get more personal.\"</p><p>Angela, I know you said people are in danger if they come and try to act cool and it's not real.  How does that go?</p><p>YEE:  Well, I think part of the issue is that we're not political pundits.  So people come on the show and they're used to talking about things like their policies and things that are very rehearsed.</p><p>But when you come on the Breakfast Club, we might ask you about anything.  And I think for people, they also want to answer for our audience.  So they might say things to make them sound like more hip than normal.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, and you know, Senator Kamala Harris --</p><p>CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD:  You know --</p><p>BREAM:  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  No.  I was going to say, you know, when you talk to a politician, they've got a talking point for everything, especially when you talk to them about politics.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes, that's the truth.  We find that out every time we have one on.</p><p>Senator Kamala Harris who has gotten a lot of attention, very popular, pulling near the top, even though -- away from the first cluster, but she's definitely in the mix.</p><p>I want to play something that she talked about with you guys that got a lot of attention.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D), CALIFORNIA:  I am absolutely in favor of legalizing marijuana.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Have ever smoked?</p><p>HARRIS:  I have.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  OK.  In college or --</p><p>HARRIS:  And I inhaled.  I did -- I did inhale.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  What were you listening to when you were high?</p><p>CASEY:  What was on?  What song was it?  Was it Snoop?</p><p>HARRIS:  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, yes, definitely Snoop.  Tupac, for sure.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  I mean, guys, that was a big moment.  You just keep making national news with these interviews.</p><p>CASEY:  That question was a little crazy because I asked her what she listened to and my cohost over here was still on the weed question.  And it got a little blurry.  But she was talking about what she listen to.  She says she listened Tupac.  She listened to Snoop and it kind of got blurred with Charlamagne's weed question.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Fox News, you did that.  You all took that out of context.  You all started that.</p><p>BREAM:  I will tell you, it wasn't me.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  You all did that.</p><p>BREAM:  But I can always double-check on that.</p><p>Who do you guys want who hasn't stopped by yet?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I mean, the interesting thing is not like we sit around and we send out these requests for different people.  It's just like whoever wants to come.  We have a platform.  2020 is wide open.  A lot of people are looking to see who they want to vote for in 2020.</p><p>So we're interested in anybody who's running, who wants to get the word out.</p><p>YEE:  I wouldn't mind to have Elizabeth Warren on.  I think she'd be --</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Elizabeth Warren would be great.</p><p>CASEY:  Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>CASEY:  Anybody on both sides though.  Democratic, Republican.  It doesn't matter.  We would love to talk to anybody.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  And I like Julian Castro.  I saw him make a very great statement today when he came to reparations.  So I would love to have him on.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  I mean, that's something that you've talked about with Bernie -- Senator Bernie Sanders.  I mean, he is in the top one or two slots in almost all of the new polls.  It's him and the former vice president and who's not technically in.</p><p>What did you make of Bernie's answer on that?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Oh, I didn't like his answer at all because it seemed to be something he wasn't considering or it's just something he wants to -- he wants some type of form of reparations.  Well, he seemed like he wasn't for the reparations thing at all.</p><p>CASEY:  Kind of avoiding the question a little bit.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.</p><p>YEE:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I wasn't digging his answers.</p><p>YEE:  I think it's important to have solutions.  Like to see if there's an issue that we have, so here are some solutions, here are some possibilities of how we can make that happen instead of dodging a question.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Absolutely.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, and Hillary Clinton back in 2016, she made a lot of news for this exchange when she was on your show.  We want to play.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YEE:  What's something that you always carry with you?</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES:  Hot sauce.</p><p>CASEY:  Really?</p><p>CLINTON:  Yes.</p><p>CASEY:  Really?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  You're giving information right now?</p><p>CASEY:  Hot sauce.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Hot sauce in my bag?  What?</p><p>CLINTON:  Hot sauce.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Really?</p><p>CLINTON:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Now, listen, I'd want you to know people are going to see this and say, OK.  She's pandering to black people.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLINTON:  OK.  Is it working?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  She got a lot of heat for that.  What did you guys make of that exchange?  Because that kind of set the bar for stopping by to your show.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I mean, I said it to her in that moment, you know, this is one of those times when people are going to think that you're pandering the black people.</p><p>But she has said that she likes hot sauce in previous interviews decades earlier.  So maybe she wasn't pandering.</p><p>But the best part about that exchange was when she looked me in the eye and say --</p><p>YEE:  \"Is it working?\"</p><p>MCKELVEY:  \"Is it working?\"  That's a very honest response.</p><p>YEE:  You know, after that, I had to do some research myself and I did go back and see that she talk about it in various other outlets.  And she's been talking about it for years.  But most people won't do that research to see.  This is something real.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.  I don't know how much it worked because --</p><p>CASEY:  People still think that's pandering.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Well, no, she didn't win.</p><p>CASEY:  No, she didn't win.</p><p>YEE:  She did not -- well, technically.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  Well, that's in the history books.</p><p>Let me ask about the guy who did win.  How would you guys handle an interview with President Trump?</p><p>(LAUGHS)</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I don't think that'll go well.</p><p>CASEY:  I think that will go amazing, actually.  He would have to be honest.</p><p>YEE:  I don't think that he would be comfortable answering any questions from us.  I doubt that he would stay for a full interview with us.  Just because there's a lot of issues that I have with things that he says that had been problematic for us and our people.</p><p>Things that we hear that Michael Cohen is even coming forward and saying that he said in private to him, so.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I don't think he would come because I don't think he cares about our audience.  I mean, there's nothing about Donald Trump that makes me think he cares about black and brown people.</p><p>YEE:  There's a lot of hurtful things that he says.  Personally he had offended me.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  I mean, something that he talks about a lot is the low unemployment rate, historically low, for African-Americans and for the Hispanic community.  It is something he likes to talk about.  If he thought he had a platform with you guys, would he be welcome?</p><p>CASEY:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes, he definitely will be welcomed.  It's very important to know that started with Barack Obama.  It was the policies that Barack Obama implemented that caused the unemployment rate to be so low for African-Americans now and Donald Trump is taking credit for it.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, you know, he loves to joust.  He loves to fight.  He would love to debate that with you guys.  So he might actually come and stick around.  I think he might enjoy it.</p><p>YEE:  Let's have him come on.</p><p>BREAM:  He might --</p><p>CASEY:  I would love for him to come.</p><p>YEE:  Even when he gets asked questions at the White House with reporters.  He'll ban you if he doesn't like your questions, so.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.  And tell him pull up.  We'll get him -- we'll get him some fast food.  We'll get him some little White Castle sliders that fit his little hands.</p><p>CASEY:  Some McDonald's.  Some McDonald's too.</p><p>BREAM:  You know he loves the fast food.</p><p>OK.  So if he's listening tonight, because sometimes he does watch, go ahead and make your pitch to him.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I'm not --</p><p>CASEY:  We're not pitching it.</p><p>YEE:  I mean, we're not really excited.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  If he's smart, he will come up here.</p><p>CASEY:  If he wants to pull up -- he can pull up any time.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  It's not something that we want.  It's not something that we're requesting.  I'm not about to make no pitch.</p><p>CASEY:  No, we're not pitching for him.  But if he wants to come, he's invited.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  And there might be some snacks involved.</p><p>YEE:  He should face --</p><p>BREAM:  The Breakfast show.  World's most dangerous morning show.  Keep making news.  We'll keep watching.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.</p><p>BREAM:  Thank you, guys, very much.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Thank you very much.  Thank you for having us.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  The speaker says no-go to progressive plans to impeach the president.  The Mueller's special counsel reported isn't even in yet.  So, why is she taking plan b off the table?</p><p>Our power panel is here to weigh in.  They are standing by right there for you.  They're next.</p><p>Plus, the latest on the Boeing 737 Max crash.  Lawmakers calling for the aircraft to be grounded.  Will it affect your travel plans?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JOHN YARMUTH (D), KENTUCKY:  To me it's not a question of whether, it's a question of when and probably right now is not the right time but I think at some point it's going to be inevitable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  Reaction still coming in to Speaker Pelosi telling the Washington Post she is not for impeaching President Trump.  Time now for tonight's power panel, the President of Open Primaries, John Opdycke, the director of Strategic Communications for Trump 2020, Marc Lotter, and Fox News Contributor, former Utah Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz.  Welcome to all of you.</p><p>JOHN OPDYCKE, PRESIDENT, OPEN PRIMARIES:  Good evening.</p><p>MARC LOTTER, DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS FOR TRUMP 2020:  Hi, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  So just to remind, folks, this is the quote from Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker.  She says impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country and he's just not worth it.  Marc?</p><p>LOTTER:  What took her so long?  It's been two years, 300,000 documents, hundreds of hours of interviews, and she's come to the same conclusion that President Trump said day one.  No collusion.  So I'm surprised that it took her that long to get there.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  I want to read something from Politico today, it says, Dems have started the years of impeachment.  Can they still turn back?  It says interviews with more than a dozen key Democratic lawmakers revealed deep division within the caucus about whether their efforts could end up helping Trump win a second term in office.  John, we've heard that from a lot of folks who worry that it will just mobilize his base.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Yes.  I don't agree with Speaker Pelosi on much but I take her side on this.  I think that moving in the impeachment direction will be a real disservice to the rich, robust political conversation that's taking place in the country right now.  On a whole range of issues from Green New Deal, to Medicare for All, to immigration and so forth.  And I think in some ways, the American people are deeply distrustful of Congress.</p><p>And to take this decision about who the next President is going to be out of the hands of the American people and put it in the hand of an institution the people don't have a lot of trust in right now, I think it's the wrong direction to go.  I agree with Speaker Pelosi.  Leave it up to the people.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Tom Steyer who is a billionaire, who has talked a lot about the political game.  He's not running this time but he's supporting lot of other causes and folks and he has been all about impeachment from day one.  He says this, he says Speaker Pelosi thinks he's just not worth it, well, is defending our legal system worth it?  Is holding the President accountable for his crimes and cover ups worth it?</p><p>Is doing what's right worth it or shall America just stop fighting for our principles and so what's politically convenient, Jason?</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I think Speaker Pelosi was right, other than the last part of the phrase that she offered there but our founders put up an exceptionally high bar.  If she had an inkling, if she had some evidence, I think she would go for it.  I think it's an admission that she doesn't have that evidence but she has a problem with their caucus because she's got 60 or so people that have already signed up for impeachment.</p><p>They've been promising this from the day Donald Trump was sworn in.  The problem for the Democrats is they just don't have any evidence, and they don't have any facts to actually back something up and make the case because it would be a loser and the country knows that and she is smart enough to recognize that.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, you know the committees that are coordinating in the 81 letters that went out last week looking into any number of things, from the Trump organization, to family members, to Russia, to everything else even though the special counsel were still waiting on that formal proceeding to close out.  So it's clear that they're casting a net to look for some things.  Aaron Blake at the Washington Post writes after the news of Speaker Pelosi today, he says, Pelosi's ability to tamp down impeachment fever could be one of the most significant battles of her speakership and these new comments are a line in the sand.</p><p>I mean, Marc, we're hearing a number of Democrats out tonight and saying or in recent days saying they still think and you hear Congressman Yarmuth, it's just a matter of time.</p><p>LOTTER:  Yes.  I mean, the number of investigations they're launching completely egregious but when you look at what were actually getting to and this is another bad week that is showing the Democrat Party is breaking apart right in front of our very eyes.  I don't see where any of the 2020 Democratic candidates are out there rallying the base and inspiring their liberal donors with no impeachment.  The radicals have taken over.</p><p>That's who controls their party right now and I am going to be very interested to see how their Presidential candidates try to balance what Speaker Pelosi is saying with the realities on the ground and trying to win in a very polarized, very radical party.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  We're just getting in some news here, the New York Attorney General and we know that the President is facing a lot of trouble at the state level with the southern district of New York.  Actually a Federal but they're in New York -- but there are -- the state A.G. has made a lot of noise too about conducting some investigations.  The attorney general's office in New York late Monday issuing subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank for records relating to the financing of four major Trump organization projects at a failed effort to buy the buffalo bills of the National Football League.</p><p>John, what do you make about that?  I mean, it seems like the President, it's going to be a long time before all these various investigations for multiple agencies are ever wrapped up.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Yes, and everybody knows that President Trump is a ruffian.  That is beyond dispute.  I think the tactical question, the political question that the Democrats have to take seriously is why not allow the people of this country to weigh in on that question?  Why do you want to shortchange that with politically motivated investigations that even if they're correct, set up a situation that furthers the divisions in this country.</p><p>And frankly hold the Democrats back from pushing a lot of the issues that they're having a lot of traction with right now.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  And Jason, it seems like there is this internal split about some of these really big issues.  We saw last week that it took them a week to put together the resolution that ended up condemning not only anti-Semitism but Islamophobia and white supremacy and all kinds of things.  We thought it was ready for the floor then it's back then they're fighting again and now we understand that there is -- this internal split.</p><p>And some of it has gone public about this issue of impeachment but the Speaker also said that \"the party is unified.\"</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I don't think so.  I think the Democrats are an absolute chaos.  I mean, think about it.  Bernie Sanders is the leader of the Democratic Party.  He's not a member of the Democratic Party.  He is registered as an Independent and really a socialist, so the leader of the Presidential candidates isn't even a member of their own party.  And then they can't decide whether or not they hate the Jewish people are not and how are they going to actually articulate that in a pace, in a resolution instead of calling out the actual individual.</p><p>I don't think that all the -- all the Democrats hate Jews but you do have some that need to be called out specifically.  The way Republicans did, like I did, with Mr. King when he stepped over the line.  So again, it's a -- it's a -- it's a campaign that's in chaos, a party that can't define itself.  And they're totally off message.  And they have to explain to the American people why they think these socialist views are the right solution for America because America is not buying it.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Senator Elizabeth Warren is officially in the race said this weekend it is wrong to call her socialist.  She doesn't support that.  But we're going to talk more about and coming up how she's also wants to go after some big tech companies and break them up, so there's a lot there to digest.  Power panel, thank you.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Just to say one thing in response to Congressman Chaffetz is that you say the American people are buying these things, I think the American people are deeply interested in having an honest conversation about many of the issues that progressives and socialists like Bernie Sanders and AOC are putting on the table.  It doesn't mean they agree with them on everything but they want to talk about these things.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, to leave it there.  The keyword --</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Oh, I would love to talk about those issues.</p><p>BREAM:  The keyword is honest --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Bring it on.  Bring it on.  You will drive the Democratic Party into the grave.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  I think the key there is honest and we can talk -- keep it factual.  I think that it's important for the American people.  They do want to talk about these things.  But in the meantime, thank you gentlemen.  Come back soon.</p><p>LOTTER:  Thank you.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Coming up, caught in the act, dramatic surveillance footage of a transsexual woman accused of pepper spray attacks all across New York.  We'll tell you what that's about.  And Liz Warren breaking ranks with socialist Democrats but also vowing to take on big tech.  We told you about that.  She's proposing to break up some giant social media companies.  Trace on the case.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WARREN:  The giant tech companies right now are eating up little tiny businesses, start-ups, and competing unfairly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  A transgender woman has been arrested in New York.  Police say, she might be behind a series of pepper spray attacks in Upper Manhattan.  One couple says, the attacker allegedly approached them on the street, asked the woman if she was white, and then pepper sprayed her.  The man tried to intervene, the attacker pulled out a knife, he says.  Authorities say, 11 people were attacked over the weekend in suspected hate crimes.</p><p>We're awaiting information from the Black Box of the Ethiopian Airlines plane, the Boeing 737 Max 8 that crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all 157 people aboard, including at least eight Americans.  The FAA says that planes are still air-worthy after two fatal crashes in less than six months.  Correspondent Doug McKelway has the latest.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  At the United Nations today, a flag at half-staff, an honor of the 157 people killed, 21 of them U.N. staffers in Sunday's crash of an Ethiopian Airlines, Boeing 737.</p><p>ABBY AHMED, ETHIOPIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  As we all know Ethiopian Airlines is a well-known airline that has not experienced such accidents for a long time.</p><p>MCKELWAY:  It was the second Boeing 737 Max 8 to crash in the last five months.  In the first, the like Lion Air Max 8 plane dove vertically into the sea, killing all 189 on board.  In both cases, radar data showed there were similar violent oscillations, pitching up and down, before the planes crashed.  But in the Lion Air case, there were other problems.  That plane had maintenance issues with airspeed, altimeter and other gauges.  The Max 8 is the latest generation Boeing's 737 with more power, more fuel-efficient engines.  The bigger engines necessitated the redesign of the plane's trim controls.  When the two trim control switches are turned off, and the plane is powered up, it causes a different reaction than in earlier models.</p><p>JOHN GOGLIA, FORMER NTSB INVESTIGATOR:  When you apply full power to the airplane, it's going to drive the nose up.  So, what Boeing did to counter that is they automated it.</p><p>MCKELWAY:  But if the trim switch is turned off or malfunctioning, a poorly trained pilot might have problems.  Over correcting for the nose up with a pitch down.  It can produce what's called pilot induced oscillation, as seen in this 1978 NASA video.  The first officer in the Ethiopian air crash had 200 hours of flying time, compared to a minimum of 1500 hours for U.S. first officers.</p><p>The flight and voice data recorders have been recovered.  Ethiopian, Cayman Airways, and China have all grounded the Max 8, but neither the Boeing, the FAA nor Domestic Carriers United, American, or Southwest have.  In December Boeing took a risk amid the ongoing trade war, opening a finishing facility in China, the world's largest growing airplane market.  The first plane to roll out of that facility was a 737 Max 8.  Shannon?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM:  Doug McKelway, thank you very much.  Two progressives, two different views, of what to do about big technology.  Well, Senator Elizabeth Warren wants to better regulate big tech, Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez see's technology as a means to a post-capitalist end.  Trace is on the case from our L.A. Newsroom.  Trace.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Shannon.  Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren is well-aware that her views often draw comparisons to her Senate colleague Bernie Sanders, but Warren wants to make it clear unlike Sanders she's not a Democratic socialist.  She supports capitalism, albeit with the right regulations.  And in the process of building her campaign and defining her positions, the Massachusetts senator has laid out her plan to break up big technology -- a goal she shares with President Trump.  For example, Warren would require regulators to go after massive mergers like Amazon buying Whole Foods and Facebook's ownership of Instagram.  Watch.</p><p>WARREN:  We want to keep that market place competitive, not let a giant who has an incredible information advantage, and a manipulative advantage, be able to snuff you out.</p><p>GALLAGHER:  Oddly, today, Facebook took down a number of Warren's campaign ads saying she misused its company logo.  Warren responded by citing Facebook's power to shut down debate.  The ads have now been restored.  Then, there's Democratic freshman Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who doesn't seem nearly as worried about big technology expanding or the rise of workplace robots.  In fact, Ocasio-Cortez says, Americans should be excited to have their jobs automated, quoting: \"The reason we're not excited by it is because we live in a society where if you don't have a job, you are left to die.  And that is, at its core, our problem.\"  She points out that not having a job gives you more time.</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), NEW YORK:  We should be excited about automation because what it could potentially mean is more time educating ourselves, more time creating art, more time investing and investigating in the sciences, more time focused on invention, more time going to space, more time enjoying the world that we live in.</p><p>GALLAGHER:  In case you're wondering, the 29-year-old Ocasio-Cortez drew bigger crowds at South by Southwest than any other presidential candidates.  Shannon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM:  All right, Trace Gallagher, thank you very much.  There is a new face of terror.  Hamza bin Laden, the son of Osama bin Laden, has a giant bounty now on his head.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  As released audio and video messages on the Internet, calling on his followers to want to attack against the United States and its western allies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  So, will the man who killed Osama bin Laden, his father, Rob O'Neill, take a shot at finding his son?  Rob joins us live to tell us what he thinks, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  Terror has a new face and he wants revenge on America.  Officials are warning that Osama bin Laden's son is actively engaging in terrorism and is emerging as the leader of al-Qaeda.  The State Department is offering a million-dollar reward for information on Hamza bin Laden's whereabouts, so let's talk to the guy who killed his dad, Osama bin Laden, former Navy SEAL Rob O'Neill.  Good to have you with us again, Rob.</p><p>ROB O'NEILL, FORMER NAVY SEAL:  Thank you, Shannon, for having me.  I appreciate it.</p><p>BREAM:  It may have been in jest, but we've got to put up on Twitter, there was a group that reached out to you and said, you know, we're assembling crew to go claim the $1 million bounty, are you in?  You say maybe not legitimately, but you do think it's a worthy mission at this point.</p><p>O'NEILL:  This is definitely a worthy mission, just to continue to prove that if terror rears its ugly head, we have men and women who are willing to go do it.  You know, on a serious note, I would do everything asked of me to do, but we have younger, more seasoned guys that are out there right now.  Some guys that were on the actual raid -- I don't know if we would risk that kind of a cross-border type thing that we did with Osama bin Laden, but something along the lines of the good men and women from the three letter agencies that find some intel on where he is and hit him with a drone strike.  I think that Hamza bin Laden, at least, is smart enough to know that gets too cute and too cocky, he's going to stick his head out and he's going to get gotten.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, apparently, he has reached out and started to make some noise over the last couple of years.  He obviously is.  We've talked about it.  I mean, there are a number of his family members who have been taken out of this al-Qaeda fight and he's got a lot of skin in the game, as you've said.  John Gambrell back in March, he says this, talking about Hamza bin Laden, began appearing in militant videos back as far as 2015.  And he said this apparently, if you think that your sinful crime that you committed in Abbottabad has passed without punishment, then you thought wrong.\"</p><p>O'NEILL:  Right, and the way that Hamza thinks, because of his brand of Islam that he follows, they're not going to worship of false idols, so it's not going to be revenge for the death of his father and his brother, and his other brother before them.  It would be more to avenge the deaths of the defenders of Islam, as they call it.  You know, because they're obviously very religious, in their own psychotic version of Islam.  Yes, he's making it apparent that he's there and he remembers what happened and what's been going on.</p><p>And he thinks that we've oppressed everyone in Iraq, and in Iran, and in Pakistan and all that stuff.  Al-Qaeda -- they're just on a strategic pause right now.  This isn't an end.  And they're going to sit there -- and like I've always said, ISIS loved the big headline and they stab in the front.  Al-Qaeda is going to wait around and stab you in the back.  They hit New York in 2003, tried to knock down the Trade Towers; and they didn't forget, they came back in 2001 and succeeded.  So, you can't get complacent with these guys, because complacency will get you killed.</p><p>BREAM:  What do you make of the price tag?  Is it enough in the scenario to get people to turn him in?</p><p>O'NEILL:  I mean, it could be but he is surrounded by some hardliners -- everyone, Taliban, and al-Qaeda guys are all around him.  It's going to take a little bit of money for an outsider to sort of see in, especially considering what happened with the doctor in Abbottabad, Pakistan that sort of helped us try to locate Osama bin Laden.  You know, he's not in a good place right now.  And it's going to take five or 10 million which wouldn't be much for us.  It worked with a lot of the Ba'ath party and (INAUDIBLE) Hussein in Iraq.  It could work here again, but like, al-Qaeda is a lot more -- they're a lot more loyal to each other than the Ba'ath party was.</p><p>BREAM:  Well -- and very quickly, we just have a few seconds, do you think he's probably in Pakistan?</p><p>O'NEILL:  I would say pretty much in Pakistan.  Yes, probably, in Pakistan or at least in the tribal regions where there's not a lot of law and they kind of protect him there.  And weirdly enough, he's been cooperating with the Iranians.  I believe he was pretty much raised in Iran under the cover of Iran, because that government can, even with the travel ban, probably help him travel certain places.  So, it is scary, but he's in the area.  I'm thinking right near (INAUDIBLE) of Pakistan.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, as you said, and others have noted, don't mistake their pause for inactivity.  They saying, you know, experts very much that they have the ability and the intent to come after the U.S. again.</p><p>O'NEILL:  Oh, they definitely have the intent.  That's what happens when you raise people from the time, they're infants to the time, the like, Hamza -- they're in their 30s, just to hate people because they don't believe what you believe.  You get this kind of stuff.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, Rob O'Neill, always great to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>O'NEILL:  Thanks, Shannon.  I appreciate it.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, the Supreme Court made it clear, public employees can no longer be forced to pay dues to a union they don't support.  But five California public school teachers say, that is exactly what's happening to them and now, they are suing.  We'll hear from their lawyer, we're going to debate both sides.  Plus, the president joins the daylight savings time debate, should it stay or should it go?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  On the heels of six-day teachers strike in California, five teachers are now suing the state's top union over collecting dues through mandatory paycheck deductions.  A practice that the Supreme Court calls on unconstitutional less than a year ago.  All right, let's bring in former Aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, Chris Hahn; and the lawyer representing the teachers, you recognize her, Harmeet Dhillon.  Thank you both for joining us.</p><p>HARMEET DHILLION, LAWYER:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>CHRIS HAHN, FORMER AIDE TO SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER:  Thanks for having us.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Harmeet, I just want you to clarify because Justice Alito was very clear.  He said this, in the decision last year, we conclude that this arrangement violates the free-speech rights of nonmembers by compelling them to subsidize private speech on matters of substantial public concern, and he said, unless these people affirmatively consent to giving the money, the unions can't take it.  Are you claiming that's what happening in California?</p><p>DHILLON:  Exactly what's happening.  So, our five clients working in conjunction with the freedom foundation, which has filed this type of lawsuit in other West Coast states as well, are claiming that they have opted out of their union card contracts.  And despite having opted out, the union is not letting them out until the anniversary of their one-year contract.  So, every pay period that their paychecks are being deducted, significant money in the case of the lead plaintiff, Bethany Mendez, $1500 a year on a pretty meager teacher's salary, a constitutional violation is occurring.  And so, the Supreme Court was very clear that you cannot take this money unless there is a knowing and voluntary waiver of the First Amendment.  And so, none of these teachers have made a voluntary waiver of the First Amendment rights.</p><p>BREAM:  So, Chris, even if you didn't like the ruling from the Supreme Court, it was a tight 15-4 last year.  Why shouldn't these teachers have the right to put their foot down over this?</p><p>HAHN:  Well, they are.  They signed a contract and they agreed to have these dues taken out.  I always wonder where you find teachers who are willing to go against their own interests and fight their union which basically gives them a much better salary, much better benefits and much better working conditions than they would've gotten on their own, especially given the market where there are thousands of teachers coming out of colleges every single day for every single opening.  These unions actually strengthen teachers and give them a better life at a fraction for what they are paying for these unions.  So, I am shocked that these people are willing to be used this way.  I hope that the kids that they teach are learning something because, god, these people don't seem to have learned much when they were in college.</p><p>DHILLON: Wow!</p><p>BREAM:  But Chris, you know, like the plaintiffs in a couple of these big cases, before the Supreme Court have said, they're going out on -- and supporting political candidates and messages with my dues money that I 100 percent disagree with, and they don't feel like they should have to subsidize that speech.  Does that make them terrible people?</p><p>HAHN:  You know, it's funny.  It's a slippery slope and, you know, when -- you know, we all pay for things we don't want going to support things we don't like.  For example, I'd buy gasoline every day.  Do I have a right to determine what we're going to -- what the gasoline company is going to do with the money I spend on it?  You know, it's a very slippery slope.  The Supreme Court got it wrong and it will be overturned when we get some reasonable members on that court.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  Harmeet, the California Teachers Association, by the way, very brave statement, only responding this way, saying: \"It's another lawsuit from the Freedom Foundation to continue the attack on public education and public employees.\"  Harmeet?</p><p>DHILLION:  So, Chris just called these teachers stupid and said that their students are going to learn nothing, and he also ignore the fact that this is a constitutional violation.  That's the difference between your gas analogy and what's going on here.  And if you think about it in terms of a term that choice -- that the left loves which is freedom of choice, that's what these teachers are really looking for here.  They're looking for the choice to be part of a union or not.  And by the way, the sky doesn't fall when people aren't part of a union.  Chris, as you know in the federal system, people are --</p><p>HAHN:  They can opt out at the end of their contract.  They opted in and now they're opting out.</p><p>DHILLON:  Please don't interrupt me, Chris, I didn't interrupt you.  In the federal system, people do not -- people are not required to be part of the union and the unions go on just fine.  And so, no, when you have a constitutional right, it is not sufficient to you can opt out when we tell you can.  After they opted out, Shannon, union sent thugs into the classroom to try to intimidate them into revoking their opt out.</p><p>HAHN:  Stop.  Thugs.  Kindergarten teachers.</p><p>DHILLON:  And so, this is not acceptable.  And it is time for the state of California to follow the constitution as the Supreme Court says.</p><p>BREAM:  Chris, you don't think that's OK, coercion, do you, Chris?</p><p>HAHN:  No, of course not.  But I also don't think that these teachers who are her clients understand how much they're being used by extreme right-wing groups that just want to break unions all over the country.</p><p>DHILLION:  Yes, they're so dumb and you know better.</p><p>HANH:  Well, look, they are clearly unaware of how they're being used, you know.  So, it is a shame and I feel bad for them, because they're going to learn very soon if they their union does collapse, what their salaries would be in a free market, and it won't be good for them.</p><p>DHILLON:  I think they're going to be just fine without all the coerced speech.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes, a lot of people felt after the ruling last year that there would be a big threat to the unions falling apart, that kind of thing.  We haven't seen that yet.  So, we'll see and we'll watch this case and see who is right in their predictions.</p><p>HAHN:  Not for trying of these groups, though, that's for sure.</p><p>BREAM:  Chris and Harmeet, thank you both.  Good to see you.</p><p>DHILLON:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>HAHN:  Thank you, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, coming up, is New York Mayor Bill de Blasio losing the forest for the trees, as the mayor tells kids to have meatless Mondays?  Economists are warning the city is about to head into a financial crisis.  That stories are in our \"REAL NEWS ROUND UP\", next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  Well, a woman gets booted from a hearing on gun control after apparently texting about going on a shooting spree of her own.  That story tops tonight's \"REAL NEWS ROUNDUP.\"  The unidentified woman was ejected from a Connecticut State Senate hearing after she was reportedly spotted sending a text saying: if she had a gun, she'd \"blow away a Republican state lawmaker and a large group of NRAs.\"  Connecticut capital police determined there was no threat.  The woman was not arrested.</p><p>New York City implementing meatless Mondays in public schools, a move supporter say, promotes healthy, environmentally friendly meal options.  The mayor says, cutting back on a little meat will help down on greenhouse gases and help save the planet.  Meanwhile, some top economists are warning the city needs to focus instead on its financial health.  One saying, New York is already in a difficult financial spot, but it would be in an impossible situation if we had any kind of setbacks.</p><p>President Trump lending support to do the push to do away with Daylight Savings Times.  Arizona and Hawaii are the only states that do not observe the time change.  The president tweeting today: \"Making Daylight Savings Time permanent is OK with me.\"</p><p>And the Supreme Court agreeing to hear the case of Eric (INAUDIBLE), who were denied a trademark for their line of street clothes by the Patent and Trademark Office because their brand is a variation of the F-word.  That denial is based on an old federal law that requires the rejection of trademarks that are scandalous or immoral.</p><p>All right.  Time now for our \"MIDNIGHT HERO\".  94-year-old, Mary Bochanis, was the longest-serving American Red Cross volunteer.  She started volunteering in 1943 when she met her husband, Gus, and she never stopped volunteering.  After her husband died in 2006, she just started volunteering more, she says.  A Red Cross volunteer for 76 years.</p><p>Mary Bochanis died Thursday.  She leaves behind an amazing legacy.  So, she is our \"MIDNIGHT HERO\" tonight.  Thank you for all those years of service to so many people.  Most-watched, most trusted, and most grateful you spent your evening with us.  Good night from Washington.  I'm Shannon Bream.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2190200518</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB8-DDC1-DY0W-42F8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8024\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

We've known for some time that the Democratic leadership has been wary of this rush to impeach from members of their own caucus.</p><p>But now, Speaker Pelosi has finally come out and publicly said that she is not for impeachment.  In an interview just released by the Washington Post,\" she says quote, \"Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country, and he's just not worth it.\"</p><p>Democratic congressman, Adam Schiff, is backing up Speaker Pelosi by saying tonight that only graphic evidence would warrant an impeachment gamble against President Trump.</p><p>But that line of thinking will put the Democratic leadership at odds with many members of their own party, including Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib who's already said that she's planning to introduce articles of impeachment against President Trump by the end of this month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D), MICHIGAN:  If we don't hold impeachment proceedings today, start them today, and hold him accountable to following the United States constitution.  Think about that.  This is not going to be the last CEO that runs for president of the United States.  This is not going to be the last person that tries to get away with this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FISHER:  So President Trump and Speaker Pelosi may finally agree on one thing.  No impeachment.  But they still disagree on most everything else, especially the new budget proposal put forward by the White House today.</p><p>Pelosi called it cruel and shortsighted.  She said, quote, \"The cruel and shortsighted cuts in President Trump's budget request are a roadmap to a sicker, weaker America.  House Democrats will reject this toxic, destructive, budget request which would hollow out our national strength and failed to meet the needs of the American people.\"</p><p>The White House says that this budget proposal is aimed at keeping Americans safe by increasing defense spending and including more than $8 billion for the border wall.  But it's also slashing funding for many domestic programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSS VOUGHT, ACTING DIRECTOR, OMB:  Washington has a spending problem and it endangers the future prosperity of our nation for generations to come.  This budget contains nearly $2.7 trillion in savings, more spending reductions proposed than any administration in history.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FISHER:  But even with those savings, this budget proposal would still push the federal deficit past $1 trillion.  The White House is asking for a huge number for fiscal year 2020, a record $4.7 trillion.</p><p>It's a big number, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  It is.  And they've got to answer some questions about that.</p><p>FISHER:  And it's just a proposal.  Not --</p><p>BREAM:  yes.</p><p>FISHER:  Just a blueprint.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  And we remember seeing President Obama's proposals voted down like 99 to nothing.  So we know that the president's proposal is just a place for Congress to start.</p><p>FISHER:  Just a place to start.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Thank you.</p><p>FISHER:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Wisconsin Republicans say they are not surprised the Democratic Party picked Milwaukee for next year's National Convention because of the city's strong ties they say to socialism.</p><p>Correspondent David Spunt has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOM BARRETT (D), MAYOR OF MILWAUKEE:  I want to welcome to Milwaukee the 2020 Democratic National Convention.</p><p>DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  On a cold Milwaukee afternoon, it became clear July 2020 will be hot.</p><p>TOM PEREZ, CHAIRMAN, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE:  Our democracies on fire.  It's a five alarm blaze and we have first responders in this room and elsewhere prepared to take back our democracy.</p><p>SPUNT:  Milwaukee beat out Houston and Miami for the DNC bid, and it's the only major city that counts three socialist mayors in its history.  The Wisconsin Republican Party put out a statement, quote, \"No city in America has stronger ties to socialism than Milwaukee.  And with the rise of Bernie Sanders and the embrace of socialism by its newest leaders, the American left has come full circle.\"  End quote.</p><p>Speaking of Sanders, he's number two on a new national international Monmouth University poll which tested 20 different candidates.  Sanders has been a proud Democratic socialist for decades and he's three percent behind former vice president, Joe Biden, who has yet to announce a run.</p><p>Sanders is at the top of the pack in a recent Emerson Poll focusing on New Hampshire.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT:  In 2016, this is where the political revolution took off.  Thank you, New Hampshire.</p><p>SPUNT:  Whether or not a candidate is a socialist is now a key question, a question that some candidates dismissed.</p><p>GOV. JOHN HICKENLOOPER (D-CO), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Once you get back into these labels, am I a capitalist, am I a socialist?  How much of -- how much of a capitalist am I versus how much of a socialist?  It becomes kind of silly, doesn't it?</p><p>SPUNT:  While others distanced themselves completely from the socialist label.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS:  Bernie has to speak to what Democratic socialism is.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And you are not one.</p><p>WARREN:  And I'm not.</p><p>HOWARD SCHULTZ, FORMER CHAIRMAN AND CEO, STARBUCKS:  We don't want a government takeover of our lives.</p><p>SPUNT:  Independent, Howard Schultz, thought he got a negative reaction from the crowd when he talked socialism.</p><p>SCHULTZ:  If you want a good description for socialism, I think just look at Venezuela.  It's a -- you don't like that?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SPUNT:  Howard Schultz said he'll make up his mind about a run by the summer.  He brushes off any criticism that he could hurt the Democrats chance to win the White House.

David, thank you.</p><p>All right.  They featured interviews with the nation's most prominent hip-hop stars and celebrities.  But now, the popular radio show is also a must-stop media spot for 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.  Senators Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Cory Booker among others have all stopped in.</p><p>Joining me now from the nationally syndicated radio show, the Breakfast Club on Power 105.1 in New York City.  DJ Envy, Angela Yee, and Charlamagne tha God.  Welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT.  Great to have you, guys.</p><p>RAASHAUN CASEY, AMERICAN DISC JOCKEY:  Hey, thanks for having us.</p><p>ANGELA YEE, AMERICAN RADIO PERSONALITY:  Hi, Shannon.</p><p>LENARD LARRY MCKELVEY, AMERICAN RADIO PRESENTER:  What's happening?</p><p>BREAM:  Listen, I got to read something from the Daily Beast.  This how they describe you, saying, \"The world's most dangerous morning show.  Charlamagne tha God and his co-host DJ Envy and Angela Yee conduct lengthy interviews with politicians in which the cultural weight of the show and the informality of its interviews often force media train presidential hopeful to let down their guard and get more personal.\"</p><p>Angela, I know you said people are in danger if they come and try to act cool and it's not real.  How does that go?</p><p>YEE:  Well, I think part of the issue is that we're not political pundits.  So people come on the show and they're used to talking about things like their policies and things that are very rehearsed.</p><p>But when you come on the Breakfast Club, we might ask you about anything.  And I think for people, they also want to answer for our audience.  So they might say things to make them sound like more hip than normal.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, and you know, Senator Kamala Harris --</p><p>CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD:  You know --</p><p>BREAM:  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  No.  I was going to say, you know, when you talk to a politician, they've got a talking point for everything, especially when you talk to them about politics.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes, that's the truth.  We find that out every time we have one on.</p><p>Senator Kamala Harris who has gotten a lot of attention, very popular, pulling near the top, even though -- away from the first cluster, but she's definitely in the mix.</p><p>I want to play something that she talked about with you guys that got a lot of attention.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D), CALIFORNIA:  I am absolutely in favor of legalizing marijuana.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Have ever smoked?</p><p>HARRIS:  I have.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  OK.  In college or --</p><p>HARRIS:  And I inhaled.  I did -- I did inhale.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  What were you listening to when you were high?</p><p>CASEY:  What was on?  What song was it?  Was it Snoop?</p><p>HARRIS:  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, yes, definitely Snoop.  Tupac, for sure.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  I mean, guys, that was a big moment.  You just keep making national news with these interviews.</p><p>CASEY:  That question was a little crazy because I asked her what she listened to and my cohost over here was still on the weed question.  And it got a little blurry.  But she was talking about what she listen to.  She says she listened Tupac.  She listened to Snoop and it kind of got blurred with Charlamagne's weed question.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Fox News, you did that.  You all took that out of context.  You all started that.</p><p>BREAM:  I will tell you, it wasn't me.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  You all did that.</p><p>BREAM:  But I can always double-check on that.</p><p>Who do you guys want who hasn't stopped by yet?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I mean, the interesting thing is not like we sit around and we send out these requests for different people.  It's just like whoever wants to come.  We have a platform.  2020 is wide open.  A lot of people are looking to see who they want to vote for in 2020.</p><p>So we're interested in anybody who's running, who wants to get the word out.</p><p>YEE:  I wouldn't mind to have Elizabeth Warren on.  I think she'd be --</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Elizabeth Warren would be great.</p><p>CASEY:  Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>CASEY:  Anybody on both sides though.  Democratic, Republican.  It doesn't matter.  We would love to talk to anybody.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  And I like Julian Castro.  I saw him make a very great statement today when he came to reparations.  So I would love to have him on.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  I mean, that's something that you've talked about with Bernie -- Senator Bernie Sanders.  I mean, he is in the top one or two slots in almost all of the new polls.  It's him and the former vice president and who's not technically in.</p><p>What did you make of Bernie's answer on that?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Oh, I didn't like his answer at all because it seemed to be something he wasn't considering or it's just something he wants to -- he wants some type of form of reparations.  Well, he seemed like he wasn't for the reparations thing at all.</p><p>CASEY:  Kind of avoiding the question a little bit.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.</p><p>YEE:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I wasn't digging his answers.</p><p>YEE:  I think it's important to have solutions.  Like to see if there's an issue that we have, so here are some solutions, here are some possibilities of how we can make that happen instead of dodging a question.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Absolutely.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, and Hillary Clinton back in 2016, she made a lot of news for this exchange when she was on your show.  We want to play.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YEE:  What's something that you always carry with you?</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES:  Hot sauce.</p><p>CASEY:  Really?</p><p>CLINTON:  Yes.</p><p>CASEY:  Really?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  You're giving information right now?</p><p>CASEY:  Hot sauce.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Hot sauce in my bag?  What?</p><p>CLINTON:  Hot sauce.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Really?</p><p>CLINTON:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Now, listen, I'd want you to know people are going to see this and say, OK.  She's pandering to black people.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLINTON:  OK.  Is it working?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  She got a lot of heat for that.  What did you guys make of that exchange?  Because that kind of set the bar for stopping by to your show.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I mean, I said it to her in that moment, you know, this is one of those times when people are going to think that you're pandering the black people.</p><p>But she has said that she likes hot sauce in previous interviews decades earlier.  So maybe she wasn't pandering.</p><p>But the best part about that exchange was when she looked me in the eye and say --</p><p>YEE:  \"Is it working?\"</p><p>MCKELVEY:  \"Is it working?\"  That's a very honest response.</p><p>YEE:  You know, after that, I had to do some research myself and I did go back and see that she talk about it in various other outlets.  And she's been talking about it for years.  But most people won't do that research to see.  This is something real.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.  I don't know how much it worked because --</p><p>CASEY:  People still think that's pandering.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Well, no, she didn't win.</p><p>CASEY:  No, she didn't win.</p><p>YEE:  She did not -- well, technically.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  Well, that's in the history books.</p><p>Let me ask about the guy who did win.  How would you guys handle an interview with President Trump?</p><p>(LAUGHS)</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I don't think that'll go well.</p><p>CASEY:  I think that will go amazing, actually.  He would have to be honest.</p><p>YEE:  I don't think that he would be comfortable answering any questions from us.  I doubt that he would stay for a full interview with us.  Just because there's a lot of issues that I have with things that he says that had been problematic for us and our people.</p><p>Things that we hear that Michael Cohen is even coming forward and saying that he said in private to him, so.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I don't think he would come because I don't think he cares about our audience.  I mean, there's nothing about Donald Trump that makes me think he cares about black and brown people.</p><p>YEE:  There's a lot of hurtful things that he says.  Personally he had offended me.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  I mean, something that he talks about a lot is the low unemployment rate, historically low, for African-Americans and for the Hispanic community.  It is something he likes to talk about.  If he thought he had a platform with you guys, would he be welcome?</p><p>CASEY:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes, he definitely will be welcomed.  It's very important to know that started with Barack Obama.  It was the policies that Barack Obama implemented that caused the unemployment rate to be so low for African-Americans now and Donald Trump is taking credit for it.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, you know, he loves to joust.  He loves to fight.  He would love to debate that with you guys.  So he might actually come and stick around.  I think he might enjoy it.</p><p>YEE:  Let's have him come on.</p><p>BREAM:  He might --</p><p>CASEY:  I would love for him to come.</p><p>YEE:  Even when he gets asked questions at the White House with reporters.  He'll ban you if he doesn't like your questions, so.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.  And tell him pull up.  We'll get him -- we'll get him some fast food.  We'll get him some little White Castle sliders that fit his little hands.</p><p>CASEY:  Some McDonald's.  Some McDonald's too.</p><p>BREAM:  You know he loves the fast food.</p><p>OK.  So if he's listening tonight, because sometimes he does watch, go ahead and make your pitch to him.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I'm not --</p><p>CASEY:  We're not pitching it.</p><p>YEE:  I mean, we're not really excited.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  If he's smart, he will come up here.</p><p>CASEY:  If he wants to pull up -- he can pull up any time.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  It's not something that we want.  It's not something that we're requesting.  I'm not about to make no pitch.</p><p>CASEY:  No, we're not pitching for him.  But if he wants to come, he's invited.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  And there might be some snacks involved.</p><p>YEE:  He should face --</p><p>BREAM:  The Breakfast show.  World's most dangerous morning show.  Keep making news.  We'll keep watching.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.</p><p>BREAM:  Thank you, guys, very much.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Thank you very much.  Thank you for having us.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  The speaker says no-go to progressive plans to impeach the president.  The Mueller's special counsel reported isn't even in yet.  So, why is she taking plan b off the table?</p><p>Our power panel is here to weigh in.  They are standing by right there for you.  They're next.</p><p>Plus, the latest on the Boeing 737 Max crash.  Lawmakers calling for the aircraft to be grounded.  Will it affect your travel plans?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JOHN YARMUTH (D), KENTUCKY:  To me it's not a question of whether, it's a question of when and probably right now is not the right time but I think at some point it's going to be inevitable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  Reaction still coming in to Speaker Pelosi telling the Washington Post she is not for impeaching President Trump.  Time now for tonight's power panel, the President of Open Primaries, John Opdycke, the director of Strategic Communications for Trump 2020, Marc Lotter, and Fox News Contributor, former Utah Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz.  Welcome to all of you.</p><p>JOHN OPDYCKE, PRESIDENT, OPEN PRIMARIES:  Good evening.</p><p>MARC LOTTER, DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS FOR TRUMP 2020:  Hi, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  So just to remind, folks, this is the quote from Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker.  She says impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country and he's just not worth it.  Marc?</p><p>LOTTER:  What took her so long?  It's been two years, 300,000 documents, hundreds of hours of interviews, and she's come to the same conclusion that President Trump said day one.  No collusion.  So I'm surprised that it took her that long to get there.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  I want to read something from Politico today, it says, Dems have started the years of impeachment.  Can they still turn back?  It says interviews with more than a dozen key Democratic lawmakers revealed deep division within the caucus about whether their efforts could end up helping Trump win a second term in office.  John, we've heard that from a lot of folks who worry that it will just mobilize his base.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Yes.  I don't agree with Speaker Pelosi on much but I take her side on this.  I think that moving in the impeachment direction will be a real disservice to the rich, robust political conversation that's taking place in the country right now.  On a whole range of issues from Green New Deal, to Medicare for All, to immigration and so forth.  And I think in some ways, the American people are deeply distrustful of Congress.</p><p>And to take this decision about who the next President is going to be out of the hands of the American people and put it in the hand of an institution the people don't have a lot of trust in right now, I think it's the wrong direction to go.  I agree with Speaker Pelosi.  Leave it up to the people.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Tom Steyer who is a billionaire, who has talked a lot about the political game.  He's not running this time but he's supporting lot of other causes and folks and he has been all about impeachment from day one.  He says this, he says Speaker Pelosi thinks he's just not worth it, well, is defending our legal system worth it?  Is holding the President accountable for his crimes and cover ups worth it?</p><p>Is doing what's right worth it or shall America just stop fighting for our principles and so what's politically convenient, Jason?</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I think Speaker Pelosi was right, other than the last part of the phrase that she offered there but our founders put up an exceptionally high bar.  If she had an inkling, if she had some evidence, I think she would go for it.  I think it's an admission that she doesn't have that evidence but she has a problem with their caucus because she's got 60 or so people that have already signed up for impeachment.</p><p>They've been promising this from the day Donald Trump was sworn in.  The problem for the Democrats is they just don't have any evidence, and they don't have any facts to actually back something up and make the case because it would be a loser and the country knows that and she is smart enough to recognize that.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, you know the committees that are coordinating in the 81 letters that went out last week looking into any number of things, from the Trump organization, to family members, to Russia, to everything else even though the special counsel were still waiting on that formal proceeding to close out.  So it's clear that they're casting a net to look for some things.  Aaron Blake at the Washington Post writes after the news of Speaker Pelosi today, he says, Pelosi's ability to tamp down impeachment fever could be one of the most significant battles of her speakership and these new comments are a line in the sand.</p><p>I mean, Marc, we're hearing a number of Democrats out tonight and saying or in recent days saying they still think and you hear Congressman Yarmuth, it's just a matter of time.</p><p>LOTTER:  Yes.  I mean, the number of investigations they're launching completely egregious but when you look at what were actually getting to and this is another bad week that is showing the Democrat Party is breaking apart right in front of our very eyes.  I don't see where any of the 2020 Democratic candidates are out there rallying the base and inspiring their liberal donors with no impeachment.  The radicals have taken over.</p><p>That's who controls their party right now and I am going to be very interested to see how their Presidential candidates try to balance what Speaker Pelosi is saying with the realities on the ground and trying to win in a very polarized, very radical party.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  We're just getting in some news here, the New York Attorney General and we know that the President is facing a lot of trouble at the state level with the southern district of New York.  Actually a Federal but they're in New York -- but there are -- the state A.G. has made a lot of noise too about conducting some investigations.  The attorney general's office in New York late Monday issuing subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank for records relating to the financing of four major Trump organization projects at a failed effort to buy the buffalo bills of the National Football League.</p><p>John, what do you make about that?  I mean, it seems like the President, it's going to be a long time before all these various investigations for multiple agencies are ever wrapped up.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Yes, and everybody knows that President Trump is a ruffian.  That is beyond dispute.  I think the tactical question, the political question that the Democrats have to take seriously is why not allow the people of this country to weigh in on that question?  Why do you want to shortchange that with politically motivated investigations that even if they're correct, set up a situation that furthers the divisions in this country.</p><p>And frankly hold the Democrats back from pushing a lot of the issues that they're having a lot of traction with right now.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  And Jason, it seems like there is this internal split about some of these really big issues.  We saw last week that it took them a week to put together the resolution that ended up condemning not only anti-Semitism but Islamophobia and white supremacy and all kinds of things.  We thought it was ready for the floor then it's back then they're fighting again and now we understand that there is -- this internal split.</p><p>And some of it has gone public about this issue of impeachment but the Speaker also said that \"the party is unified.\"</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I don't think so.  I think the Democrats are an absolute chaos.  I mean, think about it.  Bernie Sanders is the leader of the Democratic Party.  He's not a member of the Democratic Party.  He is registered as an Independent and really a socialist, so the leader of the Presidential candidates isn't even a member of their own party.  And then they can't decide whether or not they hate the Jewish people are not and how are they going to actually articulate that in a pace, in a resolution instead of calling out the actual individual.</p><p>I don't think that all the -- all the Democrats hate Jews but you do have some that need to be called out specifically.  The way Republicans did, like I did, with Mr. King when he stepped over the line.  So again, it's a -- it's a -- it's a campaign that's in chaos, a party that can't define itself.  And they're totally off message.  And they have to explain to the American people why they think these socialist views are the right solution for America because America is not buying it.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Senator Elizabeth Warren is officially in the race said this weekend it is wrong to call her socialist.  She doesn't support that.  But we're going to talk more about and coming up how she's also wants to go after some big tech companies and break them up, so there's a lot there to digest.  Power panel, thank you.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Just to say one thing in response to Congressman Chaffetz is that you say the American people are buying these things, I think the American people are deeply interested in having an honest conversation about many of the issues that progressives and socialists like Bernie Sanders and AOC are putting on the table.  It doesn't mean they agree with them on everything but they want to talk about these things.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, to leave it there.  The keyword --</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Oh, I would love to talk about those issues.</p><p>BREAM:  The keyword is honest --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Bring it on.  Bring it on.  You will drive the Democratic Party into the grave.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  I think the key there is honest and we can talk -- keep it factual.  I think that it's important for the American people.  They do want to talk about these things.  But in the meantime, thank you gentlemen.  Come back soon.</p><p>LOTTER:  Thank you.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Coming up, caught in the act, dramatic surveillance footage of a transsexual woman accused of pepper spray attacks all across New York.  We'll tell you what that's about.  And Liz Warren breaking ranks with socialist Democrats but also vowing to take on big tech.  We told you about that.  She's proposing to break up some giant social media companies.  Trace on the case.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WARREN:  The giant tech companies right now are eating up little tiny businesses, start-ups, and competing unfairly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  A transgender woman has been arrested in New York.  Police say, she might be behind a series of pepper spray attacks in Upper Manhattan.  One couple says, the attacker allegedly approached them on the street, asked the woman if she was white, and then pepper sprayed her.  The man tried to intervene, the attacker pulled out a knife, he says.  Authorities say, 11 people were attacked over the weekend in suspected hate crimes.</p><p>We're awaiting information from the Black Box of the Ethiopian Airlines plane, the Boeing 737 Max 8 that crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all 157 people aboard, including at least eight Americans.  The FAA says that planes are still air-worthy after two fatal crashes in less than six months.  Correspondent Doug McKelway has the latest.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  At the United Nations today, a flag at half-staff, an honor of the 157 people killed, 21 of them U.N. staffers in Sunday's crash of an Ethiopian Airlines, Boeing 737.</p><p>ABBY AHMED, ETHIOPIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  As we all know Ethiopian Airlines is a well-known airline that has not experienced such accidents for a long time.</p><p>MCKELWAY:  It was the second Boeing 737 Max 8 to crash in the last five months.  In the first, the like Lion Air Max 8 plane dove vertically into the sea, killing all 189 on board.  In both cases, radar data showed there were similar violent oscillations, pitching up and down, before the planes crashed.  But in the Lion Air case, there were other problems.  That plane had maintenance issues with airspeed, altimeter and other gauges.  The Max 8 is the latest generation Boeing's 737 with more power, more fuel-efficient engines.  The bigger engines necessitated the redesign of the plane's trim controls.  When the two trim control switches are turned off, and the plane is powered up, it causes a different reaction than in earlier models.</p><p>JOHN GOGLIA, FORMER NTSB INVESTIGATOR:  When you apply full power to the airplane, it's going to drive the nose up.  So, what Boeing did to counter that is they automated it.</p><p>MCKELWAY:  But if the trim switch is turned off or malfunctioning, a poorly trained pilot might have problems.  Over correcting for the nose up with a pitch down.  It can produce what's called pilot induced oscillation, as seen in this 1978 NASA video.  The first officer in the Ethiopian air crash had 200 hours of flying time, compared to a minimum of 1500 hours for U.S. first officers.</p><p>The flight and voice data recorders have been recovered.  Ethiopian, Cayman Airways, and China have all grounded the Max 8, but neither the Boeing, the FAA nor Domestic Carriers United, American, or Southwest have.  In December Boeing took a risk amid the ongoing trade war, opening a finishing facility in China, the world's largest growing airplane market.  The first plane to roll out of that facility was a 737 Max 8.  Shannon?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM:  Doug McKelway, thank you very much.  Two progressives, two different views, of what to do about big technology.  Well, Senator Elizabeth Warren wants to better regulate big tech, Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez see's technology as a means to a post-capitalist end.  Trace is on the case from our L.A. Newsroom.  Trace.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Shannon.  Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren is well-aware that her views often draw comparisons to her Senate colleague Bernie Sanders, but Warren wants to make it clear unlike Sanders she's not a Democratic socialist.  She supports capitalism, albeit with the right regulations.  And in the process of building her campaign and defining her positions, the Massachusetts senator has laid out her plan to break up big technology -- a goal she shares with President Trump.  For example, Warren would require regulators to go after massive mergers like Amazon buying Whole Foods and Facebook's ownership of Instagram.  Watch.</p><p>WARREN:  We want to keep that market place competitive, not let a giant who has an incredible information advantage, and a manipulative advantage, be able to snuff you out.</p><p>GALLAGHER:  Oddly, today, Facebook took down a number of Warren's campaign ads saying she misused its company logo.  Warren responded by citing Facebook's power to shut down debate.  The ads have now been restored.  Then, there's Democratic freshman Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who doesn't seem nearly as worried about big technology expanding or the rise of workplace robots.  In fact, Ocasio-Cortez says, Americans should be excited to have their jobs automated, quoting: \"The reason we're not excited by it is because we live in a society where if you don't have a job, you are left to die.  And that is, at its core, our problem.\"  She points out that not having a job gives you more time.</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), NEW YORK:  We should be excited about automation because what it could potentially mean is more time educating ourselves, more time creating art, more time investing and investigating in the sciences, more time focused on invention, more time going to space, more time enjoying the world that we live in.</p><p>GALLAGHER:  In case you're wondering, the 29-year-old Ocasio-Cortez drew bigger crowds at South by Southwest than any other presidential candidates.  Shannon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM:  All right, Trace Gallagher, thank you very much.  There is a new face of terror.  Hamza bin Laden, the son of Osama bin Laden, has a giant bounty now on his head.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  As released audio and video messages on the Internet, calling on his followers to want to attack against the United States and its western allies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  So, will the man who killed Osama bin Laden, his father, Rob O'Neill, take a shot at finding his son?  Rob joins us live to tell us what he thinks, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  Terror has a new face and he wants revenge on America.  Officials are warning that Osama bin Laden's son is actively engaging in terrorism and is emerging as the leader of al-Qaeda.  The State Department is offering a million-dollar reward for information on Hamza bin Laden's whereabouts, so let's talk to the guy who killed his dad, Osama bin Laden, former Navy SEAL Rob O'Neill.  Good to have you with us again, Rob.</p><p>ROB O'NEILL, FORMER NAVY SEAL:  Thank you, Shannon, for having me.  I appreciate it.</p><p>BREAM:  It may have been in jest, but we've got to put up on Twitter, there was a group that reached out to you and said, you know, we're assembling crew to go claim the $1 million bounty, are you in?  You say maybe not legitimately, but you do think it's a worthy mission at this point.</p><p>O'NEILL:  This is definitely a worthy mission, just to continue to prove that if terror rears its ugly head, we have men and women who are willing to go do it.  You know, on a serious note, I would do everything asked of me to do, but we have younger, more seasoned guys that are out there right now.  Some guys that were on the actual raid -- I don't know if we would risk that kind of a cross-border type thing that we did with Osama bin Laden, but something along the lines of the good men and women from the three letter agencies that find some intel on where he is and hit him with a drone strike.  I think that Hamza bin Laden, at least, is smart enough to know that gets too cute and too cocky, he's going to stick his head out and he's going to get gotten.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, apparently, he has reached out and started to make some noise over the last couple of years.  He obviously is.  We've talked about it.  I mean, there are a number of his family members who have been taken out of this al-Qaeda fight and he's got a lot of skin in the game, as you've said.  John Gambrell back in March, he says this, talking about Hamza bin Laden, began appearing in militant videos back as far as 2015.  And he said this apparently, if you think that your sinful crime that you committed in Abbottabad has passed without punishment, then you thought wrong.\"</p><p>O'NEILL:  Right, and the way that Hamza thinks, because of his brand of Islam that he follows, they're not going to worship of false idols, so it's not going to be revenge for the death of his father and his brother, and his other brother before them.  It would be more to avenge the deaths of the defenders of Islam, as they call it.  You know, because they're obviously very religious, in their own psychotic version of Islam.  Yes, he's making it apparent that he's there and he remembers what happened and what's been going on.</p><p>And he thinks that we've oppressed everyone in Iraq, and in Iran, and in Pakistan and all that stuff.  Al-Qaeda -- they're just on a strategic pause right now.  This isn't an end.  And they're going to sit there -- and like I've always said, ISIS loved the big headline and they stab in the front.  Al-Qaeda is going to wait around and stab you in the back.  They hit New York in 2003, tried to knock down the Trade Towers; and they didn't forget, they came back in 2001 and succeeded.  So, you can't get complacent with these guys, because complacency will get you killed.</p><p>BREAM:  What do you make of the price tag?  Is it enough in the scenario to get people to turn him in?</p><p>O'NEILL:  I mean, it could be but he is surrounded by some hardliners -- everyone, Taliban, and al-Qaeda guys are all around him.  It's going to take a little bit of money for an outsider to sort of see in, especially considering what happened with the doctor in Abbottabad, Pakistan that sort of helped us try to locate Osama bin Laden.  You know, he's not in a good place right now.  And it's going to take five or 10 million which wouldn't be much for us.  It worked with a lot of the Ba'ath party and (INAUDIBLE) Hussein in Iraq.  It could work here again, but like, al-Qaeda is a lot more -- they're a lot more loyal to each other than the Ba'ath party was.</p><p>BREAM:  Well -- and very quickly, we just have a few seconds, do you think he's probably in Pakistan?</p><p>O'NEILL:  I would say pretty much in Pakistan.  Yes, probably, in Pakistan or at least in the tribal regions where there's not a lot of law and they kind of protect him there.  And weirdly enough, he's been cooperating with the Iranians.  I believe he was pretty much raised in Iran under the cover of Iran, because that government can, even with the travel ban, probably help him travel certain places.  So, it is scary, but he's in the area.  I'm thinking right near (INAUDIBLE) of Pakistan.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, as you said, and others have noted, don't mistake their pause for inactivity.  They saying, you know, experts very much that they have the ability and the intent to come after the U.S. again.</p><p>O'NEILL:  Oh, they definitely have the intent.  That's what happens when you raise people from the time, they're infants to the time, the like, Hamza -- they're in their 30s, just to hate people because they don't believe what you believe.  You get this kind of stuff.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, Rob O'Neill, always great to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>O'NEILL:  Thanks, Shannon.  I appreciate it.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, the Supreme Court made it clear, public employees can no longer be forced to pay dues to a union they don't support.  But five California public school teachers say, that is exactly what's happening to them and now, they are suing.  We'll hear from their lawyer, we're going to debate both sides.  Plus, the president joins the daylight savings time debate, should it stay or should it go?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  On the heels of six-day teachers strike in California, five teachers are now suing the state's top union over collecting dues through mandatory paycheck deductions.  A practice that the Supreme Court calls on unconstitutional less than a year ago.  All right, let's bring in former Aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, Chris Hahn; and the lawyer representing the teachers, you recognize her, Harmeet Dhillon.  Thank you both for joining us.</p><p>HARMEET DHILLION, LAWYER:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>CHRIS HAHN, FORMER AIDE TO SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER:  Thanks for having us.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Harmeet, I just want you to clarify because Justice Alito was very clear.  He said this, in the decision last year, we conclude that this arrangement violates the free-speech rights of nonmembers by compelling them to subsidize private speech on matters of substantial public concern, and he said, unless these people affirmatively consent to giving the money, the unions can't take it.  Are you claiming that's what happening in California?</p><p>DHILLON:  Exactly what's happening.  So, our five clients working in conjunction with the freedom foundation, which has filed this type of lawsuit in other West Coast states as well, are claiming that they have opted out of their union card contracts.  And despite having opted out, the union is not letting them out until the anniversary of their one-year contract.  So, every pay period that their paychecks are being deducted, significant money in the case of the lead plaintiff, Bethany Mendez, $1500 a year on a pretty meager teacher's salary, a constitutional violation is occurring.  And so, the Supreme Court was very clear that you cannot take this money unless there is a knowing and voluntary waiver of the First Amendment.  And so, none of these teachers have made a voluntary waiver of the First Amendment rights.</p><p>BREAM:  So, Chris, even if you didn't like the ruling from the Supreme Court, it was a tight 15-4 last year.  Why shouldn't these teachers have the right to put their foot down over this?</p><p>HAHN:  Well, they are.  They signed a contract and they agreed to have these dues taken out.  I always wonder where you find teachers who are willing to go against their own interests and fight their union which basically gives them a much better salary, much better benefits and much better working conditions than they would've gotten on their own, especially given the market where there are thousands of teachers coming out of colleges every single day for every single opening.  These unions actually strengthen teachers and give them a better life at a fraction for what they are paying for these unions.  So, I am shocked that these people are willing to be used this way.  I hope that the kids that they teach are learning something because, god, these people don't seem to have learned much when they were in college.</p><p>DHILLON: Wow!</p><p>BREAM:  But Chris, you know, like the plaintiffs in a couple of these big cases, before the Supreme Court have said, they're going out on -- and supporting political candidates and messages with my dues money that I 100 percent disagree with, and they don't feel like they should have to subsidize that speech.  Does that make them terrible people?</p><p>HAHN:  You know, it's funny.  It's a slippery slope and, you know, when -- you know, we all pay for things we don't want going to support things we don't like.  For example, I'd buy gasoline every day.  Do I have a right to determine what we're going to -- what the gasoline company is going to do with the money I spend on it?  You know, it's a very slippery slope.  The Supreme Court got it wrong and it will be overturned when we get some reasonable members on that court.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  Harmeet, the California Teachers Association, by the way, very brave statement, only responding this way, saying: \"It's another lawsuit from the Freedom Foundation to continue the attack on public education and public employees.\"  Harmeet?</p><p>DHILLION:  So, Chris just called these teachers stupid and said that their students are going to learn nothing, and he also ignore the fact that this is a constitutional violation.  That's the difference between your gas analogy and what's going on here.  And if you think about it in terms of a term that choice -- that the left loves which is freedom of choice, that's what these teachers are really looking for here.  They're looking for the choice to be part of a union or not.  And by the way, the sky doesn't fall when people aren't part of a union.  Chris, as you know in the federal system, people are --</p><p>HAHN:  They can opt out at the end of their contract.  They opted in and now they're opting out.</p><p>DHILLON:  Please don't interrupt me, Chris, I didn't interrupt you.  In the federal system, people do not -- people are not required to be part of the union and the unions go on just fine.  And so, no, when you have a constitutional right, it is not sufficient to you can opt out when we tell you can.  After they opted out, Shannon, union sent thugs into the classroom to try to intimidate them into revoking their opt out.</p><p>HAHN:  Stop.  Thugs.  Kindergarten teachers.</p><p>DHILLON:  And so, this is not acceptable.  And it is time for the state of California to follow the constitution as the Supreme Court says.</p><p>BREAM:  Chris, you don't think that's OK, coercion, do you, Chris?</p><p>HAHN:  No, of course not.  But I also don't think that these teachers who are her clients understand how much they're being used by extreme right-wing groups that just want to break unions all over the country.</p><p>DHILLION:  Yes, they're so dumb and you know better.</p><p>HANH:  Well, look, they are clearly unaware of how they're being used, you know.  So, it is a shame and I feel bad for them, because they're going to learn very soon if they their union does collapse, what their salaries would be in a free market, and it won't be good for them.</p><p>DHILLON:  I think they're going to be just fine without all the coerced speech.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes, a lot of people felt after the ruling last year that there would be a big threat to the unions falling apart, that kind of thing.  We haven't seen that yet.  So, we'll see and we'll watch this case and see who is right in their predictions.</p><p>HAHN:  Not for trying of these groups, though, that's for sure.</p><p>BREAM:  Chris and Harmeet, thank you both.  Good to see you.</p><p>DHILLON:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>HAHN:  Thank you, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, coming up, is New York Mayor Bill de Blasio losing the forest for the trees, as the mayor tells kids to have meatless Mondays?  Economists are warning the city is about to head into a financial crisis.  That stories are in our \"REAL NEWS ROUND UP\", next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  Well, a woman gets booted from a hearing on gun control after apparently texting about going on a shooting spree of her own.  That story tops tonight's \"REAL NEWS ROUNDUP.\"  The unidentified woman was ejected from a Connecticut State Senate hearing after she was reportedly spotted sending a text saying: if she had a gun, she'd \"blow away a Republican state lawmaker and a large group of NRAs.\"  Connecticut capital police determined there was no threat.  The woman was not arrested.</p><p>New York City implementing meatless Mondays in public schools, a move supporter say, promotes healthy, environmentally friendly meal options.  The mayor says, cutting back on a little meat will help down on greenhouse gases and help save the planet.  Meanwhile, some top economists are warning the city needs to focus instead on its financial health.  One saying, New York is already in a difficult financial spot, but it would be in an impossible situation if we had any kind of setbacks.</p><p>President Trump lending support to do the push to do away with Daylight Savings Times.  Arizona and Hawaii are the only states that do not observe the time change.  The president tweeting today: \"Making Daylight Savings Time permanent is OK with me.\"</p><p>And the Supreme Court agreeing to hear the case of Eric (INAUDIBLE), who were denied a trademark for their line of street clothes by the Patent and Trademark Office because their brand is a variation of the F-word.  That denial is based on an old federal law that requires the rejection of trademarks that are scandalous or immoral.</p><p>All right.  Time now for our \"MIDNIGHT HERO\".  94-year-old, Mary Bochanis, was the longest-serving American Red Cross volunteer.  She started volunteering in 1943 when she met her husband, Gus, and she never stopped volunteering.  After her husband died in 2006, she just started volunteering more, she says.  A Red Cross volunteer for 76 years.</p><p>Mary Bochanis died Thursday.  She leaves behind an amazing legacy.  So, she is our \"MIDNIGHT HERO\" tonight.  Thank you for all those years of service to so many people.  Most-watched, most trusted, and most grateful you spent your evening with us.  Good night from Washington.

A new podcast drops tomorrow.  Subscribe at podcastone.com.  Shannon Bream and the FOX NEWS @ NIGHT team take it from here.  I'll be in New York tomorrow night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I will too.  I'll see you there, Laura.  Thank you so much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INGRAHAM:  All right.  See you then.</p><p>BREAM:  We begin tonight with a Fox News alert.  Breaking tonight, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says President Trump is not worth impeaching.  But that sparking a firestorm on the left where some though it is going to happen.  It's just a matter of time.</p><p>Tonight's announcement follows a week of internal Democratic Party chaos.  And the Democrats struggled with the socialism label heats up as they announce the site of next year's convention, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p><p>A smart Republican say is perfect since its elected three socialist mayors.</p><p>Plus, from socialism to slavery reparations to legalizing prostitution, it is all on the table with a popular hip-hop radio show host who are shaking up the script.  Getting personal with the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, the hosts of the powerhouse Breakfast Club join us live to talk about how it is becoming a Democratic campaign trail must-stop.</p><p>Hello and welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT.  I'm Shannon Bream in Washington.</p><p>We begin tonight with correspondent Kristin Fisher in tonight's bombshell from Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  The top Democrat is saying the president is not worth impeaching.  She's not going to support the move, but some other feels very differently about that.</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  This was quite an interview from Speaker Pelosi.  We've known for some time that the Democratic leadership has been wary of this rush to impeach from members of their own caucus.</p><p>But now, Speaker Pelosi has finally come out and publicly said that she is not for impeachment.  In an interview just released by the Washington Post,\" she says quote, \"Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country, and he's just not worth it.\"</p><p>Democratic congressman, Adam Schiff, is backing up Speaker Pelosi by saying tonight that only graphic evidence would warrant an impeachment gamble against President Trump.</p><p>But that line of thinking will put the Democratic leadership at odds with many members of their own party, including Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib who's already said that she's planning to introduce articles of impeachment against President Trump by the end of this month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D), MICHIGAN:  If we don't hold impeachment proceedings today, start them today, and hold him accountable to following the United States constitution.  Think about that.  This is not going to be the last CEO that runs for president of the United States.  This is not going to be the last person that tries to get away with this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FISHER:  So President Trump and Speaker Pelosi may finally agree on one thing.  No impeachment.  But they still disagree on most everything else, especially the new budget proposal put forward by the White House today.</p><p>Pelosi called it cruel and shortsighted.  She said, quote, \"The cruel and shortsighted cuts in President Trump's budget request are a roadmap to a sicker, weaker America.  House Democrats will reject this toxic, destructive, budget request which would hollow out our national strength and failed to meet the needs of the American people.\"</p><p>The White House says that this budget proposal is aimed at keeping Americans safe by increasing defense spending and including more than $8 billion for the border wall.  But it's also slashing funding for many domestic programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSS VOUGHT, ACTING DIRECTOR, OMB:  Washington has a spending problem and it endangers the future prosperity of our nation for generations to come.  This budget contains nearly $2.7 trillion in savings, more spending reductions proposed than any administration in history.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FISHER:  But even with those savings, this budget proposal would still push the federal deficit past $1 trillion.  The White House is asking for a huge number for fiscal year 2020, a record $4.7 trillion.</p><p>It's a big number, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  It is.  And they've got to answer some questions about that.</p><p>FISHER:  And it's just a proposal.  Not --</p><p>BREAM:  yes.</p><p>FISHER:  Just a blueprint.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  And we remember seeing President Obama's proposals voted down like 99 to nothing.  So we know that the president's proposal is just a place for Congress to start.</p><p>FISHER:  Just a place to start.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Thank you.</p><p>FISHER:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Wisconsin Republicans say they are not surprised the Democratic Party picked Milwaukee for next year's National Convention because of the city's strong ties they say to socialism.</p><p>Correspondent David Spunt has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOM BARRETT (D), MAYOR OF MILWAUKEE:  I want to welcome to Milwaukee the 2020 Democratic National Convention.</p><p>DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  On a cold Milwaukee afternoon, it became clear July 2020 will be hot.</p><p>TOM PEREZ, CHAIRMAN, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE:  Our democracies on fire.  It's a five alarm blaze and we have first responders in this room and elsewhere prepared to take back our democracy.</p><p>SPUNT:  Milwaukee beat out Houston and Miami for the DNC bid, and it's the only major city that counts three socialist mayors in its history.  The Wisconsin Republican Party put out a statement, quote, \"No city in America has stronger ties to socialism than Milwaukee.  And with the rise of Bernie Sanders and the embrace of socialism by its newest leaders, the American left has come full circle.\"  End quote.</p><p>Speaking of Sanders, he's number two on a new national international Monmouth University poll which tested 20 different candidates.  Sanders has been a proud Democratic socialist for decades and he's three percent behind former vice president, Joe Biden, who has yet to announce a run.</p><p>Sanders is at the top of the pack in a recent Emerson Poll focusing on New Hampshire.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT:  In 2016, this is where the political revolution took off.  Thank you, New Hampshire.</p><p>SPUNT:  Whether or not a candidate is a socialist is now a key question, a question that some candidates dismissed.</p><p>GOV. JOHN HICKENLOOPER (D-CO), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Once you get back into these labels, am I a capitalist, am I a socialist?  How much of -- how much of a capitalist am I versus how much of a socialist?  It becomes kind of silly, doesn't it?</p><p>SPUNT:  While others distanced themselves completely from the socialist label.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS:  Bernie has to speak to what Democratic socialism is.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And you are not one.</p><p>WARREN:  And I'm not.</p><p>HOWARD SCHULTZ, FORMER CHAIRMAN AND CEO, STARBUCKS:  We don't want a government takeover of our lives.</p><p>SPUNT:  Independent, Howard Schultz, thought he got a negative reaction from the crowd when he talked socialism.</p><p>SCHULTZ:  If you want a good description for socialism, I think just look at Venezuela.  It's a -- you don't like that?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SPUNT:  Howard Schultz said he'll make up his mind about a run by the summer.  He brushes off any criticism that he could hurt the Democrats chance to win the White House.  The convention in Wisconsin, Shannon, a state President Trump won in 2016.</p><p>BREAM:  I'm a -- Schultz will continue causing a lot of heartburn for folks out there, waiting for that decision.  David, thank you.</p><p>All right.  They featured interviews with the nation's most prominent hip-hop stars and celebrities.  But now, the popular radio show is also a must-stop media spot for 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.  Senators Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Cory Booker among others have all stopped in.</p><p>Joining me now from the nationally syndicated radio show, the Breakfast Club on Power 105.1 in New York City.  DJ Envy, Angela Yee, and Charlamagne tha God.  Welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT.  Great to have you, guys.</p><p>RAASHAUN CASEY, AMERICAN DISC JOCKEY:  Hey, thanks for having us.</p><p>ANGELA YEE, AMERICAN RADIO PERSONALITY:  Hi, Shannon.</p><p>LENARD LARRY MCKELVEY, AMERICAN RADIO PRESENTER:  What's happening?</p><p>BREAM:  Listen, I got to read something from the Daily Beast.  This how they describe you, saying, \"The world's most dangerous morning show.  Charlamagne tha God and his co-host DJ Envy and Angela Yee conduct lengthy interviews with politicians in which the cultural weight of the show and the informality of its interviews often force media train presidential hopeful to let down their guard and get more personal.\"</p><p>Angela, I know you said people are in danger if they come and try to act cool and it's not real.  How does that go?</p><p>YEE:  Well, I think part of the issue is that we're not political pundits.  So people come on the show and they're used to talking about things like their policies and things that are very rehearsed.</p><p>But when you come on the Breakfast Club, we might ask you about anything.  And I think for people, they also want to answer for our audience.  So they might say things to make them sound like more hip than normal.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, and you know, Senator Kamala Harris --</p><p>CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD:  You know --</p><p>BREAM:  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  No.  I was going to say, you know, when you talk to a politician, they've got a talking point for everything, especially when you talk to them about politics.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes, that's the truth.  We find that out every time we have one on.</p><p>Senator Kamala Harris who has gotten a lot of attention, very popular, pulling near the top, even though -- away from the first cluster, but she's definitely in the mix.</p><p>I want to play something that she talked about with you guys that got a lot of attention.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D), CALIFORNIA:  I am absolutely in favor of legalizing marijuana.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Have ever smoked?</p><p>HARRIS:  I have.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  OK.  In college or --</p><p>HARRIS:  And I inhaled.  I did -- I did inhale.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  What were you listening to when you were high?</p><p>CASEY:  What was on?  What song was it?  Was it Snoop?</p><p>HARRIS:  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, yes, definitely Snoop.  Tupac, for sure.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  I mean, guys, that was a big moment.  You just keep making national news with these interviews.</p><p>CASEY:  That question was a little crazy because I asked her what she listened to and my cohost over here was still on the weed question.  And it got a little blurry.  But she was talking about what she listen to.  She says she listened Tupac.  She listened to Snoop and it kind of got blurred with Charlamagne's weed question.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Fox News, you did that.  You all took that out of context.  You all started that.</p><p>BREAM:  I will tell you, it wasn't me.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  You all did that.</p><p>BREAM:  But I can always double-check on that.</p><p>Who do you guys want who hasn't stopped by yet?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I mean, the interesting thing is not like we sit around and we send out these requests for different people.  It's just like whoever wants to come.  We have a platform.  2020 is wide open.  A lot of people are looking to see who they want to vote for in 2020.</p><p>So we're interested in anybody who's running, who wants to get the word out.</p><p>YEE:  I wouldn't mind to have Elizabeth Warren on.  I think she'd be --</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Elizabeth Warren would be great.</p><p>CASEY:  Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>CASEY:  Anybody on both sides though.  Democratic, Republican.  It doesn't matter.  We would love to talk to anybody.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  And I like Julian Castro.  I saw him make a very great statement today when he came to reparations.  So I would love to have him on.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  I mean, that's something that you've talked about with Bernie -- Senator Bernie Sanders.  I mean, he is in the top one or two slots in almost all of the new polls.  It's him and the former vice president and who's not technically in.</p><p>What did you make of Bernie's answer on that?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Oh, I didn't like his answer at all because it seemed to be something he wasn't considering or it's just something he wants to -- he wants some type of form of reparations.  Well, he seemed like he wasn't for the reparations thing at all.</p><p>CASEY:  Kind of avoiding the question a little bit.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.</p><p>YEE:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I wasn't digging his answers.</p><p>YEE:  I think it's important to have solutions.  Like to see if there's an issue that we have, so here are some solutions, here are some possibilities of how we can make that happen instead of dodging a question.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Absolutely.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, and Hillary Clinton back in 2016, she made a lot of news for this exchange when she was on your show.  We want to play.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YEE:  What's something that you always carry with you?</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES:  Hot sauce.</p><p>CASEY:  Really?</p><p>CLINTON:  Yes.</p><p>CASEY:  Really?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  You're giving information right now?</p><p>CASEY:  Hot sauce.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Hot sauce in my bag?  What?</p><p>CLINTON:  Hot sauce.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Really?</p><p>CLINTON:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Now, listen, I'd want you to know people are going to see this and say, OK.  She's pandering to black people.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLINTON:  OK.  Is it working?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  She got a lot of heat for that.  What did you guys make of that exchange?  Because that kind of set the bar for stopping by to your show.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I mean, I said it to her in that moment, you know, this is one of those times when people are going to think that you're pandering the black people.</p><p>But she has said that she likes hot sauce in previous interviews decades earlier.  So maybe she wasn't pandering.</p><p>But the best part about that exchange was when she looked me in the eye and say --</p><p>YEE:  \"Is it working?\"</p><p>MCKELVEY:  \"Is it working?\"  That's a very honest response.</p><p>YEE:  You know, after that, I had to do some research myself and I did go back and see that she talk about it in various other outlets.  And she's been talking about it for years.  But most people won't do that research to see.  This is something real.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.  I don't know how much it worked because --</p><p>CASEY:  People still think that's pandering.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Well, no, she didn't win.</p><p>CASEY:  No, she didn't win.</p><p>YEE:  She did not -- well, technically.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  Well, that's in the history books.</p><p>Let me ask about the guy who did win.  How would you guys handle an interview with President Trump?</p><p>(LAUGHS)</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I don't think that'll go well.</p><p>CASEY:  I think that will go amazing, actually.  He would have to be honest.</p><p>YEE:  I don't think that he would be comfortable answering any questions from us.  I doubt that he would stay for a full interview with us.  Just because there's a lot of issues that I have with things that he says that had been problematic for us and our people.</p><p>Things that we hear that Michael Cohen is even coming forward and saying that he said in private to him, so.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I don't think he would come because I don't think he cares about our audience.  I mean, there's nothing about Donald Trump that makes me think he cares about black and brown people.</p><p>YEE:  There's a lot of hurtful things that he says.  Personally he had offended me.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  I mean, something that he talks about a lot is the low unemployment rate, historically low, for African-Americans and for the Hispanic community.  It is something he likes to talk about.  If he thought he had a platform with you guys, would he be welcome?</p><p>CASEY:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes, he definitely will be welcomed.  It's very important to know that started with Barack Obama.  It was the policies that Barack Obama implemented that caused the unemployment rate to be so low for African-Americans now and Donald Trump is taking credit for it.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, you know, he loves to joust.  He loves to fight.  He would love to debate that with you guys.  So he might actually come and stick around.  I think he might enjoy it.</p><p>YEE:  Let's have him come on.</p><p>BREAM:  He might --</p><p>CASEY:  I would love for him to come.</p><p>YEE:  Even when he gets asked questions at the White House with reporters.  He'll ban you if he doesn't like your questions, so.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.  And tell him pull up.  We'll get him -- we'll get him some fast food.  We'll get him some little White Castle sliders that fit his little hands.</p><p>CASEY:  Some McDonald's.  Some McDonald's too.</p><p>BREAM:  You know he loves the fast food.</p><p>OK.  So if he's listening tonight, because sometimes he does watch, go ahead and make your pitch to him.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I'm not --</p><p>CASEY:  We're not pitching it.</p><p>YEE:  I mean, we're not really excited.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  If he's smart, he will come up here.</p><p>CASEY:  If he wants to pull up -- he can pull up any time.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  It's not something that we want.  It's not something that we're requesting.  I'm not about to make no pitch.</p><p>CASEY:  No, we're not pitching for him.  But if he wants to come, he's invited.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  And there might be some snacks involved.</p><p>YEE:  He should face --</p><p>BREAM:  The Breakfast show.  World's most dangerous morning show.  Keep making news.  We'll keep watching.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.</p><p>BREAM:  Thank you, guys, very much.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Thank you very much.  Thank you for having us.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  The speaker says no-go to progressive plans to impeach the president.  The Mueller's special counsel reported isn't even in yet.  So, why is she taking plan b off the table?</p><p>Our power panel is here to weigh in.  They are standing by right there for you.  They're next.</p><p>Plus, the latest on the Boeing 737 Max crash.  Lawmakers calling for the aircraft to be grounded.  Will it affect your travel plans?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JOHN YARMUTH (D), KENTUCKY:  To me it's not a question of whether, it's a question of when and probably right now is not the right time but I think at some point it's going to be inevitable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  Reaction still coming in to Speaker Pelosi telling the Washington Post she is not for impeaching President Trump.  Time now for tonight's power panel, the President of Open Primaries, John Opdycke, the director of Strategic Communications for Trump 2020, Marc Lotter, and Fox News Contributor, former Utah Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz.  Welcome to all of you.</p><p>JOHN OPDYCKE, PRESIDENT, OPEN PRIMARIES:  Good evening.</p><p>MARC LOTTER, DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS FOR TRUMP 2020:  Hi, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  So just to remind, folks, this is the quote from Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker.  She says impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country and he's just not worth it.  Marc?</p><p>LOTTER:  What took her so long?  It's been two years, 300,000 documents, hundreds of hours of interviews, and she's come to the same conclusion that President Trump said day one.  No collusion.  So I'm surprised that it took her that long to get there.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  I want to read something from Politico today, it says, Dems have started the years of impeachment.  Can they still turn back?  It says interviews with more than a dozen key Democratic lawmakers revealed deep division within the caucus about whether their efforts could end up helping Trump win a second term in office.  John, we've heard that from a lot of folks who worry that it will just mobilize his base.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Yes.  I don't agree with Speaker Pelosi on much but I take her side on this.  I think that moving in the impeachment direction will be a real disservice to the rich, robust political conversation that's taking place in the country right now.  On a whole range of issues from Green New Deal, to Medicare for All, to immigration and so forth.  And I think in some ways, the American people are deeply distrustful of Congress.</p><p>And to take this decision about who the next President is going to be out of the hands of the American people and put it in the hand of an institution the people don't have a lot of trust in right now, I think it's the wrong direction to go.  I agree with Speaker Pelosi.  Leave it up to the people.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Tom Steyer who is a billionaire, who has talked a lot about the political game.  He's not running this time but he's supporting lot of other causes and folks and he has been all about impeachment from day one.  He says this, he says Speaker Pelosi thinks he's just not worth it, well, is defending our legal system worth it?  Is holding the President accountable for his crimes and cover ups worth it?</p><p>Is doing what's right worth it or shall America just stop fighting for our principles and so what's politically convenient, Jason?</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I think Speaker Pelosi was right, other than the last part of the phrase that she offered there but our founders put up an exceptionally high bar.  If she had an inkling, if she had some evidence, I think she would go for it.  I think it's an admission that she doesn't have that evidence but she has a problem with their caucus because she's got 60 or so people that have already signed up for impeachment.</p><p>They've been promising this from the day Donald Trump was sworn in.  The problem for the Democrats is they just don't have any evidence, and they don't have any facts to actually back something up and make the case because it would be a loser and the country knows that and she is smart enough to recognize that.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, you know the committees that are coordinating in the 81 letters that went out last week looking into any number of things, from the Trump organization, to family members, to Russia, to everything else even though the special counsel were still waiting on that formal proceeding to close out.  So it's clear that they're casting a net to look for some things.  Aaron Blake at the Washington Post writes after the news of Speaker Pelosi today, he says, Pelosi's ability to tamp down impeachment fever could be one of the most significant battles of her speakership and these new comments are a line in the sand.</p><p>I mean, Marc, we're hearing a number of Democrats out tonight and saying or in recent days saying they still think and you hear Congressman Yarmuth, it's just a matter of time.</p><p>LOTTER:  Yes.  I mean, the number of investigations they're launching completely egregious but when you look at what were actually getting to and this is another bad week that is showing the Democrat Party is breaking apart right in front of our very eyes.  I don't see where any of the 2020 Democratic candidates are out there rallying the base and inspiring their liberal donors with no impeachment.  The radicals have taken over.</p><p>That's who controls their party right now and I am going to be very interested to see how their Presidential candidates try to balance what Speaker Pelosi is saying with the realities on the ground and trying to win in a very polarized, very radical party.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  We're just getting in some news here, the New York Attorney General and we know that the President is facing a lot of trouble at the state level with the southern district of New York.  Actually a Federal but they're in New York -- but there are -- the state A.G. has made a lot of noise too about conducting some investigations.  The attorney general's office in New York late Monday issuing subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank for records relating to the financing of four major Trump organization projects at a failed effort to buy the buffalo bills of the National Football League.</p><p>John, what do you make about that?  I mean, it seems like the President, it's going to be a long time before all these various investigations for multiple agencies are ever wrapped up.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Yes, and everybody knows that President Trump is a ruffian.  That is beyond dispute.  I think the tactical question, the political question that the Democrats have to take seriously is why not allow the people of this country to weigh in on that question?  Why do you want to shortchange that with politically motivated investigations that even if they're correct, set up a situation that furthers the divisions in this country.</p><p>And frankly hold the Democrats back from pushing a lot of the issues that they're having a lot of traction with right now.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  And Jason, it seems like there is this internal split about some of these really big issues.  We saw last week that it took them a week to put together the resolution that ended up condemning not only anti-Semitism but Islamophobia and white supremacy and all kinds of things.  We thought it was ready for the floor then it's back then they're fighting again and now we understand that there is -- this internal split.</p><p>And some of it has gone public about this issue of impeachment but the Speaker also said that \"the party is unified.\"</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I don't think so.  I think the Democrats are an absolute chaos.  I mean, think about it.  Bernie Sanders is the leader of the Democratic Party.  He's not a member of the Democratic Party.  He is registered as an Independent and really a socialist, so the leader of the Presidential candidates isn't even a member of their own party.  And then they can't decide whether or not they hate the Jewish people are not and how are they going to actually articulate that in a pace, in a resolution instead of calling out the actual individual.</p><p>I don't think that all the -- all the Democrats hate Jews but you do have some that need to be called out specifically.  The way Republicans did, like I did, with Mr. King when he stepped over the line.  So again, it's a -- it's a -- it's a campaign that's in chaos, a party that can't define itself.  And they're totally off message.  And they have to explain to the American people why they think these socialist views are the right solution for America because America is not buying it.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Senator Elizabeth Warren is officially in the race said this weekend it is wrong to call her socialist.  She doesn't support that.  But we're going to talk more about and coming up how she's also wants to go after some big tech companies and break them up, so there's a lot there to digest.  Power panel, thank you.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Just to say one thing in response to Congressman Chaffetz is that you say the American people are buying these things, I think the American people are deeply interested in having an honest conversation about many of the issues that progressives and socialists like Bernie Sanders and AOC are putting on the table.  It doesn't mean they agree with them on everything but they want to talk about these things.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, to leave it there.  The keyword --</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Oh, I would love to talk about those issues.</p><p>BREAM:  The keyword is honest --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Bring it on.  Bring it on.  You will drive the Democratic Party into the grave.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  I think the key there is honest and we can talk -- keep it factual.  I think that it's important for the American people.  They do want to talk about these things.  But in the meantime, thank you gentlemen.  Come back soon.</p><p>LOTTER:  Thank you.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Coming up, caught in the act, dramatic surveillance footage of a transsexual woman accused of pepper spray attacks all across New York.  We'll tell you what that's about.  And Liz Warren breaking ranks with socialist Democrats but also vowing to take on big tech.  We told you about that.  She's proposing to break up some giant social media companies.  Trace on the case.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WARREN:  The giant tech companies right now are eating up little tiny businesses, start-ups, and competing unfairly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  A transgender woman has been arrested in New York.  Police say, she might be behind a series of pepper spray attacks in Upper Manhattan.  One couple says, the attacker allegedly approached them on the street, asked the woman if she was white, and then pepper sprayed her.  The man tried to intervene, the attacker pulled out a knife, he says.  Authorities say, 11 people were attacked over the weekend in suspected hate crimes.</p><p>We're awaiting information from the Black Box of the Ethiopian Airlines plane, the Boeing 737 Max 8 that crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all 157 people aboard, including at least eight Americans.  The FAA says that planes are still air-worthy after two fatal crashes in less than six months.  Correspondent Doug McKelway has the latest.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  At the United Nations today, a flag at half-staff, an honor of the 157 people killed, 21 of them U.N. staffers in Sunday's crash of an Ethiopian Airlines, Boeing 737.</p><p>ABBY AHMED, ETHIOPIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  As we all know Ethiopian Airlines is a well-known airline that has not experienced such accidents for a long time.</p><p>MCKELWAY:  It was the second Boeing 737 Max 8 to crash in the last five months.  In the first, the like Lion Air Max 8 plane dove vertically into the sea, killing all 189 on board.  In both cases, radar data showed there were similar violent oscillations, pitching up and down, before the planes crashed.  But in the Lion Air case, there were other problems.  That plane had maintenance issues with airspeed, altimeter and other gauges.  The Max 8 is the latest generation Boeing's 737 with more power, more fuel-efficient engines.  The bigger engines necessitated the redesign of the plane's trim controls.  When the two trim control switches are turned off, and the plane is powered up, it causes a different reaction than in earlier models.</p><p>JOHN GOGLIA, FORMER NTSB INVESTIGATOR:  When you apply full power to the airplane, it's going to drive the nose up.  So, what Boeing did to counter that is they automated it.</p><p>MCKELWAY:  But if the trim switch is turned off or malfunctioning, a poorly trained pilot might have problems.  Over correcting for the nose up with a pitch down.  It can produce what's called pilot induced oscillation, as seen in this 1978 NASA video.  The first officer in the Ethiopian air crash had 200 hours of flying time, compared to a minimum of 1500 hours for U.S. first officers.</p><p>The flight and voice data recorders have been recovered.  Ethiopian, Cayman Airways, and China have all grounded the Max 8, but neither the Boeing, the FAA nor Domestic Carriers United, American, or Southwest have.  In December Boeing took a risk amid the ongoing trade war, opening a finishing facility in China, the world's largest growing airplane market.  The first plane to roll out of that facility was a 737 Max 8.  Shannon?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM:  Doug McKelway, thank you very much.  Two progressives, two different views, of what to do about big technology.  Well, Senator Elizabeth Warren wants to better regulate big tech, Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez see's technology as a means to a post-capitalist end.  Trace is on the case from our L.A. Newsroom.  Trace.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Shannon.  Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren is well-aware that her views often draw comparisons to her Senate colleague Bernie Sanders, but Warren wants to make it clear unlike Sanders she's not a Democratic socialist.  She supports capitalism, albeit with the right regulations.  And in the process of building her campaign and defining her positions, the Massachusetts senator has laid out her plan to break up big technology -- a goal she shares with President Trump.  For example, Warren would require regulators to go after massive mergers like Amazon buying Whole Foods and Facebook's ownership of Instagram.  Watch.</p><p>WARREN:  We want to keep that market place competitive, not let a giant who has an incredible information advantage, and a manipulative advantage, be able to snuff you out.</p><p>GALLAGHER:  Oddly, today, Facebook took down a number of Warren's campaign ads saying she misused its company logo.  Warren responded by citing Facebook's power to shut down debate.  The ads have now been restored.  Then, there's Democratic freshman Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who doesn't seem nearly as worried about big technology expanding or the rise of workplace robots.  In fact, Ocasio-Cortez says, Americans should be excited to have their jobs automated, quoting: \"The reason we're not excited by it is because we live in a society where if you don't have a job, you are left to die.  And that is, at its core, our problem.\"  She points out that not having a job gives you more time.</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), NEW YORK:  We should be excited about automation because what it could potentially mean is more time educating ourselves, more time creating art, more time investing and investigating in the sciences, more time focused on invention, more time going to space, more time enjoying the world that we live in.</p><p>GALLAGHER:  In case you're wondering, the 29-year-old Ocasio-Cortez drew bigger crowds at South by Southwest than any other presidential candidates.  Shannon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM:  All right, Trace Gallagher, thank you very much.  There is a new face of terror.  Hamza bin Laden, the son of Osama bin Laden, has a giant bounty now on his head.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  As released audio and video messages on the Internet, calling on his followers to want to attack against the United States and its western allies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  So, will the man who killed Osama bin Laden, his father, Rob O'Neill, take a shot at finding his son?  Rob joins us live to tell us what he thinks, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  Terror has a new face and he wants revenge on America.  Officials are warning that Osama bin Laden's son is actively engaging in terrorism and is emerging as the leader of al-Qaeda.  The State Department is offering a million-dollar reward for information on Hamza bin Laden's whereabouts, so let's talk to the guy who killed his dad, Osama bin Laden, former Navy SEAL Rob O'Neill.  Good to have you with us again, Rob.</p><p>ROB O'NEILL, FORMER NAVY SEAL:  Thank you, Shannon, for having me.  I appreciate it.</p><p>BREAM:  It may have been in jest, but we've got to put up on Twitter, there was a group that reached out to you and said, you know, we're assembling crew to go claim the $1 million bounty, are you in?  You say maybe not legitimately, but you do think it's a worthy mission at this point.</p><p>O'NEILL:  This is definitely a worthy mission, just to continue to prove that if terror rears its ugly head, we have men and women who are willing to go do it.  You know, on a serious note, I would do everything asked of me to do, but we have younger, more seasoned guys that are out there right now.  Some guys that were on the actual raid -- I don't know if we would risk that kind of a cross-border type thing that we did with Osama bin Laden, but something along the lines of the good men and women from the three letter agencies that find some intel on where he is and hit him with a drone strike.  I think that Hamza bin Laden, at least, is smart enough to know that gets too cute and too cocky, he's going to stick his head out and he's going to get gotten.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, apparently, he has reached out and started to make some noise over the last couple of years.  He obviously is.  We've talked about it.  I mean, there are a number of his family members who have been taken out of this al-Qaeda fight and he's got a lot of skin in the game, as you've said.  John Gambrell back in March, he says this, talking about Hamza bin Laden, began appearing in militant videos back as far as 2015.  And he said this apparently, if you think that your sinful crime that you committed in Abbottabad has passed without punishment, then you thought wrong.\"</p><p>O'NEILL:  Right, and the way that Hamza thinks, because of his brand of Islam that he follows, they're not going to worship of false idols, so it's not going to be revenge for the death of his father and his brother, and his other brother before them.  It would be more to avenge the deaths of the defenders of Islam, as they call it.  You know, because they're obviously very religious, in their own psychotic version of Islam.  Yes, he's making it apparent that he's there and he remembers what happened and what's been going on.</p><p>And he thinks that we've oppressed everyone in Iraq, and in Iran, and in Pakistan and all that stuff.  Al-Qaeda -- they're just on a strategic pause right now.  This isn't an end.  And they're going to sit there -- and like I've always said, ISIS loved the big headline and they stab in the front.  Al-Qaeda is going to wait around and stab you in the back.  They hit New York in 2003, tried to knock down the Trade Towers; and they didn't forget, they came back in 2001 and succeeded.  So, you can't get complacent with these guys, because complacency will get you killed.</p><p>BREAM:  What do you make of the price tag?  Is it enough in the scenario to get people to turn him in?</p><p>O'NEILL:  I mean, it could be but he is surrounded by some hardliners -- everyone, Taliban, and al-Qaeda guys are all around him.  It's going to take a little bit of money for an outsider to sort of see in, especially considering what happened with the doctor in Abbottabad, Pakistan that sort of helped us try to locate Osama bin Laden.  You know, he's not in a good place right now.  And it's going to take five or 10 million which wouldn't be much for us.  It worked with a lot of the Ba'ath party and (INAUDIBLE) Hussein in Iraq.  It could work here again, but like, al-Qaeda is a lot more -- they're a lot more loyal to each other than the Ba'ath party was.</p><p>BREAM:  Well -- and very quickly, we just have a few seconds, do you think he's probably in Pakistan?</p><p>O'NEILL:  I would say pretty much in Pakistan.  Yes, probably, in Pakistan or at least in the tribal regions where there's not a lot of law and they kind of protect him there.  And weirdly enough, he's been cooperating with the Iranians.  I believe he was pretty much raised in Iran under the cover of Iran, because that government can, even with the travel ban, probably help him travel certain places.  So, it is scary, but he's in the area.  I'm thinking right near (INAUDIBLE) of Pakistan.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, as you said, and others have noted, don't mistake their pause for inactivity.  They saying, you know, experts very much that they have the ability and the intent to come after the U.S. again.</p><p>O'NEILL:  Oh, they definitely have the intent.  That's what happens when you raise people from the time, they're infants to the time, the like, Hamza -- they're in their 30s, just to hate people because they don't believe what you believe.  You get this kind of stuff.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, Rob O'Neill, always great to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>O'NEILL:  Thanks, Shannon.  I appreciate it.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, the Supreme Court made it clear, public employees can no longer be forced to pay dues to a union they don't support.  But five California public school teachers say, that is exactly what's happening to them and now, they are suing.  We'll hear from their lawyer, we're going to debate both sides.  Plus, the president joins the daylight savings time debate, should it stay or should it go?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  On the heels of six-day teachers strike in California, five teachers are now suing the state's top union over collecting dues through mandatory paycheck deductions.  A practice that the Supreme Court calls on unconstitutional less than a year ago.  All right, let's bring in former Aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, Chris Hahn; and the lawyer representing the teachers, you recognize her, Harmeet Dhillon.  Thank you both for joining us.</p><p>HARMEET DHILLION, LAWYER:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>CHRIS HAHN, FORMER AIDE TO SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER:  Thanks for having us.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Harmeet, I just want you to clarify because Justice Alito was very clear.  He said this, in the decision last year, we conclude that this arrangement violates the free-speech rights of nonmembers by compelling them to subsidize private speech on matters of substantial public concern, and he said, unless these people affirmatively consent to giving the money, the unions can't take it.  Are you claiming that's what happening in California?</p><p>DHILLON:  Exactly what's happening.  So, our five clients working in conjunction with the freedom foundation, which has filed this type of lawsuit in other West Coast states as well, are claiming that they have opted out of their union card contracts.  And despite having opted out, the union is not letting them out until the anniversary of their one-year contract.  So, every pay period that their paychecks are being deducted, significant money in the case of the lead plaintiff, Bethany Mendez, $1500 a year on a pretty meager teacher's salary, a constitutional violation is occurring.  And so, the Supreme Court was very clear that you cannot take this money unless there is a knowing and voluntary waiver of the First Amendment.  And so, none of these teachers have made a voluntary waiver of the First Amendment rights.</p><p>BREAM:  So, Chris, even if you didn't like the ruling from the Supreme Court, it was a tight 15-4 last year.  Why shouldn't these teachers have the right to put their foot down over this?</p><p>HAHN:  Well, they are.  They signed a contract and they agreed to have these dues taken out.  I always wonder where you find teachers who are willing to go against their own interests and fight their union which basically gives them a much better salary, much better benefits and much better working conditions than they would've gotten on their own, especially given the market where there are thousands of teachers coming out of colleges every single day for every single opening.  These unions actually strengthen teachers and give them a better life at a fraction for what they are paying for these unions.  So, I am shocked that these people are willing to be used this way.  I hope that the kids that they teach are learning something because, god, these people don't seem to have learned much when they were in college.</p><p>DHILLON: Wow!</p><p>BREAM:  But Chris, you know, like the plaintiffs in a couple of these big cases, before the Supreme Court have said, they're going out on -- and supporting political candidates and messages with my dues money that I 100 percent disagree with, and they don't feel like they should have to subsidize that speech.  Does that make them terrible people?</p><p>HAHN:  You know, it's funny.  It's a slippery slope and, you know, when -- you know, we all pay for things we don't want going to support things we don't like.  For example, I'd buy gasoline every day.  Do I have a right to determine what we're going to -- what the gasoline company is going to do with the money I spend on it?  You know, it's a very slippery slope.  The Supreme Court got it wrong and it will be overturned when we get some reasonable members on that court.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  Harmeet, the California Teachers Association, by the way, very brave statement, only responding this way, saying: \"It's another lawsuit from the Freedom Foundation to continue the attack on public education and public employees.\"  Harmeet?</p><p>DHILLION:  So, Chris just called these teachers stupid and said that their students are going to learn nothing, and he also ignore the fact that this is a constitutional violation.  That's the difference between your gas analogy and what's going on here.  And if you think about it in terms of a term that choice -- that the left loves which is freedom of choice, that's what these teachers are really looking for here.  They're looking for the choice to be part of a union or not.  And by the way, the sky doesn't fall when people aren't part of a union.  Chris, as you know in the federal system, people are --</p><p>HAHN:  They can opt out at the end of their contract.  They opted in and now they're opting out.</p><p>DHILLON:  Please don't interrupt me, Chris, I didn't interrupt you.  In the federal system, people do not -- people are not required to be part of the union and the unions go on just fine.  And so, no, when you have a constitutional right, it is not sufficient to you can opt out when we tell you can.  After they opted out, Shannon, union sent thugs into the classroom to try to intimidate them into revoking their opt out.</p><p>HAHN:  Stop.  Thugs.  Kindergarten teachers.</p><p>DHILLON:  And so, this is not acceptable.  And it is time for the state of California to follow the constitution as the Supreme Court says.</p><p>BREAM:  Chris, you don't think that's OK, coercion, do you, Chris?</p><p>HAHN:  No, of course not.  But I also don't think that these teachers who are her clients understand how much they're being used by extreme right-wing groups that just want to break unions all over the country.</p><p>DHILLION:  Yes, they're so dumb and you know better.</p><p>HANH:  Well, look, they are clearly unaware of how they're being used, you know.  So, it is a shame and I feel bad for them, because they're going to learn very soon if they their union does collapse, what their salaries would be in a free market, and it won't be good for them.</p><p>DHILLON:  I think they're going to be just fine without all the coerced speech.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes, a lot of people felt after the ruling last year that there would be a big threat to the unions falling apart, that kind of thing.  We haven't seen that yet.  So, we'll see and we'll watch this case and see who is right in their predictions.</p><p>HAHN:  Not for trying of these groups, though, that's for sure.</p><p>BREAM:  Chris and Harmeet, thank you both.  Good to see you.</p><p>DHILLON:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>HAHN:  Thank you, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, coming up, is New York Mayor Bill de Blasio losing the forest for the trees, as the mayor tells kids to have meatless Mondays?  Economists are warning the city is about to head into a financial crisis.  That stories are in our \"REAL NEWS ROUND UP\", next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  Well, a woman gets booted from a hearing on gun control after apparently texting about going on a shooting spree of her own.  That story tops tonight's \"REAL NEWS ROUNDUP.\"  The unidentified woman was ejected from a Connecticut State Senate hearing after she was reportedly spotted sending a text saying: if she had a gun, she'd \"blow away a Republican state lawmaker and a large group of NRAs.\"  Connecticut capital police determined there was no threat.  The woman was not arrested.</p><p>New York City implementing meatless Mondays in public schools, a move supporter say, promotes healthy, environmentally friendly meal options.  The mayor says, cutting back on a little meat will help down on greenhouse gases and help save the planet.

A new podcast drops tomorrow.  Subscribe at podcastone.com.  Shannon Bream and the FOX NEWS @ NIGHT team take it from here.  I'll be in New York tomorrow night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  I will too.  I'll see you there, Laura.  Thank you so much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INGRAHAM:  All right.  See you then.</p><p>BREAM:  We begin tonight with a Fox News alert.  Breaking tonight, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says President Trump is not worth impeaching.  But that sparking a firestorm on the left where some though it is going to happen.  It's just a matter of time.</p><p>Tonight's announcement follows a week of internal Democratic Party chaos.  And the Democrats struggled with the socialism label heats up as they announce the site of next year's convention, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p><p>A smart Republican say is perfect since its elected three socialist mayors.</p><p>Plus, from socialism to slavery reparations to legalizing prostitution, it is all on the table with a popular hip-hop radio show host who are shaking up the script.  Getting personal with the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, the hosts of the powerhouse Breakfast Club join us live to talk about how it is becoming a Democratic campaign trail must-stop.</p><p>Hello and welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT.  I'm Shannon Bream in Washington.</p><p>We begin tonight with correspondent Kristin Fisher in tonight's bombshell from Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  The top Democrat is saying the president is not worth impeaching.  She's not going to support the move, but some other feels very differently about that.</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  This was quite an interview from Speaker Pelosi.  We've known for some time that the Democratic leadership has been wary of this rush to impeach from members of their own caucus.</p><p>But now, Speaker Pelosi has finally come out and publicly said that she is not for impeachment.  In an interview just released by the Washington Post,\" she says quote, \"Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country, and he's just not worth it.\"</p><p>Democratic congressman, Adam Schiff, is backing up Speaker Pelosi by saying tonight that only graphic evidence would warrant an impeachment gamble against President Trump.</p><p>But that line of thinking will put the Democratic leadership at odds with many members of their own party, including Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib who's already said that she's planning to introduce articles of impeachment against President Trump by the end of this month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D), MICHIGAN:  If we don't hold impeachment proceedings today, start them today, and hold him accountable to following the United States constitution.  Think about that.  This is not going to be the last CEO that runs for president of the United States.  This is not going to be the last person that tries to get away with this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FISHER:  So President Trump and Speaker Pelosi may finally agree on one thing.  No impeachment.  But they still disagree on most everything else, especially the new budget proposal put forward by the White House today.</p><p>Pelosi called it cruel and shortsighted.  She said, quote, \"The cruel and shortsighted cuts in President Trump's budget request are a roadmap to a sicker, weaker America.  House Democrats will reject this toxic, destructive, budget request which would hollow out our national strength and failed to meet the needs of the American people.\"</p><p>The White House says that this budget proposal is aimed at keeping Americans safe by increasing defense spending and including more than $8 billion for the border wall.  But it's also slashing funding for many domestic programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSS VOUGHT, ACTING DIRECTOR, OMB:  Washington has a spending problem and it endangers the future prosperity of our nation for generations to come.  This budget contains nearly $2.7 trillion in savings, more spending reductions proposed than any administration in history.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FISHER:  But even with those savings, this budget proposal would still push the federal deficit past $1 trillion.  The White House is asking for a huge number for fiscal year 2020, a record $4.7 trillion.</p><p>It's a big number, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  It is.  And they've got to answer some questions about that.</p><p>FISHER:  And it's just a proposal.  Not --</p><p>BREAM:  yes.</p><p>FISHER:  Just a blueprint.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  And we remember seeing President Obama's proposals voted down like 99 to nothing.  So we know that the president's proposal is just a place for Congress to start.</p><p>FISHER:  Just a place to start.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Thank you.</p><p>FISHER:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Wisconsin Republicans say they are not surprised the Democratic Party picked Milwaukee for next year's National Convention because of the city's strong ties they say to socialism.</p><p>Correspondent David Spunt has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOM BARRETT (D), MAYOR OF MILWAUKEE:  I want to welcome to Milwaukee the 2020 Democratic National Convention.</p><p>DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  On a cold Milwaukee afternoon, it became clear July 2020 will be hot.</p><p>TOM PEREZ, CHAIRMAN, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE:  Our democracies on fire.  It's a five alarm blaze and we have first responders in this room and elsewhere prepared to take back our democracy.</p><p>SPUNT:  Milwaukee beat out Houston and Miami for the DNC bid, and it's the only major city that counts three socialist mayors in its history.  The Wisconsin Republican Party put out a statement, quote, \"No city in America has stronger ties to socialism than Milwaukee.  And with the rise of Bernie Sanders and the embrace of socialism by its newest leaders, the American left has come full circle.\"  End quote.</p><p>Speaking of Sanders, he's number two on a new national international Monmouth University poll which tested 20 different candidates.  Sanders has been a proud Democratic socialist for decades and he's three percent behind former vice president, Joe Biden, who has yet to announce a run.</p><p>Sanders is at the top of the pack in a recent Emerson Poll focusing on New Hampshire.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT:  In 2016, this is where the political revolution took off.  Thank you, New Hampshire.</p><p>SPUNT:  Whether or not a candidate is a socialist is now a key question, a question that some candidates dismissed.</p><p>GOV. JOHN HICKENLOOPER (D-CO), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Once you get back into these labels, am I a capitalist, am I a socialist?  How much of -- how much of a capitalist am I versus how much of a socialist?  It becomes kind of silly, doesn't it?</p><p>SPUNT:  While others distanced themselves completely from the socialist label.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS:  Bernie has to speak to what Democratic socialism is.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And you are not one.</p><p>WARREN:  And I'm not.</p><p>HOWARD SCHULTZ, FORMER CHAIRMAN AND CEO, STARBUCKS:  We don't want a government takeover of our lives.</p><p>SPUNT:  Independent, Howard Schultz, thought he got a negative reaction from the crowd when he talked socialism.</p><p>SCHULTZ:  If you want a good description for socialism, I think just look at Venezuela.  It's a -- you don't like that?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SPUNT:  Howard Schultz said he'll make up his mind about a run by the summer.  He brushes off any criticism that he could hurt the Democrats chance to win the White House.  The convention in Wisconsin, Shannon, a state President Trump won in 2016.</p><p>BREAM:  I'm a -- Schultz will continue causing a lot of heartburn for folks out there, waiting for that decision.  David, thank you.</p><p>All right.  They featured interviews with the nation's most prominent hip-hop stars and celebrities.  But now, the popular radio show is also a must-stop media spot for 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.  Senators Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Cory Booker among others have all stopped in.</p><p>Joining me now from the nationally syndicated radio show, the Breakfast Club on Power 105.1 in New York City.  DJ Envy, Angela Yee, and Charlamagne tha God.  Welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT.  Great to have you, guys.</p><p>RAASHAUN CASEY, AMERICAN DISC JOCKEY:  Hey, thanks for having us.</p><p>ANGELA YEE, AMERICAN RADIO PERSONALITY:  Hi, Shannon.</p><p>LENARD LARRY MCKELVEY, AMERICAN RADIO PRESENTER:  What's happening?</p><p>BREAM:  Listen, I got to read something from the Daily Beast.  This how they describe you, saying, \"The world's most dangerous morning show.  Charlamagne tha God and his co-host DJ Envy and Angela Yee conduct lengthy interviews with politicians in which the cultural weight of the show and the informality of its interviews often force media train presidential hopeful to let down their guard and get more personal.\"</p><p>Angela, I know you said people are in danger if they come and try to act cool and it's not real.  How does that go?</p><p>YEE:  Well, I think part of the issue is that we're not political pundits.  So people come on the show and they're used to talking about things like their policies and things that are very rehearsed.</p><p>But when you come on the Breakfast Club, we might ask you about anything.  And I think for people, they also want to answer for our audience.  So they might say things to make them sound like more hip than normal.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, and you know, Senator Kamala Harris --</p><p>CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD:  You know --</p><p>BREAM:  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  No.  I was going to say, you know, when you talk to a politician, they've got a talking point for everything, especially when you talk to them about politics.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes, that's the truth.  We find that out every time we have one on.</p><p>Senator Kamala Harris who has gotten a lot of attention, very popular, pulling near the top, even though -- away from the first cluster, but she's definitely in the mix.</p><p>I want to play something that she talked about with you guys that got a lot of attention.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D), CALIFORNIA:  I am absolutely in favor of legalizing marijuana.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Have ever smoked?</p><p>HARRIS:  I have.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  OK.  In college or --</p><p>HARRIS:  And I inhaled.  I did -- I did inhale.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  What were you listening to when you were high?</p><p>CASEY:  What was on?  What song was it?  Was it Snoop?</p><p>HARRIS:  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, yes, definitely Snoop.  Tupac, for sure.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  I mean, guys, that was a big moment.  You just keep making national news with these interviews.</p><p>CASEY:  That question was a little crazy because I asked her what she listened to and my cohost over here was still on the weed question.  And it got a little blurry.  But she was talking about what she listen to.  She says she listened Tupac.  She listened to Snoop and it kind of got blurred with Charlamagne's weed question.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Fox News, you did that.  You all took that out of context.  You all started that.</p><p>BREAM:  I will tell you, it wasn't me.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  You all did that.</p><p>BREAM:  But I can always double-check on that.</p><p>Who do you guys want who hasn't stopped by yet?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I mean, the interesting thing is not like we sit around and we send out these requests for different people.  It's just like whoever wants to come.  We have a platform.  2020 is wide open.  A lot of people are looking to see who they want to vote for in 2020.</p><p>So we're interested in anybody who's running, who wants to get the word out.</p><p>YEE:  I wouldn't mind to have Elizabeth Warren on.  I think she'd be --</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Elizabeth Warren would be great.</p><p>CASEY:  Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>CASEY:  Anybody on both sides though.  Democratic, Republican.  It doesn't matter.  We would love to talk to anybody.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  And I like Julian Castro.  I saw him make a very great statement today when he came to reparations.  So I would love to have him on.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  I mean, that's something that you've talked about with Bernie -- Senator Bernie Sanders.  I mean, he is in the top one or two slots in almost all of the new polls.  It's him and the former vice president and who's not technically in.</p><p>What did you make of Bernie's answer on that?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Oh, I didn't like his answer at all because it seemed to be something he wasn't considering or it's just something he wants to -- he wants some type of form of reparations.  Well, he seemed like he wasn't for the reparations thing at all.</p><p>CASEY:  Kind of avoiding the question a little bit.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.</p><p>YEE:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I wasn't digging his answers.</p><p>YEE:  I think it's important to have solutions.  Like to see if there's an issue that we have, so here are some solutions, here are some possibilities of how we can make that happen instead of dodging a question.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Absolutely.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, and Hillary Clinton back in 2016, she made a lot of news for this exchange when she was on your show.  We want to play.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YEE:  What's something that you always carry with you?</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES:  Hot sauce.</p><p>CASEY:  Really?</p><p>CLINTON:  Yes.</p><p>CASEY:  Really?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  You're giving information right now?</p><p>CASEY:  Hot sauce.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Hot sauce in my bag?  What?</p><p>CLINTON:  Hot sauce.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Really?</p><p>CLINTON:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Now, listen, I'd want you to know people are going to see this and say, OK.  She's pandering to black people.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLINTON:  OK.  Is it working?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  She got a lot of heat for that.  What did you guys make of that exchange?  Because that kind of set the bar for stopping by to your show.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I mean, I said it to her in that moment, you know, this is one of those times when people are going to think that you're pandering the black people.</p><p>But she has said that she likes hot sauce in previous interviews decades earlier.  So maybe she wasn't pandering.</p><p>But the best part about that exchange was when she looked me in the eye and say --</p><p>YEE:  \"Is it working?\"</p><p>MCKELVEY:  \"Is it working?\"  That's a very honest response.</p><p>YEE:  You know, after that, I had to do some research myself and I did go back and see that she talk about it in various other outlets.  And she's been talking about it for years.  But most people won't do that research to see.  This is something real.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.  I don't know how much it worked because --</p><p>CASEY:  People still think that's pandering.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Well, no, she didn't win.</p><p>CASEY:  No, she didn't win.</p><p>YEE:  She did not -- well, technically.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  Well, that's in the history books.</p><p>Let me ask about the guy who did win.  How would you guys handle an interview with President Trump?</p><p>(LAUGHS)</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I don't think that'll go well.</p><p>CASEY:  I think that will go amazing, actually.  He would have to be honest.</p><p>YEE:  I don't think that he would be comfortable answering any questions from us.  I doubt that he would stay for a full interview with us.  Just because there's a lot of issues that I have with things that he says that had been problematic for us and our people.</p><p>Things that we hear that Michael Cohen is even coming forward and saying that he said in private to him, so.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I don't think he would come because I don't think he cares about our audience.  I mean, there's nothing about Donald Trump that makes me think he cares about black and brown people.</p><p>YEE:  There's a lot of hurtful things that he says.  Personally he had offended me.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  I mean, something that he talks about a lot is the low unemployment rate, historically low, for African-Americans and for the Hispanic community.  It is something he likes to talk about.  If he thought he had a platform with you guys, would he be welcome?</p><p>CASEY:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes, he definitely will be welcomed.  It's very important to know that started with Barack Obama.  It was the policies that Barack Obama implemented that caused the unemployment rate to be so low for African-Americans now and Donald Trump is taking credit for it.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, you know, he loves to joust.  He loves to fight.  He would love to debate that with you guys.  So he might actually come and stick around.  I think he might enjoy it.</p><p>YEE:  Let's have him come on.</p><p>BREAM:  He might --</p><p>CASEY:  I would love for him to come.</p><p>YEE:  Even when he gets asked questions at the White House with reporters.  He'll ban you if he doesn't like your questions, so.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.  And tell him pull up.  We'll get him -- we'll get him some fast food.  We'll get him some little White Castle sliders that fit his little hands.</p><p>CASEY:  Some McDonald's.  Some McDonald's too.</p><p>BREAM:  You know he loves the fast food.</p><p>OK.  So if he's listening tonight, because sometimes he does watch, go ahead and make your pitch to him.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I'm not --</p><p>CASEY:  We're not pitching it.</p><p>YEE:  I mean, we're not really excited.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  If he's smart, he will come up here.</p><p>CASEY:  If he wants to pull up -- he can pull up any time.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  It's not something that we want.  It's not something that we're requesting.  I'm not about to make no pitch.</p><p>CASEY:  No, we're not pitching for him.  But if he wants to come, he's invited.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  And there might be some snacks involved.</p><p>YEE:  He should face --</p><p>BREAM:  The Breakfast show.  World's most dangerous morning show.  Keep making news.  We'll keep watching.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.</p><p>BREAM:  Thank you, guys, very much.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Thank you very much.  Thank you for having us.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  The speaker says no-go to progressive plans to impeach the president.  The Mueller's special counsel reported isn't even in yet.  So, why is she taking plan b off the table?</p><p>Our power panel is here to weigh in.  They are standing by right there for you.  They're next.</p><p>Plus, the latest on the Boeing 737 Max crash.  Lawmakers calling for the aircraft to be grounded.  Will it affect your travel plans?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JOHN YARMUTH (D), KENTUCKY:  To me it's not a question of whether, it's a question of when and probably right now is not the right time but I think at some point it's going to be inevitable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  Reaction still coming in to Speaker Pelosi telling the Washington Post she is not for impeaching President Trump.  Time now for tonight's power panel, the President of Open Primaries, John Opdycke, the director of Strategic Communications for Trump 2020, Marc Lotter, and Fox News Contributor, former Utah Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz.  Welcome to all of you.</p><p>JOHN OPDYCKE, PRESIDENT, OPEN PRIMARIES:  Good evening.</p><p>MARC LOTTER, DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS FOR TRUMP 2020:  Hi, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  So just to remind, folks, this is the quote from Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker.  She says impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country and he's just not worth it.  Marc?</p><p>LOTTER:  What took her so long?  It's been two years, 300,000 documents, hundreds of hours of interviews, and she's come to the same conclusion that President Trump said day one.  No collusion.  So I'm surprised that it took her that long to get there.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  I want to read something from Politico today, it says, Dems have started the years of impeachment.  Can they still turn back?  It says interviews with more than a dozen key Democratic lawmakers revealed deep division within the caucus about whether their efforts could end up helping Trump win a second term in office.  John, we've heard that from a lot of folks who worry that it will just mobilize his base.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Yes.  I don't agree with Speaker Pelosi on much but I take her side on this.  I think that moving in the impeachment direction will be a real disservice to the rich, robust political conversation that's taking place in the country right now.  On a whole range of issues from Green New Deal, to Medicare for All, to immigration and so forth.  And I think in some ways, the American people are deeply distrustful of Congress.</p><p>And to take this decision about who the next President is going to be out of the hands of the American people and put it in the hand of an institution the people don't have a lot of trust in right now, I think it's the wrong direction to go.  I agree with Speaker Pelosi.  Leave it up to the people.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Tom Steyer who is a billionaire, who has talked a lot about the political game.  He's not running this time but he's supporting lot of other causes and folks and he has been all about impeachment from day one.  He says this, he says Speaker Pelosi thinks he's just not worth it, well, is defending our legal system worth it?  Is holding the President accountable for his crimes and cover ups worth it?</p><p>Is doing what's right worth it or shall America just stop fighting for our principles and so what's politically convenient, Jason?</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I think Speaker Pelosi was right, other than the last part of the phrase that she offered there but our founders put up an exceptionally high bar.  If she had an inkling, if she had some evidence, I think she would go for it.  I think it's an admission that she doesn't have that evidence but she has a problem with their caucus because she's got 60 or so people that have already signed up for impeachment.</p><p>They've been promising this from the day Donald Trump was sworn in.  The problem for the Democrats is they just don't have any evidence, and they don't have any facts to actually back something up and make the case because it would be a loser and the country knows that and she is smart enough to recognize that.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, you know the committees that are coordinating in the 81 letters that went out last week looking into any number of things, from the Trump organization, to family members, to Russia, to everything else even though the special counsel were still waiting on that formal proceeding to close out.  So it's clear that they're casting a net to look for some things.  Aaron Blake at the Washington Post writes after the news of Speaker Pelosi today, he says, Pelosi's ability to tamp down impeachment fever could be one of the most significant battles of her speakership and these new comments are a line in the sand.</p><p>I mean, Marc, we're hearing a number of Democrats out tonight and saying or in recent days saying they still think and you hear Congressman Yarmuth, it's just a matter of time.</p><p>LOTTER:  Yes.  I mean, the number of investigations they're launching completely egregious but when you look at what were actually getting to and this is another bad week that is showing the Democrat Party is breaking apart right in front of our very eyes.  I don't see where any of the 2020 Democratic candidates are out there rallying the base and inspiring their liberal donors with no impeachment.  The radicals have taken over.</p><p>That's who controls their party right now and I am going to be very interested to see how their Presidential candidates try to balance what Speaker Pelosi is saying with the realities on the ground and trying to win in a very polarized, very radical party.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  We're just getting in some news here, the New York Attorney General and we know that the President is facing a lot of trouble at the state level with the southern district of New York.  Actually a Federal but they're in New York -- but there are -- the state A.G. has made a lot of noise too about conducting some investigations.  The attorney general's office in New York late Monday issuing subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank for records relating to the financing of four major Trump organization projects at a failed effort to buy the buffalo bills of the National Football League.</p><p>John, what do you make about that?  I mean, it seems like the President, it's going to be a long time before all these various investigations for multiple agencies are ever wrapped up.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Yes, and everybody knows that President Trump is a ruffian.  That is beyond dispute.  I think the tactical question, the political question that the Democrats have to take seriously is why not allow the people of this country to weigh in on that question?  Why do you want to shortchange that with politically motivated investigations that even if they're correct, set up a situation that furthers the divisions in this country.</p><p>And frankly hold the Democrats back from pushing a lot of the issues that they're having a lot of traction with right now.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  And Jason, it seems like there is this internal split about some of these really big issues.  We saw last week that it took them a week to put together the resolution that ended up condemning not only anti-Semitism but Islamophobia and white supremacy and all kinds of things.  We thought it was ready for the floor then it's back then they're fighting again and now we understand that there is -- this internal split.</p><p>And some of it has gone public about this issue of impeachment but the Speaker also said that \"the party is unified.\"</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I don't think so.  I think the Democrats are an absolute chaos.  I mean, think about it.  Bernie Sanders is the leader of the Democratic Party.  He's not a member of the Democratic Party.  He is registered as an Independent and really a socialist, so the leader of the Presidential candidates isn't even a member of their own party.  And then they can't decide whether or not they hate the Jewish people are not and how are they going to actually articulate that in a pace, in a resolution instead of calling out the actual individual.</p><p>I don't think that all the -- all the Democrats hate Jews but you do have some that need to be called out specifically.  The way Republicans did, like I did, with Mr. King when he stepped over the line.  So again, it's a -- it's a -- it's a campaign that's in chaos, a party that can't define itself.  And they're totally off message.  And they have to explain to the American people why they think these socialist views are the right solution for America because America is not buying it.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Senator Elizabeth Warren is officially in the race said this weekend it is wrong to call her socialist.  She doesn't support that.  But we're going to talk more about and coming up how she's also wants to go after some big tech companies and break them up, so there's a lot there to digest.  Power panel, thank you.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Just to say one thing in response to Congressman Chaffetz is that you say the American people are buying these things, I think the American people are deeply interested in having an honest conversation about many of the issues that progressives and socialists like Bernie Sanders and AOC are putting on the table.  It doesn't mean they agree with them on everything but they want to talk about these things.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, to leave it there.  The keyword --</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Oh, I would love to talk about those issues.</p><p>BREAM:  The keyword is honest --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Bring it on.  Bring it on.  You will drive the Democratic Party into the grave.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  I think the key there is honest and we can talk -- keep it factual.  I think that it's important for the American people.  They do want to talk about these things.  But in the meantime, thank you gentlemen.  Come back soon.</p><p>LOTTER:  Thank you.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Coming up, caught in the act, dramatic surveillance footage of a transsexual woman accused of pepper spray attacks all across New York.  We'll tell you what that's about.  And Liz Warren breaking ranks with socialist Democrats but also vowing to take on big tech.  We told you about that.  She's proposing to break up some giant social media companies.  Trace on the case.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WARREN:  The giant tech companies right now are eating up little tiny businesses, start-ups, and competing unfairly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  A transgender woman has been arrested in New York.  Police say, she might be behind a series of pepper spray attacks in Upper Manhattan.  One couple says, the attacker allegedly approached them on the street, asked the woman if she was white, and then pepper sprayed her.  The man tried to intervene, the attacker pulled out a knife, he says.  Authorities say, 11 people were attacked over the weekend in suspected hate crimes.</p><p>We're awaiting information from the Black Box of the Ethiopian Airlines plane, the Boeing 737 Max 8 that crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all 157 people aboard, including at least eight Americans.  The FAA says that planes are still air-worthy after two fatal crashes in less than six months.  Correspondent Doug McKelway has the latest.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  At the United Nations today, a flag at half-staff, an honor of the 157 people killed, 21 of them U.N. staffers in Sunday's crash of an Ethiopian Airlines, Boeing 737.</p><p>ABBY AHMED, ETHIOPIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  As we all know Ethiopian Airlines is a well-known airline that has not experienced such accidents for a long time.</p><p>MCKELWAY:  It was the second Boeing 737 Max 8 to crash in the last five months.  In the first, the like Lion Air Max 8 plane dove vertically into the sea, killing all 189 on board.  In both cases, radar data showed there were similar violent oscillations, pitching up and down, before the planes crashed.  But in the Lion Air case, there were other problems.  That plane had maintenance issues with airspeed, altimeter and other gauges.  The Max 8 is the latest generation Boeing's 737 with more power, more fuel-efficient engines.  The bigger engines necessitated the redesign of the plane's trim controls.  When the two trim control switches are turned off, and the plane is powered up, it causes a different reaction than in earlier models.</p><p>JOHN GOGLIA, FORMER NTSB INVESTIGATOR:  When you apply full power to the airplane, it's going to drive the nose up.  So, what Boeing did to counter that is they automated it.</p><p>MCKELWAY:  But if the trim switch is turned off or malfunctioning, a poorly trained pilot might have problems.  Over correcting for the nose up with a pitch down.  It can produce what's called pilot induced oscillation, as seen in this 1978 NASA video.  The first officer in the Ethiopian air crash had 200 hours of flying time, compared to a minimum of 1500 hours for U.S. first officers.</p><p>The flight and voice data recorders have been recovered.  Ethiopian, Cayman Airways, and China have all grounded the Max 8, but neither the Boeing, the FAA nor Domestic Carriers United, American, or Southwest have.  In December Boeing took a risk amid the ongoing trade war, opening a finishing facility in China, the world's largest growing airplane market.  The first plane to roll out of that facility was a 737 Max 8.  Shannon?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM:  Doug McKelway, thank you very much.  Two progressives, two different views, of what to do about big technology.  Well, Senator Elizabeth Warren wants to better regulate big tech, Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez see's technology as a means to a post-capitalist end.  Trace is on the case from our L.A. Newsroom.  Trace.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Shannon.  Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren is well-aware that her views often draw comparisons to her Senate colleague Bernie Sanders, but Warren wants to make it clear unlike Sanders she's not a Democratic socialist.  She supports capitalism, albeit with the right regulations.  And in the process of building her campaign and defining her positions, the Massachusetts senator has laid out her plan to break up big technology -- a goal she shares with President Trump.  For example, Warren would require regulators to go after massive mergers like Amazon buying Whole Foods and Facebook's ownership of Instagram.  Watch.</p><p>WARREN:  We want to keep that market place competitive, not let a giant who has an incredible information advantage, and a manipulative advantage, be able to snuff you out.</p><p>GALLAGHER:  Oddly, today, Facebook took down a number of Warren's campaign ads saying she misused its company logo.  Warren responded by citing Facebook's power to shut down debate.  The ads have now been restored.  Then, there's Democratic freshman Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who doesn't seem nearly as worried about big technology expanding or the rise of workplace robots.  In fact, Ocasio-Cortez says, Americans should be excited to have their jobs automated, quoting: \"The reason we're not excited by it is because we live in a society where if you don't have a job, you are left to die.  And that is, at its core, our problem.\"  She points out that not having a job gives you more time.</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), NEW YORK:  We should be excited about automation because what it could potentially mean is more time educating ourselves, more time creating art, more time investing and investigating in the sciences, more time focused on invention, more time going to space, more time enjoying the world that we live in.</p><p>GALLAGHER:  In case you're wondering, the 29-year-old Ocasio-Cortez drew bigger crowds at South by Southwest than any other presidential candidates.  Shannon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM:  All right, Trace Gallagher, thank you very much.  There is a new face of terror.  Hamza bin Laden, the son of Osama bin Laden, has a giant bounty now on his head.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  As released audio and video messages on the Internet, calling on his followers to want to attack against the United States and its western allies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  So, will the man who killed Osama bin Laden, his father, Rob O'Neill, take a shot at finding his son?  Rob joins us live to tell us what he thinks, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  Terror has a new face and he wants revenge on America.  Officials are warning that Osama bin Laden's son is actively engaging in terrorism and is emerging as the leader of al-Qaeda.  The State Department is offering a million-dollar reward for information on Hamza bin Laden's whereabouts, so let's talk to the guy who killed his dad, Osama bin Laden, former Navy SEAL Rob O'Neill.  Good to have you with us again, Rob.</p><p>ROB O'NEILL, FORMER NAVY SEAL:  Thank you, Shannon, for having me.  I appreciate it.</p><p>BREAM:  It may have been in jest, but we've got to put up on Twitter, there was a group that reached out to you and said, you know, we're assembling crew to go claim the $1 million bounty, are you in?  You say maybe not legitimately, but you do think it's a worthy mission at this point.</p><p>O'NEILL:  This is definitely a worthy mission, just to continue to prove that if terror rears its ugly head, we have men and women who are willing to go do it.  You know, on a serious note, I would do everything asked of me to do, but we have younger, more seasoned guys that are out there right now.  Some guys that were on the actual raid -- I don't know if we would risk that kind of a cross-border type thing that we did with Osama bin Laden, but something along the lines of the good men and women from the three letter agencies that find some intel on where he is and hit him with a drone strike.  I think that Hamza bin Laden, at least, is smart enough to know that gets too cute and too cocky, he's going to stick his head out and he's going to get gotten.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, apparently, he has reached out and started to make some noise over the last couple of years.  He obviously is.  We've talked about it.  I mean, there are a number of his family members who have been taken out of this al-Qaeda fight and he's got a lot of skin in the game, as you've said.  John Gambrell back in March, he says this, talking about Hamza bin Laden, began appearing in militant videos back as far as 2015.  And he said this apparently, if you think that your sinful crime that you committed in Abbottabad has passed without punishment, then you thought wrong.\"</p><p>O'NEILL:  Right, and the way that Hamza thinks, because of his brand of Islam that he follows, they're not going to worship of false idols, so it's not going to be revenge for the death of his father and his brother, and his other brother before them.  It would be more to avenge the deaths of the defenders of Islam, as they call it.  You know, because they're obviously very religious, in their own psychotic version of Islam.  Yes, he's making it apparent that he's there and he remembers what happened and what's been going on.</p><p>And he thinks that we've oppressed everyone in Iraq, and in Iran, and in Pakistan and all that stuff.  Al-Qaeda -- they're just on a strategic pause right now.  This isn't an end.  And they're going to sit there -- and like I've always said, ISIS loved the big headline and they stab in the front.  Al-Qaeda is going to wait around and stab you in the back.  They hit New York in 2003, tried to knock down the Trade Towers; and they didn't forget, they came back in 2001 and succeeded.  So, you can't get complacent with these guys, because complacency will get you killed.</p><p>BREAM:  What do you make of the price tag?  Is it enough in the scenario to get people to turn him in?</p><p>O'NEILL:  I mean, it could be but he is surrounded by some hardliners -- everyone, Taliban, and al-Qaeda guys are all around him.  It's going to take a little bit of money for an outsider to sort of see in, especially considering what happened with the doctor in Abbottabad, Pakistan that sort of helped us try to locate Osama bin Laden.  You know, he's not in a good place right now.  And it's going to take five or 10 million which wouldn't be much for us.  It worked with a lot of the Ba'ath party and (INAUDIBLE) Hussein in Iraq.  It could work here again, but like, al-Qaeda is a lot more -- they're a lot more loyal to each other than the Ba'ath party was.</p><p>BREAM:  Well -- and very quickly, we just have a few seconds, do you think he's probably in Pakistan?</p><p>O'NEILL:  I would say pretty much in Pakistan.  Yes, probably, in Pakistan or at least in the tribal regions where there's not a lot of law and they kind of protect him there.  And weirdly enough, he's been cooperating with the Iranians.  I believe he was pretty much raised in Iran under the cover of Iran, because that government can, even with the travel ban, probably help him travel certain places.  So, it is scary, but he's in the area.  I'm thinking right near (INAUDIBLE) of Pakistan.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, as you said, and others have noted, don't mistake their pause for inactivity.  They saying, you know, experts very much that they have the ability and the intent to come after the U.S. again.</p><p>O'NEILL:  Oh, they definitely have the intent.  That's what happens when you raise people from the time, they're infants to the time, the like, Hamza -- they're in their 30s, just to hate people because they don't believe what you believe.  You get this kind of stuff.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, Rob O'Neill, always great to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>O'NEILL:  Thanks, Shannon.  I appreciate it.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, the Supreme Court made it clear, public employees can no longer be forced to pay dues to a union they don't support.  But five California public school teachers say, that is exactly what's happening to them and now, they are suing.  We'll hear from their lawyer, we're going to debate both sides.  Plus, the president joins the daylight savings time debate, should it stay or should it go?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  On the heels of six-day teachers strike in California, five teachers are now suing the state's top union over collecting dues through mandatory paycheck deductions.  A practice that the Supreme Court calls on unconstitutional less than a year ago.  All right, let's bring in former Aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, Chris Hahn; and the lawyer representing the teachers, you recognize her, Harmeet Dhillon.  Thank you both for joining us.</p><p>HARMEET DHILLION, LAWYER:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>CHRIS HAHN, FORMER AIDE TO SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER:  Thanks for having us.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Harmeet, I just want you to clarify because Justice Alito was very clear.  He said this, in the decision last year, we conclude that this arrangement violates the free-speech rights of nonmembers by compelling them to subsidize private speech on matters of substantial public concern, and he said, unless these people affirmatively consent to giving the money, the unions can't take it.  Are you claiming that's what happening in California?</p><p>DHILLON:  Exactly what's happening.  So, our five clients working in conjunction with the freedom foundation, which has filed this type of lawsuit in other West Coast states as well, are claiming that they have opted out of their union card contracts.  And despite having opted out, the union is not letting them out until the anniversary of their one-year contract.  So, every pay period that their paychecks are being deducted, significant money in the case of the lead plaintiff, Bethany Mendez, $1500 a year on a pretty meager teacher's salary, a constitutional violation is occurring.  And so, the Supreme Court was very clear that you cannot take this money unless there is a knowing and voluntary waiver of the First Amendment.  And so, none of these teachers have made a voluntary waiver of the First Amendment rights.</p><p>BREAM:  So, Chris, even if you didn't like the ruling from the Supreme Court, it was a tight 15-4 last year.  Why shouldn't these teachers have the right to put their foot down over this?</p><p>HAHN:  Well, they are.  They signed a contract and they agreed to have these dues taken out.  I always wonder where you find teachers who are willing to go against their own interests and fight their union which basically gives them a much better salary, much better benefits and much better working conditions than they would've gotten on their own, especially given the market where there are thousands of teachers coming out of colleges every single day for every single opening.  These unions actually strengthen teachers and give them a better life at a fraction for what they are paying for these unions.  So, I am shocked that these people are willing to be used this way.  I hope that the kids that they teach are learning something because, god, these people don't seem to have learned much when they were in college.</p><p>DHILLON: Wow!</p><p>BREAM:  But Chris, you know, like the plaintiffs in a couple of these big cases, before the Supreme Court have said, they're going out on -- and supporting political candidates and messages with my dues money that I 100 percent disagree with, and they don't feel like they should have to subsidize that speech.  Does that make them terrible people?</p><p>HAHN:  You know, it's funny.  It's a slippery slope and, you know, when -- you know, we all pay for things we don't want going to support things we don't like.  For example, I'd buy gasoline every day.  Do I have a right to determine what we're going to -- what the gasoline company is going to do with the money I spend on it?  You know, it's a very slippery slope.  The Supreme Court got it wrong and it will be overturned when we get some reasonable members on that court.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  Harmeet, the California Teachers Association, by the way, very brave statement, only responding this way, saying: \"It's another lawsuit from the Freedom Foundation to continue the attack on public education and public employees.\"  Harmeet?</p><p>DHILLION:  So, Chris just called these teachers stupid and said that their students are going to learn nothing, and he also ignore the fact that this is a constitutional violation.  That's the difference between your gas analogy and what's going on here.  And if you think about it in terms of a term that choice -- that the left loves which is freedom of choice, that's what these teachers are really looking for here.  They're looking for the choice to be part of a union or not.  And by the way, the sky doesn't fall when people aren't part of a union.  Chris, as you know in the federal system, people are --</p><p>HAHN:  They can opt out at the end of their contract.  They opted in and now they're opting out.</p><p>DHILLON:  Please don't interrupt me, Chris, I didn't interrupt you.  In the federal system, people do not -- people are not required to be part of the union and the unions go on just fine.  And so, no, when you have a constitutional right, it is not sufficient to you can opt out when we tell you can.  After they opted out, Shannon, union sent thugs into the classroom to try to intimidate them into revoking their opt out.</p><p>HAHN:  Stop.  Thugs.  Kindergarten teachers.</p><p>DHILLON:  And so, this is not acceptable.  And it is time for the state of California to follow the constitution as the Supreme Court says.</p><p>BREAM:  Chris, you don't think that's OK, coercion, do you, Chris?</p><p>HAHN:  No, of course not.  But I also don't think that these teachers who are her clients understand how much they're being used by extreme right-wing groups that just want to break unions all over the country.</p><p>DHILLION:  Yes, they're so dumb and you know better.</p><p>HANH:  Well, look, they are clearly unaware of how they're being used, you know.  So, it is a shame and I feel bad for them, because they're going to learn very soon if they their union does collapse, what their salaries would be in a free market, and it won't be good for them.</p><p>DHILLON:  I think they're going to be just fine without all the coerced speech.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes, a lot of people felt after the ruling last year that there would be a big threat to the unions falling apart, that kind of thing.  We haven't seen that yet.  So, we'll see and we'll watch this case and see who is right in their predictions.</p><p>HAHN:  Not for trying of these groups, though, that's for sure.</p><p>BREAM:  Chris and Harmeet, thank you both.  Good to see you.</p><p>DHILLON:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>HAHN:  Thank you, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, coming up, is New York Mayor Bill de Blasio losing the forest for the trees, as the mayor tells kids to have meatless Mondays?  Economists are warning the city is about to head into a financial crisis.  That stories are in our \"REAL NEWS ROUND UP\", next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  Well, a woman gets booted from a hearing on gun control after apparently texting about going on a shooting spree of her own.  That story tops tonight's \"REAL NEWS ROUNDUP.\"  The unidentified woman was ejected from a Connecticut State Senate hearing after she was reportedly spotted sending a text saying: if she had a gun, she'd \"blow away a Republican state lawmaker and a large group of NRAs.\"  Connecticut capital police determined there was no threat.  The woman was not arrested.</p><p>New York City implementing meatless Mondays in public schools, a move supporter say, promotes healthy, environmentally friendly meal options.  The mayor says, cutting back on a little meat will help down on greenhouse gases and help save the planet.  Meanwhile, some top economists are warning the city needs to focus instead on its financial health.  One saying, New York is already in a difficult financial spot, but it would be in an impossible situation if we had any kind of setbacks.</p><p>President Trump lending support to do the push to do away with Daylight Savings Times.  Arizona and Hawaii are the only states that do not observe the time change.  The president tweeting today: \"Making Daylight Savings Time permanent is OK with me.\"</p><p>And the Supreme Court agreeing to hear the case of Eric (INAUDIBLE), who were denied a trademark for their line of street clothes by the Patent and Trademark Office because their brand is a variation of the F-word.  That denial is based on an old federal law that requires the rejection of trademarks that are scandalous or immoral.</p><p>All right.  Time now for our \"MIDNIGHT HERO\".  94-year-old, Mary Bochanis, was the longest-serving American Red Cross volunteer.  She started volunteering in 1943 when she met her husband, Gus, and she never stopped volunteering.  After her husband died in 2006, she just started volunteering more, she says.  A Red Cross volunteer for 76 years.</p><p>Mary Bochanis died Thursday.  She leaves behind an amazing legacy.  So, she is our \"MIDNIGHT HERO\" tonight.  Thank you for all those years of service to so many people.  Most-watched, most trusted, and most grateful you spent your evening with us.  Good night from Washington.  I'm Shannon Bream.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2190201341</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9V-1SM1-JBHT-D3B3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8024\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

We've known for some time that the Democratic leadership has been wary of this rush to impeach from members of their own caucus.</p><p>But now, Speaker Pelosi has finally come out and publicly said that she is not for impeachment.  In an interview just released by the Washington Post,\" she says quote, \"Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country, and he's just not worth it.\"</p><p>Democratic congressman, Adam Schiff, is backing up Speaker Pelosi by saying tonight that only graphic evidence would warrant an impeachment gamble against President Trump.</p><p>But that line of thinking will put the Democratic leadership at odds with many members of their own party, including Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib who's already said that she's planning to introduce articles of impeachment against President Trump by the end of this month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D), MICHIGAN:  If we don't hold impeachment proceedings today, start them today, and hold him accountable to following the United States constitution.  Think about that.  This is not going to be the last CEO that runs for president of the United States.  This is not going to be the last person that tries to get away with this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FISHER:  So President Trump and Speaker Pelosi may finally agree on one thing.  No impeachment.  But they still disagree on most everything else, especially the new budget proposal put forward by the White House today.</p><p>Pelosi called it cruel and shortsighted.  She said, quote, \"The cruel and shortsighted cuts in President Trump's budget request are a roadmap to a sicker, weaker America.  House Democrats will reject this toxic, destructive, budget request which would hollow out our national strength and failed to meet the needs of the American people.\"</p><p>The White House says that this budget proposal is aimed at keeping Americans safe by increasing defense spending and including more than $8 billion for the border wall.  But it's also slashing funding for many domestic programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSS VOUGHT, ACTING DIRECTOR, OMB:  Washington has a spending problem and it endangers the future prosperity of our nation for generations to come.  This budget contains nearly $2.7 trillion in savings, more spending reductions proposed than any administration in history.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FISHER:  But even with those savings, this budget proposal would still push the federal deficit past $1 trillion.  The White House is asking for a huge number for fiscal year 2020, a record $4.7 trillion.</p><p>It's a big number, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  It is.  And they've got to answer some questions about that.</p><p>FISHER:  And it's just a proposal.  Not --</p><p>BREAM:  yes.</p><p>FISHER:  Just a blueprint.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  And we remember seeing President Obama's proposals voted down like 99 to nothing.  So we know that the president's proposal is just a place for Congress to start.</p><p>FISHER:  Just a place to start.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Thank you.</p><p>FISHER:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Wisconsin Republicans say they are not surprised the Democratic Party picked Milwaukee for next year's National Convention because of the city's strong ties they say to socialism.</p><p>Correspondent David Spunt has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOM BARRETT (D), MAYOR OF MILWAUKEE:  I want to welcome to Milwaukee the 2020 Democratic National Convention.</p><p>DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  On a cold Milwaukee afternoon, it became clear July 2020 will be hot.</p><p>TOM PEREZ, CHAIRMAN, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE:  Our democracies on fire.  It's a five alarm blaze and we have first responders in this room and elsewhere prepared to take back our democracy.</p><p>SPUNT:  Milwaukee beat out Houston and Miami for the DNC bid, and it's the only major city that counts three socialist mayors in its history.  The Wisconsin Republican Party put out a statement, quote, \"No city in America has stronger ties to socialism than Milwaukee.  And with the rise of Bernie Sanders and the embrace of socialism by its newest leaders, the American left has come full circle.\"  End quote.</p><p>Speaking of Sanders, he's number two on a new national international Monmouth University poll which tested 20 different candidates.  Sanders has been a proud Democratic socialist for decades and he's three percent behind former vice president, Joe Biden, who has yet to announce a run.</p><p>Sanders is at the top of the pack in a recent Emerson Poll focusing on New Hampshire.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT:  In 2016, this is where the political revolution took off.  Thank you, New Hampshire.</p><p>SPUNT:  Whether or not a candidate is a socialist is now a key question, a question that some candidates dismissed.</p><p>GOV. JOHN HICKENLOOPER (D-CO), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Once you get back into these labels, am I a capitalist, am I a socialist?  How much of -- how much of a capitalist am I versus how much of a socialist?  It becomes kind of silly, doesn't it?</p><p>SPUNT:  While others distanced themselves completely from the socialist label.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS:  Bernie has to speak to what Democratic socialism is.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And you are not one.</p><p>WARREN:  And I'm not.</p><p>HOWARD SCHULTZ, FORMER CHAIRMAN AND CEO, STARBUCKS:  We don't want a government takeover of our lives.</p><p>SPUNT:  Independent, Howard Schultz, thought he got a negative reaction from the crowd when he talked socialism.</p><p>SCHULTZ:  If you want a good description for socialism, I think just look at Venezuela.  It's a -- you don't like that?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SPUNT:  Howard Schultz said he'll make up his mind about a run by the summer.  He brushes off any criticism that he could hurt the Democrats chance to win the White House.  The convention in Wisconsin, Shannon, a state President Trump won in 2016.</p><p>BREAM:  I'm a -- Schultz will continue causing a lot of heartburn for folks out there, waiting for that decision.  David, thank you.</p><p>All right.  They featured interviews with the nation's most prominent hip-hop stars and celebrities.  But now, the popular radio show is also a must-stop media spot for 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.  Senators Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Cory Booker among others have all stopped in.</p><p>Joining me now from the nationally syndicated radio show, the Breakfast Club on Power 105.1 in New York City.  DJ Envy, Angela Yee, and Charlamagne tha God.  Welcome to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT.  Great to have you, guys.</p><p>RAASHAUN CASEY, AMERICAN DISC JOCKEY:  Hey, thanks for having us.</p><p>ANGELA YEE, AMERICAN RADIO PERSONALITY:  Hi, Shannon.</p><p>LENARD LARRY MCKELVEY, AMERICAN RADIO PRESENTER:  What's happening?</p><p>BREAM:  Listen, I got to read something from the Daily Beast.  This how they describe you, saying, \"The world's most dangerous morning show.  Charlamagne tha God and his co-host DJ Envy and Angela Yee conduct lengthy interviews with politicians in which the cultural weight of the show and the informality of its interviews often force media train presidential hopeful to let down their guard and get more personal.\"</p><p>Angela, I know you said people are in danger if they come and try to act cool and it's not real.  How does that go?</p><p>YEE:  Well, I think part of the issue is that we're not political pundits.  So people come on the show and they're used to talking about things like their policies and things that are very rehearsed.</p><p>But when you come on the Breakfast Club, we might ask you about anything.  And I think for people, they also want to answer for our audience.  So they might say things to make them sound like more hip than normal.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, and you know, Senator Kamala Harris --</p><p>CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD:  You know --</p><p>BREAM:  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  No.  I was going to say, you know, when you talk to a politician, they've got a talking point for everything, especially when you talk to them about politics.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes, that's the truth.  We find that out every time we have one on.</p><p>Senator Kamala Harris who has gotten a lot of attention, very popular, pulling near the top, even though -- away from the first cluster, but she's definitely in the mix.</p><p>I want to play something that she talked about with you guys that got a lot of attention.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D), CALIFORNIA:  I am absolutely in favor of legalizing marijuana.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Have ever smoked?</p><p>HARRIS:  I have.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  OK.  In college or --</p><p>HARRIS:  And I inhaled.  I did -- I did inhale.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  What were you listening to when you were high?</p><p>CASEY:  What was on?  What song was it?  Was it Snoop?</p><p>HARRIS:  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, yes, definitely Snoop.  Tupac, for sure.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  I mean, guys, that was a big moment.  You just keep making national news with these interviews.</p><p>CASEY:  That question was a little crazy because I asked her what she listened to and my cohost over here was still on the weed question.  And it got a little blurry.  But she was talking about what she listen to.  She says she listened Tupac.  She listened to Snoop and it kind of got blurred with Charlamagne's weed question.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Fox News, you did that.  You all took that out of context.  You all started that.</p><p>BREAM:  I will tell you, it wasn't me.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  You all did that.</p><p>BREAM:  But I can always double-check on that.</p><p>Who do you guys want who hasn't stopped by yet?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I mean, the interesting thing is not like we sit around and we send out these requests for different people.  It's just like whoever wants to come.  We have a platform.  2020 is wide open.  A lot of people are looking to see who they want to vote for in 2020.</p><p>So we're interested in anybody who's running, who wants to get the word out.</p><p>YEE:  I wouldn't mind to have Elizabeth Warren on.  I think she'd be --</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Elizabeth Warren would be great.</p><p>CASEY:  Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>CASEY:  Anybody on both sides though.  Democratic, Republican.  It doesn't matter.  We would love to talk to anybody.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  And I like Julian Castro.  I saw him make a very great statement today when he came to reparations.  So I would love to have him on.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  I mean, that's something that you've talked about with Bernie -- Senator Bernie Sanders.  I mean, he is in the top one or two slots in almost all of the new polls.  It's him and the former vice president and who's not technically in.</p><p>What did you make of Bernie's answer on that?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Oh, I didn't like his answer at all because it seemed to be something he wasn't considering or it's just something he wants to -- he wants some type of form of reparations.  Well, he seemed like he wasn't for the reparations thing at all.</p><p>CASEY:  Kind of avoiding the question a little bit.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.</p><p>YEE:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I wasn't digging his answers.</p><p>YEE:  I think it's important to have solutions.  Like to see if there's an issue that we have, so here are some solutions, here are some possibilities of how we can make that happen instead of dodging a question.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Absolutely.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, and Hillary Clinton back in 2016, she made a lot of news for this exchange when she was on your show.  We want to play.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>YEE:  What's something that you always carry with you?</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES:  Hot sauce.</p><p>CASEY:  Really?</p><p>CLINTON:  Yes.</p><p>CASEY:  Really?</p><p>MCKELVEY:  You're giving information right now?</p><p>CASEY:  Hot sauce.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Hot sauce in my bag?  What?</p><p>CLINTON:  Hot sauce.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Really?</p><p>CLINTON:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Now, listen, I'd want you to know people are going to see this and say, OK.  She's pandering to black people.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CLINTON:  OK.  Is it working?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  She got a lot of heat for that.  What did you guys make of that exchange?  Because that kind of set the bar for stopping by to your show.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I mean, I said it to her in that moment, you know, this is one of those times when people are going to think that you're pandering the black people.</p><p>But she has said that she likes hot sauce in previous interviews decades earlier.  So maybe she wasn't pandering.</p><p>But the best part about that exchange was when she looked me in the eye and say --</p><p>YEE:  \"Is it working?\"</p><p>MCKELVEY:  \"Is it working?\"  That's a very honest response.</p><p>YEE:  You know, after that, I had to do some research myself and I did go back and see that she talk about it in various other outlets.  And she's been talking about it for years.  But most people won't do that research to see.  This is something real.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.  I don't know how much it worked because --</p><p>CASEY:  People still think that's pandering.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Well, no, she didn't win.</p><p>CASEY:  No, she didn't win.</p><p>YEE:  She did not -- well, technically.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  Well, that's in the history books.</p><p>Let me ask about the guy who did win.  How would you guys handle an interview with President Trump?</p><p>(LAUGHS)</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I don't think that'll go well.</p><p>CASEY:  I think that will go amazing, actually.  He would have to be honest.</p><p>YEE:  I don't think that he would be comfortable answering any questions from us.  I doubt that he would stay for a full interview with us.  Just because there's a lot of issues that I have with things that he says that had been problematic for us and our people.</p><p>Things that we hear that Michael Cohen is even coming forward and saying that he said in private to him, so.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I don't think he would come because I don't think he cares about our audience.  I mean, there's nothing about Donald Trump that makes me think he cares about black and brown people.</p><p>YEE:  There's a lot of hurtful things that he says.  Personally he had offended me.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  I mean, something that he talks about a lot is the low unemployment rate, historically low, for African-Americans and for the Hispanic community.  It is something he likes to talk about.  If he thought he had a platform with you guys, would he be welcome?</p><p>CASEY:  Yes.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes, he definitely will be welcomed.  It's very important to know that started with Barack Obama.  It was the policies that Barack Obama implemented that caused the unemployment rate to be so low for African-Americans now and Donald Trump is taking credit for it.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, you know, he loves to joust.  He loves to fight.  He would love to debate that with you guys.  So he might actually come and stick around.  I think he might enjoy it.</p><p>YEE:  Let's have him come on.</p><p>BREAM:  He might --</p><p>CASEY:  I would love for him to come.</p><p>YEE:  Even when he gets asked questions at the White House with reporters.  He'll ban you if he doesn't like your questions, so.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.  And tell him pull up.  We'll get him -- we'll get him some fast food.  We'll get him some little White Castle sliders that fit his little hands.</p><p>CASEY:  Some McDonald's.  Some McDonald's too.</p><p>BREAM:  You know he loves the fast food.</p><p>OK.  So if he's listening tonight, because sometimes he does watch, go ahead and make your pitch to him.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  I'm not --</p><p>CASEY:  We're not pitching it.</p><p>YEE:  I mean, we're not really excited.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  If he's smart, he will come up here.</p><p>CASEY:  If he wants to pull up -- he can pull up any time.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  It's not something that we want.  It's not something that we're requesting.  I'm not about to make no pitch.</p><p>CASEY:  No, we're not pitching for him.  But if he wants to come, he's invited.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  And there might be some snacks involved.</p><p>YEE:  He should face --</p><p>BREAM:  The Breakfast show.  World's most dangerous morning show.  Keep making news.  We'll keep watching.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Yes.</p><p>BREAM:  Thank you, guys, very much.</p><p>MCKELVEY:  Thank you very much.  Thank you for having us.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  The speaker says no-go to progressive plans to impeach the president.  The Mueller's special counsel reported isn't even in yet.  So, why is she taking plan b off the table?</p><p>Our power panel is here to weigh in.  They are standing by right there for you.  They're next.</p><p>Plus, the latest on the Boeing 737 Max crash.  Lawmakers calling for the aircraft to be grounded.  Will it affect your travel plans?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JOHN YARMUTH (D), KENTUCKY:  To me it's not a question of whether, it's a question of when and probably right now is not the right time but I think at some point it's going to be inevitable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  Reaction still coming in to Speaker Pelosi telling the Washington Post she is not for impeaching President Trump.  Time now for tonight's power panel, the President of Open Primaries, John Opdycke, the director of Strategic Communications for Trump 2020, Marc Lotter, and Fox News Contributor, former Utah Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz.  Welcome to all of you.</p><p>JOHN OPDYCKE, PRESIDENT, OPEN PRIMARIES:  Good evening.</p><p>MARC LOTTER, DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS FOR TRUMP 2020:  Hi, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  So just to remind, folks, this is the quote from Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker.  She says impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because it divides the country and he's just not worth it.  Marc?</p><p>LOTTER:  What took her so long?  It's been two years, 300,000 documents, hundreds of hours of interviews, and she's come to the same conclusion that President Trump said day one.  No collusion.  So I'm surprised that it took her that long to get there.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  I want to read something from Politico today, it says, Dems have started the years of impeachment.  Can they still turn back?  It says interviews with more than a dozen key Democratic lawmakers revealed deep division within the caucus about whether their efforts could end up helping Trump win a second term in office.  John, we've heard that from a lot of folks who worry that it will just mobilize his base.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Yes.  I don't agree with Speaker Pelosi on much but I take her side on this.  I think that moving in the impeachment direction will be a real disservice to the rich, robust political conversation that's taking place in the country right now.  On a whole range of issues from Green New Deal, to Medicare for All, to immigration and so forth.  And I think in some ways, the American people are deeply distrustful of Congress.</p><p>And to take this decision about who the next President is going to be out of the hands of the American people and put it in the hand of an institution the people don't have a lot of trust in right now, I think it's the wrong direction to go.  I agree with Speaker Pelosi.  Leave it up to the people.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Tom Steyer who is a billionaire, who has talked a lot about the political game.  He's not running this time but he's supporting lot of other causes and folks and he has been all about impeachment from day one.  He says this, he says Speaker Pelosi thinks he's just not worth it, well, is defending our legal system worth it?  Is holding the President accountable for his crimes and cover ups worth it?</p><p>Is doing what's right worth it or shall America just stop fighting for our principles and so what's politically convenient, Jason?</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I think Speaker Pelosi was right, other than the last part of the phrase that she offered there but our founders put up an exceptionally high bar.  If she had an inkling, if she had some evidence, I think she would go for it.  I think it's an admission that she doesn't have that evidence but she has a problem with their caucus because she's got 60 or so people that have already signed up for impeachment.</p><p>They've been promising this from the day Donald Trump was sworn in.  The problem for the Democrats is they just don't have any evidence, and they don't have any facts to actually back something up and make the case because it would be a loser and the country knows that and she is smart enough to recognize that.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, you know the committees that are coordinating in the 81 letters that went out last week looking into any number of things, from the Trump organization, to family members, to Russia, to everything else even though the special counsel were still waiting on that formal proceeding to close out.  So it's clear that they're casting a net to look for some things.  Aaron Blake at the Washington Post writes after the news of Speaker Pelosi today, he says, Pelosi's ability to tamp down impeachment fever could be one of the most significant battles of her speakership and these new comments are a line in the sand.</p><p>I mean, Marc, we're hearing a number of Democrats out tonight and saying or in recent days saying they still think and you hear Congressman Yarmuth, it's just a matter of time.</p><p>LOTTER:  Yes.  I mean, the number of investigations they're launching completely egregious but when you look at what were actually getting to and this is another bad week that is showing the Democrat Party is breaking apart right in front of our very eyes.  I don't see where any of the 2020 Democratic candidates are out there rallying the base and inspiring their liberal donors with no impeachment.  The radicals have taken over.</p><p>That's who controls their party right now and I am going to be very interested to see how their Presidential candidates try to balance what Speaker Pelosi is saying with the realities on the ground and trying to win in a very polarized, very radical party.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  We're just getting in some news here, the New York Attorney General and we know that the President is facing a lot of trouble at the state level with the southern district of New York.  Actually a Federal but they're in New York -- but there are -- the state A.G. has made a lot of noise too about conducting some investigations.  The attorney general's office in New York late Monday issuing subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank for records relating to the financing of four major Trump organization projects at a failed effort to buy the buffalo bills of the National Football League.</p><p>John, what do you make about that?  I mean, it seems like the President, it's going to be a long time before all these various investigations for multiple agencies are ever wrapped up.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Yes, and everybody knows that President Trump is a ruffian.  That is beyond dispute.  I think the tactical question, the political question that the Democrats have to take seriously is why not allow the people of this country to weigh in on that question?  Why do you want to shortchange that with politically motivated investigations that even if they're correct, set up a situation that furthers the divisions in this country.</p><p>And frankly hold the Democrats back from pushing a lot of the issues that they're having a lot of traction with right now.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes.  And Jason, it seems like there is this internal split about some of these really big issues.  We saw last week that it took them a week to put together the resolution that ended up condemning not only anti-Semitism but Islamophobia and white supremacy and all kinds of things.  We thought it was ready for the floor then it's back then they're fighting again and now we understand that there is -- this internal split.</p><p>And some of it has gone public about this issue of impeachment but the Speaker also said that \"the party is unified.\"</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  I don't think so.  I think the Democrats are an absolute chaos.  I mean, think about it.  Bernie Sanders is the leader of the Democratic Party.  He's not a member of the Democratic Party.  He is registered as an Independent and really a socialist, so the leader of the Presidential candidates isn't even a member of their own party.  And then they can't decide whether or not they hate the Jewish people are not and how are they going to actually articulate that in a pace, in a resolution instead of calling out the actual individual.</p><p>I don't think that all the -- all the Democrats hate Jews but you do have some that need to be called out specifically.  The way Republicans did, like I did, with Mr. King when he stepped over the line.  So again, it's a -- it's a -- it's a campaign that's in chaos, a party that can't define itself.  And they're totally off message.  And they have to explain to the American people why they think these socialist views are the right solution for America because America is not buying it.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, Senator Elizabeth Warren is officially in the race said this weekend it is wrong to call her socialist.  She doesn't support that.  But we're going to talk more about and coming up how she's also wants to go after some big tech companies and break them up, so there's a lot there to digest.  Power panel, thank you.</p><p>OPDYCKE:  Just to say one thing in response to Congressman Chaffetz is that you say the American people are buying these things, I think the American people are deeply interested in having an honest conversation about many of the issues that progressives and socialists like Bernie Sanders and AOC are putting on the table.  It doesn't mean they agree with them on everything but they want to talk about these things.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, to leave it there.  The keyword --</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Oh, I would love to talk about those issues.</p><p>BREAM:  The keyword is honest --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHAFFETZ:  Bring it on.  Bring it on.  You will drive the Democratic Party into the grave.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  I think the key there is honest and we can talk -- keep it factual.  I think that it's important for the American people.  They do want to talk about these things.  But in the meantime, thank you gentlemen.  Come back soon.</p><p>LOTTER:  Thank you.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Coming up, caught in the act, dramatic surveillance footage of a transsexual woman accused of pepper spray attacks all across New York.  We'll tell you what that's about.  And Liz Warren breaking ranks with socialist Democrats but also vowing to take on big tech.  We told you about that.  She's proposing to break up some giant social media companies.  Trace on the case.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WARREN:  The giant tech companies right now are eating up little tiny businesses, start-ups, and competing unfairly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  A transgender woman has been arrested in New York.  Police say, she might be behind a series of pepper spray attacks in Upper Manhattan.  One couple says, the attacker allegedly approached them on the street, asked the woman if she was white, and then pepper sprayed her.  The man tried to intervene, the attacker pulled out a knife, he says.  Authorities say, 11 people were attacked over the weekend in suspected hate crimes.</p><p>We're awaiting information from the Black Box of the Ethiopian Airlines plane, the Boeing 737 Max 8 that crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all 157 people aboard, including at least eight Americans.  The FAA says that planes are still air-worthy after two fatal crashes in less than six months.  Correspondent Doug McKelway has the latest.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  At the United Nations today, a flag at half-staff, an honor of the 157 people killed, 21 of them U.N. staffers in Sunday's crash of an Ethiopian Airlines, Boeing 737.</p><p>ABBY AHMED, ETHIOPIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  As we all know Ethiopian Airlines is a well-known airline that has not experienced such accidents for a long time.</p><p>MCKELWAY:  It was the second Boeing 737 Max 8 to crash in the last five months.  In the first, the like Lion Air Max 8 plane dove vertically into the sea, killing all 189 on board.  In both cases, radar data showed there were similar violent oscillations, pitching up and down, before the planes crashed.  But in the Lion Air case, there were other problems.  That plane had maintenance issues with airspeed, altimeter and other gauges.  The Max 8 is the latest generation Boeing's 737 with more power, more fuel-efficient engines.  The bigger engines necessitated the redesign of the plane's trim controls.  When the two trim control switches are turned off, and the plane is powered up, it causes a different reaction than in earlier models.</p><p>JOHN GOGLIA, FORMER NTSB INVESTIGATOR:  When you apply full power to the airplane, it's going to drive the nose up.  So, what Boeing did to counter that is they automated it.</p><p>MCKELWAY:  But if the trim switch is turned off or malfunctioning, a poorly trained pilot might have problems.  Over correcting for the nose up with a pitch down.  It can produce what's called pilot induced oscillation, as seen in this 1978 NASA video.  The first officer in the Ethiopian air crash had 200 hours of flying time, compared to a minimum of 1500 hours for U.S. first officers.</p><p>The flight and voice data recorders have been recovered.  Ethiopian, Cayman Airways, and China have all grounded the Max 8, but neither the Boeing, the FAA nor Domestic Carriers United, American, or Southwest have.  In December Boeing took a risk amid the ongoing trade war, opening a finishing facility in China, the world's largest growing airplane market.  The first plane to roll out of that facility was a 737 Max 8.  Shannon?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM:  Doug McKelway, thank you very much.  Two progressives, two different views, of what to do about big technology.  Well, Senator Elizabeth Warren wants to better regulate big tech, Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez see's technology as a means to a post-capitalist end.  Trace is on the case from our L.A. Newsroom.  Trace.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good evening, Shannon.  Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren is well-aware that her views often draw comparisons to her Senate colleague Bernie Sanders, but Warren wants to make it clear unlike Sanders she's not a Democratic socialist.  She supports capitalism, albeit with the right regulations.  And in the process of building her campaign and defining her positions, the Massachusetts senator has laid out her plan to break up big technology -- a goal she shares with President Trump.  For example, Warren would require regulators to go after massive mergers like Amazon buying Whole Foods and Facebook's ownership of Instagram.  Watch.</p><p>WARREN:  We want to keep that market place competitive, not let a giant who has an incredible information advantage, and a manipulative advantage, be able to snuff you out.</p><p>GALLAGHER:  Oddly, today, Facebook took down a number of Warren's campaign ads saying she misused its company logo.  Warren responded by citing Facebook's power to shut down debate.  The ads have now been restored.  Then, there's Democratic freshman Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who doesn't seem nearly as worried about big technology expanding or the rise of workplace robots.  In fact, Ocasio-Cortez says, Americans should be excited to have their jobs automated, quoting: \"The reason we're not excited by it is because we live in a society where if you don't have a job, you are left to die.  And that is, at its core, our problem.\"  She points out that not having a job gives you more time.</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D), NEW YORK:  We should be excited about automation because what it could potentially mean is more time educating ourselves, more time creating art, more time investing and investigating in the sciences, more time focused on invention, more time going to space, more time enjoying the world that we live in.</p><p>GALLAGHER:  In case you're wondering, the 29-year-old Ocasio-Cortez drew bigger crowds at South by Southwest than any other presidential candidates.  Shannon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREAM:  All right, Trace Gallagher, thank you very much.  There is a new face of terror.  Hamza bin Laden, the son of Osama bin Laden, has a giant bounty now on his head.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  As released audio and video messages on the Internet, calling on his followers to want to attack against the United States and its western allies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  So, will the man who killed Osama bin Laden, his father, Rob O'Neill, take a shot at finding his son?  Rob joins us live to tell us what he thinks, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  Terror has a new face and he wants revenge on America.  Officials are warning that Osama bin Laden's son is actively engaging in terrorism and is emerging as the leader of al-Qaeda.  The State Department is offering a million-dollar reward for information on Hamza bin Laden's whereabouts, so let's talk to the guy who killed his dad, Osama bin Laden, former Navy SEAL Rob O'Neill.  Good to have you with us again, Rob.</p><p>ROB O'NEILL, FORMER NAVY SEAL:  Thank you, Shannon, for having me.  I appreciate it.</p><p>BREAM:  It may have been in jest, but we've got to put up on Twitter, there was a group that reached out to you and said, you know, we're assembling crew to go claim the $1 million bounty, are you in?  You say maybe not legitimately, but you do think it's a worthy mission at this point.</p><p>O'NEILL:  This is definitely a worthy mission, just to continue to prove that if terror rears its ugly head, we have men and women who are willing to go do it.  You know, on a serious note, I would do everything asked of me to do, but we have younger, more seasoned guys that are out there right now.  Some guys that were on the actual raid -- I don't know if we would risk that kind of a cross-border type thing that we did with Osama bin Laden, but something along the lines of the good men and women from the three letter agencies that find some intel on where he is and hit him with a drone strike.  I think that Hamza bin Laden, at least, is smart enough to know that gets too cute and too cocky, he's going to stick his head out and he's going to get gotten.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, apparently, he has reached out and started to make some noise over the last couple of years.  He obviously is.  We've talked about it.  I mean, there are a number of his family members who have been taken out of this al-Qaeda fight and he's got a lot of skin in the game, as you've said.  John Gambrell back in March, he says this, talking about Hamza bin Laden, began appearing in militant videos back as far as 2015.  And he said this apparently, if you think that your sinful crime that you committed in Abbottabad has passed without punishment, then you thought wrong.\"</p><p>O'NEILL:  Right, and the way that Hamza thinks, because of his brand of Islam that he follows, they're not going to worship of false idols, so it's not going to be revenge for the death of his father and his brother, and his other brother before them.  It would be more to avenge the deaths of the defenders of Islam, as they call it.  You know, because they're obviously very religious, in their own psychotic version of Islam.  Yes, he's making it apparent that he's there and he remembers what happened and what's been going on.</p><p>And he thinks that we've oppressed everyone in Iraq, and in Iran, and in Pakistan and all that stuff.  Al-Qaeda -- they're just on a strategic pause right now.  This isn't an end.  And they're going to sit there -- and like I've always said, ISIS loved the big headline and they stab in the front.  Al-Qaeda is going to wait around and stab you in the back.  They hit New York in 2003, tried to knock down the Trade Towers; and they didn't forget, they came back in 2001 and succeeded.  So, you can't get complacent with these guys, because complacency will get you killed.</p><p>BREAM:  What do you make of the price tag?  Is it enough in the scenario to get people to turn him in?</p><p>O'NEILL:  I mean, it could be but he is surrounded by some hardliners -- everyone, Taliban, and al-Qaeda guys are all around him.  It's going to take a little bit of money for an outsider to sort of see in, especially considering what happened with the doctor in Abbottabad, Pakistan that sort of helped us try to locate Osama bin Laden.  You know, he's not in a good place right now.  And it's going to take five or 10 million which wouldn't be much for us.  It worked with a lot of the Ba'ath party and (INAUDIBLE) Hussein in Iraq.  It could work here again, but like, al-Qaeda is a lot more -- they're a lot more loyal to each other than the Ba'ath party was.</p><p>BREAM:  Well -- and very quickly, we just have a few seconds, do you think he's probably in Pakistan?</p><p>O'NEILL:  I would say pretty much in Pakistan.  Yes, probably, in Pakistan or at least in the tribal regions where there's not a lot of law and they kind of protect him there.  And weirdly enough, he's been cooperating with the Iranians.  I believe he was pretty much raised in Iran under the cover of Iran, because that government can, even with the travel ban, probably help him travel certain places.  So, it is scary, but he's in the area.  I'm thinking right near (INAUDIBLE) of Pakistan.</p><p>BREAM:  Well, as you said, and others have noted, don't mistake their pause for inactivity.  They saying, you know, experts very much that they have the ability and the intent to come after the U.S. again.</p><p>O'NEILL:  Oh, they definitely have the intent.  That's what happens when you raise people from the time, they're infants to the time, the like, Hamza -- they're in their 30s, just to hate people because they don't believe what you believe.  You get this kind of stuff.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, Rob O'Neill, always great to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>O'NEILL:  Thanks, Shannon.  I appreciate it.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, the Supreme Court made it clear, public employees can no longer be forced to pay dues to a union they don't support.  But five California public school teachers say, that is exactly what's happening to them and now, they are suing.  We'll hear from their lawyer, we're going to debate both sides.  Plus, the president joins the daylight savings time debate, should it stay or should it go?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  On the heels of six-day teachers strike in California, five teachers are now suing the state's top union over collecting dues through mandatory paycheck deductions.  A practice that the Supreme Court calls on unconstitutional less than a year ago.  All right, let's bring in former Aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, Chris Hahn; and the lawyer representing the teachers, you recognize her, Harmeet Dhillon.  Thank you both for joining us.</p><p>HARMEET DHILLION, LAWYER:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>CHRIS HAHN, FORMER AIDE TO SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER:  Thanks for having us.</p><p>BREAM:  All right.  Harmeet, I just want you to clarify because Justice Alito was very clear.  He said this, in the decision last year, we conclude that this arrangement violates the free-speech rights of nonmembers by compelling them to subsidize private speech on matters of substantial public concern, and he said, unless these people affirmatively consent to giving the money, the unions can't take it.  Are you claiming that's what happening in California?</p><p>DHILLON:  Exactly what's happening.  So, our five clients working in conjunction with the freedom foundation, which has filed this type of lawsuit in other West Coast states as well, are claiming that they have opted out of their union card contracts.  And despite having opted out, the union is not letting them out until the anniversary of their one-year contract.  So, every pay period that their paychecks are being deducted, significant money in the case of the lead plaintiff, Bethany Mendez, $1500 a year on a pretty meager teacher's salary, a constitutional violation is occurring.  And so, the Supreme Court was very clear that you cannot take this money unless there is a knowing and voluntary waiver of the First Amendment.  And so, none of these teachers have made a voluntary waiver of the First Amendment rights.</p><p>BREAM:  So, Chris, even if you didn't like the ruling from the Supreme Court, it was a tight 15-4 last year.  Why shouldn't these teachers have the right to put their foot down over this?</p><p>HAHN:  Well, they are.  They signed a contract and they agreed to have these dues taken out.  I always wonder where you find teachers who are willing to go against their own interests and fight their union which basically gives them a much better salary, much better benefits and much better working conditions than they would've gotten on their own, especially given the market where there are thousands of teachers coming out of colleges every single day for every single opening.  These unions actually strengthen teachers and give them a better life at a fraction for what they are paying for these unions.  So, I am shocked that these people are willing to be used this way.  I hope that the kids that they teach are learning something because, god, these people don't seem to have learned much when they were in college.</p><p>DHILLON: Wow!</p><p>BREAM:  But Chris, you know, like the plaintiffs in a couple of these big cases, before the Supreme Court have said, they're going out on -- and supporting political candidates and messages with my dues money that I 100 percent disagree with, and they don't feel like they should have to subsidize that speech.  Does that make them terrible people?</p><p>HAHN:  You know, it's funny.  It's a slippery slope and, you know, when -- you know, we all pay for things we don't want going to support things we don't like.  For example, I'd buy gasoline every day.  Do I have a right to determine what we're going to -- what the gasoline company is going to do with the money I spend on it?  You know, it's a very slippery slope.  The Supreme Court got it wrong and it will be overturned when we get some reasonable members on that court.</p><p>BREAM:  OK.  Harmeet, the California Teachers Association, by the way, very brave statement, only responding this way, saying: \"It's another lawsuit from the Freedom Foundation to continue the attack on public education and public employees.\"  Harmeet?</p><p>DHILLION:  So, Chris just called these teachers stupid and said that their students are going to learn nothing, and he also ignore the fact that this is a constitutional violation.  That's the difference between your gas analogy and what's going on here.  And if you think about it in terms of a term that choice -- that the left loves which is freedom of choice, that's what these teachers are really looking for here.  They're looking for the choice to be part of a union or not.  And by the way, the sky doesn't fall when people aren't part of a union.  Chris, as you know in the federal system, people are --</p><p>HAHN:  They can opt out at the end of their contract.  They opted in and now they're opting out.</p><p>DHILLON:  Please don't interrupt me, Chris, I didn't interrupt you.  In the federal system, people do not -- people are not required to be part of the union and the unions go on just fine.  And so, no, when you have a constitutional right, it is not sufficient to you can opt out when we tell you can.  After they opted out, Shannon, union sent thugs into the classroom to try to intimidate them into revoking their opt out.</p><p>HAHN:  Stop.  Thugs.  Kindergarten teachers.</p><p>DHILLON:  And so, this is not acceptable.  And it is time for the state of California to follow the constitution as the Supreme Court says.</p><p>BREAM:  Chris, you don't think that's OK, coercion, do you, Chris?</p><p>HAHN:  No, of course not.  But I also don't think that these teachers who are her clients understand how much they're being used by extreme right-wing groups that just want to break unions all over the country.</p><p>DHILLION:  Yes, they're so dumb and you know better.</p><p>HANH:  Well, look, they are clearly unaware of how they're being used, you know.  So, it is a shame and I feel bad for them, because they're going to learn very soon if they their union does collapse, what their salaries would be in a free market, and it won't be good for them.</p><p>DHILLON:  I think they're going to be just fine without all the coerced speech.</p><p>BREAM:  Yes, a lot of people felt after the ruling last year that there would be a big threat to the unions falling apart, that kind of thing.  We haven't seen that yet.  So, we'll see and we'll watch this case and see who is right in their predictions.</p><p>HAHN:  Not for trying of these groups, though, that's for sure.</p><p>BREAM:  Chris and Harmeet, thank you both.  Good to see you.</p><p>DHILLON:  Thanks, Shannon.</p><p>HAHN:  Thank you, Shannon.</p><p>BREAM:  All right, coming up, is New York Mayor Bill de Blasio losing the forest for the trees, as the mayor tells kids to have meatless Mondays?  Economists are warning the city is about to head into a financial crisis.  That stories are in our \"REAL NEWS ROUND UP\", next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BREAM:  Well, a woman gets booted from a hearing on gun control after apparently texting about going on a shooting spree of her own.  That story tops tonight's \"REAL NEWS ROUNDUP.\"  The unidentified woman was ejected from a Connecticut State Senate hearing after she was reportedly spotted sending a text saying: if she had a gun, she'd \"blow away a Republican state lawmaker and a large group of NRAs.\"  Connecticut capital police determined there was no threat.  The woman was not arrested.</p><p>New York City implementing meatless Mondays in public schools, a move supporter say, promotes healthy, environmentally friendly meal options.  The mayor says, cutting back on a little meat will help down on greenhouse gases and help save the planet.  Meanwhile, some top economists are warning the city needs to focus instead on its financial health.  One saying, New York is already in a difficult financial spot, but it would be in an impossible situation if we had any kind of setbacks.</p><p>President Trump lending support to do the push to do away with Daylight Savings Times.  Arizona and Hawaii are the only states that do not observe the time change.  The president tweeting today: \"Making Daylight Savings Time permanent is OK with me.\"</p><p>And the Supreme Court agreeing to hear the case of Eric (INAUDIBLE), who were denied a trademark for their line of street clothes by the Patent and Trademark Office because their brand is a variation of the F-word.  That denial is based on an old federal law that requires the rejection of trademarks that are scandalous or immoral.</p><p>All right.  Time now for our \"MIDNIGHT HERO\".  94-year-old, Mary Bochanis, was the longest-serving American Red Cross volunteer.  She started volunteering in 1943 when she met her husband, Gus, and she never stopped volunteering.  After her husband died in 2006, she just started volunteering more, she says.  A Red Cross volunteer for 76 years.</p><p>Mary Bochanis died Thursday.  She leaves behind an amazing legacy.  So, she is our \"MIDNIGHT HERO\" tonight.  Thank you for all those years of service to so many people.  Most-watched, most trusted, and most grateful you spent your evening with us.  Good night from Washington.

I'm judge Jeanine Pirro. Thanks so much for being with us tonight. We've got a big show on deck with fantastic guests, including my exclusive sit down with White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Governor Mike Huckabee and Charlie Kirk to name just a few. Plus, a final goodbye to my beloved mom. But first, my open.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Washington DC swamp has officially entered surreal territory. Why? Because they know that justice is coming. The Democrats have turned into the angry unreasonable mob that you usually see in the movies. But have you ever seen a real life bunch of crazies so desperate to hang on to a narrative dispelled by their own team that they're running around like chickens with their own heads cut off? Their one mantra, impeach anyone who gets in their way?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And this week, it was this man, Attorney General Bill Barr. Now Barr voluntarily testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding his four-page conclusion of Mueller's 400 plus page report. He did so until the whole report subject to legally mandated redactions could be released.</p><p>No Democrats took advantage of Barr's offer to look at the less redacted report. They didn't even want to see it. But the show put on by the hysterical, hyperventilating, histrionic, frenzied Democrats dripping with hate and venom was must-see TV.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MAZIE HIRONO (D-HI): Mr. Barr, now the American people know that you are no different from Rudy Giuliani or Kellyanne Conway, or any of the other people who sacrifice their once decent reputation for the grifter and liar who sits in the Oval Office.</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You, the chief law enforcement officer not only undermines your own credibility as an independent actor where you seem to not even be willing to be in the least bit critical in your summarizations. I believe that calls in your credibility.</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think you've made it clear that you've not looked at the evidence. We can move on. I think you've made it clear, sir that you've not looked at the evidence and we can move on. I think the American public has seen quite well that you are biased in the situation and you've not been objective.</p><p>HIRONO: You did exactly what I thought you'd do. It's why I voted against your confirmation. I expected you would try to protect the President and indeed you did. Being Attorney General of the United States is a sacred trust. You have betrayed that trust. America deserves better, you should resign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PIRRO: Barr, on the other hand was lucid, focused and unflappable. No surprise, the calls for his resignation or impeachment were immediate and simply the latest outrage and unsupported demands of the loony left.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Should Barr resign?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, I think he should.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): There is no sugarcoating this. I think he should step down.</p><p>REP. MAXINE WATERS (D-CA): I think that Barr should resign. And if he does not resign, he should be facing impeachment proceedings also.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): He lied to Congress. If anybody else did that, it would be considered a crime.</p><p>REP. JERROLD NADLER (D-NY): He clearly misled the American people. He seems to have testified non-truthfully.</p><p>REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He is seeking the Donald Trump. He should resign. We need an Attorney General who has credibility with the American people.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): So I will be writing him a letter and sending it to him this morning, asking him explicitly these questions and asking him if he stands by his statement. Because if he does, he should not be Attorney General.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PIRRO: But then to add more drama to a report that defeated the mainstream media's Trump-Russia collusion fiction, the left weaved yet a new web that Barr is misrepresenting the Mueller report.</p><p>A letter written to Barr on Mueller letterhead suggests that Barr's conclusions did not fully capture the content and substance of findings by Mueller. The left does it's crazy dance again. The truth. Barr offered Mueller the opportunity to review the conclusions, but Mueller declined.</p><p>Upon receipt of the letter, Barr calls Mueller and says, \"What's the issue?\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: I asked him if he was suggesting that the March 24th letter was inaccurate? And he said no, but that the press reporting had been inaccurate?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PIRRO: Now ain't that special. Even Robert Mueller now thinks the mainstream media can't get the news, right. Hey, Bob, go complain to your pals. Comey -- have him call the \"New York Times,\" CNN, MSNBC -- what makes you think that Barr can convince the mainstream media to say the truth? And next time, Bob, let's hope there never is one for you.</p><p>Don't write a 448-page report and expect everyone to get it just the way you wanted it in four pages.</p><p>Look, folks, the left simply refuses to accept that the Mueller investigation is over, and that justice is coming for them. They are fixated on obstruction but make no mistake, if Mueller wanted an indictment for obstruction, he would have recommended one. Hell, they even indicted George Papadopoulos for getting a date wrong. He could have recommended an indictment for obstruction, but he didn't.</p><p>Didn't Mueller look into that for two years? Didn't he have an army of investigators, search warrant, subpoenas, a grand jury? Look, I said it weeks ago, it was political whoremanship. It was Mueller's attempt to satisfy an unsatisfied client by leaving crumbs that the Democrats could fight over.</p><p>But this whole thing has been the biggest political con job and the closest attempt to a successful coup in American history. Everything I said in my book, \"Liars, Leakers and Liberals\" was right. They hate Trump, and they'll do anything, including subjugating the Constitution and our system of justice to destroy the man.</p><p>Their desperation to hang on to a narrative so torn up, worn out and destroyed, it isn't even entertaining anymore. It's not even worth talking about anymore. I'm done with it. But what is worth talking about is how the tables will turn. Sources tell me there's an investigation into how this counterintelligence investigation into Trump began.</p><p>It's time to investigate the beginning of this coup and who in the DOJ, FBI and White House signed on to prevent and overturn the will of the American people. Grab your popcorn, folks. It's show time. It's show time.</p><p>Multiple criminal leak investigations are underway. The FISA warrants are being reviewed. The beginning of the actual investigation that Peter Strzok tried so hard to cover up and the Inspector General's report expected to be damning to Comey's FBI and Lynch's DOJ will be out in weeks.</p><p>And then it's real show time for Obama, Brenna, Clapper, Lynch, Rice, Strzok, McCabe, Rose and the whole Cardinal Comey crime family devoted to obstructing not only the will of the American people, but obstructing the very foundation of justice in this great nation.</p><p>And that's my open. Tell me what you think on my Facebook and Twitter, #JudgeJeanine.</p><p>Here with reaction to my open and all the developing news, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. All right, good evening, Congressman, I want it I want to start with the whole idea of the Democrats going after Barr and the claim that they want to hold him in contempt. There are two things they want to hold him in contempt for.</p><p>Let's start with the first if, he doesn't appear on Monday to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, which he had volunteered and agreed to testify before, they want to hold him in contempt. Now tell us what that's about?</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Well, what that's about is he would have been before Judiciary Committee just as he was in the Senate last week. But you have to understand, at the beginning of every Congress, the Committees adopt their rules. Never in the history of the Judiciary Committee have they ever had a rule to allow staff to interview anybody at the Cabinet level.</p><p>Even CNN fact checkers cannot find one item that that ever happened after Attorney General Barr said he would come to the committee, you know what Nadler did? He changed the rules last week. You know why he wanted to do this? He wants it to look like impeachment.</p><p>He changed the rules of a committee that's never had the history of the committee to do this. Instead of using the members, does he not trust his own members who ran for Congress who are supposed to be the voice of the people? Eighteen of him on his side of the aisle are attorneys.</p><p>PIRRO: Who was ever -- I've never heard of anyone other than the congress people, when you appear before a House Judiciary question the person who has been asked to appear? I mean that's -- isn't that show time? That is a show time. They all get up and they have their five minutes and they rant and rave and then they don't even ask a question.</p><p>All right, so that they changed the rules. Barr says I'm not showing up.</p><p>MCCARTHY: They changed the rules of history. Rightfully so, Attorney General Barr should not have gone to that committee after they changed the rules in the history of Congress, never been.</p><p>PIRRO: Okay.</p><p>MCCARTHY: He is in the right.</p><p>PIRRO: Okay. So they are trying to make it look like an impeachment proceeding like they did in Watergate, correct?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes.</p><p>PIRRO: All right.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes, exactly.</p><p>PIRRO: Now, let's talk about Barr and the claim that they want a total un- redacted copy of the Mueller report and if they don't get it, again, they're going to hold Barr in contempt. Tell us about that.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, first of all, Nadler has the right to go read the un- redacted version, which, which would not include the grand jury, because that's breaking the law if he gave anything within the grand jury.</p><p>PIRRO: It's secret.</p><p>MCCARTHY: I also have the right to read it, and I have read it. But first of all, the American public has to understand there are two volumes or two sections of this. First of all, was there collusion? Ninety percent of all that has been made public for weeks. The part that they care most about -- the obstruction 98 percent -- get this, Judge -- 98 percent of that has been made public and the last 2 percent, Nadler has the right to go read it and he won't. Last I checked, he has not been down to read it. Does he care that much?</p><p>PIRRO: Well, okay, so what you're telling us is they've had an opportunity to read the less redacted version, as I understand it in a skiff or a room where you know, it's secure, and no Democrat has ...</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes, you go to down to the skiff.</p><p>PIRRO: ... even tried or taken advantage of that opportunity to read it. They just want to do their crazy dance and say, \"Let's hold him in contempt. He is horrible. He is hiding things. He is breaking the law.\" Now you've read it. Lindsey Graham has read it and you say already 90 percent to 98 percent --</p><p>MCCARTHY: And Doug Collins.</p><p>PIRRO: And Doug Collins. Okay. Ninety percent on the collusion and 98 percent on obstruction is already out there. So there's very little that's redacted. What's going on?</p><p>MCCARTHY: And it's not just -- it's not just out there to the members of Congress. It's out there to all of the world.</p><p>PIRRO: Yes, that's right.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Attorney General Barr has been one of the most transparent individuals out there. He offered Mueller to even read the letter before he let it out to the American public. I think Attorney General Barr has handled this situation better than anybody else, one of the most transparent bringing it forward to the American public. It is the Democrats that if you watch Nadler, he decided to impeach President Trump the day of the election.</p><p>PIRRO: That's right.</p><p>MCCARTHY: But you know what? There's no proof to be able to go forward, so he tries to even change the law. He tries to change history of Congress, and then he allies out to the American public.</p><p>If you watch the way Congressman, or Chairman Nadler handles his committee, I have never had so many complaints on both sides of the aisle of his inability to handle the most basic motions as a Chairman. He is not up for the job.</p><p>PIRRO: Let be open about this. There is -- Nadler has despised Donald Trump for years from their days in New York. This is an old personal vendetta.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes.</p><p>PIRRO: And you know what -- to do this to the American people to satisfy his own revenge or whatever his issue is, is crazy. Now, I want to talk about the -- what I call justice is coming. And that is turning the tables and looking at the investigators.</p><p>Now, there's an IG report that's coming out and it appears, and I believe that the President has indicated he is not going to be releasing or declassifying the FISA, which we've all been trying to get him to declassify until after the IG report. When do you think all of this is going to happen?</p><p>MCCARTHY: I don't know the date of when it will come. But in my view, it's not turning the tables, but it's making sure America never has to live through this again. This was the closest you ever had a few individuals to create a coup, because they disagreed philosophically with who won an election. If we believe in the rule of law, you want to get to the bottom of this.</p><p>The American public should never have to go through this again. It doesn't matter what side of the aisle you are on, you should want to make sure this never gets repeated. That is what has to go through. And then an IMG report will be just that. They will be able to be non-biased, to be able to look at the situation put forward -- put it forward to the American public to both Houses -- to the Senate and to the House and give it to both sides of the aisle and they can ask the questions.</p><p>That's why people run for Congress, they need to be the voice of their people. Not that you hand it off to some committee or to some staffer.</p><p>PIRRO: All right, I've got 30 seconds left. The President Donald Trump tweeted today that, \"I believe Kim Jong-un fully realizes the great economic potential of North Korea will do nothing to interfere or end with it.\" It's a tweet, \"He knows that I am with him and does not want to break his promise to me.\" Apparently Kim Jong-un is sending off some missiles. But my understanding is they're short range missiles, and they're not a threat. Are you aware of any of this?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes, I've seen what's happening, but history has to understand this. Ronald Reagan, in his second term, got up and walked away from Gorbachev in Iceland. And he did that because he wasn't able to get everything that he asked. The idea of peace without freedom is meaningless.</p><p>Had Ronald Reagan not walked away, the Berlin Wall would have never collapsed and neither would the Soviet Union. I believe at the end of the day, President Trump will have changed North Korea for the better for the rest of the world. And he was right to walk away when he did. And I think he is sending a very clear message that is probably personal that the rest of don't understand, but Kim Jong-un does understand it. I think it will change the course of history for the better.</p><p>PIRRO: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, I totally agree with you on that last point. I think that there's a message between the two of them. Thank you so much for taking time to be with us on JUSTICE tonight.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Thank you, Judge and my prayers are with you on the loss of your mother. I'm so sorry.</p><p>PIRRO: Thank you. Thank you. And still ahead, Governor Mike Huckabee, Charlie Kirk, plus my political panel ready for battle. But first, my exclusive interview with White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, what do you thinks about the Dems frenzied attacks on Bill Bar? And is there any chance of working with this political party whose only focus seems to be taking down the President. Back in a moment.</p><p>PIRRO: Breaking tonight, in a historic reversal at the 145th Kentucky Derby, long shot horse, Country House emerged as the winner today following a disqualification of Maximum Security, the horse that had crossed the finish line first. Stay with Fox News for continuing developments on this story.</p><p>Now, earlier, I sat down in a JUSTICE exclusive with the Acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney to discuss the record breaking economic growth, his take on the Dems unwillingness to work with the President and the outrageous attacks on Attorney General Bill Barr. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PIRRO: All right, thanks for being with us tonight. You know, jobs report yesterday, incredible -- 263,000 new jobs, unemployment 3.9 percent, the lowest unemployment in 49 years. That's quite a record for this President.</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Yes, the last time I think unemployment was this low, I was one and you probably weren't even born yet.</p><p>PIRRO: I was probably in high school.</p><p>MULVANEY: But the numbers are just great. And they continue to be. We look at it sort of the three threes. GDP is above three, unemployment is in the threes, and most importantly, and I think something that doesn't get as much attention, Jeanine in this is wage growth is in the 3 percent. I think was 3.2 percent in this quarter.</p><p>PIRRO: Yes, and that's the thing that people don't talk about that much. You know, the Democrats will get out there and say, you know, we need higher wages, but the wage growth is actually because of the competition and the need for better labor is growing, almost on its own.</p><p>MULVANEY: And I watched some of the Democrats running for President and they're on TV, and I keep wondering what they're talking about. They're talking about plants closing and people losing their jobs and wages going down. And all of that is the exact opposite of that is happening.</p><p>So it's fascinating to watch everybody get richer. The wage increases have actually been focused at the bottom end of the economic scale. So we're lifting people up out of poverty and into the middle class. It's everything that Donald Trump said what happened from his policies that it's just fun to sit back and watch it happens.</p><p>PIRRO: And what about Bill Barr? You know, I think you said that the Democratic Party was infested with the Trump derangement syndrome, and this week when Attorney General Bill Barr refused to go before the House Judiciary Committee, because he was being treated differently not being questioned by the Congress, men and women, but instead by staff lawyers, what do you think that was about?</p><p>MULVANEY: I've been on those committees. I was on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. I was on Maxine Waters' Financial Services Committee at that time, but I've been in Congress. And I've been -- and the members of Congress are supposed to be the ones answering the question. So I think Mr. Barr did exactly what he was supposed to do. He went to the Senate, he took as many Democratic questions as they had for him, because the rules were right. And the members were asking the questions.</p><p>Go to House, if they don't trust their own members to ask questions, they shouldn't be in Congress.</p><p>PIRRO: Why do you think the lawyers though? What are they going to do with that? Are they going to, you know, present it somewhere?</p><p>MULVANEY: That's part of the whole thing. They're not a court.</p><p>PIRRO: Right.</p><p>MULVANEY: Because they're not the Judicial Branch of government, and they're not law enforcement. They don't get to second guess the Mueller report. They don't get the second guess the Attorney General because they're not in the Executive Branch. They are in the Legislative Branch. Now they have the right to do a little bit of oversight. That's fine.</p><p>But they're not a judge and jury, and they're not law enforcement. So they need to do their legislative job. And that means if they want to do some oversight, ask questions, fine. But bringing in the lawyers is not appropriate.</p><p>PIRRO: You know, the President tweeted this week that it's time for the Democrats and the Republicans to come together and get some real work done. Is the White House confident that this can actually happen? And then I want to ask you about infrastructure, but do you think that the Democrats can put their hatred of this President aside and actually work with him?</p><p>MULVANEY: We're going to give them that -- we're going to give them every opportunity to do that, because we're down there working every single day. I mean, it's Saturday so we're not down there today. But we're down there every day this week working on things like infrastructure. The President met with him this week on that; like healthcare, we meet almost every single day with the President on that and trade. Another thing that doesn't really get nearly enough attention.</p><p>We're working on the business of running the government, and the Democrats are welcome to go along with us legislatively if they like. I don't think they figured out yet if they even want to do that.</p><p>PIRRO: Now the Democrats came out of one those meetings and said -- they're talking about $2 trillion for infrastructure. And yet it seems the Republicans are voicing some opposition to this. Where would this money come from? And how do you get this money without raising the debt?</p><p>MULVANEY: There's a bunch of different places we can look and it's going to be tough to find $2 trillion. I think it'd be fairly easy to find maybe half that -- a trillion dollars -- but again, we're just starting this process. Keep in mind, though, I still in my -- deep in my soul -- and I know these folks, because I used to work with them. I wonder if they were serious about the meeting or were they trying to set a trap for the President? Try to get him to commit to something that makes him look bad.</p><p>So we're going to go ahead and work on infrastructure, again, like we did this week. But it's going to be up to the Democrats to sort of send a clear message, do they want to legislate or do they want to litigate? Do they want to fight with us, or they want to work with us? Because you can't do both. It's just human nature. I can't sue you on Monday then have us do a deal on Tuesday.</p><p>PIRRO: But the amazing part of this is that look, these Democrats, they're not stupid, they got elected. I mean, don't they realize that the American people are watching all of this and the American people elected them to do things that are going to help them like if you need a bridge in your town or you need a better road and potholes are destroying cars, that kind of thing. I mean, why are they willing to risk themselves or don't they think that that's what's going on?</p><p>MULVANEY: They're torn. They are really torn within their own party. They do have some Democrats who think that and they have some other Democrats who think that their only purpose in that building across the street is to treat Donald Trump as badly as they possibly can.</p><p>Keep in mind, the Democratic Party has a very sort of an ascendant hardcore left-wing growing within it and there are folks in Congress who really do think that anything they can do to make Donald Trump look bad will get them reelected. So it's going to be interesting to see how that balance of power weighs out within the Democratic Party and that will help dictate whether or not they can work with us.</p><p>PIRRO: Okay, and do you think we're going to see a healthcare plan from the Republicans before 2020?</p><p>MULVANEY: We've already seen parts of it. Keep in mind, every time the Democrats talk about healthcare, they talk about Obamacare, which is a little tiny slice of what healthcare is. You've already seen what we're doing on drug prices, which came down for the first time in almost 50 years last year under this administration.</p><p>You're going to see us work on drug prices, see us work on new cures, see us work on protecting Medicare, something the Democrats don't even want to talk about. They're talking about Medicare for all, which they know destroys Medicare. We're going to talk about private markets, where the overwhelming majority of people get their health insurance. You get it from your employer. I get it from mine. The Democrats are out there admitting, \"Well, if we do Medicare-for-All, all of that goes away.\" So we're going to be protecting that. So we are talking about healthcare. In fact, we're doing a lot more than they are.</p><p>PIRRO: All right, and last question. You are very different from John Kelly. I mean --</p><p>MULVANEY: I'm shorter.</p><p>PIRRO: The reputation -- your reputation is that you pretty much let Trump be Trump. Whereas General Kelly was someone who by most accounts, tried to control him. He is a military guy. I get it, chain of command. What do you think is working better? And --</p><p>MULVANEY: I put it this way, it's that the Chief of Staff, if there's one thing the Chief of Staff needs to remember is that he is the chief or she is the chief of the staff. You're not the chief of the President. No Chief of Staff where regardless what you read in all the books -- I've talked to, I don't know, eight or 10 of them, none of them actually directed the President or told the President what to do. That's not what a good Chief of Staff does.</p><p>What does the Chief of Staff do? You figure out a way to make the staff help serve the President and make the President successful? We think we're doing it. We think we're helping the President be the President. He got elected. He is the one the nation wanted. So if we can make him successful, we're doing our jobs.</p><p>PIRRO: The President has been tweeting about Joe Biden a lot, is that because he's the latest in the race or because the President go sees the nominee and he thinks he can beat him?</p><p>MULVANEY: I think he's just the latest flavor of the day. And I think you know, next week, it'll be somebody else with the Democrats. Mayor of some town was on \"Time\" magazine yesterday, so he'll be the flavor of the week - - I can't even actually --</p><p>PIRRO: All right, so let me ask you this. How many hours do you work as the Acting Chief of Staff and you are the Director of Management and Budget? How many hours a week do you work?</p><p>MULVANEY: All my time is the Chief of Staff right now. It has been since I got there, I think in mid-December.</p><p>PIRRO: Can you keep up with the President?</p><p>MULVANEY: No. No. It's late for me. I'll go home and go to bed after this show is on and he will be up to the wee hours of the morning. The phone calls start at 6:00 a.m. from him and he goes well past midnight.</p><p>PIRRO: We're all aware. Mr. Mulvaney, it's a pleasure to have you on JUSTICE. Thank you.</p><p>MULVANEY: Thank you for having me.</p><p>PIRRO: All right.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PIRRO: Okay, worse than Watergate. President Trump calling out the FBI's attempt to spy on his campaign back in 2016. Did they go too far? Our All-Star panel of Hammill and Hahn join us to break it down, next.</p><p>AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Aishah Hasnie. A shocking upset at the 144th running of the Kentucky Derby earlier today, a 65 to one long shot named Country House taking the win after a controversial finish. One that saw the unbeaten Maximum Security crossing the finish line first. But an objection was filed after the muddy race saying the four to one favorite had interfered with the path of the other horses. After reviews, stewards announced that Maximum Security was disqualified declaring Country House the winner.</p><p>Israeli airstrikes targeting buildings in Gaza City Saturday night after Palestinian militants launched hundreds of rockets into Israel earlier in the day. The violence ending a month of relative peace between the two sides. At least six Palestinians are dead and three Israelis are injured. I'm Aishah Hasnie, now back to JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JEANINE.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I was happy to see on the front page of the \"New York Times\" for the first time where they were talking about spying and they were talking about spying on my campaign. It's a story bigger than Watergate as far as I'm concerned.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PIRRO: Okay, well, now we have our panel that's going to speak about this. Stephanie Hamill and Chris Hahn. Stephanie, I'm going to start with you. The President is actually using the word \"spying.\" And you know, the left has a conniption every time they hear that word. And yet the \"New York Times\" seems to be coming around and recognizing it for what it was and that that surveillance by the FBI was actual spying. What say you?</p><p>STEPHANIE HAMILL, VIDEO COLUMNIST: Yes, it's interesting to see the left there apoplectic over the word \"spying.\" They can look into the dictionary. But it's pretty clear what happened that we have the Obama administration that was potentially looking into a rival administration coming in and President Trump has a lot to be upset about.</p><p>I mean, his administration and everyone in his orbit has been dragged through the mud for the past two and a half years, they're still being dragged through the mud, despite what we learned from the Mueller report and now they're going into obstruction and X, Y and Z. It's time to look in to why they felt the need to spy on the campaign. I feel safe to use that word. It's okay to use that word. And we need to get to the bottom of what exactly happened and people should support this too, by the way.</p><p>PIRRO: All right.</p><p>HAMILL: It doesn't matter if you're a Republican or a Democrat.</p><p>PIRRO: Chris, let me ask you something. What Stephanie is talking about, I mean, the \"New York Times\" is now using the word \"spying.\" It's not pejorative anymore. I mean, it's a real word. And so why was there such a frenzy by Comey and the rest of them to deny that they were spying?</p><p>CHRIS HAHN, RADIO SHOW HOST: Well, I think it was counterintelligence work following leads, but it wasn't necessarily political. But what was political was the President of the United States asking his Attorney General to spy on Joe Biden and his political opponents.</p><p>And that's why the Attorney General could not answer Kamala Harris' question when he questioned it -- when she was questioning him earlier this week. That is bigger than Watergate. That is something we should all worry about.</p><p>PIRRO: Chris, I am going to ask you -- Chris, Chris, Chris. You're on the show to answer the questions. The question was whether or not there was spying by the FBI which that now the \"New York Times\" even seems to admit was the case. And I suspect that when the investigations continue, that we're going to see more of James Comey's denial that there was any spying by the investigators. Why would he deny spying and yet not deny that there was counterintelligence?</p><p>HAHN: I think the objection is that there was -- though using the word spying, which sounds like a nasty thing that was being done. What was actually being done was law enforcement following leads as they should. There's no evidence. There's no suggestion that anyone ordered these people to do this other than them following their lead and going and getting warrants.</p><p>Now, if they didn't get warrants, if they didn't follow the process. That's something that we should all talk about and we should be very concerned about. I agree on that part. But if they were following the law, and they were getting warrants the proper way, then of course, that's what they should be doing. You would agree with that? I'm sure.</p><p>PIRRO: Look, look, Chris. So you're taking issue with the word \"spy,\" as opposed to counterintelligence. But you know, what's interesting is Peter Strzok who was a deputy head of the FBI or head of counterintelligence told us he forgot what date they started the counterintelligence on when you know, they're glued to this July 30 of 2016. Because there is no basis for the counterintelligence. But you know what, I just wanted to make it clear --</p><p>HAHN: Well, we'll find out.</p><p>PIRRO: We will find out. Make no mistake.</p><p>HAHN: Yes.</p><p>PIRRO: But what I want to do now --</p><p>HAHN: Yes, that's great.</p><p>PIRRO: I want to talk about this. James Comey did an interview. Guys, if we can listen to the sound on it, take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: They exceeded their wildest expectations because look at where we are as a country now? How we're at each other's throats? So they will be back again. They will work to reelect Donald Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PIRRO: Okay, so there you have Jim Comey he is back and he had that to say about the Russians, Chris. He is basically saying, \"Look at where we are because of the Russians.\" And it seems to me, Chris, that he is almost conceding 2020 Trump because he says, you know, they will be back again. Is this their prophylactic attempt to protect themselves from what may be a real defeat in 2020?</p><p>HAHN: I don't think we should be worrying about political people protecting themselves for political things. And we should ask the President of the United States, what he is doing to protect America from Russia coming back, because I do believe and so do his Intelligence officers believe that they are coming back, that they were they are planning on coming back that they are still here, and we should be safeguarding our elections against it.</p><p>I know a lot of private companies have started doing that, but I think that the President of the United States and his Attorney General and his Homeland Security people should do this correctly.</p><p>PIRRO: Okay, you already said it. I got it. The President should do it. Stephanie, when Obama found out about this, I hear he told Putin to knock it off. Do you think Obama did anything about it in 2016 when he thought Hillary would win?</p><p>HAMILL: No, he didn't. He actually said and there is video of this that he wasn't worried about it, and that it was impossible for any -- for the Russians or anyone else to hack our elections. And look, the Democrats aren't concerned about the Russians hacking the elections, because they are not really talking about that right now.</p><p>HAHN: We should all be concerned about it.</p><p>HAMILL: And how exactly did they have the election. They spent a couple of hundred thousand dollars on Facebook.</p><p>PIRRO: It didn't affect the vote, Chris.</p><p>HAMILL: Yes, they spent a couple of hundred thousand dollars on Facebook ads. And I'm curious, why aren't we looking into China and some of our other adversaries out there in the world and how much they spent on Facebook? No one has answered my question on that yet.</p><p>Look, no one is really taking it seriously. They're still upset over the loss. They're going to continue to use this narrative and push it through 2020 and people are still buying it. Look, Chris, I go out in the streets and I talk to people and they're so upset over Russia, Russia, Russia, but they can't explain how the Russians influenced so many thousands of people to go to all of Trump's rallies, those aren't Russians. Those are hardworking Americans that are there to support the President.</p><p>PIRRO: Chris, okay, Stephanie, I got it. Chris, Hillary Clinton is calling on China to get involved. What do you say to that?</p><p>HAHN: I think she was basically echoing what the President did in 2016. I think it's -- I don't think people should be doing that. But she was trying to make the same joke that the President made. I mean, we call it jokes because I think that --</p><p>PIRRO: Is she relevant? Is that woman even relevant?</p><p>HAHN: I don't think she's going to be a player in the 2020 election, Judge. I think the election is going to be a very interesting one. It's going to have a handful and I can't wait to talk to you about it. Thank you.</p><p>PIRRO: Okay, good. Got to go. Thanks, guys. Okay, good.</p><p>HAMILL: Thank you, Judge.</p><p>PIRRO: Coming up, Venezuela in chaos. We dive deeper into what sparked the crisis and why the Dems socialist agenda is so dangerous. Mike Huckabee -- Governor Mike Huckabee is fired up. He joins us next.</p><p>PIRRO: While the Democrats continue to rev up their socialist agenda here in the United States, we're getting to see the reality of socialism up close and personal in Venezuela.</p><p>Joining me now with reaction to that and more, former Arkansas Governor and Fox News contributor Mike Huckabee. All right, Governor, you know what's going on in Venezuela? I mean, the pictures are pretty horrible. And I really don't want to get into the politics, the internal politics of what's going on. But I want you to talk about two issues in Venezuela.</p><p>One, the idea of socialism and what we are seeing in Venezuela, and you know what the Democrats the progressive, liberal, leftist, whatever they call themselves are trying to do in terms of bringing socialism to the United States.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS: Judge, one of the problems that a lot of the younger Democrats have is that they've never lived in a world where socialism really was prevalent.</p><p>AOC was born, for example, a month after the Soviet collapse. So she doesn't have a frame of reference, so she can speak eloquently about how great socialism is. What we see in Venezuela is where socialism always leads. And here's where it leads. Deprivation of the things that consumers want, prices go high, supply goes low, people's wages collapse, the economic system crumbles within itself, and the only way the government can get people to behave and to accept now what has become socialism is that the end of a gun and the only thing people are left with is throwing sticks and bottles and rocks at the people with guns i.e. the government.</p><p>It's a terrible system. It's never worked. It has never ever worked long term. And in order for it to work at all, you've got to kill several million people to make it work.</p><p>PIRRO: Well, you know, I was reading about it several months ago. And you know, the idea of women -- that hospitals can't handle patients and they certainly can't handle women who are trying to deliver babies and so they're delivering them on the side of the road because there's no medical care for these people.</p><p>HUCKABEE: When you take competition out of the market, and when you take the incentive for people to work, because they're going to be rewarded for their work, you end up with the old Soviet system. And it used to be said, in the Soviet Union, people pretended to work and the government pretended to pay them.</p><p>They really weren't working and the government really wasn't paying them. And the result is nobody gets ahead. Look what's happening in our own economy compared to Venezuela. We have prosperity and the people at the lowest 25 percent of the income brackets in America, the ones who have been helped most by President Trump's economic policies, you're never going to hear that on the mainstream media.</p><p>But let's remember about Venezuela, 25 years ago, it was one of the most prosperous nations on Planet Earth, certainly the most prosperous nation in all of South America. It was really like a goose with lots of golden eggs. And now those eggs have cracked and there's nothing left. It's just -- it's tragic what's happened to those good people.</p><p>PIRRO: Let's talk about the Second Amendment in the United States -- guns and the right to possess a weapon -- and what has happened to weapon possession in Venezuela and the impact of it.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well, a lot of people in America forget that the Second Amendment was never about hunting, I hear people say, \"Well, you know, we want to protect the hunters rights,\" forget about hunting, it's not about hunting.</p><p>The founders -- and this sounds really radical in 2019 -- but the founders knew that the last stand that freedom had against a tyrannical government was being able to fight for itself and to fend off the government if the government became a tyranny.</p><p>And so the Second Amendment was placed there so that people would have that right. When they don't have it, like they don't have it in Venezuela, then they are reduced to trying to pick up a rock or a stick and, and throw it at the people who are holding guns. Well guess what? The people with guns win every time.</p><p>So when we say we want those people to have freedom, but what we should want them to have is enough freedom that they had a Second Amendment or something similar to it, so that they could defend themselves, their families and their principles and we should want that in America as well.</p><p>PIRRO: All right, Governor Mike Huckabee, well said. Thanks so much for being with us tonight.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Always a pleasure. Thanks, Judge.</p><p>PIRRO: All right, and up next social media may be trying to censor conservatives, but you can always hear them here on JUSTICE. Charlie Kirk joins me next to talk about the censorship Fallout and President Trump's reaction.</p><p>PIRRO: Most people already know the First Amendment protects free speech. But these days, some seem totally unclear about exactly what that means, especially those in the social media world.</p><p>Joining me now with more on the topic, host of the new podcast, \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" Turning Point USA, founder, Charlie Kirk. All right, Charlie, you know, one of the things that people don't seem to understand is that speech that some consider a horrible or a hate speech is actually protected speech by the First Amendment.</p><p>Because, you know, we wouldn't need the First Amendment if we all agreed that the only speech we wanted to hear was speech everyone wanted to hear. The United States Supreme Court, in fact, has repeatedly reaffirmed the fact that hate speech is protected speech. The only speech that is not protected as one that incites people to riot or is something that is, you know, causing people to immediately try to riot or producing imminent danger.</p><p>So why -- and what right do they have to suspend people like Laura Loomer, Milo Yiannopoulos and the rest of them from Facebook? What is going on and you know, better than anyone because of what's going on, on the campuses?</p><p>CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA: This is a huge issue and what I say is, the censorship that happens on college campuses has now happened in Silicon Valley and it is happening every single day on these conduits of communication.</p><p>This is one of the biggest issues coming into the 2020 election. Because remember, it's President Trump who uses Twitter so effectively to get his supporters. It's the President who used Facebook so innovatively to be able to win the 2016 election. And the analogy that I make with this, and this is why it's really dangerous what's happening here is these social media companies have such a monopoly on the audience that that people need to communicate with, people like you, people like me.</p><p>It's no different than some of these airlines that have a monopoly on some of these smaller towns. So if an airline all of a sudden says, \"You know what, you're not allowed to fly on our airplane because you engage in hate speech.\" Well, how am I supposed to get to rural Montana then if there's only one airline that goes there? This is exactly what's happening with these big tech companies. It is now, they're using their monopolization, their monopoly as a way to exert their power to have a singular leftist conversation, not a true marketplace of ideas.</p><p>PIRRO: But Charlie, you know, if they're not -- they're not regulated by the government, or are they? Because the government wouldn't tolerate this. The government cannot censor the First Amendment?</p><p>KIRK: Well, look, here's where as a conservative, I've done a lot of thinking about this. I think it is time to get the Federal government involved in this. And I'm not quick to say that, Judge, mind you. I don't -- I don't like using the government to do much of anything, by the way.</p><p>However, when you're talking about Google that controls 85 percent of all search results. You're talking about Facebook, over a billion active users, these sort of tech companies are arguably even more powerful than parts of the Federal government. And whether it be the enforcement the Sherman Antitrust Act after Google and their monopoly that exists over search engine results or the equal application of free speech policy, because these are now public utilities.</p><p>You could make the argument that these tech companies are so big and so powerful, they're no different than electricity providers now. They're no different because basically everyone uses them and people need them.</p><p>PIRRO: All right, Charlie Kirk, thanks so much. And a final goodbye to my beautiful mom, next.</p><p>PIRRO: I wasn't here last Saturday. I lost my best friend. I was burying my mom, Esther Ferris in Elmira, New York. She was my hero, my backbone, my inspiration, my rock, my mentor, and my muse.</p><p>A woman who challenged life, went toe-to-toe with it, poked it in the eye. She had to because the storms in her life were many -- the kinds of storms that few survive.</p><p>She taught me to fight, fight for the victim, the weak, people who couldn't take care of themselves long before it was vogue to do so.</p><p>I can vividly remember her sticking up for those who couldn't help themselves -- complete strangers. She would confront the offender head on, her words clear, bitingly articulate in spite of her accent.</p><p>She was stunningly beautiful and strong-willed, and she never hesitated to speak her mind. Her big brown eyes flashing with indignation. Her DNA was etched with compassion and empathy, her natural intelligence and strong sense of justice, belied an upbringing designed to crush her because she was a girl.</p><p>Yes, she was my hero, and as the song goes, she was the wind beneath my wings. The inspiration for all that I have done as a prosecutor and judge. She was everything I would like to be.</p><p>Mom, I was the one with all the glory while you were the one with all the strength. A beautiful face. A beautiful smile, to hide the pain. And now mom, the angels are the wind beneath your wings as they carry you into the heavens. I will miss you, mom. I will miss you terribly. I'll miss talking to you after the show every Saturday night. So till we meet again, mom. I love you and I miss you. Good night, mom.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019050401cb255</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W1X-38K1-DXH2-617V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7675\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 4, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Election</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Internet</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Constitutional Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODdEMDhDREQzOEQ2NDE2RkE2Njk3RTNEMUM0NTE3MEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTFCNEUyMUZCNzJDNEY0NjkzRDVCMjIxOUE5NzZBNzg</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkU5NzdDMzI5QTcxNDQ5QTg3NDAwNjNGM0MwMTgxNEI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>Scope</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkFFNzEwMUYzNEU3NDdGRTg4RUM2OUM0ODI1ODg2QjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Energy &amp;

Big push back from Iran and the U.S. as world leaders prepare to head to the G20.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL GATES, MICROSOFT FOUNDER: Well, technology has become so central that government has to think, OK, what does that mean?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: And Bill Gates joins the call to regulate big tech. Why he said it's time his own industry needs to be closely watched.</p><p>Welcome back to EARLY START. I'm Christine Romans.</p><p>BRIGGS: I'm Dave Briggs. Good morning, everybody, 4:30 Eastern Time on a Tuesday.</p><p>We start with the fighting behind the fighting over the immigration battle here. A Democratic source calls it the hardest Nancy Pelosi has had to work in her speakership. House Democrats emerging from a tense late-night meeting about an emergency border funding measure with Speaker Pelosi agreeing to review specific changes. Why? Democrats in the Progressive and Hispanic Caucuses argue the $4.6 billion proposal does not go far enough addressing humanitarian needs.</p><p>Pelosi called the meeting following reports of poor conditions at border protection centers and President Trump's threat of mass deportations.</p><p>The speaker addressed the border issue before the meeting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Families belong together. In America, everyone has rights, immigrants have rights. And we just have to beat that drum for the next couple of weeks. And as we do so, we must also pass legislation that meets the humanitarian needs at the border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: The clock is ticking on several fronts here. A vote on the Democratic proposal is set for today. Lawmakers leave Washington for a one-week recess on Thursday. The president pushed back his timeline but says deportations, there will be deportations in 12 days. The chair of the House Democratic Caucus recently outlined leadership's border strategy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): We should provide the humanitarian assistance necessary to change the conditions along the border, particularly as it relates to immigrant children. But we need to make sure that there are guardrails that are erected so that we do not inadvertently fund the reckless Trump deportation machine.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Now without some version of emergency immigration funding, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar says that the effect on HHS would be essentially like a government shutdown.</p><p>BRIGGS: Help is comes immediately for nearly 250 migrant children held at the Customs and Border Protection facility in Clint, Texas. The Department of Health and Human Services will be shifted into its shelter system by today. This comes days after CNN reported on a team of lawyers, doctors and advocates warning of what they called major health and hygiene problems at that Clint facility.</p><p>Our Jake Tapper asked Vice President Mike Pence about those conditions on Sunday. Pence quickly pivoted to politics.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: We have money to give toothpaste and soap and blankets to these kids in El Paso County right now.</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Of course we do.</p><p>TAPPER: So, why aren't we?</p><p>PENCE: My point is, it's all a part of the appropriations process. Congress needs to provide additional support to deal with the crisis at our southern border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: As of June 10th, more than 52,000 unaccompanied children have been transferred from DHS to HHS, a 60 percent increase over last year.</p><p>ROMANS: Wow.</p><p>All right. An extraordinary denial from President Trump in the face of rape allegation from the mid-1990s. According to the president, written E. Jean Carroll is, quote, totally lying when she claims he sexually assaulted her in a New York City department store. Mr. Trump tells \"The Hill\", quote, this: I'll say it with great respect, number one, she's not my type. Number two, it never happened. It never happened, OK?</p><p>Watch Carroll's reaction when Anderson Cooper reads her the president's remarks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[04:35:00] ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: He said: I'll say it with great respect. Number one, she's not my type. Number two. It never happened. It never happened, OK?</p><p>E. JEAN CARROLL, COLUMNIST: I love that. I am so glad I am not his type. I am so glad.</p><p>This is -- this was 20 years ago. And I probably was at that moment in that five-minutes the most attractive woman in Bergdorf's, in that one bit of time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Carroll has been an advice columnist for \"Elle\" Magazine for 26 years. She alleges Mr. Trump attacked her in one of the store's dressing rooms. The president has denied accusations of sexual misconduct now by more than a dozen women.</p><p>BRIGGS: President Trump refusing to reveal whether he has confidence in FBI Director Chris Wray. Wray and the president recently clash on whether campaigns should accept dirt on their opponents from foreign governments. He was asked by \"The Hill\" about his confidence with Wray. The president replied: Well, we'll see how it turns out. I mean, I disagree with him on that.</p><p>Here's what Mr. Trump recently told ABC News.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is somebody that said, we have information on your opponent. Oh, let me call the FBI, give me a break. Life doesn't work that way.</p><p>GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS ANCHOR: The FBI director says that's what should happen.</p><p>TRUMP: The FBI director is wrong.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: The FBI has not responded to that comment from the president.</p><p>ROMANS: Senator Bernie Sanders' plan farther than any Democratic candidate in the field. His plan cancels all $1.6 trillion in loan debt for some 45 million people.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Bottom line is we should not be punishing people for getting a higher education. It is time to hit the reset button. Under the proposal that we introduce today, all student debt would be canceled in six months.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: All right. This ambitious plan goes beyond the proposal from Elizabeth Warren, Senator Elizabeth Warren. And it has not eligibility limitations. He wants Wall Street to pay for it. The plan is facing backlash from some who say it would help rich people.</p><p>It's a populist play to young voters who have more student loan debt than mortgage, new for this generation. According to college boards, the typical graduate of a four-year public college has $26,900 in debt. Private colleges, more, $32,600.</p><p>Not everyone agrees there is a crippling student loan crisis in the same terms as Warren and Sanders. A senior fellow at Manhattan Institute said Monday the government already has systems in place for people who need helping repaying their loans. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos is accused of cutting elements of those plans in every year of the Trump administration.</p><p>BRIGGS: President Trump doesn't think he needs congressional approval for a military strike against Iran.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I like the idea of keeping Congress abreast, but I wouldn't have to do that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nancy Pelosi actually said you must have congressional approval. So, you disagree with her on that?</p><p>TRUMP: I disagree.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Members of Congress have hotly debated the question of president's authority especially in the wake of the attack the president called off last week. He ordered that strike in retaliation for Iran's downing of an unmanned American spy plane.</p><p>ROMANS: The president targeted Iran's supreme leader with new sanctions Monday. He warned that U.S. restraint is limited. Overnight, the Iranian foreign minister slapped back, saying the new sanctions mean the White House is, quote, closing the channel of diplomacy forever. CNN's Frederick Pleitgen is standing by for us. He is live in Tehran today again.</p><p>Fred, what's the latest?</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Christine.</p><p>Well, the Iranians have a dual approach to these two new sanctions. On the one hand, they seem to be wanting to laugh them off and are saying that they don't mean anything and are just propaganda. On the other hand, they are also lashing out at them. As we said, also, saying that this closes any sort of diplomatic channels that might have been possible.</p><p>We do have some new lines that we just got from Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani, who just said, get this, that he believes the White House is in a state of mental disability. He then goes to say, now, this is a quote what I'm reading now, the Pentagon is confused, CentCom is confused. The White House is confused as well. Among this confusion, they have begun to take illogical moves and lie.</p><p>Essentially, what Tehran was saying on the one hand, the White House is saying it wants talks with the Iranian administration. On the other hand, the Iranians are saying it's precisely the additional sanctions that are preventing Iran from going back to the negotiating table. At the same time they're saying, look, the sanctions are not having any sort of effect on the Iranian economy. They say the supreme leader does not own any assets. He owns a modest home and a mosque.</p><p>At the same time, they're saying, look, this is not going to allow us to go into any talks. They're quite angry also, Christine, about the fact that the foreign minister, Javad Zarif, is being sanctioned as well. In fact, a senior advisor to Rouhani tweeting just a couple of minutes ago, that Zarif is in the process of becoming Iran's Nelson Mandela -- Christine.</p><p>[04:40:04] ROMANS: All right. That's some comparison.</p><p>All right. Thank you so much, Fred Pleitgen in Tehran for us.</p><p>BRIGGS: Kellyanne Conway will not be showing up to a hearing on Wednesday to discuss her alleged violations of the Hatch Act. White House lawyers claiming longstanding precedent allows her to decline the House Oversight Committee's invitation.</p><p>Chairman Elijah Cummings tells CNN he plans to subpoena Conway on Wednesday. And his panel will vote to hold her in contempt if she ignores the subpoena. Earlier this month, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel recommended Conway be fired for violating the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from using their authority to influence the outcome of an election.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. President Trump has signed an executive order to make health care prices more transparent for patients. The order requires hospitals to disclose prices that reflect what insurers and patients pay for common items and services. And it calls for patients to receive an estimate of their out of pocket costs before they are treated. Hospitals, insurers and other providers in health care industry are already preparing to fight this, to fight disclosing their contracted rates.</p><p>BRIGGS: Mitch McConnell is set to meet with 9/11 first responders today. He'll be discussing an extension for the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund. The current funding expires in 2020. The fund's administrator says there's not enough money left to pay off all of the claims. Last week, former \"Daily Show\" host Jon Stewart criticized the Senate majority leader for holding up legislation and challenged him to sit down with first responders. The new bill does not call for a specific amount of money for the 9/11 fund, just whatever sums are necessary through 2090.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Bill Gates calling on the United States government to step up regulation of big tech. The founder of Microsoft says company like he created have so much influence on culture, business and life, they must be constantly monitored.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GATES: Technology's become so central that government has to think, OK, what does that mean about elections? What does that mean about bullying? Things like privacy I'm sure they'll -- and there should be at some point better regulation as it relates to that. The fact that now this is the way people consume media, you know, has really brought a realm that we need to shape it so that the benefits outweigh the negatives.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Those remarks from Bill Gates on the same days Senators Mark Warner of Virginia and Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a bill that could force companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook to reveal how much they make, how much money they make off your data.</p><p>The bill would compel commercial data operators and more than 100 million monthly users to provide public updates. And, you know, some folks say, I want to know how much you make. I want to know what you're doing, what you have on me and who you're getting it to. That's what I like to know.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes, we don't know enough about the data they control.</p><p>The L.A. Dodgers take the action to protect fans after two people were hit by foul balls. Hear from the latest victim, next.</p><p>[04:47:22] ROMANS: Dozens of hours of videotext messages and other documents released in \"Empire\" actor Jussie Smollett's case. Back in January, Smollett claimed he was attacked and a noose was placed around his neck. For the first time, we're seeing Smollett wearing that rope as police arrived to his apartment. Smollett's face blurred in the video because he was considered a victim at the time.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUSSIE SMOLLETT, ACTOR: The reason I'm calling is because of this (AUDIOP DELETED)</p><p>POLICE OFFICER: OK, do you want to take it off or anything?</p><p>SMOLLETT: Yes, I do I just wanted you guys to see it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Police later determined this was an elaborate hoax staged by Smollett for attention and publicity. All charges against Smollett, though, were dropped in late February for community service and forfeiture of his $10,000 bond payment. That decision is under a separate review by the county's inspector general.</p><p>BRIGGS: Family and friends of a missing Connecticut mother dismissing a theory being floated by the attorney for her estranged husband. Fifty-year-old Jennifer Dulos, a mother of five, vanished last month in a midst of a custody battle. Her ex-lawyer alleges she may have staged her disappearance in a \"Gone Girl\" type of situation. The popular novel and film, a wife fakes her own death after disappearing to frame her husband for murder in retaliation for his infidelity.</p><p>A spokesperson for Jennifer Dulos' family calls the theory false and irresponsible. The estranged husband, Fotis Dulos, and his girlfriend pleaded not guilty of to charges of evidence tampering and hindering prosecution on her disappearance.</p><p>The Los Angeles Dodgers plan to extend the protective netting past the far ends of each dugout at Dodgers Stadium. It comes after a fan was hit in the head by a foul ball Sunday.</p><p>Kaitlyn Salazar spoke about the incident.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KAITLYN SALAZAR, HIT BY FOUL BALL: You know those movies where a bomb goes off and you hear an eerie sound and then like the scene starts to get fady and then everyone sounds like mumble? Yes, like that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: There has been greater scrutiny on fan safety after a woman died last year when she was hit by a line drive foul ball at Dodgers Stadium. Just last month, a 4-year-old girl was struck in the head by a line drive during a game in Houston.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The host is Milan and Cortina!</p><p>(CHEERS)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: The Italian delegation erupting in cheers after the International Olympic Committee announced the 2026 Winter Games will be held in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo. The IOC selecting Milan and Cortina over the other finalist, Stockholm.</p><p>[04:50:05] Italy has hosted the Winter Olympics twice before. Cortina in 1956 and Turin in 2006, but this will be the first time for the city of Milan.</p><p>ROMANS: The U.S. women's national team is onto the quarterfinals to the 2019 Women's World Cup. They defeated Spain Monday but barely, 2- 1 behind two Megan Rapinoe penalty kicks.</p><p>Look at that, Team USA, the defending World Cup champs, will now meet France, the host nation on Friday.</p><p>BRIGGS: Questionable decision making by the U.S. goaltender and coach. It was a tough win. But nonetheless, they survived and advanced. Congrats to them.</p><p>ROMANS: And McDonald's decision to switch from frozen to fresh beef has fired up its sales. CNN Business has details, next.</p><p>[04:55:21] BRIGGS: Four-fifty-five Eastern Time.</p><p>During a face to face with the Saudi king, the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did not bring up the murder of American journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Now, there are more questions about whether President Trump will also avoid the subject at the G20 Summit this week.</p><p>Jomana Karadsheh live from Istanbul where the journalist was murdered last year.</p><p>Good morning, Jomana.</p><p>It appears the president is more concerned about the weapons sales to the Saudis than the dismemberment of an American journalist.</p><p>JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And, you know, the president has made that clear so many times, Dave, over the past more than eight months since Jamal Khashoggi was murdered here at the Saudi consulate.</p><p>As you mentioned, a senior State Department official telling CNN that the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, did not bring up the killing of Jamal Khashoggi or the investigation into his killing with the king, King Salman, during their meetings in Jeddah yesterday, saying it was more focus on regional tensions and Saudi Arabia's main rival in the region, Iran.</p><p>It's unclear if he brought up the issue with the crown prince, Mohammad bin Salman, during their meetings. We know the secretary of state has brought it up in the past. You know, keeping in mind, it was the CIA's assessment that the crown prince ordered the killing of Jamal Khashoggi.</p><p>And that these meetings, whether it is Secretary Pompeo's meetings or President Trump meeting with the Saudis during the G20, this is coming days after the first independent investigation was completed and the report was published by the United Nations repertoire for extra judicial killing. And she concluded that Jamal Khashoggi was the victim of a premeditated extrajudicial killing that was -- that the Saudi state is responsible for his killing. She said she cannot make any conclusions about the crown prince's skill but she has recommended that he be investigated further and that he get hit with sanctions.</p><p>It seems at this point, as you mentioned, that the Trump administration is not willing to do this. We've heard this from the president during an interview this weekend where he dismissed the recommendation of the United Nations investigator calling for an FBI investigation and basically again putting his priority there as doing business with Saudi Arabia over human rights, Dave.</p><p>BRIGGS: It does not appear likely the president will address it. Jomana Karadsheh live for us in Istanbul, thank you.</p><p>President Trump also said to be considering a trip to the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea. The South Korean government official said it would happen during the president's visit to Seoul following the G20 summit. The official says there are no plans for a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Let's get a check on CNN Business this Tuesday morning.</p><p>Taking a look at global markets, you can see a softness in Asian markets and European markets have closed slightly lower -- have opened rather slightly lower as well. Wall Street, you see the same kind of tone leaning down.</p><p>You know, stocks ended mixed on Monday ahead of the planned U.S./China trade talks. Investors looking towards the G20 Summit where President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are going to meet and talk trade. Even if no deal is reached immediately, the meeting could set the tone or at least the outline for the next phase of the trade spat.</p><p>The Dow finished up just eight points. That's just about nothing. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq closed lower. Dow is now just 99 points lower than the record closing high it set in October. The S&amp;P is very close to its all-time high that it hit last week.</p><p>ROMANS: McDonald's sales are on fire, and the reason to switch from frozen beef patties to fresh beef last year. That change has led to a 30 percent spike in sales of the classic quarter pounder over the past year. McDonald's made the change to appeal to its customers who want to know where their food comes from. It's the biggest supply chain change McDonald's had made since it started all day breakfast in 2015.</p><p>Ann Sarnoff is about to become the new chair and CEO of Warner Brothers, and the first female chief in the studio's storied history.

The majority of EFF's funding comes from ordinary individuals, and over 80% of that funding consists of donations under $10,000. We receive less than six and a half percent of our funding from corporate sponsors. n1</p><p>For nearly 30 years, EFF has represented the interests of technology users both in court cases and in broader policy debates to help ensure that law and technology support our civil liberties. From that vantage point, we are well aware that online speech is not always pretty--sometimes it's extremely ugly and causes real-world harm. The effects of this kind of speech are often disproportionately felt by communities for whom the Internet has also provided invaluable tools to organize, educate, and connect. Systemic discrimination does not disappear and can even be amplified online. Given the paucity and inadequacy of tools for users themselves to push back, it's no surprise that many would look to Internet intermediaries to do more to limit such speech.</p><p>We all want an Internet where we are free to meet, create, organize, share, associate, debate, and learn. We want to make our voices heard in the way that technology now makes possible and to feel safe. We want to exercise control over our online environments and to feel empowered by the tools we use. We want our elections free from manipulation and for the speech of women and marginalized communities not to be silenced by harassment.</p><p>Chipping away at the legal foundations of the Internet is not the way to accomplish those goals. Instead, it is likely to backfire, to the detriment of all users but particularly to those who are most vulnerable to other forms of silencing. As a civil liberties organization, the Electronic Frontier Foundation's primary reason for defending Section 230 is the role that the law has played in providing a megaphone to those who previously lacked one, and removing much of the gatekeeping that stifled social change, perpetuated power imbalances, and rendered marginalized voices susceptible to censorship. Section 230 enables the existence of intermediaries that allow marginalized voices to get their messages out to the whole world, without having to own a printing press or a broadcast license, and without knowing how to code. It allows people to connect with people from around the world, to find community, organize, and advocate.</p><p>But Section 230 does far more. If you have ever forwarded an email--whether a news article, a party invitation, or a birth announcement--you have done so with the protection of Section 230. If you have ever maintained an online forum for a neighborhood group, you have done so with the protection of Section 230. If you are a library that provides a forum for reader reviews, or a local newspaper that allows readers to comment online regarding the news of the day, or a job board that allows former employees to share comments about a prospective company, you do so with the protection of Section 230. If you've used Wikipedia to figure out the birthplace of George Washington or the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow, you have benefited (indirectly) from Section 230. When you watch online videos documenting events in real time in northern Syria, you are benefiting from Section 230.</p><p>To be clear, the free and open Internet has never been fully free or open. And it can amplify the worst of us as well as the best. But at root, the Internet still represents and embodies an extraordinary idea: that anyone with a computing device can connect with the world, anonymously or not, to tell their story, organize, educate, and learn. Section 230 helps make that idea a reality. And it is still worth protecting.</p><p>A. What Section 230 Does</p><p>Commonly referred to as Section 230, 47 U.S.C. [Sec.] 230 originated in H.R. 1978--the \"Internet Freedom and Family Empowerment Act\"--introduced in 1995 by Reps. Chris Cox (R-CA) and Ron Wyden (D-OR)--but was ultimately incorporated into the Telecommunications Act of 1996.</p><p>Section 230 provides broad--but not absolute--immunity for Internet intermediaries from legal liability for user-generated content. 47 U.S.C. [Sec.] 230(c)(1) states that \"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\"</p><p>This means Internet intermediaries that host third-party content are protected against a range of laws that might otherwise be used to hold them legally responsible for what their users say and do. Specifically, Section 230 provides immunity to platforms against liability under state law--whether criminal or civil--and against liability under federal civil law, but not under federal criminal law or copyright law.</p><p>At the same time, Section 230 protects companies when they choose to moderate their platforms. Indeed, part of the genesis of the law was a pair of defamation disputes where one company was held liable for content on its service, and the other was not, because the first company chose to moderate generally but failed to catch the defamatory statement. Section 230 remedied that disparity, providing a safe harbor for moderation. n2</p><p>In essence, Section 230 ensures that while Internet platforms.--ISPs, web hosting companies, webmail providers, blogging platforms, social media and review sites, online marketplaces, photo and video sharing platforms, and cloud storage providers--have limited liability for the speech on their platforms, they are also free to remove or restrict users or speech that have violated their standards or terms of service.</p><p>B. What Section 230 Does Not Do</p><p>It's also important to understand what Section 230 does not do. Section 230 has important exceptions: it doesn't provide immunity against prosecutions under federal criminal law, liability based on intellectual property law, electronic communications privacy law, or certain sex trafficking laws. For example, a federal judge in the Silk Road case correctly ruled that Section 230 did not provide immunity against federal prosecution to the operator of a website that hosted other people's ads for illegal drugs. n3</p><p>Courts have also held that Section 230 does not provide immunity against civil or state criminal liability where the company had a direct role in creating the content at issue or where liability is otherwise based on the company's own actions, rather than on user-generated content. For example:</p><p>. In Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley v. Roommates.com, LLC, the Ninth Circuit held that Roommates.com could not claim immunity under Section 230 where it required users to choose among set answers to questions that violated anti-discrimination laws. n4</p><p>. In Anthony v. Yahoo!, Inc., a district court held that Section 230 did not apply to claims against Yahoo! based on the company's own creation of false dating profiles and its tactic of sending users now-defunct profiles in order to entice them to re-subscribe. n5 Similarly, the Fourth Circuit explained in Nemet Chevrolet, LTD. v. Consumeraffairs.com, Inc. that Section 230 would not apply to claims that a platform had fabricated reviews of a plaintiff's business. n6</p><p>. In Barnes v. Yahoo!, Inc., the Ninth Circuit held that Section 230 did not bar a claim against Yahoo! based on the company's failure to take down a false profile of the plaintiff after a company employee assured her that it would be removed. The reason is that claim was based on Yahoo!'s failure to honor its promise to the plaintiff, not the user-generated content itself. n7</p><p>. In Doe v. Internet Brands, Inc., the Ninth Circuit held that Section 230 did not immunize a networking website from a \"failure to warn\" claim brought by one of its users who posted content to its site, because the plaintiff's claims did not derive from her content, but rather Internet Brands' own actions. n8</p><p>Thus, Section 230's safe harbor, while substantial, is significantly narrower than is often supposed.</p><p>Another common misconception is that Section 230 provides special legal protection only to \"tech companies.\" n9 For example, legacy news media companies often complain that Section 230 gives online social media platforms extra legal protections and thus an unfair advantage. In fact, Section 230 makes no distinction between news entities and social media platforms. When a news media entity operates online, it gets the exact same Section 230 immunity from liability based on someone else's content as a social media platform does. So, for example, news media entities have Section 230 immunity from any liability that arises from online comments that readers post to articles, or wire service stories or advertisements run online. n10 Conversely, a big tech company is not protected by Section 230 when it publishes someone else's content in print. That means, for example, that Airbnb can't use Section 230 to avoid liability based on user reviews or letters to the editor that it might publish in its new print magazine. n11</p><p>Nor is Section 230's protection limited to businesses. Instead, it provides immunity to any \"provider or user of an interactive computer service\" when that \"provider or user\" republishes content created by someone or something else. \"User,\" in particular, has been interpreted broadly to apply \"simply to anyone using an interactive computer service.\" n12</p><p>Finally, it bears repeating that Section 230 does not prevent Internet companies from removing unlawful or objectionable content. n13 To the contrary, as noted above, it encourages them to do so by protecting them from liability for actions \"taken in good faith to restrict access or availability\" of material they deem objectionable. To be clear, however, they do not have to do so in a \"neutral\" manner; n14 any such requirement would violate the First Amendment, which gives online platforms the choice about what speech they will and will not host.</p><p>C. Section 230 Helps Ensure the Internet's Growth as a Platform for Speech and Innovation</p><p>Section 230 has ushered in a new era of community and connection on the Internet. People can find friends old and new over the Internet, learn, share ideas, organize, and speak out. Those connections can happen organically, often with no involvement on the part of the platforms where they take place. Consider that some of the most vital modern activist movements--#MeToo, #WomensMarch, #BlackLivesMatter--are universally identified by hashtags.</p><p>The ways in which the Internet has grown as a platform for everyone to speak out go far beyond what lawmakers had imagined when they wrote Section 230. The freedom that Section 230 afforded to Internet startups to choose their own moderation strategies has led to a multiplicity of options for users--some more restrictive and sanitized, some more laissez-faire. That mix of moderation philosophies contributes to a healthy environment for free expression and association online. n15</p><p>Indeed, and perhaps ironically, Section 230 has also played a key role in the development of Internet filtering technologies and practices. While the technologies platforms use to find offensive speech remain deeply flawed, they've been allowed to evolve under the legal protections of Section 230. n16 Without those protections, the extremely high risk associated with letting a piece of unlawful content slip by would have discouraged platforms from improving them, and the filters on the market today would look much like notoriously flawed \"parental control\" tools of the 1990s. n17</p><p>Section 230 also plays an important role in preventing or limiting efforts to use legal threats to silence critics. Defamation law in particular is already frequently abused to silence and intimidate critics, including using legal process to unmask anonymous speakers solely for purposes of retaliation. n18 Without Section 230, bad-faith actors could wield these tactics equally effectively against not only the original author of the criticism but also anyone who forwards it, quotes it, or otherwise shares it online. For example, Section 230 unambiguously provides Rose McGowan immunity from defamation liability for sharing, via Twitter, stories that other women sent her about abuse by Harvey Weinstein.</p><p>But Section 230's beneficial effect is even more pervasive. A host of ordinary activities depend on Section 230's protections. Users can forward an email without worrying whether its contents might be deemed defamatory under some state's law. A library can host an online catalog that allows for reader reviews. A university can provide forums for students to share their work. A job search service can allow employees to share their views on a given employer. Wikipedia can offer a free online encyclopedia used by everyone from schoolchildren to judges. n19 And so on.</p><p>Section 230 was crafted before many of these services and activities existed, and it's easy to forget that it gives them legal shelter. In fact, for people who rely on online communities and services to share ideas, knowledge, and culture, Section 230 is more crucial today than ever before.</p><p>D.

Weakened Liability Protections Will Undermine Valuable Online Speech</p><p>a) Increased Liability Risk Will Lead to Over-censorship</p><p>Without Section 230--or with a weakened Section 230--online platforms would have to exercise extreme caution in their moderation decisions in order to limit their own liability. A platform with a large number of users can't remove all unlawful speech while keeping everything else intact. Therefore, undermining Section 230 effectively forces platforms to put their thumbs on the scale--that is, to remove far more speech than only what is actually unlawful, censoring innocent people and often important speech in the process.</p><p>The effects of 2018's Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) offer an object lesson. FOSTA amended Section 230 to create new civil and criminal liability for platforms that host content about sex work at both the state and federal levels. It also broadly and ambiguously expanded federal criminal law to target online platforms where users discuss sex work and related topics.</p><p>FOSTA's impact on Internet speech was apparent almost immediately after the law passed. Internet companies became significantly more restrictive toward speech discussing sex. n20 The law threw harm reduction activities in the sex work community into a legal gray area, giving the organizations providing support to sex workers the unpleasant choice of taking on a great deal of legal risk or ceasing operations. n21 Unfortunately, many of them chose the latter. Websites that sex workers relied on for sharing information about dangerous clients have gone offline, putting sex workers' lives at risk. n22</p><p>At the same time, platforms presented with new liability risks immediately moved to over-censor. For example, Craigslist completely removed its message boards dedicated to both personal ads and therapeutic services. The company could not individually review every post on those boards--and even if it could, it would not be able to reliably recognize every unlawful post--so it removed the boards altogether, punishing legitimate, lawful businesses in the process. n23 Similarly, Tumblr--a community which many LGBTQ users have said was vital to them as youth n24 --chose to ban all sexual content. Some smaller, niche personals sites either removed certain features or closed entirely. n25</p><p>Our founders knew that it is impossible to craft laws that only target bad actors, which is why the First Amendment protects most speech, even distasteful or \"indecent\" speech. Private enforcers face the same problem, and it will only worsen if a failure to enforce perfectly could lead to legal liability.</p><p>b) The Content Moderation System is Already Broken</p><p>For decades, EFF has followed the role of social media companies in providing platforms for users to speak and exchange ideas, including the recent surge in \"voluntary\" platform censorship.</p><p>That surge drew public attention in 2017 when a company called Cloudflare made headlines for its decision to take down a neo-Nazi website called The Daily Stormer. n26 But that was far from the only instance. Two years ago, for example, YouTube came under fire for restricting LGBTQ content. n27 Companies--under pressure from lawmakers, shareholders, and the public alike-- ramped up restrictions on speech, adding new rules, n28 adjusting their still-hidden algorithms, and hiring more staff to moderate content. n29 They have banned ads n30 from certain sources and removed \"offensive\" but legal content. n31</p><p>All of these efforts have, predictably, led to the silencing of all kinds of lawful speech. For example, social media platforms have been hard-pressed to remove violent extremism while keeping videos and other content documenting violent extremism intact. n32 We've seen prohibitions on hate speech employed to silence individuals engaging in anti-racist speech n33 and rules against harassment used to suspend the account of an activist calling out their harasser. n34</p><p>These mistakes are the result, in part, of an intractable problem: threats to free expression in real life and on the Internet don't always come in obvious packages, announcing their presence. They instead may come in the form of speech--describing hateful violence, aggression and despicable acts--that fair-minded people find appalling. The desire to remove this speech (and hopefully, the underlying prejudice) from public discourse is understandable, but fulfilling that desire is likely to lead to a host of unintended consequences for all online speech. Those on the left face calls n35 to characterize the Black Lives Matter movement as a hate group. In the Civil Rights Era cases that formed the basis of today's protections for freedom of speech, the NAACP's voice was the one attacked. n36</p><p>c) Moderation Decisions Often Privilege the Powerful</p><p>In addition, moderation choices often reflect and reinforce bias against marginalized communities. Indeed, for every high-profile case of despicable content being taken down, there are many more stories of people in marginalized communities and journalists finding their voices silenced online. Here are just a few examples:</p><p>* Instagram often deletes photos of transgender people and people of color while keeping nearly identical photos of white, cisgender people online. n37 Salty, a lifestyle magazine for women, transgender, and nonbinary readers, attempted to advertise on Instagram but had its advertisements rejected, apparently due to a misapplication of a rule banning advertisements for escort services. n38</p><p>* Under rules against online harassment, platforms frequently mistakenly punish the targets of harassment who are attempting to engage in counter-speech, rather than the perpetrators. n39</p><p>* Flickr removed photos of Egypt's state security force from a user's account claiming the takedown was because the user did not create the images himself. n40</p><p>* Facebook allows white supremacists to spread violent threats while censoring Black Lives Matter posts and activists of color. n41</p><p>* Twitter regularly removes ads related to sexual health and condoms but allows Playboy to promote its account freely. n42</p><p>* Egyptian journalist Wael Abbas has been censored by Facebook, Yahoo!, Twitter, and YouTube in connection with his work documenting police brutality. n43</p><p>* YouTube removed reports about the Syrian war because of rules against depictions of violence. n44</p><p>* Facebook removed posts about the military campaign against the Rohingya in Myanmar. n45</p><p>* Facebook also removed links on a small news weekly's page to an opinion column criticizing men for their complacency in light of several high-profile sexual assault and harassment scandals. n46</p><p>Problematically, companies' moderation policies also often feature exceptions for public figures: that's why the president of the United States can post false information but an ordinary user can't. While there's some sense to such policies--people should know what their elected representatives are saying--they necessarily privilege the powerful. n47</p><p>Given this background, we worry that the users most likely to be harmed by a weakened Section 230 are the people who most rely on online communities to safely gather and share information: racial and religious minorities, members of the LGBTQ community, and other marginalized groups. For some of those groups, online platforms provide safety and resources that aren't available anywhere else. As a group of South Dakota activists wrote in a letter to Senator John Thune:</p><p>[Section 230's] protections are uniquely important to South Dakotans: we rely on online communities to share our thoughts and ideas with friends across the country and around the world. For rural Americans, online communities often serve as our most important connection to likeminded friends. For people of color, members of the LGBTQ community, and other marginalized South Dakotans, online communities are our lifelines. n48</p><p>Online platforms can give power to the most vulnerable members of society. As EFF Chief Program Officer Rainey Reitman put it, \"Online communities let women make decisions from the safety of our homes about whom we can trust. When we're forced to make those decisions on the street, we're usually doing it from the wrong side of a power imbalance.\" n49 A weakened Section 230 means an Internet where some members of society aren't afforded that safety.</p><p>d) The Robots Won't Fix It</p><p>The situation worsens when we look to automation and algorithms to help enforce already confused policies. Machine learning algorithms are meant to grow and evolve on their own without human input, and they inevitably end up removing legal and often important speech.</p><p>For example, when Google launched its PerspectiveAPI tool, designed to measure the \"toxicity\" in online discussions based on feedback from users, users quickly noticed troubling results in how it would treat different user demographics, flagging statements like \"I am a gay woman\" and \"I am a black man\" as highly toxic. n50 And when blogging platform Tumblr turned to automated tools last year to enforce its ban on \"adult\" content, its filters flagged a wide variety of non-adult content, including images Tumblr itself has identified as acceptable and even ordinary drawings from patent applications. n51</p><p>Automation failures can have significant consequences for human rights. In Syria, human rights defenders have found the openness of the YouTube platform to be a major benefit to their efforts to document the conflict. Syrian activists have relied on both YouTube and Facebook to generate more hours of content than the length of the conflict itself, some of which has been collected for use in war crimes tribunals. But YouTube's automated filters have taken down thousands of Syrian channels that depicted human rights violations. Our joint investigation with Syrian Archive and Witness estimates that at least 206,077 videos, including 381 videos documenting airstrikes targeting hospitals and medical facilities, have been removed from the platform between 2011 and 2019. n52</p><p>Political criticism also suffers. For example, a video by Kurdish activist was flagged simply because it contained imagery that depicted Turkey's President Erdogan as a member of ISIS. n53</p><p>And state actors have systematically abused Facebook's flagging process to censor political enemies. n54</p><p>Further examples abound; EFF has documented a few of the most egregious ones in our \"TOSsed Out\" archive. n55</p><p>Building a more complicated filter--say, by using advanced machine learning or AI techniques--won't solve the problem either. That's because all complex machine learning systems are susceptible to what are known as \"adversarial inputs\"--examples of data that look normal to a human, but which completely fool AI-based classification systems. For example, an AI-based filtering system that recognizes sex trafficking posts might look at such a post and classify it correctly--unless the sex trafficker adds some random-looking-yet-carefully-chosen characters to the post (maybe even a block of carefully constructed incomprehensible text at the end), in which case the filtering system will classify the post as having nothing to do with sex trafficking. n56</p><p>Based on the track record of filters for copyright infringement, these problems were unfortunately predictable. YouTube's expensive and sophisticated Content ID system has a woeful track record at flagging noninfringing videos as copyright infringement, n57 including infamously flagging a video of nothing but static five times. n58 It is telling that even one of the most powerful Internet companies in the world, with powerful incentives, nonetheless still cannot filter reliably.</p><p>Finally, automated speech \"decisions,\" unlike those of courts, are often shrouded in mystery because the technology is hidden behind a veil of trade secrets and other assertions of proprietary information. When platforms like Facebook and YouTube create large databases of what they believe to represent \"terrorist\" content, the algorithm begins to define what it considers \"terrorist\" content to be, but few people in the human rights community, if any, have knowledge about how they're programmed. n59 Fionnuala Ni Aolain, a law professor and special rapporteur for the United Nations Human Rights Council, has been quoted as saying that Facebook's definition of terrorism \"bears no relationship to the global definition agreed by states,\" a development which she sees as \"a very dangerous precedent.\" n60</p><p>Given the value we place on free speech and access to information in the United States, we should be wary of giving control over both to a network of robot Star Chambers.</p><p>2. Raising the Cost of Hosting 3rd Party Speech May Help Also Cement the Dominance of Big Tech</p><p>As noted, Section 230 has played a key role in the development of the today's Internet industry. Without Section 230, Google, Facebook, and Twitter would not exist in their current form. It's understandable that some people who are concerned about the outsized power of the tech giants are drawn toward proposals to modify Section 230.</p><p>Unfortunately, any such attempt is likely to backfire. If Section 230 does nothing else, it helps pave the way for competition. As Professor Eric Goldman of Santa Clara University School of Law puts it, \"Even as Section 230 privileges the Internet giants, it also plants the seeds of their future destruction.\" n61</p><p>Simply put, Section 230 dramatically reduces the legal cost of hosting third-party speech. This allows Internet platforms both big and small, commercial and nonprofit, to operate at a global scale. Whether it's Wikipedia, the world's largest (and continuously growing) repository of information, staffed by a mere 350 people worldwide (approximately one third of the size of just Google's legal department); or the Internet Archive's 150 staff members that maintain an archive of the entire Internet on a budget of just $18 million a year; these types of massive global efforts would not exist without a strong Section 230.</p><p>Eviscerating Section 230, or imposing new burdens in exchange for immunity, would make those operations untenable (much less the smaller operations of many startups, websites, and community forums). The tech giants, by contrast, would have resources to shoulder those burdens. They also have the legal resources to fight off the lawsuits a weakened Section 230 would invite. n62 More generally, changing the formula after the fact only favors established companies that have used the law to establish a foothold while their would-be usurpers are forced to tread less certain legal waters. And if competing products don't exist, users cannot simply switch services as a means to discipline a company's conduct.</p><p>To see how this works now, we need only look to the example of the Grindr dating website, which was hardly a giant but was nonetheless financially successful. A subscriber misused the service as part of a harassment campaign targeting a former boyfriend, with terrible consequences for that person. The victim sued Grindr, alleging it failed to do enough to help stop the harassment, and the lawsuit garnered intense press coverage. Even though Grindr was not found liable under Section 230, users looking for a safer experience turned to alternative dating applications committed to tougher vetting and safety processes. n63 Those competitors were just as dependent on 230's protections as they experimented with moderation techniques as Grindr itself was.</p><p>We do not have to guess as to whether the potential impacts on profits would be sufficiently motivating for corporations to censor speech. We are witnessing it in real time today as corporations with financial entanglements in China willfully stifle expression on behalf of the Chinese government in order to preserve their access to lucrative markets. n64 There is little difference between preserving opportunities to increase profits in more censorship-oriented markets and eliminating their exposure to liability to a weakened Section 230 in order to protect profits.</p><p>Finally, competitive effects are another reason Congress should avoid pushing platforms toward more reliance on automated filtering. The cost of building and using automated systems for removing content makes these tools inaccessible for startups. For example, YouTube's Content ID system cost the company approximately $100 million. n65 For comparison, the Wikimedia Foundation (the organization that maintains Wikipedia and several other information-sharing tools) has an annual budget of $80 million. n66</p><p>E. (Further) Lessons from FOSTA</p><p>EFF is a part of the legal team representing the plaintiffs who are seeking to have FOSTA declared unconstitutional. n67 They include two human rights organizations, a digital library, a sex work activist, and a certified massage therapist.</p><p>All of those plaintiffs have one thing in common: thanks to FOSTA, their lawful speech and activities are now compromised. Woodhull Freedom Foundation and Human Rights Watch both advocate for decriminalization of sex work. While their advocacy is completely legal, FOSTA put them at risk. Alex Andrews works with several organizations to provide harm reduction resources to sex workers. Like Woodhull and Human Rights Watch, Ms. Andrews' work is legal, but thanks to FOSTA's broad prohibition on using the Internet to \"support\" sex work, has now been thrown into a legal gray area. Massage therapist Eric Koszyk advertised his services on Craigslist's therapeutic services section and has now lost a key income source.</p><p>But the plaintiffs have another thing in common: they represent the types of voices that were sadly missing from the congressional debate over FOSTA. Groups like Freedom NetworkUSA and the Sex Workers Outreach Project--both national networks of frontline organizations working to reduce trafficking--expressed grave concerns that FOSTA would put trafficking victims in more danger. n68 But those groups weren't invited to speak to Congress, and neither were Mr. Koszyk or other business owners whose work would be threatened by the law.</p><p>FOSTA teaches that Congress should carefully consider the unintended consequences of this type of legislation, recognizing that any law that puts the onus on online platforms to discern and remove illegal posts will result in over-censorship. Most importantly, it should listen to the voices most likely to be taken offline.</p><p>FOSTA also teaches that removing distasteful speech online may not have the hoped-for impact. At this committee's hearing on November 30, 2017, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation special agent Russ Winkler explained that online platforms were the most important tool in his arsenal for catching sex traffickers. n69 One year later, there is anecdotal evidence that FOSTA has made it harder for law enforcement to find traffickers. n70 Indeed, several law enforcement agencies report that without these platforms, their work finding and arresting traffickers has hit a wall. n71</p><p>This is not a new lesson. For example, while many have worried that playing violent video games lead to real-world violence, researchers have been unable to establish any causal link. n72 Similarly, before Congress takes steps to undermine Section 230 in the hopes that policing hateful speech will help reduce dangerous hateful activities, it should take care to examine the causal links, if any, so that it can legislate with a scalpel, not a hacksaw.</p><p>F. Remedies Exist Under Current Law That Do Not Conflict with 230</p><p>Critics of Section 230 often forget that the law already affords rights and remedies to victims of harmful speech when it causes injury. Arguments that the tools that disseminate speech such as Internet platforms, broadband providers, and applications must be held liable for the conduct of users wrongly discount this fundamental fact. A speaker who harms another is not free from the consequences of their actions.</p><p>In the infamous Grindr case mentioned above, for instance, the abuser was arrested two years ago under criminal charges of stalking, criminal impersonation, making a false police report, and disobeying a court order. n73 Backpage.com, a controversial website that was frequently cited in debates over FOSTA, was shut down by the FBI in April 2018--without any help from or need for FOSTA. n74</p><p>States have also crafted a whole range of laws that hold individuals personally responsible for their harmful conduct that make it clear there are consequences. There are state criminal penalties for both stalking and harassment and a whole panoply of civil and criminal statutes for conduct that causes physical harm to an individual. The courts can draft restraining orders that carry with them penalties for their violation. Many of these criminal laws also carry civil enforcement equivalents as well.</p><p>In addition to criminal charges, victims can use defamation, false light, intentional infliction of emotional distress, common law privacy, interference with economic advantage, fraud, anti-discrimination laws, and other civil causes of action to seek redress. They can also sue the platforms if the platform owner is itself creating the illegal content. But just as we do not hold telephone companies liable for crimes committed over the telecommunications system, Section 230 stands for the consistent proposition that building a tool that allows the dissemination of information should not result in liability for what other parties do with that tool.</p><p>To the extent Congress believes any currently existing remedies individuals may invoke are insufficient, we encourage the Committee to explore why they are insufficient and to carefully consider the collateral impacts any new remedies would yield. But I caution this committee to understand that there will be no law that will do a perfect job preemptively at all times.</p><p>G. Conclusion</p><p>Unfortunately, regulation of much of our online expression, thought, and association has already been ceded to unaccountable executives and enforced by minimally-trained, overworked staff and hidden algorithms. Nonetheless, many, especially in policy circles, continue to push for companies to perfectly differentiate--magically and at scale--between speech that should be protected and speech that should be erased. If our experience has taught us anything, it is that we have no reason to trust the powerful--inside governments, corporations, or other institutions--to draw those lines, and every reason to expect that the line-drawing processes will be abused.</p><p>Fighting censorship--by governments, large private corporations, or anyone else--has been core to EFF's mission for more than 25 years, not because we enjoy defending reprehensible content, but because we know that tools for censorship are more often used by the powerful, against the powerless. n75 And we are worried about proposals to force platforms to filter the content on their services not because there's a slippery slope from judicious moderation to active censorship--but because we are already far down that slope. Congress should not take us any further.</p><p>n1 2018 Annual Report, Electronic Frontier Found. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eff.org/files/annual-report/2018\">https://www.eff.org/files/annual-report/2018</url>.</p><p>n2 CDA 230: Legislative History, Electronic Frontier Found. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230/legislative-history\">https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230/legislative-history</url>.</p><p>n3 Cyrus Farivar, Judge denies Silk Road's demands to dismiss criminal prosecution, Ars Technica (July 9, 2014), <url normalizedValue=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/07/judge-denies-silk-roads-demands-to-dismiss-criminal-prosecution\">https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/07/judge-denies-silk-roads-demands-to-dismiss-criminal-prosecution</url>.</p><p>n4 Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley v.

An overwhelming majority of Americans want social media companies to moderate content to prevent disinformation, and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act clearly gives social media companies this authority. Social media platforms should use this authority.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Clearly, social media has been used to target and suppress Black voters. For example, while African Americans made up just 12.7 percent of the United States population, in 2016 Black audiences accounted for over 38 percent of U.S.-focused ads purchased by the Russian Internet Research Agency and almost half of the user clicks. The Russian social media accounts generally built a following by posing as being African American-operated and by paying for ads that social media companies distributed largely to Black users. Near Election Day, the accounts urged African Americans to \"boycott the election.\" We have seen similar schemes in the current election cycle, and social media companies need to take additional measures to protect voting rights in 2020.</p><p>Of late, President Trump has issued an executive order that attempted to narrowly construe Section 230 to expose social media companies to the risk of legal liability in retaliation for companies moderating objectionable content by President Trump and his followers.* n1 Retaliatory threats to discourage moderation by social media platforms only make the problem worse by effectively promoting disinformation, polarization, and voter suppression.</p><p>Although President Trump's executive order is misguided and constitutionally problematic, a serious debate on possible regulation of social media platforms is warranted in Congress. There are serious questions about whether social media platforms should be required to engage in reasonable content moderation to prevent disinformation that results in online civil rights and other legal violations.</p><p>While I am loathe to open up Section 230 to debate, the status quo is not working. Even in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd, there exists a real question about whether social media companies will address their own systemic shortcomings and embrace civil rights principles. Various social media platforms have been very effective at preventing obscenity and disinformation about COVID-19, for example, but have not effectively prevented disinformation that undermines to voting rights and other civil rights. The comparative lack of effectiveness seems to reflect not a lack of capacity, but a lack of will.</p><p>While some platforms claim they are advancing \"free speech\" in refraining from content moderation, in doing so they ignore the effect of the content on many communities of color and facilitate discrimination. For many Americans, Facebook and other social media are the primary platforms for political identity, social relationships, professional networking, and other opportunities. To treat discriminatory ad distribution that steers economic opportunities away from Black and Latino communities or steers voter suppression ads toward Black communities as \"neutral\" ignores the non-neutral harms and disparities produced by the platforms. It is not \"neutral\" for the world's most valuable companies to externalize the costs of discrimination onto many of the nation's most economically and politically marginalized communities.</p><p>My hope is that private social media companies will embrace civil rights as a core value and use the expansive protections of Section 230 to prevent voter suppression. If legal reforms are needed, the debates should occur in Congress and should center the voices of people of color who have been disproportionately affected by the negative consequences of social media through targeted voter suppression and other disinformation campaigns.</p><p>I. Disinformation Is Dividing Americans in 2020</p><p>Disinformation presents significant dangers to democracy due to social media's widespread use and the speed with which disinformation is disseminated. According to the most recent Pew Research survey published on the topic, a large percentage of U. S. adults get news on social media sites such as Facebook (43 percent), YouTube (21 percent), Twitter (12 percent), and Instagram (8 percent). n2 Disinformation can be quickly shared amongnetworks of friends (\"go viral\" n3) before the disinformation can be rebutted -- sometimes just before Election Day. n4 The anonymity of \"fake accounts\" on social media allows fringe domestic actors to avoid responsibility for misinformation, n5 and allows foreign interests to pose as Americans, build trust, and later undermine American interests. Microtargeting--which gathers information about the preferences and interests of users--allows those intending to deploy misinformation about elections the opportunity to target ads at those most likely to believe the misinformation, while steering it away from those more likely to challenge and correct the misinformation, thereby hardening polarization. n6</p><p>Federal intelligence officials recently revealed that Russia is currently interfering in 2020 elections through disinformation, and on June 18, 2020 the head of security policy at Facebook testified before Congress that the company disabled 1.7 billion fake accounts between January and March 2020 and had taken down \"18 coordinated networks seeking to manipulate public debate, including three networks originating from Russia, two from Iran and two based here in the United States.\" n7 The current efforts are similar to strategies used by Russia's Internet Research Agency to polarize Americans from 2015-2017, n8 when over 30 million users in the U.S. shared the Russian agency's Facebook and Instagram posts. n9</p><p>In an analysis of 31 posts linked to Russian Internet Research Agency from late 2019, University of Wisconsin professor Young Mie Kim found that the Russians were impersonating Americans n10 and were targeting \"both sides of the ideological spectrum to sow division.\" n11 The Russian Agency ' s social media campaigns \"exploit sharp political divisions already existing in our society\" and \"often create an 'us vs. them' discourse, feeding fear to activate or demobilize those who consider an issue personally important.\" n12 In her review of the recent posts, Professor Kim found that the Russian Agency's posts focused on \"racial identity/conflicts, anti-immigration (especially anti-Muslim), nationalism/patriotism, sectarianism, and gun rights.\" n13 See Exhibits A1, A2, and A3 for examples of posts from the current election cycle.</p><p>Disinformation and microtargeting that exploits emotion is not merely a foreign exercise, but is also employed by domestic political actors. In 2016, for example, Cambridge Analytica did not just use data on individuals' preferences, but created psychological profiles of individuals so that ads were tailored to particular users to exploit psychological vulnerabilities such as anxiety. n14</p><p>II. Targeted Disinformation Suppresses Votes</p><p>In addition to polarizing the electorate, fake social media accounts and targeted digital advertising have targeted and suppressed Black votes. n15 For example, on Election Day 2016, the operators of the Williams and Kalvin Facebook page -- ostensibly two Black men from Atlanta who ran a popular Facebook page focused on Black media and culture -- paid for and posted a Facebook ad. The ad proclaimed: \"We don't have any other choice this time but to boycott the election. This time we choose between two racists. No one represents Black people. Don't go to vote.\" n16 (See Exhibit B below).</p><p>The creators of the Election Day ad discouraging Black voting selected as audiences the Facebook microtargeting advertising categories of users interested in \"Martin Luther King, Jr.\"; \"African American Civil Rights Movement (1954-68)\"; and \"African American history or Malcolm X.\" n17 A video with the same message appeared on the Williams and Kalvin YouTube account and was also promoted on the Williams and Kalvin Twitter account.</p><p>After the November 2016 election, an investigation revealed that the Williams and Kalvin Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube accounts were fake accounts set up and operated by the Russian Internet Research Agency (the \"Russian Agency\"). The Williams and Kalvin Facebook page started operating at least as early as January 2016. n18 Many of its posts showcased Black achievements, Black dignity, and other positive affirmations of Black community. n19 Over time, regular posts on police violence, disproportionate levels of incarceration, disparate treatment in news media, and other structural inequalities had allowed Williams and Kalvin to establish a significant following among and credibility with Black users. n20</p><p>While African Americans make up just 12.7% of the U.S. population, 37.04% of the unique Facebook pages believed to be created by the Russian Agency were focused on Black audiences, n21 and these pages attracted 35.72% of the followers of the pages created by the Russian Agency. n22 Of the twenty U.S.-focused audience segments that the Russian Agency targeted on Facebook, just two segments -- \"African American Politics and Culture\" and \"Black Identity and Nationalism\" -- accounted for over 38% of the ads purchased, 46.96% of the user impressions, and 49.84% of the user clicks. n23 The Russian Agency paid Facebook 1,350,489 rubles (about $20,257) for 1,087 different ads for these two Black audience segments. The ad campaign resulted in 15,815,597 user impressions (users seeing the ad) and 1,563,584 user clicks (users engaging with the ad). n24</p><p>Similar trends occurred on other platforms. Of all of the U.S.-focused Russian Agency-generated YouTube content, 96% was related to the Black Lives Matter movement and police brutality. n25 The Russian Agency Instagram account with the most interactions was @blackstagram_______, with 303,663 followers, over 27.8 million likes, and over 450,000 comments. n26 The Russian Agency also disproportionately focused on African Americans on its Twitter accounts. n27</p><p>While the Russian Agency also created pages and ads that were targeted at and delivered to conservative groups in the United States, those pages warned of voter fraud and encouraged audiences to vote. n28 In contrast, the messages on Black-oriented pages either ignored the election, discouraged African Americans from voting, or encouraged African Americans to vote for a third-party candidate unlikely to win. n29</p><p>The 2016 presidential election marked the most significant declinein Black voter turnout on record -- falling from 66.6% in 2012 to 59.6% in 2016. n30 Political scientists, however, find it difficult to quantify the precise impact of voter deception through online targeted ads on election outcomes relative to other possible factors. n31</p><p>These same threats against Black voters on social media platforms continue in the 2020 election cycle. In March 2020, Facebook and Twitter acknowledged that they removed a network of Russian-backed accounts that originated in Ghana and Nigeria that targeted Black communities in the U.S. Just like the voter suppression campaign in 2016, the accounts posed as being operated by people in the United States (e.g., California, Florida, Louisiana, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina) and attempted to build an audience with Black Americans with posts focusing on Black history, Black excellence, and \"content about oppression and injustice, including police brutality.\" n32 (See Exhibit C below). The network consisted of 85 Instagram accounts (which had about 263,000 followers), 49 Facebook accounts, 69 Facebook Pages, and 71 Twitter accounts (which had 68,000 followers). In addressing the matter, Twitter acknowledged that in the 2018 midterms the vast majority of voter suppression and disinformation campaigns were domestic rather than foreign.</p><p>In analyzing Russian-linked posts from the current 2020 election cycle, Professor Kim of the University of Wisconsin did not identify any posts that discouraged African Americans from voting, perhaps because this type of voter suppression occurs just before elections. n33 Professor Kim did notice, however, that during the Democratic presidential primary the Russian Internet Agency targeted African Americans with an attack on Senator Kamala Harris (see Exhibit D below). n34</p><p>III. Americans Want Disinformation Removed</p><p>Americans have strong feelings against political disinformation. According to recent surveys by Gallup and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation conducted in December 2019 and March 2020, the vast majority of U.S. adults--81 percent--believe that social media companies should never allow intentionally misleading information on elections and political issues. n35 Of various types of content surveyed, the only other content that larger groups of respondents believed should never be allowed on social media were child pornography and intentionally misleading health and medical information.</p><p>Should social media companies allow intentionally misleading information on elections and political issues?</p><p>IV. Federal Law Allows Social Media Companies to Remove Disinformation</p><p>Federal law explicitly empowers private social media companies to remove disinformation--even if such content would be constitutionally-protected speech if removed by a state actor. Section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934 (also known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act) proclaims that platforms will not \"be held liable on account of . . . any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.. ,\" n36 Section 230 also protects social media platforms from being liable as publishers or speakers due to the content of information of third parties by stating: \"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\" n37</p><p>These provisions reflect Congress's intent to empower platforms to engage in content moderation without fear of liability. Section 230's drafters sought to repudiate a case that they, and ultimately Congress, believed was wrong. In Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Servs. Co., the trial court found that the internet service provider Prodigy was liable as a publisher for defamatory comments that a third-party user posted on Prodigy's financial bulletin board. Although Prodigy argued that it could not edit the thousands of messages posted to its bulletin board, the trial court reasoned that Prodigy used software to identify and delete \"notes from its computer bulletin board on the basis of offensiveness or 'bad taste.'\" n38 According to the trial court, by engaging in some content moderation Prodigy had opened itself to liability for all content, unlike a different case which held CompuServe was not liable for defamation for third-party content on its website because CompuServe did not attempt to filter any third-party content. n39</p><p>Members of Congress were disturbed by the holding, fearing that liability stemming from Prodigy's attempted but imperfect screening would not lead to improved content moderation, but no screening at all. n40 In the words of then Congressman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA):</p><p>[T]here is a tremendous disincentive for online service providers to create family friendly services by detecting and removing objectionable content. These providers face the risk of increased liability where they take reasonable steps to police their systems. A New York judge recently sent the online services the message to stop 36 37 38 39 40 policing by ruling that Prodigy was subject to a $200 million libel suit simply because it did exercise some control over profanity and indecent material. n41</p><p>As a result, Congress passed Section 230 to immunize \"interactive computer services\" such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube from liability for claims based on content created entirely by third-party users that they fail to take down. Section 23 0 ensures social media platforms can freely remove unsavory content by users without fear of becoming \"publishers\" who are suddenly liable for all third-party content. n42 As a U.S. Court of Appeals decision later explained, in enacting Section 230 \"Congress sought to encourage websites to make efforts to screen content without fear of liability.\" n43 Section 230 also allows for the development of movements like #MeToo, the Tea Party, and Black Lives Matter whose members make controversial allegations, because social media platforms can display this content without fear of being sued. n44</p><p>As they are empowered to do by Section 230, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other social media companies have developed specific content moderation guidelines to reduce the spread of false or misleading information about voting in elections, other false or misleading information, hate speech, threats of violence, and other objectionable content. n45</p><p>V. Executive Branch Retaliation for Content Moderation Promotes Disinformation and Undermines Democracy</p><p>Unfortunately, President Trump recently issued an executive order attempting to narrowly construe the protections of Section 230 in retaliation for Twitter enforcing its content moderation guidelines against the President. This executive order during an election season discourages social media companies from content moderation, which undermines democracy by effectively promoting disinformation, polarization, and suppression.</p><p>In response to concerns about the transmission of COVID-19 during in-person voting, many states have expanded vote-by-mail options, n46 and on May 26, 2020 at 5:17 am, President Trump tweeted the following in two tweets:</p><p>There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged and even illegally printed out and fraudulently signed. . . . The Governor of California is sending Ballots to millions of people, anyone . . . living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get one. That will be followed up with professionals telling all of these people, many of whom have never even thought of voting before, how, and for whom, to vote. This will be a Rigged Election. No way! n47</p><p>Later that day, Twitter attached a \"Get the facts about mail in-ballots\" notice to the President's tweets, which Twitter hyperlinked to a notice indicating the President's claim was \"unsubstantiated\" according to news outlets, and that experts indicate \"mail-in ballots are very rarely linked to voter fraud. n48 Twitter did not remove the President's tweets.</p><p>In response, President Trump tweeted \"Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen!\" n49 The following day he tweeted:</p><p>Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives [sic] voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen. We saw what they attempted to do, and failed, in 2016. We can't let a more sophisticated version of that . . . happen again. n50</p><p>Two days after his original tweet, President Trump issued an \"Executive Order on Preventing Online Censorship.\" n51 Although Section 230 clearly gives social media provider the power to in good faith \"restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or users considers\" to be \"objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected,\" the Executive Order directs several federal agencies to restrict significantly Section 230's protections to reflect the Administration's interpretation of the \"narrow purpose of the section.\" The Order directs government agencies to report their advertising spent on social media platforms so that it can be reviewed by the Department of Justice and takes several other steps.</p><p>While a serious debate on possible regulation of social media platforms by Congress is warranted (see below), the President's retaliatory executive order chills social media companies from moderating content during an election season. In this instance, a social media company was targeted and penalized not for removingthe President's content, but by providing facts that counter his narrative against a well-established form of voting that would make voting easier and safer for millions of Americans during a pandemic. The threatening nature of the executive order increases the likelihood that social media companies will fail to take down disinformation by fake accounts that provide erroneous information about voting and discourage voting by communities of color. The order increases the likelihood that social media companies will ignore posts that promote hate speech and facilitate racial polarization. This retaliatory use of executive branch power-- particularly during an election season--only promotes the likelihood of disinformation and suppression, and effectively undermines free and fair elections and democracy.</p><p>The President's legally-mandated viewpoint neutrality would worsen online experiences for many Americans. Social media companies could not remove threats, harassment, altered video, or misinformation. n52 They could not prevent bullying or cyber harassment of marginalized groups, or block sexual-privacy invasions. As non-state actors social media companies currently have the power to prevent these harms--but a \"viewpoint neutrality\" requirement would hinder this content moderation.</p><p>The executive order harms communities of color in other ways. Because executive branch agencies must report to the Office of Management and Budget the funds they spend on online advertising and the Department of Justice will review the spending to \"assess whether any online platforms are problematic vehicles for government speech due to viewpoint discrimination, deception to consumers, or other bad practices,\" federal agencies may be impaired in serving people in the United States. The Census Bureau, for example, could be deterred or prevented from using social media platforms to reach and count communities that are traditionally undercounted. The CDC may be impaired in its ability to use social media platforms to provide critical information about COVID-19 to communities with disproportionately high mortality rates.</p><p>Under the President's executive order, social media companies would be forced to moderate content according to the executive branch's perspectives. The solution is not the executive branch sanctioning particular content during an election season. While the President claims content moderation by private social media companies stifles free speech, the First Amendment was supposed to be a check against government--not against private entities. To give government the power to control information through ad hoc content moderation during an election season is more dangerous to our democracy and our constitution values than private entities engaging in content moderation. n53 As a result, litigation is now pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the President's executive order. n54</p><p>VI. Social Media Companies Need to More Effectively Protect Civil Rights</p><p>Disinformation on social media presents a real danger to racial equity, voting rights, and democracy. Social media companies currently have the authority in the United States to moderate content to prevent disinformation, civil rights violations, and voter suppression. They should use this authority.</p><p>While President Trump's executive order is misguided and constitutionally problematic, a serious debate on possible regulation of social media platforms is warranted in Congress. There are serious questions about whether social media platforms should be required to engage in reasonable content moderation to prevent disinformation that results in online civil rights and other legal violations. n55</p><p>While I am loathe to open up Section 230 to debate because the provision servessuch an important purpose, the status quo is not working. Even after the killing of George Floyd, there is a real question about whether social media companies will address their own systemic shortcomings and embrace civil rights principles and racial equity. Ab sent a clear declaration accompanied by action, those interested in racial equity and voting rights may have no choice but to seek to amend Section 230.</p><p>Various platforms--including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube--have been very effective at preventing other objectionable content--such as obscenity. Similarly, social media companies have been very effective in ensuring truthful information on COVID-19 because they perceived that disinformation on the coronavirus posed a public health risk. Unfortunately, some social media companies do not seem to have internalized the threat disinformation poses to the health of our democracy. The comparative lack of effectiveness in protecting racial equity and the voting rights of all Americans seems to reflect not a lack of capacity, but a lack of will.</p><p>For example, if America's most prominent social media company--Facebook--will not fully commit to civil rights principles, we have little hope of private actors dealing with this alone. Facebook has made some progress in recent years on voting, as evidenced by its civil rights audit and policy improvements documented in that audit, such as an expanded definition of voter suppression, a policy against \"don't vote\" ads, updated hate speech policy, a full-time team focused on protecting U.S. elections, and a center that provides accurate information on how to vote. n56</p><p>These efforts, however, do not fully address the real challenges to communities of color that the platform facilitates. Facebook claims it was caught unaware of the magnitude of the impact of the voter suppression schemes on Black communities in the 2016 election, but the same thing could happen in 2020. The current state of affairs is unacceptable.</p><p>For example, Facebook could have a more comprehensive definition of voter suppression, could prohibit any content that attempts to threaten voters from participating, and could be much more transparent and accountable in providing to outside groups data on voter suppression networks it identifies. Facebook could also enforce its standard content rules against politicians, who can currently post or buy ads that spread disinformation and racial division. n57 Another problematic example--Facebook has claimed that federal civil rights laws do not apply to the company--that the company can legally accept money to utilize their algorithms and data to target employment and housing ads away from Black and Latino users, and toward White users. n58 While the company later settled the lawsuit, n59 research suggests it still uses algorithms that deliver employment ads along discriminatory lines. n60 A third example--despite a recent ban on praise, support, and representation of White supremacy and White nationalism, n61 White supremacists continue to circumvent Facebook's policy. n62</p><p>While some platforms claim they are advancing \"free speech\" by facilitating discrimination, in doing so, they ignore the effect of the content on Black and other communities. For many</p><p>Americans, Facebook and other social media are the primary platforms for political identity, social relationships, professional networking, and other opportunities. To treat discriminatory ad distribution that steers economic opportunities away from Black communities or steers voter suppression ads toward Black communities as \"neutral\" ignores the non-neutral harms and disparities that result from the content moderation standards of the platforms. It is not \"neutral\" for the world's most valuable companies to externalize the costs of discrimination onto many of the nation's most economically and politically marginalized communities. n63 Facebook should not treat as \"neutral\" content that has a non-neutral impact.</p><p>Unfortunately, immediately after announcing its civil rights audit, Facebook announced a conservative bias audit, which falsely equated bigotry against protected classes on Facebook with anti-conservative bias. This approached civil rights as a partisan issue, instead of an issue of values.</p><p>As a bipartisan group of election experts recommended in April 2020:</p><p>Leaders in social media, election officials, government leaders, and others should promote the equal protection voting norm, enshrined in the Voting Rights Act and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, which ban targeting voters based on race or ethnicity in an effort to suppress or dilute their vote. Social media companies have a unique responsibility to prevent the use of their platforms for efforts that would suppress votes through the spread of misinformation about voting. n64</p><p>For Facebook, the conclusion of its civil rights audit represents a crossroads--it has an opportunity to take tangible action. My hope is that Facebook and other private social media companies will embrace civil rights values and use the expansive protections of Section 230 to prevent voter suppression and protect civil rights. If legal reforms are needed, the debates should occur in Congress, and should center the voices of people of color who have been disproportionately impacted by negative consequences of social media through targeted voter suppression and other disinformation campaigns.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Disinformation on social media is real. This disinformation is being used by both foreign and domestic actors to deepen divisions among Americans, and if unchecked could again result in voter suppression. The vast majority of Americans believe that social media companies should never allow intentionally misleading information on elections and political issues, and federal law explicitly gives social media companies the power to moderate content and prevent disinformation. Social media companies should commit to civil rights principles and moderate content to protect voting rights and equity.</p><p>Exhibits</p><p>Exhibits A1, A2, and A3 are from Instagram in September 2019, and were removed for links to the Russian Internet Research Agency. n65</p><p>Exhibit A1</p><p>Exhibit A2</p><p>IF WHITE PRIVILEGE EXISTED, WHY DID ELIZABETH WARREN HAVE TO SPEND DECADES LYING ABOUT HER ETHNICITY TO GET AHEAD?</p><p>Exhibit A3</p><p>Exhibit B</p><p>Exhibit B was posted by the operators of the Williams and Kalvin Facebook page on Election Day 20 1 6, n66 and the Facebook ad was targeted at the advertising categories of those interested in \"Martin Luther King, Jr.\"; \"African American Civil Rights Movement (1954-68)\"; and \"African American history or Malcolm X.\" n67 A video with the same message appeared on the Williams and Kalvin YouTube account and was also promoted on the Williams and Kalvin Twitter account.</p><p>Exhibit C</p><p>Exhibit C is from a Facebook page that claimed to be operated by someone in Florida and was removed because it was actually a Russian-backed Ghanaian operative that was targeting African Americans in January of 2020. n68</p><p>Roots Revival</p><p>January 21 - Q</p><p>America's descent into a fascist police state continues..

In the two plus decades since the creation of the internet, we have seen life for Americans and their families transformed in many positive ways. The internet provides new opportunities for commerce, education, information, and connecting people.</p><p>However, along with these many new opportunities, we have seen new challenges. Bad actors are stalking the online marketplace using deceptive techniques to influence consumers, deceptive designs to fool them into giving away personal information, stealing their money, and engaging in other unfair practices.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission works to protect Americans from many unfair and deceptive practices, but a lack of resources, authority, and even a lack of will has left many American consumers feeling helpless in the digital world.</p><p>Adding to that feeling of helplessness, new technologies are increasing the scope and scale of the problem. Deepfakes, manipulated video, dark patterns, bots, and other technologies are hurting us in direct and indirect ways.</p><p>Congress has unfortunately taken a laissez faire approach to regulating unfair and deceptive practices online over the past decade and platforms have let them flourish.</p><p>The result is big tech failed to respond to the grave threat posed by deep-fakes, as evidenced by Facebook scrambling to announce a new policy that strikes me as wholly inadequate, since it would have done nothing to prevent the altered video of Speaker Pelosi that amassed millions of views and prompted no action by the online platform. Hopefully our discussion today can change my mind.</p><p>Underlying all of this is Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which provided online platforms like Facebook a legal liability shield for 3rd party content. Many have argued that this liability shield resulted in online platforms not adequately policing their platforms, including online piracy and extremist content. Thus, here we are, with big tech wholly unprepared to tackle the challenges we face today.</p><p>A topline concern for this subcommittee must be to protect consumers regardless of whether they are online or not. For too long, big tech has argued that ecommerce and digital platforms deserved special treatment and a light regulatory touch. We are finding out that consumers can be harmed as easily online as in the physical world. And in some cases, the online dangers are greater. It's incumbent on this subcommittee to make clear that protections that apply to in-person commerce also apply in the virtual space. I thank the witnesses for their testimony, and I recognize Ranking Member Rodgers for five minutes.</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/01072020%20CPC%20Hearing%20Deepfakes%20Opening_JDS_FINAL__0.pdf\">https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/01072020%20CPC%20Hearing%20Deepfakes%20Opening_JDS_FINAL__0.pdf</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COSHC108006Z3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY1-42M1-JCCP-00N9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"473\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 8, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Tech has become the infrastructure that manage civilization's global \"social organs\" and our personal lives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">. Broadcast: YouTube's algorithms have effectively become the video broadcast infrastructure for the world, without any of the regulations that used to protect children or other ethical standards.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">. Social Relationships: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram have become the infrastructure for making sense of our social world - shaping how we determine what the majority of people around us seem to believe or agree with, how popular or influential people are, how happy our ex-romantic partners seem to be, even how we track each other's psychological health.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">. Democracy: Micro-targeting and lookalike models through Facebook and Google Ads have become the infrastructure for competing in elections, without any of the regulations ensuring equal-price slots for political candidates as regulated on TV.</p><p>. Children: While children may spend hours at school, they often spend more hours per day on their devices and platforms like YouTube, TikTok or Snapchat - often while at school - effectively becoming the infrastructure for children's development and learning.</p><p>. Family and Relationships: Look around you at dinner tables in homes or at restaurants, smartphones have intermediated the private spaces that used to make up family time and meals, and set the background for our relationships.</p><p>. News: Facebook's algorithms have become the news and social commentary infrastructure for 2.7 billion people.</p><p>. Communications: WhatsApp, Instagram or FB Messenger have become the primary communications infrastructure for one-to-many broadcast communication.</p><p>Consider the scale. Facebook has more than 2.7 billion users, more than the number of followers of Christianity. YouTube has north of 2 billion users, more than the followers of Islam. Tech platforms arguably have more psychological influence over two billion people's daily thoughts and actions when considering that millions of people spend hours per day within the social world that tech has created, checking hundreds of times a day. In several developing countries like the Philippines, Facebook has 100% penetration. Philippines journalist Maria Ressa calls it the first \"Facebook nation.\"</p><p>But what happens when infrastructure is left completely unprotected, and vast harms emerge as a product of tech companies' direct operation and profit?</p><p>Social Organs of Society, Left Open for Deception</p><p>These private companies have become the eyes, ears, and mouth by which we each navigate, communicate and make sense of the world. Technology companies manipulate our sense of identity, self-worth, relationships, beliefs, actions, attention, memory, physiology and even habit-formation processes, without proper responsibility. Technology has become the filter by which we are experiencing and making sense of the real world. In so doing, technology has directly led to the many failures and problems that we are all seeing: fake news, addiction, polarization, social isolation, declining teen mental health, conspiracy thinking, erosion of trust, breakdown of truth.</p><p>But while social media platforms have become our cultural and psychological infrastructure on which society works, commercial technology companies have failed to mitigate deception on their own platforms from deception. Imagine a nuclear power industry creating the energy grid infrastructure we all rely on, without taking responsibility for nuclear waste, grid failures, or making sufficient investments to protect it from cyber attacks. And then claiming that we are personally responsible for buying radiation kits to protect ourselves from possible nuclear meltdowns.</p><p>By taking over more and more of the \"organs\" needed for society to function, social media has become the de facto psychological infrastructure that has created conditions that incentivize mass deception at industrialized scales. There are three core aspects of the problem:</p><p>1) For-profit companies operating for private interest have taken over critical, intimate functions in society that should -- and used to -- operate in the public interest. Instead of operating for the public good they operate to their own benefit. Even though they have sensitive information about each of us, involuntarily given due to their infrastructure role, they are not required to treat that information with sensitivity -- with regard to the wellbeing of the people or the cultures that they inherently affect.</p><p>2) The infrastructure they built has both enabled and been left vulnerable to mass deception and manipulation by: a) Directly taking advantage of our psychological vulnerabilities (self-image, addiction, infinite scrolling feeds) to capture attention necessary for their profits,</p><p>b) Automating that attention with gameable algorithms and impersonated user identities, and</p><p>c) Renting access to the manipulation and targeting of our deepest vulnerabilities with unprecedented precision for advertising purposes, unreviewable by any real regulatory process. The amount of deception that can be created far exceeds that of any realistic process of review. Technology companies have covertly \"tilted\" the playing field of our individual and collective attention, beliefs and behavior to their private commercial benefit. Naturally, these tools and capabilities tend to favor the sole pursuit of private profit far more easily and productively than any \"dual purpose\" benefits they may also have at one time -- momentarily -- and occasionally had for culture or society.</p><p>3) Once becoming the obligate infrastructures that manage civilization's global \"social organs\" they have lead to myriad individual and collective harms (isolation, anxiety, depression, suicide, polarization, war). Because this loss of unmediated interpersonal communication and relationship is beyond the means of the public to fight back or change, it is the equivalent of extortion. These platforms pollute the information environment and are damaging to all forms of public deliberation and society, indirectly leading to many other collective problems (disease, pollution, collapse and other environmental damage).</p><p>Further critical and consequential outcomes occur on top of these lower level infrastructures managed by private companies, including the upbringing and education of the next generation, our national psychological health, and the information environment that determines the outcome of elections.</p><p>While tech has taken over each \"organ\" of the social fabric, they have failed to also take responsibility for managing that system in a healthy and integrated way. They are inherently acting in ways which are deeply harmful to the communities that they claimed they were in service to -- \"to connect all the people,\" so that they could \"live more meaningful lives.\" While this is the dream, it is not the reality.</p><p>The private tech company takeover of social process poses enormous harms and risks to the people and to those societies that are using this tech, along with the greater civilization. Deep Fakes dismantle our shared capacity to make sense of the world, to determine what is true, what is real, and what we can or should trust. This leads to all sorts of consumer product advertising and marketing issues, hijacking of our election process, and creating a situation in which the most deceptive and least moral actors win, without accountability.</p><p>Truth Loses</p><p>Truth loses. In an MIT Twitter study, n1 fake news spread six times faster than true news. Someone limited to speaking only truths is constrained, it takes time and energy to investigate and carefully articulate accurately what is true. By contrast, those speaking falsehoods are unconstrained. You can say anything without exerting any energy to censor yourself. In a competition between the two, the least constrained (least ethical actor who's willing to say whatever works) wins. This incentivizes a \"race to the bottom of the brain stem\" to go lower and lower into unconstrained, fear, outrage, existential, trust-destroying conspiracy thinking to win. If you don't play the game, you lose.</p><p>Deception and distortion of our relationships, narrative, and social lives, of our sense of community meaning, takes advantage of our innate human vulnerabilities -- the psychological bias that we all have built in. The development of tools for advertisers to leverage our natural social interests is at the root of what has gone wrong in our current use of technology. Both individually and collectively, the unrestrained use of content amplification and context manipulation capabilities are dismantling, directly disrupting, and disabling our democracy -- our great nation is at risk of ruin.</p><p>They Have Become a \"Digital Frankenstein\" That is Out of Control</p><p>The manipulation-for-profit (MFP) business model of large technology companies (Facebook, YouTube, Instagram or TikTok) are existential to the sustainability of the societies in which they operate, and cannot be allowed to continue with their current business model.</p><p>This manipulation occurs at multiple levels - manipulating our lizard brains to keep people hooked, and then using automated systems for routing content and ads that cannot distinguish between what is true or deceitful (fake accounts, fake users, deep fakes vs. regular content), because it is not profitable to pay actual human editors.</p><p>In each case, in support of paid marketing, technology enables the mass deception of consumers to think that things which are unhealthy are \"good for them,\" that things which are false are \"popular knowledge,\" and that things which are actually dangerous are \"in the public good.\" Most of what is causing harm in technology can be broken down into exploitation of human weaknesses:</p><p>- Netflix exploits our reliance on stopping cues to keep kids and adults alike binge watching and losing sleep.</p><p>- \"Likes\" and \"filters\" exploit teens' need for social validation and approval from others.</p><p>- Notification sounds (\"you have mail!\") exploits operant conditioning and habit formation to expect frequent rewards.</p><p>- Infinite scrolling feeds, \"pull to refresh\" notifications are designed to operate like slot machines, offering \"intermittent variable rewards\" as you check for notifications, maximizing addiction.</p><p>- Moral outrage exploits our vulnerability to anger, fast agreement and desire for tribe membership.</p><p>- Fake news and conspiracy theories exploit our need for significance and confirmation bias -- that what we feel is more important than what we think.</p><p>- Deepfakes (including bots, deeptext, etc) exploit the shortcuts our brains rely on to discern what's authentic or trustworthy, and have now become completely and fundamentally indistinguishable from the real thing. This is a trust-breaking deception. This is \"checkmate.\"</p><p>A vehicle that results in people more likely getting hurt in car accidents is a product that could be purchased or not, or perhaps purchased from some other maker, because they had a better safety design and public reports. And there are regulations concerning what vehicles will be allowed on the road. Yet Metcalfe's law \"winner take all\" dynamics ensures that everyone is involved -- willingly or not -- in social media.</p><p>It is like the choice of a community to accept that some company wants to build a nuclear power plant. The people in the surrounding community will be affected, if something goes wrong, regardless. And in such an event, we do not expect that the general public to be responsible -- to have their own radiation detectors, or hazmat suits, or to deal with radiation, fallout, etc. With infrastructure, the level of responsibility should be higher than it would for an automobile manufacturer. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission puts policies in place to protect the people, when it is clear that asking them to handle the hazards -- to make them responsible for the errors of the company -- is simply inappropriate. When radiation is everywhere, what does it mean to move away?</p><p>It is not a personal responsibility for people to protect themselves from grid attacks, from nuclear waste issues, from chemical spills, quack doctors, toxic food vendors, or anything else which is inherently a commons or utility. Asking \"individuals\" to be responsible for pollution effects of a business, or to assume that an industry can \"regulate itself\", is like asking a passenger to \"be responsible\" for flying the 737 Max plane, or to \"take care of themselves\" in a crash. Creating unsafe aircraft is not a pilot problem, nor is it a \"personal problem.\" Dangerous and addictive drugs are FDA \"controlled substances\" for a reason. Gambling must be licensed and sanctioned by the state.</p><p>When you create infrastructure that millions or billions of people rely on for the daily function of their lives and their social contracts (information, news, etc.) you become responsible for the harms, direct or indirect, created by that infrastructure. This is the message of responsibility that we need to teach tech companies -- like all other types of infrastructure businesses -- to adhere to.</p><p>Unless the government acts, the competition between technology businesses' never-ending interest in capturing human attention, will irreversibly dismantle the information environment, accelerate polarization leading towards civil war, degrade the mental health of a generation of children and teenagers, and break down the basis for trust itself, leading to market collapse and near permanent civil disorder.</p><p>Currently, social tech companies are building infrastructure -- but they are not acting responsibly -- for the harms that that infrastructure is creating at both personal and societal levels. Therefore, the government must act, and not expect the industry regulate itself. It is not possible for an industry run on optimizing quarterly profits to think in the long term. Yet, it is inherent in the creation of public infrastructure to imply public responsibility and policy.</p><p>Therefore, as with all other forms of public works, infrastructure, and common utility, there is also with social tech, media, and communications companies, now a need for similarly clear, effective, and actionable government process, policy, and law, holding such commons infrastructure implementations to reasonable and responsible standards, designed to promote the public good. New law is needed to protect the health and welfare of the consumer, culture, and community, to restore and maintain the value of the commons, the practice of free and open commerce, and the vitality and utility of the digital environment as a whole.</p><p>Our current use and deployment of technology is not properly aligned with the limits and vulnerabilities of human nature. It is currently being implemented in a way to weaken us and to disadvantage nearly everyone, so as to favor only a few. Most of what is going wrong with technology today -- harming and deceiving the consumer -- is based on this misalignment.</p><p>Dismantled Shared Truth - The \"Flint Water Supply\" of Information</p><p>By creating 2.7 billion \"Truman shows\" (personalized channels of automated news feeds) keeping us engaged for hours by calculating what will most likely keep us glued to screens, social media has taken the shared narratives and facts that make society function and put it through an industrial-grade meat shredder.</p><p>Newspapers thought they were in the truth business but found out they were actually in the attention business. It costs money to pay journalists and editors that ultimately generate the attention sold to advertisers.</p><p>By allowing technology platforms to take the role of an information environment without journalistic standards, long-form investigation, fact-checking and some notion of care, we suffer the consequences. Exponential hearsay, gossip, \"BREAKING\" news, and cynical \"hot take\" commentary generated by the most outrageous voices have become the default information flows that make up how we see reality.</p><p>We are the free \"gig workers\" of the attention economy. Instead of investing in journalists and their protection, Facebook and YouTube turned each of us into unpaid \"contractors\" who create posts and share links to gain the attention of our friends to look at what we post, and doing it for free by manipulating to our honest desires for belonging and purpose. This has destroyed our way of making sense in the world.</p><p>This is not normal, and it is not sustainable. It is the \"Flint water supply\" of information run by privately-interested tech platforms.</p><p>Addiction and Public Health</p><p>What we call addiction is when technology manipulates and deceives our dopamine reward systems (\"pull to refresh!\" like a slot machine), our physiological workings of habit formation (link habit X with action Y), our reliance on stopping cues (\"is there an end to scrolling this feed?\"), and manipulation of vanity and desire for attention from others (\"Look, I got more followers today than I did last week!\"). Even Facebook's own founding president, Sean Parker, admitted that he, along with the founders of Instagram, Mark Zuckerberg, and others, knew they were designing their products to exploit vulnerabilities in human psychology and \"we did it anyway.\" n2</p><p>Most of all, this affects kids and teenagers. We are raising a generation of children who are more distracted, less creative, more narcissistic, and more vulnerable to bullying and teen suicides than in the last few decades. While we glorify U.S. tech companies as the crown jewels of our economy, we are profiting off of the harm to our own children, cannibalizing our national longevity and the well-being of our citizens.</p><p>Bragging about the U.S. economic growth from our most harmful tech companies, is like bragging about getting a plastic surgery while suffering from congestive heart failure. The organs that make up our society are failing.</p><p>Social Pressure and Deception of Self-Image</p><p>Social media is harming teenagers. After nearly two decades in decline, \"high depressive\" symptoms for 13-18 year old teen girls rose 170% between 2010 - 2017 which researchers such as NYU sociologist Jonathan Haidt link directly to social media n3. Tech products using beautification filters like Snapchat have led to \"Body Dysmorphic Disorder\" - where people's self-image is distorted by beautification filters, is harming mental health. In a survey of plastic surgeons, 55% said they'd seen patients whose primary motivation was to look better in selfies, up from 13% in 2016 n4. On YouTube, two years ago if a teen girl searched for \"dieting\" videos, the recommendation systems would recommend \"anorexia\" videos because they were better at keeping attention. n5</p><p>Is it surprising that mental health problems surge when millions of kids negotiating their identity in public with immediate feedback are taught, \"people like you... if only you looked different than you actually are.\"</p><p>Each time a child is admitted to a hospital, there is a real-life family dealing with a tragedy.</p><p>Moreover, parents are trapped in a \"game\" of social pressure controlled by companies that capture enough children in a community that essentially force all other children in that school or community to be on their service. Parents feel intense pressure to give in and let middle school kids have it only because everyone else has it.</p><p>A chart of High-depressive symptoms for teenage girls -- whose sense of personal self-worth is much more likely to be defined in terms of the currency of the attention of their peers -- rose 170% between 2010 and 2017.</p><p>Conspiracy Theories, Deepfakes and the Basis of Trust</p><p>70% of YouTube's traffic is driven by its recommendation engine. Multiplied by two billion people that use YouTube, this has vast consequences. Because the recommendation system is automated, it does not know what's valuable, ethical, or credible beyond what got the most clicks or watchtime.</p><p>Inadvertently, YouTube's algorithms have recommended countless conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theories like Flat Earth were recommended by YouTube hundreds of millions of times. Alex Jones InfoWars conspiracies were recommended 15 billion times before being removed.</p><p>While it might sound innocuous and funny, the Flat Earth conspiracy is particularly damaging because if taken seriously, it means that all of science and the entirety of government has been lying to the public. It means you can't trust any of science. That sentence is worth repeating.</p><p>Conspiracies are \"trust bombs\" because they eliminate all faith in science, reason and institutions. Using bot networks to amplify \"the Election is rigged\" becomes a common doubt -- people are disenfranchised and no longer vote. Authoritarian regimes are recognizing their power to use these effects deliberately. In the Philippines, there is evidence of populist movements behind authoritarian president Roderigo Duterte promoting the Filipino Flat Earth conspiracies groups to sow distrust in the media and scientific establishment. n6</p><p>Conspiracies can have lasting effects for decades. Famously, a Soviet disinformation campaign in 1983 seeded the idea that the HIV virus raging across the world was a bioweapon released by the United States, based on an anonymous n7 letter published in an Indian newspaper, and ended up becoming widely believed among those predisposed to distrust the Reagan administration. From Russian disinformation researcher Renee DiResta, \"As late as 2005, a study showed n8 that 27 percent of African Americans still believed that HIV was created in a government lab.\" n9</p><p>Mass Deception - Trolling Elections, Civil Wars, and Geopolitics</p><p>Our minds operate on the principle of social proof: if others believe it and say it's true, we're more likely to believe that it's true. But with social media, it's never been easier to synthesize fake consensus, as detailed by this Russian troll:</p><p>\"We did it by dividing into teams of three,\" he said. \"One of us would be the 'villain,' the person who disagrees with the forum and criticizes the authorities, in order to bring a feeling of authenticity to what we're doing. The other two enter into a debate with him -- 'No, you're not right; everything here is totally correct.' One of them should provide some kind of graphic or image that fits in the context, and the other has to post a link to some content that supports his argument. You see? Villain, picture, link.\" n10 - interview with Russian troll Foreign actors have also gone after U.S. veterans communities online to sow distrust of the military and government. In a report by social media research analytics firm Graphic telling the House Veterans Affairs Committee, Russia-linked ads from the 2016 election found \"at least 113 ads directed at veterans, or which used veterans as props in Russia's mission to divide Americans. \"Foreign actors have been targeting U.S. veterans across social media for at least eight years\" Vlad Barash, says Graphicka's science director.</p><p>To this day, even after Twitter and other platforms have banned paid political ads, it's still incredibly cheap to buy influence as this is still the fundamental business model and it's impossible for them to fully distinguish paid political speech from any other speech. NATO recently discovered \"At a cost of just 300 euros (about $333), NATO StratCom bought 3,530 comments, 25,750 likes, 20,000 views and 5,100 followers across the four platforms.\" n11</p><p>Moreover, it's never been easier to impersonate being someone you're not. In one quarter alone, Facebook shut down 2.2 billion fake accounts. Tech platforms leave the doors open to anyone who would want to create a fake account to impersonate anyone else -- so as to maintain plausible deniability. While we have been obsessed with closing down and protecting our physical borders, we've left the digital borders wide open for abuse by any actor.</p><p>Keeping in mind that Facebook and YouTube's commanding the daily attention of more than two billion users for hours a day, a psychological footprint greater than the followers of the Christian church, technology has become the de facto information environment by our civilization makes sense of the world: what is real, and what is true.</p><p>Platforms have disrupted the psychological logistics, by eliminating the capacity for people to have trust in what is true, our capacity to agree, or build consensus and take action instead of feeling hopeless. DARPA calls this \"reality jamming\" and the RAND Corporation calls this \"truth decay.\"</p><p>The risks of disinformation continue to escalate into serious potential problems. The consequences can range from internal polarization, functionally biased elections, civil wars, escalation of international disputes to nuclear-armed conflict, as a civilization as a whole, all the way up to whether we can agree on whether we are actually facing existential threats at all. A report by the Toda Peace Institute's stated, \"we have already seen six instances of social media playing a role in nuclear-prone conflicts occurring between August 2017 and January 2018\" in the Asia-Pacific region. n12</p><p>Will China Win? Or Will Democracy Survive?</p><p>Today's technology platforms have put our civilization into tremendous danger. If we continue to let the big tech company platforms continue to enable civilization's regression into a \"Digital Dark Age\", it will also be the case that the government will have failed its basic job to protect the land and the people.</p><p>The real problem of humanity is that we have Paleolithic emotions, Medieval institutions, and God-like technology. -- Dr. E.O. Wilson</p><p>Our human physiology isn't changing any time soon -- it evolves over many millennia. But our technology is growing exponentially more powerful, over a trillion times since the computer was invented in 1946.</p><p>Technology can either be used to create a kind of robustness that makes society and democracy work, or it can be used to disable that democracy completely. The culture, incentives, and protections must be shaped so technology's god-like power is always in service to human values -- never the other way around. Any other arrangement is catastrophic to the human race, as god-like powers are expressed outside the control and wise guidance of humanity.</p><p>We can live in a world of humane technology. One that is built on protecting the vulnerabilities and limits of human nature. It can align with the development of human sovereignty. To do that -- to have any possibility of a bright future -- we must give up the desire to allow it to continue to be used to exploit our natural human weaknesses.</p><p>Technology is not going away. We can't put the genie of these god-like powers back in the bottle. Technology can -- and must -- be implemented and used in a manner that is consistent with healthy society, communities, and the world.</p><p>Therefore, we must tame the tech, regulate its business model for the common good of the people, as the temptation to misuse it to take \"advantage\" of someone's short sighted personal ends, is too great for any one of us to manage by ourselves. We must reign-in such forces into an alignment with the well-being of our communities.</p><p>It is natural, therefore, to suggest that the government put regulations in place around any industry and its products, services and procedures, to prevent societal harms and/or to harness the technology in salutary ways - like any other fundamental infrastructure we live by, whether that's the auto industry, electric/power utilities, roads and transportation, or anything else.</p><p>Most people recognize the need and the benefits of government regulating various aspects of industries that operate common infrastructure. The Big Five -- Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple -- is the new infrastructure of our social fabric. Representative democracies have the right to put the rules around companies that society has determined are necessary. Why should these Big Tech companies be any different?</p><p>Why should any private infrastructure company be allowed to collect, store or in any way use or manipulate our personal data? After all, the Post Office can't do it, FedEx and UPS can't do it. There are many businesses that are not allowed to use our data - whether personal data or location data - in these sorts of toxic ways. So why not just regulate the social tech infrastructure companies, and their services, the way these other businesses are regulated?</p><p>Federal criminal laws are designed to deter and punish trafficking in stalking and harassment by means of computer. If we define \"stalking\" as following the user everywhere, tracking and collecting photos and notes about everything that they are doing, as if every person in the world was a paparazzi target; then perhaps we should regard that each social infrastructure tech company is *stalking* each and every user on their platform, at industrial scales. If so, then there is a clear and present need for an anti-stalking law, to protect our children, ourselves, and our communities, from digital surveillance capitalism.</p><p>Some possible policy directions that can be explored:</p><p>- 1) Mandate a \"Digital Update\" to each of the regulatory bodies already charged with doing their job on these problems. Instead of creating a brand new Digital Federal agency to regulate all digital matters, we could extend all the existing agencies who already have jurisdiction over the areas with a \"digital update\" to deal with the public health, public education, election and broadcast issues, etc. The SEC could monitor fraud from tech platforms in the form of fake clicks, fake users and mandate regular reporting from tech companies. HHS and NIH could force quarterly reporting by technology companies on how many users are addicted, depressed, isolated etc for addressing the public health, addiction and teen suicide aspects, with quarter goals set with tech companies to issue product updates to address the problems. A \"Digital Update\" would also be popular with the American public who are increasingly alarmed about these issues and want to see government act to update our medieval institutions for the 21st century, let alone the 2020 decade.</p><p>- 2) Apply the principles of broadcast law to technology platforms that enable broadcasting of matching scale and reach, without any of the responsibility. There should be restrictions on developing and/or deploying tools for the creation of weaponized disinformation campaigns, or for the creation, dissemination, or distribution of ads targeting children, seniors, mentally disabled or developmentally disadvantaged, or other vulnerable populations. In the same way that you cannot simply just sell automatic weapons to anyone, that you cannot also grant unlimited broadcast license, beyond certain volumes, to just anyone who wants it.</p><p>- 3) Require tech platforms that have asymmetrically powerful and sensitive information about what influences users' or communities' behavior and beliefs to have Fiduciary responsibilities to that membership. We can't have private companies that privately profit for their own self-interest, while dumping harm and excess risk onto the balance sheets of society. Business interest cares about short-term self-interest, not long-term, societal-scale issues. We need government to represent the common long-term interest and well-being.</p><p>- 4) Decouple profit from attention and clean up the attention economy. Explore making attention, social, and voting manipulation markets should be illegal.</p><p>- 5) Put sane limits on the development and/or deploying of tools and technologies designed for the purpose of social capital value mining, extraction, and the aggressive re-purposing of cultural norms, sacred icons, religious morals, etc. This includes the use of deepfakes.</p><p>- 6) Set up some forms of real and legal deterrence. In China, the use of deep-fake technology without labeling it as such, for any reason, is simply illegal -- treated as an information weapon and inherent moral hazard -- and that people violating that law are put into prison. Our analog could be temporary platform bans. Citizens seeing actual enforcement of their own protection has the effect of supporting the building of reliable trust and identity infrastructures in community.</p><p>No regulation is perfect. Sometimes you kill some of the lesser notions of \"good\" while protecting against the more serious and significant harms. These harms accrue into a dystopia we cannot afford: a world without truth, mass social isolation, constant social pressure, and a whole generation of children and teenagers who never knew that life could be different.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>I believe in a world where technology industry is remade in a manner that becomes a more empowering tool -- something that serves humanity and life again. Where it is built around servicing our needs and strengthening the fabric of our society, not parasitically extracting value from the most vulnerable organs of society. Where technology strengths our capacity to see multiple perspectives, nuance and complexity - where there are no black and white answers.</p><p>We need technology to aid us in these endeavors for our civilization to survive.</p><p>While we all have base emotions, we also always have something unique to our species: a capacity for choice. The ability to do other than what would simply be predicted by past behavior, or whatever profit is dangled in front of our brains.</p><p>In a way this situation is a test: will we be the chimpanzees with predictable emotions drawn to economic growth, or will we recognize that no one else is going to put their hand on the steering wheel. You have to do it. You have to make a choice. That choice is now up to you.</p><p>n1 <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-twitter-false-news-travels-faster-true-stories-0308\">https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-twitter-false-news-travels-faster-true-stories-0308</url></p><p>n2 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/09/facebook-sean-parker-vulnerability-brain-psychology\">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/09/facebook-sean-parker-vulnerability-brain-psychology</url></p><p>n3 <url normalizedValue=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2167702617723376\">https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2167702617723376</url></p><p>n4 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aafprs.org/media/stats_polls/m_stats.html\">https://www.aafprs.org/media/stats_polls/m_stats.html</url></p><p>n5 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-pro-eating-disorder-posts-evade-social-media-filters/\">https://www.wired.com/story/how-pro-eating-disorder-posts-evade-social-media-filters/</url></p><p>n6 <url normalizedValue=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/medialse/2019/08/28/beyond-conspiracy-the-ties-that-bind-filipino-flat-earthers-and-populist-supporters/\">https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/medialse/2019/08/28/beyond-conspiracy-the-ties-that-bind-filipino-flat-earthers-and-populist-supporters/</url></p><p>n7 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2018/03/12/the-russian-fake-news-campaign-that-damaged-the-united-states-in-the-1980s/\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2018/03/12/the-russian-fake-news-campaign-that-damaged-the-united-states-in-the-1980s/</url></p><p>n8 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.prb.org/conspiracybeliefsmaybehinderinghivpreventionamongafricanamericans\">https://www.prb.org/conspiracybeliefsmaybehinderinghivpreventionamongafricanamericans</url>/</p><p>n9 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/11/15/heres-how-russia-will-attack-election-were-still-not-ready/\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/11/15/heres-how-russia-will-attack-election-were-still-not-ready/</url></p><p>n10 <url normalizedValue=\"https://share.america.gov/trolls-everything-you-wanted-to-know\">https://share.america.gov/trolls-everything-you-wanted-to-know</url>/</p><p>n11 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/albertonardelli/facebook-twitter-google-manipulation-nato-stratcom\">https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/albertonardelli/facebook-twitter-google-manipulation-nato-stratcom</url></p><p>n12 <url normalizedValue=\"https://toda.org/assets/files/resources/policy-briefs/t-pb-66_peter-hayes_social-media-arrives-on-the-nuclear-stage.pdf\">https://toda.org/assets/files/resources/policy-briefs/t-pb-66_peter-hayes_social-media-arrives-on-the-nuclear-stage.pdf</url></p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/010820%20CPC%20Hearing%20Testimony_Harris.pdf\">https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/010820%20CPC%20Hearing%20Testimony_Harris.pdf</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COSHC108003Y9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY1-42M1-JCCP-00N6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5851\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 8, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Unfortunately, I know firsthand that online hate ruins lives by stoking fear, silencing voices, and causing harm to people's physical and professional safety--all of which have a serious and lasting effect on victims and their families. And just because it happens digitally doesn't mean it should be taken less seriously. Hate should never be normalized.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On May 1, 2017--the day after I was sworn in as President--a masked perpetrator hung bananas from black corded nooses from light posts and bus stops around campus. The bananas were labeled with \"AKA\" and \"AKA FREE,\" referencing Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated (AKA) the predominately Black sorority of which I am a member, and \"HARAMBE BAIT\" referencing the gorilla that was killed at the Cincinnati Zoo in 2016. As this vile act gained national attention and was investigated by the Department of Justice as a hate crime, my story must have come to Andrew Anglin's attention.</p><p>By May 4, 2017, Anglin took it upon himself to incite a coordinated cyber-harassment campaign to encourage his followers to \"send me some words of support\" by doxing me. In other words, Anglin and many in his army of followers posted my personal information online with the intent that the information be used to harass, stalk, and threaten me, and be used against me for an unlawful purpose.</p><p>He and others provided their followers with the direct link to my Facebook page and Twitter page with calls to action. Due to his notoriety amongst the white supremacist community, Anglin's followers heeded his call to action and began to inundate my social media accounts, chatrooms, and the dark-net with racist and sexist threats and comments. This \"troll storm\" was unrelenting and went on for months. This took place on various social media platforms, websites, and chatrooms. In essence, any time my name or story was--or is--mentioned, white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and their sympathizers leave comments voicing their discontent, hate, and thinly veiled threats.</p><p>What I experienced following the May 1st hate crime was not \"just some mean words from some mean people,\" but was a part of a larger coordinated effort incited by a world-renowned neo-Nazi leader to intimidate, threaten, and harass me online. I was scared for my physical safety as bananas were already hung from nooses on my campus and was afraid that the white supremacists and neo-Nazis would act on their statements. I did not know what acts of violence Daily Stormer users were capable of doing, but I knew that this troll storm was not the first time that its users acted offline on their threats espoused online. There are reports that Dylann Roof posted on the Daily Stormer's website prior to committing the Emanuel AME Church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina. I was incredibly frightened to know the same website was targeting me.</p><p>As a result of this experience, I was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and lost 15 percent of my body weight. Still today, more than three years later, I experience flashbacks and triggers, and am forced to take increased measures to protect myself and my family. The online hate and harassment forced me to change my daily routine, install video cameras at my house, drastically decrease my social media use, stop tagging my location in posts online, and even take self-defense classes.</p><p>Like most millennials, social media was the way that I kept in touch with friends and family, accessed the news, and stayed up to date with grassroots movements in my community. However, after the events of May 1 and May 4, I became extremely isolated and withdrawn as my ability to express myself was significantly limited due to the safety risks posed by my engagement online.</p><p>To be clear, these are not just flashbacks and triggers: the harassment Anglin and his followers incited on various social media platforms against me continues to this day. I continue to receive threatening and harassing messages three years after Anglin initiated his troll storm. Below you can find images and text of some of the threatening, racist, and sexist comments directed at me on social media platforms within the last few years.</p><p>This is why I sued Andrew Anglin, the Daily Stormer's parent company, and two other defendants in federal court for violating the District of Columbia's Human Rights Act, which prohibits individuals from interfering with someone's use of a public accommodation, with pro bono representation by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the Washington Lawyers' Committee, and Kirkland and Ellis, LLP.</p><p>In Dumpson v. Ade, Judge Rosemary Collyer of the United States District Court of the District of Columbia set precedent by ruling that racist online harassment can interfere with an individual's equal access to a public accommodation, as I had to make significant changes to how I navigated on a day-to-day basis. Further, Judge Collier found that \"a causal nexus exists between the troll storm created by [Andrew] Anglin... and [my] enjoyment of [American University] ...and that [I] was targeted because of my race and gender.\"</p><p>Extremist Use of Social Media in Radicalizing America</p><p>Unfortunately, my personal experience as a victim of online hate and harassment is not unique or even infrequent. Social media platforms such as Facebook have allowed the worst and most heinous elements of society into my home and my life, and into yours too. It's created an open door to the kinds of people you would never allow anywhere near your loved ones in the physical world. All too often people say that what happens online \"isn't real.\" Let me be clear, what happens online is very real--and the line between virtual and physical has become indistinguishable.</p><p>Over the last several years, extremists like Anglin's Daily Stormer followers have been empowered by access to the online world. The internet amplifies hateful voices to reach millions around the world. It does not take an expert to see the ways social media has become a universal tool for extremist movements to organize and engage in violence.</p><p>Social media also offers a virtual community for like-minded hatemongering individuals and groups. Online forums allow isolated white supremacists and extremists to become more active and involved in virtual campaigns of ideological recruitment and radicalization. Individuals can easily find sanction, support, and reinforcement online for their extreme beliefs or actions because the internet offers a reading and viewing library of tens of thousands of pieces of content.</p><p>The internet also allows hate to spread faster and wider than it ever has before. A meme that is generated by a dedicated antisemite on a toxic platform like Gab, 8kun, 4chan or messenger services used by extremists, like Telegram, can be disseminated almost instantaneously on more mainstream social media sites like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, or Reddit.</p><p>Once on mainstream social media sites, these hate messages, incitement and violent threats often spread faster than content moderators can catch--or, in the case of Facebook and Holocaust denial, are willing to remove. Podcasting and video sharing sites like YouTube allow white supremacists, extremists and antisemites to broadcast their hateful ideology and speak directly to users. The hateful content is \"recommended\" to some users because social media algorithms are trained to optimize and increase user engagement. So, the most problematic content on these sites is actually recommended and amplified by the social media companies themselves.</p><p>The hate crimes and incidents I experienced in May of 2017 were not the first and far from the last time social media has been used to perpetuate white supremacy and extremism. Three months after nationalizing the online attacks against me, in August 2017, Anglin used Facebook to co-organize the white supremacist \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, which attracted some 600 extremists from around the country and ended in deadly violence. Members of the so-called alt right descended on the small college city and clashed with counter-demonstrators, leading to scores of injuries and the death of counter-protester Heather Heyer.</p><p>Impact of Hate Online</p><p>This year in particular has seen a tectonic shift in the way communities across the world integrate digital and social networks into their daily lives. Online hate and harassment were pervasive issues long before the COVID-19 pandemic, but against the backdrop of quarantine and virtual work, school, worship and social lives, this phenomenon is more pervasive than ever. The Asian, Jewish, Muslim, Latinx and immigrant communities in particular are experiencing an onslaught of targeted hate, fueled by conspiracy theories, bigotry, and racism surrounding the novel coronavirus. Also, the social justice reckoning protesting police brutality in the wake of George Floyd's murder has spurred even more dehumanizing anti-Black racism and prejudice across social media platforms.</p><p>According to a 2020 national ADL survey (ADL's 2020 Online Hate survey), 44 percent of Americans experienced online harassment and 28 percent experienced severe online harassment--including stalking, physical threats, swatting, doxing and sustained harassment.</p><p>It does not surprise me that ADL's research also shows that targeting based on specific identity-characteristics is on the rise. The 2020 statistics show race-based harassment affected 55 percent of Asian-Americans and 42 percent of Hispanic and African-American respondents. Women also experienced harassment disproportionately, as 37 percent of female-identified respondents felt they were targeted because of their gender. Sixty-one percent of Muslim Americans who reported experiencing online harassment felt they were targeted because of their religion and 43 percent of Jewish Americans felt they were targeted with hateful content because of their religion. Forty-eight percent of LGBTQ+ respondents reported harassment based on their sexual orientation.</p><p>Online harassment impacts targets in a variety of ways. The most common response is to stop, reduce or change online behavior, which 36 percent of those who have been harassed have done. This can include steps like posting less often, avoiding certain sites, changing privacy settings, deleting apps, or increasing filtering of content or users. Many go further, with 18 percent of harassment targets contacting the technology platform to ask for help or report harassing content. In some cases, these behaviors were coupled with other consequences including thoughts of depression and suicide, anxiety, and economic impact.</p><p>I know I'm not alone in the call for change. According to ADL's 2020 Online Hate survey, Americans overwhelmingly want to see concrete steps taken to address online hate and harassment. Across political ideologies, the vast majority of Americans believe that social media companies and the government need to take action against online hate and harassment. In fact, 87.5 percent of Americans somewhat or strongly agree that the government should strengthen laws and improve training and resources for police on online hate and harassment. Americans also want platforms to take more action to counter or mitigate the problem. Seventy-seven percent of Americans want companies to make it easier to report hateful content and behavior.</p><p>Big Tech is Apathetic to the Problem</p><p>In the months and years that followed the May 1 and May 4 events, I faced hurdles and struggled to regain my sense of normalcy. My PTSD is triggered each time white supremacists' attacks or anti-black racism makes its way to the news cycle. I still struggle to sleep and often have invasive thoughts about the hate crimes I experienced. And these experiences also had lingering impacts on my family and friends' mental health.</p><p>Weeks ago, Facebook was, yet again, apathetic to racism and incitement to violence. The call to arms event that resulted in the Kenosha shooting was flagged over 450 times, but Facebook did nothing. This inaction reminded me of the Orlando Pulse Nightclub attack--where the gunman allegedly used multiple Facebook accounts to search about the Islamic State and other terrorist groups before the attack and also used the site after to see if his attack went viral. n1</p><p>This inaction reminded me of social media's role in the deadly 2017 Charlottesville \"Unite the Right Rally,\" which was organized by my attacker on Facebook and the event page was up for a month, only taken down the day before the event. n2 It reminded me of the horrors of the New Zealand mosque shootings, livestreamed on Facebook and still hosted on the platform six months later. n3 It reminded me of Pittsburgh, El Paso, Poway, and too many other violent (and often fatal) hate crimes in which Facebook (and Big Tech) played a central role.</p><p>In ADL's 2020 Online Hate survey, 42 percent of daily Facebook users experienced harassment on the platform. Of those respondents who were harassed online, like I was, more than three-quarters (77%) reported that at least some of their harassment occurred on Facebook. It is a hotbed of hate and an all-too-easy platform to harass and terrorize targets. Below are just a couple images the Stop Hate for Profit Coalition recently shared with supporters. These images were found on Facebook in August and September 2020.</p><p>Stop Hate for Profit</p><p>In response to social media's repeated failure to meaningfully address the vast proliferation of hate on their platforms--and Facebook's particular role in this proliferation, ADL, Color of Change, Common Sense, Free Press, LULAC, Mozilla, NAACP, National Hispanic Media Center, and Sleeping Giants launched a campaign called Stop Hate for Profit. In July, the campaign called on advertisers to engage in a one-month ad pause. In September, just last week, the campaign called on A-List influencers to freeze their Instagram accounts and highlight Facebook's inaction toward electoral misinformation, hate, violence and racism.</p><p>I strongly support the Stop Hate for Profit campaign. I know what it is like to be the target of daily racist and misogynist posts, to receive threats online, and to be the subject of extremist group chats. Their request for Facebook (and the rest of Big Tech) to increase accountability, decency and victim support on the platform resonates with me both as an advocate and as a survivor (and enduring target) of online abuse. And I find comfort in knowing that thousands of major businesses including Volkswagen, Unilever, Verizon, Walgreens, KIND, Pfizer, Colgate-Palmolive, Williams Sonoma Inc., North Face and Patagonia joined in an ad pause to call on Facebook to address rampant hate, racism and disinformation on its platforms. On the other hand, it's disheartening that Mr. Zuckerberg immediately dismissed this campaign, insisting that advertisers will be back on the platform \"soon enough.\" I understand that this is because Facebook's vast user base and reach provides a captive audience for advertisers to micro-target and engage.</p><p>Not surprisingly, when it comes to dealing with rampant hate and harassment, the platform continues to come up short--responding with PR moves at best, and apathy more often. When will enough be enough? What are they doing with $70 billion in revenue and $17 billion in profit? Their hate speech, incitement, and misinformation policies are inequitable. Their harassment victim services are inadequate. Their advertising placement's proximity to hateful content is haphazard. And their \"civil rights\" audit transparency reports aren't helpful to the civil rights community.</p><p>Backspace Hate</p><p>As our online lives have become even more central to the way we work, communicate and socialize in this unprecedented time, it's also gotten easier than ever before for individuals to harm their targets online. I speak from personal experience. I know what it is like to have every aspect of my life invaded with racist, misogynist comments, threats and images. I know what it is like to be the target of cyberstalking and doxing--it is something no person should have to experience. But, if they do, our government needs to support the targets of these crimes and hold perpetrators accountable.</p><p>But do not take my word for it. As I mentioned above, ADL's 2020 Online Hate survey found that 28 percent of Americans experienced severe online harassment, including sexual harassment, stalking, physical threats, or sustained harassment. ADL has also done deep ethnographic research and found that individuals who were the targets of intense harassment campaigns experienced significant emotional and economic burdens. In response to these trends, over 85 percent of Americans want policymakers to strengthen laws to prevent such acts.</p><p>I'm a big supporter of ADL's \"Backspace Hate,\" a national initiative to fight the escalating problems of harmful online activities, including cyber harassment, cyber stalking, swatting, and doxing, through updating legislation and raising awareness. Doxing is one form of online harassment that does not have adequate legal protections for targets at the state or federal level. These are tactics extremists have used to harass and terrorize targets. Swatting is the false reporting of an emergency with the goal of having a police unit or emergency response team deployed to a dwelling. It has been increasingly used as a digital harassment tactic and has resulted in injuries and trauma (and even a fatality) to both targets and unintended victims.</p><p>The prevalence of these problems is only increasing. In fact, in January 2020, one individual who was sympathetic to neo-Nazi ideology and loosely associated with the neo-Nazi group, the Atomwaffen Division (AWD), was caught after having worked with others from Canada and England to target people in a series of multi-national swatting and doxing incidents. According to ADL's Center on Extremism, cyber-harassment has been at the forefront of AWD tactics since the group's inception in 2016.</p><p>Shockingly, there are no protections for doxing or swatting at the federal level. And, in far too many states common digital tactics harassers use to harm their targets are not considered unlawful. I was able to sue my online tormentors, but my lawyers should not have had to find a novel legal theory and a DC-specific law to bring my case to court. What I experienced was hate crime after hate crime. I sued Andrew Anglin, The Daily Stormer, and two other individuals--this did not account for the thousands of people threatening my life online daily.</p><p>As part of ADL's Backspace Hate effort, several states are pursuing bipartisan legislation that address severe online harassment by holding perpetrators accountable for their actions online. For example, this past legislative session, Washington State showed tremendous leadership in enacting anti-swatting legislation protecting targets and victims from the serious and potentially fatal consequences of this digital abuse. Washington's law makes swatting a felony when it results in someone being injured or killed. The legislation also gives swatting victims and targets the right to sue and allows law enforcement or a city to seek damages. While some states have anti-swatting laws, too many do not.</p><p>In addition to advocating for specific legislation, ADL is harnessing its resources and expertise by raising awareness among policymakers, law enforcement, and supporters; building coalitions with diverse partners; gathering petition signatures to deliver to legislators; publishing research on these issues and their effects on targets; and providing recommendations for technical solutions.</p><p>Hate Crimes</p><p>While I have focused mostly on the cyber harassment components of my experience, let me end where this started: a hate crime investigated by the Justice Department. Unfortunately, it is unusual that the hate crime against me was reported. It was the American University public safety department that made the intial report--not me. Often, victims of hate crimes do not come forward to report their experiences because they either do not trust the police, believe the police are unwilling to act, or have reason to believe they are unable to respond effectively to a hate crime. For example, I reported the cyber-harassment itself to the Metropolitan Police Department, but never heard back. That's why law enforcement's role in responding to and reporting incidents, both online and on the ground, is so important.</p><p>While I was afraid of being physically attacked on campus and at home, many Americans are afraid that they will be attacked in their house of worship, their supermarket, or walking down the street. 2018 saw the highest number of hate crime murders on record, with 24 victims. n4 The second highest year for hate crime murders was 2000, with 19 victims. n5</p><p>While FBI statistics are essential, we know they are incomplete. 16,039 law enforcement agencies in the United States participated in the 2018 data collection effort--the second highest level of participation since the enactment of the HCSA in 1990, but a slight decrease from 2017 record participation of 16,149. Importantly, only 2,028 of these agencies, less than 13 percent, reported one or more hate crimes to the FBI. That means that 87 percent of all participating police agencies affirmatively reported zero (0) hate crimes to the FBI (including at least 77 cities over 100,000). And eight more law enforcement agencies over 100,000 did not report any data to the FBI. According to anti-hate groups like ADL, that specialize in understanding hate crimes and advocating for more protections for targets, reports of zero hate crimes are simply not credible. These reports suggest that the number of hate crimes in America is far greater than what is reported.</p><p>It's been brought to my attention that the federal government has an essential leadership role to play in confronting hate crimes and in alleviating intolerance. The most effective response is to explicitly call out bigotry whenever and wherever it happens, and to strengthen federal hate crime prevention and response.</p><p>I am hopeful about the enactment of hate crimes laws. This is a matter with bipartisan support, as demonstrated in Georgia, which in June passed a comprehensive and inclusive hate crime law and joined the 45 other states with hate crimes laws on the books. I was heartened to learn that Governor Brian Kemp signed into law House Bill 426, the \"Georgia Enhanced Penalties for Hate Crimes Act,\" with protections that go into effect immediately.</p><p>ADL leads the Hate Free Georgia Coalition, which played an important role in securing the passage of HB 426. HB 426 provides stronger penalties for individuals who target victims because of their actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender, mental disability, or physical disability. It also requires local law enforcement agencies to collect data on hate crime investigations and provide \"Bias Crime Reports\" to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which is essential for effective enforcement of the law. This was a critical step towards addressing systemic racial injustice in that state. Still, there is more to do. There are states without adequate hate crime protections and hate crimes going uninvestigated or unreported. We need the full picture.</p><p>Policy Recommendations</p><p>In partnership with ADL, I want to share the following measures that, taken together, can immediately help combat the rise in physical and online hate crimes, as well as hate incidents in general:</p><p>1. Use the Bully Pulpit to Fight Hate: Words have power</p><p>o Speak up and call out racism and bigotry at every opportunity. The right to free speech is a core value, but the promotion of hate should be vehemently and consistently rejected. Often, people will say that the answer to extremism and hate speech is more speech. That premise is inherently flawed because it assumes incorrectly that more speech would be counter-speech, not simply be more hate speech. While at one time that argument might have been persuasive, during my lifetime--in the digital age--the hateful voices too often just drown out the others.</p><p>o In this environment, the importance of ensuring that the fight against extremists not be politicized--all the more so close to the election--cannot be overstated.</p><p>2. Improve Federal Hate Crime Data Collection, Transparency and Support</p><p>o The Department of Justice should incentivize and encourage state and local law enforcement agencies to more comprehensively collect and report hate crimes to the FBI, with special attention devoted to large underreporting by law enforcement agencies that either have not participated in the FBI Hate Crime Statistics Act program at all or have affirmatively and not credibly reported zero hate crimes. More comprehensive, complete hate crime reporting--including reporting online hate crimes--can deter hate violence.</p><p>o The federal government should provide funding for criminal investigations and prosecutions by state, local and tribal law enforcement officials, as authorized by Section 4704 of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009.</p><p>3. Pass Legislation to Fight Hate</p><p>o Pass H.R. 1931, the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act: This legislation would enhance the federal government's efforts to prevent domestic terrorism by authorizing into law the offices addressing domestic terrorism and requiring federal law enforcement agencies to regularly assess those threats and then deploy resource to the threats. The bill would also provide training and resources to assist non-federal law enforcement, requiring DOJ, DHS, and the FBI to provide training and resources to assist state, local, and tribal law enforcement in understanding, detecting, investigating, and deterring acts of domestic terrorism.</p><p>o Pass H.R. 3545, the Khalid Jabara and Heather Heyer National Opposition to Hate, Assault, and Threats to Equality (NO HATE) Act of 2019, which would authorize incentive grants to encourage improved local and state hate crime training, prevention, best practices, and data collection initiatives--including grants for state hate crime reporting hotlines to direct individuals to local law enforcement and support services.</p><p>4. Support More Anti-Bias Education and Training</p><p>o Recognizing that hate cannot be legislated or regulated out of existence, Congress should provide increased funding for inclusive school anti-bias education, civics education, and bullying prevention programs.</p><p>5. Address Online Hate and Harassment Through Legislation and Training</p><p>o Review the tools and services platforms provide to targets: Targets like myself rely on platforms to provide tools and services to report the online hate and harassment I regularly receive. I can tell you from personal experience, it isn't enough. Congress should commission research that provides a summary of the available mechanisms provided by platforms to their users to protect and defend themselves. The review process should also include a needs assessment of users and a gap analysis of available tools and services.</p><p>o Strengthen laws against perpetrators of online hate: Hate and harassment exist both on the ground and online spaces, but our laws aren't doing enough. Many forms of severe online misconduct are not consistently or adequately covered by our current cybercrime, harassment, stalking and hate crime laws. State and federal lawmakers have an opportunity to lead the fight against online hate and harassment by increasing protections for targets as well as penalties for perpetrators of severe and abusive online misconduct.</p><p>. In July 2017, in the 115th Congress, Representative Katherine Clark introduced and lead H.R. 3067, the Online Safety Modernization Act, which, among other things, would have provided federal protections against doxing and swatting. We desperately need these protections.</p><p>o Improve training of law enforcement: Though the physical threat I experienced was classified as a hate crime, the online hate and harassment that terrorized me was not. Law enforcement should be a key responder to online hate and harassment, especially in cases like mine that involve direct threats. I know these cases are complicated but that is not an excuse. We must increase training and resources for agencies to ensure law enforcement personnel can better support targets. Additionally, law enforcement training on stalking, harassment, and threats should be modernized to reflect the role the internet plays in the 21st Century. Too often, local law enforcement agencies are not adequately equipped with technology or personnel to address the nuance in this area. Better training and resources can support better and more effective investigations and prosecutions.</p><p>. The Department of Justice should also incentivize and encourage state and local law enforcement agencies to specifically incorporate cultural competency and trauma-informed trainings into their hate crime response trainings, as far too often survivors and targets of hate crimes are uncomfortable with reporting their experiences to members of law enforcement for fear of retraumatization. Though I reported some of the most egregious instances of hate directed at me to law enforcement, the vast majority of times I did not because of my experiences with law enforcement officers failing to act with cross-cultural awareness and empathy.</p><p>6. Urge Social Media Platforms to Institute Stronger Means to Measure and Address Online Hate and Harassment</p><p>o Strengthen and Adequately Enforce Policies Against Hate: Social media platforms should have better community guidelines or standards that comprehensively address hateful content and harassing behavior, and clearly define consequences for violations. Platforms should prohibit toxic content from being monetized to ensure their platform cannot be used to fund extremist individuals, groups and movements. Social media platforms also need to invest in enforcement. Platforms need to use a mix of human reviewers, AI, and an appeals process that all work together to enforce their policies. Social media platforms owe their consumers an equal opportunity to engage in the digital space irrespective of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or other identity-based characteristics. However, platforms fail to satisfy that obligation when they prioritize the speech rights of extremists to that of marginalized communities, who are silenced when platforms amplify hate.</p><p>o Expand tools and services for targets: Given the prevalence of online hate and harassment, platforms should offer far more services and tools for individuals facing or fearing online attack. Targets should be allowed to flag multiple pieces of content, or even an entire thread, within one report instead of having to create a new report for each piece of content being flagged. I am now used to reviewing, filtering, identifying, screenshotting, and saving multiple threatening and harassing comments on a monthly basis, in the event that the comments rise to the level of a \"true threat,\" specifying time, place, and manner of attack--but I should not have to be. And even when I have used the reporting mechanisms provided on various social media platforms, the platforms have either failed to remove the content.</p><p>o Alternatively, I have also received messages that platforms have decided to keep up the abusive content I have reported because it allegedly does not violate their community standards. The messages I have received that have remained up are personally violating and it is unfathomable how they would not violate community standards. I should be able to trust that social media platforms will regulate the content posted on their sites and prevent their platforms from being used to by extremists to mobilize and act on hate. The arduous process of capturing images of violating content and reporting can and should be improved. The burden of bringing hate and extremism to the attention of social media platforms should not be on the victims and targets.</p><p>o Increase accountability and transparency: Platforms need a better civil rights infrastructure. They should be subject to external, independent audits. Right now, the only people who truly know the extent of hate and harassment on platforms are targets, perpetrators and the platforms themselves. I was encouraged to learn that Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee Chair Jan Schakowsky along with other Energy and Commerce Committee leadership voiced concerns about the newly launched Facebook Oversight Board, because of the lack of power it has to actually drive the necessary accountability and transparency measures necessary to decrease hate and extremism on social media. The public needs to know about the extent of hate, extremism and harassment on a given platform. Audits would also allow the public to verify that the company is following through on its promises. Transparency reports should include data from user generated identity-based reporting.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Thank you for calling this important hearing and for the opportunity to submit this testimony. ADL data clearly indicates that my personal experience is unfortunately not unique, that hate is rising across America and that crimes like doxing and swatting pose a significant threat to our communities. Everyday Americans are subjected to hate online but, too often we are told that because these comments and threats were made on social media platforms little can be done to regulate these actions and prevent them from happing in the future. But a lot more can be done, and Congress must be a part of the efforts to de-radicalize social media.</p><p>This is a time for leaders to lead. I urge you to speak out about the threat, legislate against it and encourage social media companies to address online hate in their platforms, so we can prevent future hate crimes and protect targets like me.</p><p>n1 Blinder, Alan, et al. \"Omar Mateen Posted to Facebook Amid Orlando Attack, Lawmaker Says.\" The New York Times, June 16, 2016, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/us/orlando-shooting.html;\">www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/us/orlando-shooting.html;</url> Nicks, Denver. \"Orlando Shooting: Omar Mateen Checked Facebook During Attack.\" Time, Time, 16 June 2016, time.com/4371910/orlando-shooting-omar-mateen-facebook/.</p><p>n2 Heath, Alex. \"Facebook Removed the Event Page for White Nationalist 'Unite the Right' Rally in Charlottesville One Day before It Took Place.\" Business Insider, Business Insider, 14 Aug. 2017, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-removed-unite-the-right-charlottesville-rally-event-page-one-day-before-2017-8\">www.businessinsider.com/facebook-removed-unite-the-right-charlottesville-rally-event-page-one-day-before-2017-8</url>.</p><p>n3 Tom Acres, technology reporter. \"New Zealand Mosque Attack Videos Are Still Being Hosted on Facebook.\" Sky News, Sky, 24 Sept. 2019, news.sky.com/story/new-zealand-mosque-attack-videos-are-still-being-hosted-on-facebook-11817602.</p><p>n4 ADL, 2018 Audit of Anti-Semitic Incidents <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.adl.org/audit2018\">https://www.adl.org/audit2018</url></p><p>n5 ADL, Tracker of Anti-Semitic Incidents, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.adl.org/adl-tracker-of-anti-semitic-incidents\">https://www.adl.org/adl-tracker-of-anti-semitic-incidents</url></p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/09.24.20%20CPC%20Witness%20Testimony_Dumpson.pdf\">https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/09.24.20%20CPC%20Witness%20Testimony_Dumpson.pdf</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COSHC924005B5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XF-PBW1-DYVR-P0RT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5896\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 24, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>ALPHA KAPPA ALPHA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Today, we will be hearing holding it a hearing entitled Consumer Beware: Increased Risk During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Due to the COVID-19 public health emergency, today's hearing is being held remotely. All the members-- </p><p>RODGERS: --Hey, Jan? </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Yes? </p><p>RODGERS: We can't hear you. I don't know, are you--are you muted?  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: I'm not muted. </p><p>UNKNOWN: I can hear her. </p><p>UNKNOWN: I can hear you, Jan. </p><p>RODGERS: I can't hear you at least. Not yet.  </p><p>UNKNOWN: I can, Madam Chair. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Okay, can--can you hear me now? </p><p>RODGERS: Not yet. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Well, then I think it must be on your end, then. </p><p>RUSH: Yeah. You're coming in loud and clear here.  </p><p>UNKNOWN: Can any Republicans hear Jan?  </p><p>RODGERS: Is it just me? I'm not hearing anybody.  </p><p>GIANFORTE: Yes, Jan. This is Greg Gianforte. I can hear you fine. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Okay. I'm going to I'm going to continue while somebody helps fix the silent person. Okay, due--due to the COVID-19 public health emergency, today's hearing is being held remotely. All of the members and witnesses will be participating via videoconference.  </p><p>As part of our--as part of our hearing, microphones will be set on mute for the purpose of eliminating inadvertent background noise. Members and witnesses, you will need to unmute yourself, unmute your microphone each time that you wish to speak. Additionally, members will need to be visible on screen in order to be recognized. I messed up with that before and got out of order for my chance to speak, so be sure that if you're on that we see you.  </p><p>Documents for the record can be sent to Chloe Rodriguez at the email address that we provided to all of the staff and all documents will be entered into the record at the conclusion. We're going to go to members' opening statements, but if I could take a moment of personal privilege to welcome, Anna, you back from maternity leave. She gave birth to Cassia, who is I think about three months old now who joins her sister Sage as part of the family. So welcome back to the staff, Anna.  </p><p>And so let me begin then with my opening statements for five minutes. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today for a virtual hearing consumer protection in the COVID era. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the lives of nearly every American consumer. In so--in so many ways, technology has made the isolation--has made the isolation of many American--that many Americans face for more than bearable than say the social isolation experienced by Americans doing far less, I should say. There--less unbearable then it was in 1918 pandemic.  </p><p>Unfortunately, the Trump administration hasn't risen to the moment and hasn't has instead dithered and reflects--reflexly --reflexly deterring--I'm sorry, deterring to the private--deferring to the private sector instead of leading. Even before the pandemic, consumers reported feeling of helplessness with the--with respect to the digital economy despite the Trump administration's courting--counting on the private sector to play a key role in the response and recovery.  </p><p>Big tech has allowed fraud, fake news, fake reviews, counterfeit and stolen product to get into the marketplace. Price gouging has been--has continued most unfettered on platforms because of our weakness, our weak and uneven federal response. That's why I initiated and introduced the price gouging prevention act along with Chairman Pallone. It was included in the HEROES Act, which Senate--Senator McConnell has yet to take up.  </p><p>The current crisis has also laid bare our platforms' need to be doing more to protect consumers and ensuring they have the same right online as that they have when they go shopping in person. And that's why I am proud to be introducing an updated version of the informed consumers act. I will--I would like to thank Senators Durbin and Cassidy in the Senate for being partners on that and this common sense legislation would ensure that consumers have informed--information that they need when they are online--when an online seller fails to deliver the goods or services that they were promised. And I hope our colleagues on both sides of the aisle would join us in supporting this important bill and that it might be favorably reported by this subcommittee.  </p><p>I'm looking at--I'm looking for the clock. Almost out. Okay. Transparency alone is simply not enough. Agencies like the Consumer Product Safety Commission must aggressively be stopping dangerous products that they--that can actually kill or harm Americans (INAUDIBLE) consumers. The administration, however, has continued to prioritize corporate interests over the safety of the public and now national where is this clearer than in the continued support for Nancy Beck.  </p><p>I'll get into that more later, but Nancy Beck is the nominee for the Consumer Product Safety Commission chair. And at this point, I will stop and put the rest of my opening statement in the--in the record and recognize our ranking member, Ms. Rodgers for an opening statement. </p><p>RODGERS: Good morning, Madam Chair. And I'm sorry for the interruption earlier. it was on my end, I guess that I wasn't hearing. But I appreciate you bringing us together today. I want to thank the witnesses for participating today. I look forward to the expert testimony of our panel and I value your insights.  </p><p>However, this hearing should also include the role of an agencies in our jurisdiction. That includes the FTC, let's CSPC, which are essential to our mission to protect consumers. This administration has made it a priority to protect Americans and during this health and economic crisis and hearing directly from the commissioners should have been a part of today's discussion.  </p><p>In addition, while the subject matter for this hearing is broad, I believe that there is a striking omission from the background memo. Data privacy is the most fundamental consumer protection we could advance and we should right now be working together. We enthusiastically participate in good faith negotiations with the majority, which preceded the COVID-19 outbreak.  </p><p>Although the pandemic broke the rhythm of our talks, it's made that need for a strong national privacy standard more urgent. There are plenty of proposals out there. Notably, our subcommittee has developed the only bipartisan staff draft on either side of the hill. My hope was that this draft would serve as a foundation for a strong bipartisan bill that we could introduce together, Chair Schakowsky and myself.  </p><p>There are also targeted proposals that include protections during the pandemic, including one from Chair Schakowsky and Chair Eshoo. To protect people's privacy, I'm open to a targeted proposal, but the partisan process and the product has done serious harm to our bipartisan talks on a broader bill.  </p><p>Frankly, partisan proposals have no chance of being signed into law. If the majority chooses to come back to the negotiation table, I know we can still pass a comprehensive bipartisan bill in the house. If the point of targeted bills is that we want to--want consumer protections during this crisis, why don't we find an agreement on a broader bill now and put a sunset date on it for us to revisit it later?  </p><p>This is not my first choice to a solution, but if we don't act now and work together, I fear a few more years will slip away before we see real action. The result will be a bigger patchwork of laws and it will be impossible for people to trust how their privacy is protected. It's never been more important that we set a national standard.  </p><p>More Americans are spending their days online than ever before. There are many data driven proposals for contact tracing that have raised privacy concerns. Small and medium sized businesses who are already struggling to survive must now worry about being crushed by CCPA enforcement and frivolous lawsuit.  </p><p>Chairman Pallone tweeted that he wanted to pass a comprehensive privacy bill by the end of this Congress. Let's get it done with our bipartisan draft. No one else is better positioned to do this. Let's see how it works for a set period and then negotiate to extend it with the added hindsight. If we succeed, Americans won't be left with uncertainty over how their data is collected during this pandemic and in the future.  </p><p>Another area where certainty is needed is in light liability protections. For our economy to boom again, we must address the liability uncertainty hanging over the head of every small business owner out there. If we strike the right balance between protecting the safety of our workers and protecting employers from frivolous lawsuits, people can get back to work safely and have the opportunity again to build a better life.  </p><p>To win the future, we should also be focusing on the importance of emerging technologies that enhance consumer protection. Generally and in the--and in relationship to the pandemic, the Trump administration has been at the forefront of American leadership in emerging tech. For example, the Office of Science and Technology Policy is leading a public private partnership that leverages AI and quantum computing in our fight against the virus. Many of the problems we're talking about here today could be solved with progress in advanced materials, blockchain, and quantum computing.  </p><p>Not only will these technologies help us fight scams, unsafe products, and misinformation directly, it will help us ensure that we lead the world and be to China, which is the greatest source of fake and unsafe products and dangerous information. I thank you again and I look forward to the discussion. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: I--I want to thank the ranking member. And let me just say before I call on Mr. Pallone, our chairman of the full committee, that absolutely, we need to work to--together. It is definitely my intention to continue to--to meet with you, to talk about both the short term during the pandemic privacy issues and the--and the longer term. and I thank you for raising that. And now, let me call on the chairman of the full committee for his five minutes for an opening statement. Mr. Pallone. </p><p>PALLONE: Thank you, Chairwoman Schakowsky. And today, we are continuing your subcommittees' work of protecting consumers by examining the increased risks that consumers face from scams and unsafe products during the COVID-19 pandemic. And while the direct loss of life is the most terrible consequence of the pandemic, its devastation extends beyond the infections.  </p><p>Tens of millions of people have lost their jobs and the pandemic has also completely upended American life, forcing Americans to dramatically change how they work, how they learn, how they socialize. In New Jersey, data shows people were spending 98 percent of their time at home during the peak of the outbreak here in April and now with COVID-19 infections surging across the country, this new normal looks like it's going to last a long time.  </p><p>The health experts tell us that we are safer at home, but more time at home could also result in risks to consumers health, safety, and financial well-being. Young--young children, for example, are particularly at risk to household threats as parents struggling to juggle work and childcare were more likely to inadvertently lead leave their unsupervised, you know, young person or children and there's more potential for an injury from household dangers, for example. And for older Americans and senior citizens, months on end with little interpersonal contact and support has left them particularly vulnerable to the fraudsters praying on their isolation.  </p><p>So in March, just before much of the country went on lockdown, the subcommittee had a hearing examining their privilege proliferation of safe fake and unsafe products in the online marketplace. And while E-commerce has become something of a lifeline for many Americans sheltering at home, it's also laid bare the ubiquity of unsafe and counterfeit products as well as the truth that scammers abound making what's already a nightmare even worse. </p><p>Americans have purchased bogus treatments and at sham testing kits from unscrupulous sellers that flood social media sites. Even hospitals have fallen victims inadvertently purchasing counterfeit face masks that put the lives of our frontline health workers at risk. With widespread shortages and supply chain delays on key medical equipment and household essentials, opportunistic sellers are also price gouging consumers.  </p><p>And I think we've made some job gains in the last few months, but still, nearly 18 million Americans are still unemployed. Scammers are exploiting Americans struggling financially, including by targeting their stimulus checks and unemployment benefits. scammers have come with new versions of the old scams posing as the government, fund raising for fake charities among other things. And I think that the ongoing pandemic is no excuse to stop our vigilance on these consumer protection threats.  </p><p>So I'm proud to--to have joined you, Madam Chair and introducing the COVID-19 price in gouging prevention act, which prohibits the sale of consumer goods and services and unconscionable excessive prices. This legislation was included in the HEROES Act, which the House passed in May and social media platforms also need to do their part to protect American consumers.  </p><p>Yesterday, along with subcommittee Chairs Schakowsky, Doyle, and DeGette, I sent a letter to Facebook, and Google, and Twitter requesting regular monthly updates on their response to COVID-19 disinformation. The troubling rise in COVID-19 information is driving fear and conspiracy theories and impairing consumers ability to make rational and informed purchasing decisions and pushing consumers into the very traps of scammers peddling unproven and unbranded or misbranded products.  </p><p>So I look forward to this hearing. I--I have no doubt that what you're doing, Jan, is more important than ever given the COVID crisis because, you know, I know that I'm in my--in my district office in Long Branch. We're still closed. We're still operating virtually, but we're getting all kinds of calls from people talking about price gouging and scams.  </p><p>So this is a particularly important hearing. I want to thank the witnesses as well. I yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The--the gentleman yields back. And now the chair recognizes, I understand it, Mr. Carter who will be taking the place of, right now, ranking member of the--of the full committee for today. So Mr. Carter, you are working night for five minutes for your opening statement. </p><p>CARTER: Madam Chair, did you say it was just for today? I thought it was permanently. Daggum. Madam Chair, thank you for holding today's hearing and for the committee's efforts to highlight the issues facing consumers during this pandemic.  </p><p>Every day, we hear and see stories about people utilizing this time to scam, to fraud, and steal money from our fellow citizens. We are living through unprecedented times and we're seeing bad actors tried to take advantage of Americans during this pandemic. I'm pleased to see that the Trump administration step up and fight back.  </p><p>Earlier this year, President Trump signed an executive order on hoarding and price gouging and we have seen the Federal Trade Commission ramp up its efforts to both educate consumers and pursue actions against bad actors. Whether it's price gouging or Personal Protective Equipment or scamming money for senior citizens, this is a continued need for agencies like the FTC to work with private sector partners to strengthen protections for Americans.  </p><p>I think it's also important to look at the progress that's been made by the FTC during this pandemic. They certainly have met this challenge. Since January, they have been over 122 thousand reports to the FTC regarding fraud and other unsolicited activity activities. Of that number, 63 thousand were for fraud for a total loss of $79 million. </p><p>The FTC has done a good job of fighting this behavior, but they haven't done it alone. The private sector has taken a proactive approach in protecting their consume--protecting their customers and negating these fraudulent actions. It is this continued partnership that can ensure maximum effectiveness while addressing all aspects of the problems we're seeing popping up across the country.  </p><p>I've introduced bipartisan Legislation, the Combating Pandemic Scams Act, which is designed to strengthen the partnership between federal agencies overseeing these issues. There would have been--they would be required to disseminate that information to the public, including how to spot and report these scams in a way that is easily accessible and digestible in and in a manner that prioritizes senior citizens and people with infirmities and disabilities. </p><p>I firmly believe that more action in this space will help us as a committee address these actions across the country. Americans around the U.S. should be able to protect themselves, and one way to do that is arming them with up-to-date information on the practices to avoid. If they can spot this and report it to the appropriate agencies, they can help to protect their neighbors and communities.  </p><p>I look forward to today's hearing and our efforts to protect Americans against fraud and I hope that we will be able to continue bipartisan dialogue on solutions. I believe this is an area where we can find common ground in today's hearing is a step in the right direction. With that, I want to yield the remaining time to my colleague, Mr. Hudson in North Carolina. </p><p>HUDSON: Thank you, Mr. Carter and thank you, Madam Chair. Before I began, let me first extend the very special welcome to one of our witnesses. Kevin Anderson of the North Carolina Department of Justice. In North Carolina, we see pervasive attempts to defraud consumers, especially among elderly populations.  </p><p>Last month over $310,000 was lost to COVID related scams in our state. Additionally, NC DOJ has received 4908 reports of illegal robo-calls since we began the COVID-19 pandemic. That's just a small slice of what's happened across the country and illustrates the importance of addressing this issue. We appreciate you joining us today, Mr. Anderson, and we look forward to your testimony.  </p><p>For the past several months, the United States along with the rest of the world has grappled with COVID-19 and its impact on our health, safety, and way of life. But not only has COVID-19 proven to be a deadly disease, it's created an environment for nefarious actors to take advantage of people.  </p><p>During our hearing on misinformation in the digital age, I discussed efforts I'd taken to prevent the online sale an abuse of opioids. I believe we must take a similar approach to prevent the sale of deliberately misleading medications as it relates to COVID-19. I'm proud to join Mr. Carter as an original cosponsor of the Combating Pandemic Scams Act and am pleased to see how the use of emerging technology has not only allowed individuals to stay connected during this this historic pandemic, but also enable us to leverage new resources to combat the scams and fraudulent activities.  </p><p>I'm also thankful that there's been significant efforts by the President Trump's administration and the private businesses taking actions to eliminate deceptive behavior before the negatively impact our consumers. Together, they've shown the need for more public and private sector working together. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stay ahead of the changing nature of these scams. And with that, Madam Chair, I yield back the remaining 20 seconds of our time. Thank you. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The--the gentleman yields back. And now the chair would like to remind members that personal pursuant to committee rules, all members' written opening statements shall be made part of the record.  </p><p>And now, I have the pleasure to introduce our witnesses for today's hearing. Sally Greenberg is executive director of the National Consumer--National Consumers, which I understand is well over 100 years old organization. Thomas Quad--Quaadman is Executive Vice President of the Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness. The chamber technological engagement center and the global innovation and policy center at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  </p><p>And Kevin Anderson, Senior Deputy Attorney General and Director of the Consumer Protection Division at the North Carolina Department of Justice. We want to thank our witnesses for joining us today. We look forward to your testimony. And Ms. Greenberg, you are now recognized for five minutes. </p><p>GREENBERG: Thank you so much. Good morning or Good afternoon depending on what time zone you're in. Chairwoman Schakowsky, Ranking Member McMorris Rodgers and members of the subcommittee and thanks to the tremendous staff work that's gone into putting this very important hearing together.  </p><p>My name is Sally Greenberg. I'm executive director of the National Consumers League. And indeed, we have been around for over 120 years. I so appreciate your giving the NCL the opportunity to provide the subcommittee with our views on the increased risk of consumer fraud stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented tsunami of scams. A combination of rampant fear and misinformation about the virus combined with an economic catastrophe has made consumers more vulnerable than ever. Consumers are telling us about scammers stealing stimulus or unemployment checks, price gouging for in demand items such as protective masks and gloves, sales of fake health care products claimed claiming to treat or cure or vaccinate against COVID-19, and companies refusing consumer refunds for things like concerts or sporting events that have been cancelled.  </p><p>As one headline put it about COVID-19 pandemic, it has been pure hell for far too many consumers. The statistics about fraud linked to COVID-19 are sober. since the beginning of 2020, the Federal Trade Commission has received more than 122,000 complaints about scams, identity theft, and other types of fraud linked to COVID-19. And the FTC data is likely just the tip of the iceberg.  </p><p>In April alone, Google announced that it was tracking more than 18 million malware and phishing emails related to COVID-19 per day. The Secret Service recently testified over in the Senate in the Senate Judiciary Committee that at least $30 billion will end up in the hands of criminals. And the Department of Labor's Inspector General has estimated that there could be at least $26 billion in wasted unemployment insurance funds paid out with a large portion attributable to fraud. And in fact, in Washington state alone, criminals reportedly collected as much as $650 million in such unemployment benefits.  </p><p>Fraud linked to COVID 19 is a threat to public health as well. The pandemic has been a boom boon to scammers selling bogus coronavirus cures, vaccines, testing kids, and CBD infused immunity boosting products. At best, these products are ineffective. At worst, they can be dangerous or even deadly, particularly if a consumer is relying on such quack medicines instead of taking steps to reduce the risk of contracting the virus or seeking treatment when symptoms appear.  </p><p>Since March, the FDA has sent 80 warning letters to purveyors of fraudulent COVID-19 treatment product and the Federal Trade Commission has more warned more than 250 companies for similar conduct. The pandemic is also exacerbating the threat posed by unsafe products in the home.  </p><p>As the subcommittee has noted, since the beginning of the pandemic, child drownings, calls to poison control, and other hazards related to in home product have all increased as we all shelter in place. The CPSC's website currently features a prominent notice warning consumers that remedies identified in its recall alerts may not be available due to the pandemic. The pandemic has is also temporarily preventing some companies from accepting back recalled items.  </p><p>And while we are encouraged by the governmental approach to fighting back against COVID-19 scams, more needs to be done in our view to protect the public from the torrent of fraud and unfair and deceptive marketplace practices that threatened to overwhelm millions of consumers. The scourge of the coronavirus will not be significantly reduced by enforcement and consumer education alone.  </p><p>In particular, policy steps to address scammers' reliance on vulnerable payment systems are needed to augment enforcement and education. For example, we have on the books the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and the Fair Credit Billing Act, which provide consumers with important liability protections when credit card and debit cards are involved and used fraudulently. We believe those kinds of protections should be extended to other payment mechanisms that fraudsters use such as wire transfers, gift cards, and bank accounts.  </p><p>At the NCL fraud center, we have that URL fraud.org so we know--we know a lot about fraud. We're also receiving a steady stream of reports of scammers using peer to peer payment services like PayPal friends and family, Venmo, Zelle, and Cash App to defraud consumers and we recently met with pen pal--PayPal, sorry to discuss how their use--the uses of their services can be better protected. And while these initial meetings have been encouraging, we urge members of this subcommittee to work with colleagues on financial services and other committees of jurisdiction to develop policies to better protect users of peer to peer payment services from fraud of all kinds, particularly scams linked to COVID.  </p><p>Chairwoman Schakowsky, on behalf of the National Consumers League, we thank you for your continuing work to protect the public from scams and for including the consumer perspective as you consider these important issues. Thank you. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Well, thank you. And now Mr. Quad--Quaadman is recognized for five minutes. </p><p>QUAADMAN: Thank you, Chairman--Chairwoman Schakowsky, Ranking Member McMorris Rodgers, members of the subcommittee. I appreciate the opportunity to testify before you today. COVID-19 has had profound impacts on our society. It has changed how people live, work, learn, and how they provide for their daily needs. It has changed how businesses operate and how they interact with their customers.  </p><p>It has also revealed shortcomings in the digital ecosystem in both our private and public ecosystems. Addressing these issues will help everyday Americans get through the crisis and help assist in finding vaccines and treatments, create the marketplace of the future, provide consumers with more information, choices, and opportunities, and establish new efficiencies and private and public sectors while promoting opportunities for economic recovery and job creation.  </p><p>The business community and tech industry had been rising to meet these challenges. Splunk, TransUnion and Salesforce have been leading a data driven--data driven approach to track COVID-19 and help businesses reopen. Here, SAS, SAP and Facebook have systems helping with mapping and tracking of COVID-19.  </p><p>IBM, Oracle, RELEX, SAP, Google, and Microsoft art using databases, supercomputing, cloud and AI technology to help with medical research. TransUnion is providing consumers with free weekly credit reports as well as giving tools to help consumers to protect our identity and credit.  </p><p>Amazon and 3M are fighting price gouging. Amazon is removing counterfeit product from its platform platforms. AT&amp;T, charger, Comcast, and Verizon are keeping--people connected this--regardless of their ability to pay. Intel, AT&amp;T and Charter or helping low income students with distance learning. Uber, Lyft, and Postmates are providing aid to their workers. Instacart is in the process of or has hired 550,000 shoppers to help with on-demand grocery delivery.  </p><p>The chamber, since mid-March, has convened almost 200,000 people to explore resolution of these issues to help educate businesses on reopening as well as to help with relief efforts. Indeed, the global brands council of our global innovation policy center has developed and published a guide for consumers on how they can identify and avoid counterfeit goods. Indeed, the global brands council has been working with DHS and other government agencies to get goal--counterfeit goods out of the marketplace.  </p><p>Other actions must be taken to assist consumers and spur economic recovery and job creation. America needs a national data privacy bill. Our counterparts have at unitary regulatory system whereas we have a patchwork of state and federal regulations. We need one system of regulation to provide uniformity for consumers and businesses throughout the United States.  </p><p>We also need to address the cost of implementation. The California CCPA regulations will cost small businesses $50,000 each with implementation. we need to ensure that consumers have the privacy protections that they need and that we can make sure that the U.S. is competitive in global economy.  </p><p>Americans need connectivity to provide for families and to be productive. Broadband deployment, including 5G and the resolution of remote learning issues are important steps forward. The chamber in the last 10 days has issued principles on broadband deployment and closing the homework gap. We must also develop strategies to ensure U.S. global attack leadership such as rational policies for AI, automated vehicle and UAS. These will all be important drivers of economic growth.  </p><p>While promoting technology leadership, industry and commerce must work together to prevent scans amongst our most vulnerable, ensuring consumers are getting the products they were purchasing and establishing safe work environments. Businesses also need temporary, targeted, and timely liability provisions in order to reopen and operate during the emergency.  </p><p>Let me be clear, bad actors must be held accountable and prosecuted to the full extent of the law, but Congress must set a floor to help a--to help create at uniform safe harbor and a federalist system. This has been done in other COVID legislation. If businesses are allowed--are following the law or state guidelines, they shouldn't be sued. We look forward to working with the subcommittee on these issues and I'm happy to take any questions you may have.  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you. And now Mr. Anderson, you are recognized for five minutes. </p><p>ANDERSON: Thank you. Good afternoon. It's good to be here today. I'd like to thank the chair and the ranking member and the members of the subcommittee for the opportunity to appear today and for the intent--the attention the subcommittee is paying to this important issue. I'd like to thank Representative Hudson for the nice words earlier. Good to see someone else from North Carolina, Representative Hudson, and hope you're doing well.  </p><p>COVID-19 scams--well, again, I'm Kevin Anderson. I've been doing consumer protection work in our office in the North Carolina Department of Justice for over 21 years. I've worked under three different attorneys general including current Attorney General Josh Stein who's also the Co-chair of the National Association of Attorneys General Consumer Protection Committee. And thank you again for the opportunity to provide our perspective today--or my perspective today.  </p><p>COVID-19 scams are very damaging to the public and are causing enormous harm during these difficult and challenging times. Consumer protection authority authorities know from experience that when a crisis hits, scammers emerge to deceive the public and this crisis has been no different. of course, this crisis has been an unusual and unprecedented impact in duration, so the scams have been even more damaging here.  </p><p>State attorneys in general and consumer protection divisions are on the ground and on the front lines protecting consumers and there's been a tremendous amount of work going on all across the country in efforts to educate consumers about scams and stop scams and protect consumers from scams. Each state is hearing different types of things from its consumers. Some scams are nationwide in scope, others are more localized. And I provided a long list of examples in my testimony about the types of things states are hearing about from consumers.  </p><p>I--I won't repeat all of them in detail here in my summary, but some of the ones that may be particularly noteworthy are the stimulus check scams, the scams involving COVID-19 testing and miracle cures, and some recent scams that have emerged regarding contact tracing, and then of course, states, as others have mentioned are seeing price gouging and price gouging in connection with guide items that we don't normally see and another type of state of emergency situation such as a--such as a hurricane. So some of the price gouging matters we are seeing are--are new to us here.  </p><p>And there are different matters being investigated by states all over the country. I've included some examples in my testimony of some of the things that we've done in North Carolina. We have a price gouging case that pending that we brought against a towing company that was charging thousands and thousands of dollars booting trucks that were delivering needed supplies and goods and--in an early stage of the crisis to stores and charging amounts that were way out of line with market rates for those tows. So we sued that company in a price gouging case.  </p><p>There are a number of matters involving scams that we've managed to stop and nip in the bud by acting quickly and sending some letters out. And--and one thing I want to note here is the, to use a technical term, whack-a-mole nature of some of these scams where the true scammers don't--don't want to be found and they try to hide themselves, they make it difficult to be located and then, once scam has been enacted and they've struck, they like to disappear quickly so that they can't be tracked down. And that's just the reality of some of these outright criminal type scams that are--that are going on.  </p><p>One of the--one of the things I think that points out is the importance of educating consumers here, trying to--to make consumers informed, make them less likely to fall for the scams. If you can prevent the scams from the outset and prevent the consumers from sending their money away, especially via a form of payment such as a wire transfer or a bank transfer or a gift card exchange for the money becomes very difficult to track back once it's been sent out, it's really best to prevent the scams before they occur.  </p><p>So--and--and one of the important things I think the subcommittee is doing today is by having hearings like this today, it's a good way of shedding light on the scams and bringing them in the public eye. So I think that's very valuable. States play an important role in--in fighting these matters. It's a--it's a matter that really requires attention on all sorts of fronts, state and federal.  </p><p>Appreciate the opportunity to provide the perspective of the states here because the states do play a very important role on consumer protection. And again, we're right on the ground. We hear directly from our consumers almost every day. It's a never ending battle fighting all of these scams. I'm happy to answer any questions you have, happy to be of help in any way that I can to the subcommittee. And thank you again for the opportunity to be here today. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Well, thank you very much. So we have now concluded witnesses opening statements. At this time, we will move to member questions. each member will have five minutes to ask a question of the witnesses. And I want to remind you, please, to unmute when--when it's your turn. And I'm going to begin with my--my question.  </p><p>So the Federal Trade Commission has received a record number of online shopping complaints in April and--and May. Some of them are really important, things for face masks and hand sanitizers and toilet paper, and found that they never received those--those--those products.  </p><p>A surge of bogus treatment treatments and substandard masks, et cetera have been--had been delivered. So Mr. Anderson, as you said, you've been doing this for more than--than two decades. How has E-commerce, including the new pandemic induced reliability reliance, rather on online shopping made it easier than ever to--for scammers to get involved? </p><p>ANDERSON: Well, this is one of these things I think where technology and when items are sold online in some ways it does make it easier for the scammers if they are operating remotely, if they're selling from overseas, if they're making it difficult, you know, for consumers to really even figure out who is actually making the sale. That--that can pose some--some obstacles. So one, and--and challenges no question. And in some ways, it does increase the opportunity for some of these scams.  </p><p>We--we often try to encourage consumers when they're buying online to do as much research as they can regarding the companies that they're buying from to see if there's any track record of problems there or if it's a reputable seller. But there's no question that when line--when sales are occurring online and, in particular, if it's difficult to determine and track down who's actually making the sales and if they're coming from overseas and from a seller that's new and to maybe not reputable, it can increase some of the opportunities for--for fraud. It's one of those things where technology has many benefits for consumers and all of us, but they are there can be dangers as--as well.  </p><p>And I would say generally, scammers are always looking to--looking to hide. I mean, back many years ago, scammers would pop up door to door and try to sell things to people and just disappear. And the more modern version of that is using technology and disappearing via the Internet. So it's a good question And I think that's what I would say. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you. You know, it seems like a major obstacle to bringing successful actions in simply locating the scammer. I think you referred to that. I'm working on legislation that would require online marketplaces to verify and to disclose to consumers the sellers name, business, address, email address, and phone number. So let me ask Ms. Greenberg. How would such legislation deter bad actors? </p><p>GREENBERG: Well first of all, we support that--your legislative efforts in this in this whole area because a fundamental pillar of consumer protection is to know who you're buying from and if you have a problem with a product to be able to get in touch with the seller of that product. So what you just described to verify the name of the business, where the business is located, how you reach out to them if you have a problem, either you didn't get the product or the product was defective when it came. Those are absolutely fundamental protections and we support them for--for consumers. </p><p>Consumers are very trusting. You know, if they buy something online in a platform like Amazon, they will believe that that product came from a legitimate source, if they were to get the product that they were paying for, but they need to have information so they can take action when the product they buy online turns to be--turns out to be counterfeit or defective. So yes, we support that and we think it's a basic consumer protection. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Let me--let me just conclude with this. I--I am very concerned about the nomination of Dr. Beck to be the--head up the Consumer Product Safety Commission. And it seems to me this is a critical time when we need somebody with the right credentials. I wanted to ask you, Ms. Greenberg, which you think given her record at the EPA and her role at the CDC if she is the appropriate person. </p><p>GREENBERG: Right. Well we have joined 120 other groups, consumer organizations and other advocacy organizations that believe that that CPSC needs a leader who has a track record of pursuing stronger consumer protection regulations. And unfortunately, Dr. Beck has spent much of her career seeking to weaken such regulations, particularly as they pertain to dangerous chemicals.  </p><p>We think that the CPSC needs a leader who will strengthen consumer protections, not roll them back. And as you know, your colleagues on the Senate side, including Senator Capito and Senator Collins have come out opposing Dr. Beck's nomination as the wrong person to run a consumer protection agency. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: I thank you for that and now I recognize the ranking member for her five minutes of questions. </p><p>RODGERS: All right. Thank you, Madam Chair. Before I begin my questions, I'd like to ask unanimous consent to offer an article for the record highlighting the current use of AI to combat schemes. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Yes. All documents will be put in the--in the record at the end of this hearing.  </p><p>RODGERS: Thank you. Trial lawyers and special interest groups have stopped a number of common sense policies before this committee. In the past year alone, we've seen the trial bar obstruct bills that would protect would have protected people from asbestos, prevented frivolous medical malpractice lawsuits, ensure that U.S. lead in autonomous vehicles, and give Americans strong privacy protections across the country.  </p><p>I believe that we cannot afford to allow them to stand in the way of America reopening and getting workers back to work. Mr. Quaadman, how important is it for Congress to address liability uncertainty during this unprecedented time and how will that help America get back to full strength? </p><p>QUAADMAN: Thank you for that question, Ranking Member. That is very critical in order for US to reopen and we have liability relief. it needs to be temporary, targeted, and timely. If companies are following state laws and guidelines in reopening, they shouldn't be sued. And this isn't only the business community that's being impacted, it's educational facilities, it's not for profits, that are actually state agencies that are having similar problems.  </p><p>I would also say too, Congress has also recognized this issue as well with COVID-19 legislation that's already passed. There's been liability relief for--for medical volunteers as well as those who are manufacturing ventilators. So this is a very critical step in order for businesses and America to reopen. </p><p>RODGERS: Thank you. We are living in unprecedented times that have forced millions of Americans at no fault of their own to stay home and rely on the Internet to seek medical advice, connect with loved ones, and educate their children. As more people turn to online services, they need the--we need that national privacy framework and that need only increases. Mr. Quaadman, I'd like to ask if you agree it is critical that we pass a federal privacy law that sets one national standard to ensure consumer protections are the same across the country. </p><p>QUAADMAN: We believe that is a very important step that we need to take as well as an important consumer protection step. We currently have a state based and federal a system and we have five different forms of privacy regimes that are currently being developed within the states. Obviously, the CCPA out in California is the best known, but if you take a look at our international counterpart, they only have one system of regulation.  </p><p>So we are currently going down a path where neither consumers nor businesses actually have the certainty that they need to operate digitally. So we believe it is very important for such legislation to pass, and I would also say too, there's a cost involved as well. When you take a look at that CCPA regulations, those will cost small businesses $50,000 to implement. So that's a very tremendous cost and we need to--we need to have one system to deal with this.  </p><p>RODGERS: Thank you. During this crisis, I think we've all heard so many different stories of American ingenuity and American creativity solving problems and I think American innovation is so important as we move forward. We must ensure that we do not fall behind other countries as we emerge from this unprecedented crisis.  </p><p>We know China is moving full speed ahead to beat China, we must prioritize our industries and ensure that the U.S. remains a global innovation leader around emerging technology. We recently unveiled an emergency emerging technology package that includes important priorities brought forward by members of the subcommittee to advance U.S. leadership on critical technology. Mr. Quaadman, can you please speak to how vital it is for America to emerge from this pandemic in a strong global position on critical technologies?  </p><p>QUAADMAN: To be clear, the nation that's going to lead and technology is going to lead the global economy. So first off, I'd like to thank you and--and your colleagues for their work in coming up with emerging technology agenda. We think that's very important. And America is still the leader in innovation. You see that with artificial intelligence, you see that with automated vehicles with UAS.  </p><p>However, we are seeing where the European Union is the leader in developing regulations around artificial intelligence. We see that UK is the leader in terms of developing regulations around financial technology. And that's where the technology is going to migrate to. So we're actually in danger of developing technologies that others might take over, and that is going to impact our economy and the ability of the United States to lead the global economy in the future. </p><p>RODGERS: Thank you. I yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: I was trying to get back to--to the ranking member. You had 30 seconds extra because some--there was some problem with the--with the clock. Do you would you like to take that time? </p><p>RODGERS: Oh, well I appreciate that. I'll--I'll just let it go right now. Thank you very much though. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Okay, the gentlelady yields back and now let me recognize Chairman Pallone of the full committee for five minutes to ask his questions.  </p><p>PALLONE: Thank you Madam Chairwoman Schakowsky. I know that--I wanted to follow up on you said--what you said that, you know, in New Jersey, we are still seeing--even in my office I still hear a lot of people calling complaining about price gouging. And you know, this is of course many months after the pandemic began, but it still seems to be that there are more cases of businesses illegally hiking prices on things like cleaning supplies and Personal Protective Equipment.  </p><p>And now, you know, a lot of targeting of work at home supplies and summer products or here at the Jersey Shore like inflatable pools because, you know, a lot of Americans art looking for products that--that can allow them to stay home and--and not have to go out. So I just wanted to ask Mr. Anderson, again, I know you talked about price gouging increasing and you mentioned online, but just to drill down a little bit about what kind of increases you've seen in price gouging online and what challenges you see in pursuing bad actors who sell online. I just want to focus online, if you would.  </p><p>ANDERSON: Sure. Hold on. There we go. Sure. And many of the items that we are seeing being sold online where consumers have reported price gouging involve personal protective type equipment, hand sanitizer, masks, things of those items are--are being sold overline--online and we've heard some reports about--about those.  </p><p>And again, you know, the challenges sometimes are--and it really just really depends on who the seller is. It might depend on what platform they are using, whether they're using a more obscure type of online platform as opposed to one that consumers are familiar with. But there can be a lot of challenges just locating the seller sometimes when they're selling online. But those--those are the types of items that are being sold online and some of the reports that we are hearing about and we have some investigations currently pending regarding some of those items that have--types of items that have been sold online. </p><p>PALLONE: Well, you--Chairwoman Schakowsky and I, she mentioned that we introduced this COVID-19 price gouging prevention act. Do you--I just would like you to comment on that. Is, you know, is that the type of legislation on price gouging that would make it easier for state attorney generals to go after bad actors and protect consumers, again, particularly online? </p><p>ANDERSON: Sure. And let me give a very quick caveat before I answer that question, which I should have given earlier is that even though I'm here in my role as consumer protection director of the North Carolina Department of Justice, some of the views here I might express today are my own. But I say that in an effort to be able to provide some helpful answers to your questions. so I--I have looked at that--at that bill.  </p><p>I'll make a couple of just general observations here without taking an official position on it or anything is--is one, I think states are typically looking and at least I'm typically looking at a bill like that in terms of does it preempt states from acting and--and that bill does not. So I would say generally, that's a positive thing in that it doesn't preempt states.  </p><p>Another observation is that it gives states the ability to enforce the law, which again, I think from a state perspective or my perspective is a positive thing because it gives us another tool in our toolbox to--to use. And--and I think having the ability to enforce a federal law like that, even if a state has its own price gouging law, there's potential benefit in that it might fill some gaps that the state law doesn't--doesn't cover.  </p><p>And certainly for a state that doesn't have a price gouging law at all and--and you might want to talk directly to some of those states to get their input on it, but just intuitively, if a state doesn't have a price gouging law at all and there's a new federal law enacted that they can enforce, that would certainly seem to provide that state with a new tool that they don't currently have. And I would think that would be a benefit to a state like that. So those are just some general observations. </p><p>PALLONE: Well, thank you. Thank you, chairwoman. Thank you, Jan. I yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentleman yields back and I now recognize Mr. Latta for his questions for five minutes. </p><p>LATTA: Thank you, Madam Chair for having today's hearing. Very important. I want to also thank our witnesses for being with us today. Really appreciate your time and because again, it's a--it's an issue that we're all concerned with.  </p><p>But again, thank you again for holding today's important hearing to protect consumers from the risks that have been amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. I'd also like to thank our witnesses for participating.  </p><p>For the past five months, our nation has been devastated by the outbreak of COVID-19 because of our evolving understanding of the virus, Americans have been inundated with conflicting information on how best to protect themselves and their families both physically and financially. Unfortunately, the uncertainty generated by this crisis is providing new opportunities for bad actors to try to take advantage of our concerned citizens. </p><p>That is why we need to be--to redouble our efforts to combat these scammers. The pandemic has also inspired businesses and individuals to innovate in order to make the new challenges we are experiencing. For example, during a visit to the camps of Bowling Green State University in May, I saw how unmanned delivery services, robots are already being used to deliver food and beverages in our community.  </p><p>This--this kind of remarkable innovation is why I introduced HR 6943, the Advancing Unmanned Delivery Services Act before we work to evaluate the many benefits contactless delivery has for various segments in sectors of our of our country. Again, Madam Chair, before I begin my questions, I also have an article I'd like to introduce to the record from dearbrain.com that highlights how autonomous robots will be used to deliver food on campus in the fall including on the campus of Bowling Green State University.  </p><p>Mr. Quaadman, if I could start my questions with you, in your written testimony, you state that companies are working to provide solutions to consumers that are targeted by scams. Would you state a few of these solutions and how is the business community working to keep up with the scammers?  </p><p>QUAADMAN: Thank you very much for that question, Mr. Latta. First off, companies are using different tools such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to try and stay a step ahead of scammers. Unfortunately, we have seen fraudulent online fraudulent activity increase by about 10 percent since COVID-19 has taken place. There have also been the business community has been trying to work with other agencies to try and deal with these issues as well.  </p><p>And we hope as they said in trying to develop that counterfeit guide that I--that I talked about that we can also inform consumers. Because an informed consumer is a protected consumer. So we think some of the legislation that has also been discussed here but also I know then introduced by Mr. Carter and Ms. Rochester are going to help provide consumers with more information as well, which we think is helpful also. </p><p>LATTA: Good. Thank you. You know, on the innovation front, you stated that delivery industry is evolving to meet consumer needs. And how have businesses that rely on delivery see delivery services then impacted by COVID-19 and the current regulations or lack thereof impede the expansion of unmanned autonomous technologies? </p><p>QUAADMAN: So first off, Mr. Latta, I wanted to thank you for your leadership with--with unmanned delivery services as well as with automated vehicles. I'll just give you one a couple of stories. One is we have seen an automated vehicle startup called Beep in Jacksonville, Florida where they had been working with the Jacksonville transportation authority to provide--to deliver medical goods to the Mayo Clinic there.  </p><p>And we're seeing how UPS and CVS are using drones to actually deliver prescription drugs to consumers. So that's I think a glimpse into the future. We do think it is very important, one for Congress to pass legislation and to help put pressure to ensure that we are going to have regulations around automated vehicles.  </p><p>We think it is very important for the national highways safety--Traffic Safety Administration to accelerate its efforts here. We also think with drones it is very important for the FAA to finish up its rulemakings as well because this will, again allow for the guardrails for how these important transportation vehicle facilities are going to be able to operate and are going to make actually the lives of consumers much easier. </p><p>LATTA: Well, I appreciate that because again when you're thinking about especially with autonomous vehicles and, you know, it came out of our committee unanimously, passed the house by vote--voice vote in the last Congress, but just we could be doing what we could be doing with autonomous vehicles right now, so many people that don't want to be out right now or have somebody pick them up that, you know, they have the ability to be in a vehicle that they'd feel a lot more safe. Madam Chair, I see my time has expired and I thank you very much for today's hearing. I yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you. And next, I recognize Congresswoman Castor for five minutes. </p><p>CASTOR: Well thank you very much, Chair Schakowsky and thanks to our witnesses for being here today. I have to tell you I just got some very disturbing news here in Florida related to COVID. It was just announced that Florida just sent--set an unfortunate record. We've had 120 deaths in just 24 hour period. That far exceeds any number we had seen before. The positivity rate for testing is well over 18 percent.  </p><p>I'll tell you, I was checking around with hospital leaders here in the Tampa Bay area yesterday and I'm completely dismayed to hear there are still significant shortages in testing materials, their reagents, the Personal Protective Equipment, staffing. We had--we have a--and extreme shortage of Remdesivir.  </p><p>A little bit of good news, the coronavirus taskforce last night CDC and Dr. Birx said that they were going to send an emergency supply here to Florida on Friday. But I am completely frustrated with the Trump administration. After we have provided bipartisan direction and funds to get a handle on supplies and PPE and to boost the supply chains, it's just not there.  </p><p>And I want to ask our--our witnesses, what is your sense about the--the absence of the national testing strategy and a--a strategy on supply chains for critical equipment? What has--has that helped fuel these scam artists? The--my hospitals tell me they--they can't count on the Fed right now. Can you believe that and that they have to go and still work other lines. But maybe I'll start with Mr. Anderson. What's your--your sense of the lack of leadership there and the lack of the national strategy and what that's done to fuel scam artists and price gouging? </p><p>ANDERSON: Well, I'll just say generally that scam artists are usually looking to fill some sort of need that consumers have or desperately want. And so in this time, you know, obviously consumers would really love to have a cure for COVID-19. So scam artists are going to move in and try to fill that desire and need by promoting scam cures.  </p><p>And I think it's the same with testing, that if there aren't tests out there or if consumers are confused about tests, I mean, scammers will try to make whatever they can out of any confusing situation, any--any situation where consumers, you know, feel like their needs aren't being met. So I would just kind of make that general comment.  </p><p>And we should never underestimate how clever and sophisticated some of these scams are. The scam artists are looking for every opportunity to get in and rip people off. And so that's--that's part of what's happening here. So that's just what I would say generally. </p><p>CASTOR: Mr. Quaadman, what do you say? </p><p>QUAADMAN: Yeah, thank you for that question. I'm sorry to hear of--of the pain that is going on in Florida. First off, we have worked with various different agencies as I've talked about to ensure that those bad actors are going to be prosecuted. We've also been working with Congress and with others to ensure that medical supplies are--and that companies that are delivering them and are delivering them and developing them are going to be able to get them out there as quickly as possible. And lastly, some of the activities I was talking about before in terms of supercomputing--supercomputing and things that are going on, those things are actually shaving off months if not years in terms of research in trying to (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>CASTOR: --So where--where is the national strategy on this? It it's entirely frustrating. This has been bipartisan direction from the Congress to this administration to get a handle on this and yet, and yet they still--there's still--our hospitals and health systems are still scraping for--for supplies. Ms. Greenberg, can you shed any light on this for us? </p><p>GREENBERG: Sure, yes. I think there has been a void in national leadership and national direction. And as a result, states are forced to compete with one another and have raised this issue over and over again. We have to do much better. We have failed I think on a national level dramatically to get a handle on this pandemic and create a national strategy which has states working together, which delivers products which are high-quality.  </p><p>And we know that some states bought lots of equipment that turned out to be defective and spent millions of dollars. This can never happen again. We need a much stronger national program bipartisan and we--you know, so sad to hear about events in Florida and we are committed to doing much better when it comes to testing, personal--PPE, equipment to provide to your hospitals. We are--we despair as well. </p><p>CASTOR: Thank you very much. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentlewoman yields back and now I recognize Congressman Guthrie for his five minutes of questions. </p><p>GUTHRIE: Thank--thank you, Madam Chair. And before I begin my questions, I'd like to offer an article for the record highlighting how blockchain can be used in our flight against the coronavirus. I think it's been distributed prior, so I'd offer that for the record.  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: That will be added to the record at the end of the hearing. </p><p>GUTHRIE: Thank you. Thank you. I--I believe that emerging technology has the potential to be a useful tool in putting a stop to the bad actors that take advantage of COVID-19 pandemic. That is why I recently introduced two bills, the Advancing Blockchain Act working with my good friend Doris Matsui and the Countering Online Harms Act.  </p><p>The Advancing Blockchain Act would direct the Department of Commerce and FTC to study potential applications of blockchain technology. The Countering Online Harms Act would direct the Federal Trade Commission to study how artificial intelligence may be used to identify and remove deceptive and fraudulent content that is intended to scam or do harm.  </p><p>So I'd like to get to questions now. For Mr. Quaadman, you talked about emerging technologies being used to help combat the COVID-19 crisis on multiple fronts, including in the therapy development, tracking the spread of the virus. How--my question is how important would you say AI, blockchain, and other emerging technologies have then in our fight against COVID-19 and do you see any obstacles in further deploying these technologies?  </p><p>QUAADMAN: These emerging technologies have been critical in the fight against COVID. So as I mentioned, you're seeing how IBM, Google, Microsoft and others are using open databases let's say relics opened up where they are actually able to look now using artificial intelligence through tens of thousands of articles and--and research studies to start to pinpoint possible treatments and vaccines.  </p><p>So as an example, BenevolentAI, which is an AI firm in the UK did--they use a I and they were able to discover that a rheumatoid arthritis drug from Eli Lilly is a potential candidate. That is now going through clinical treatments. So we think it is important and this is just from the, you know, taking it from a larger point of view, we do think it is very important for NIST to come up with standards for AI. We also think it is critical for OMB to finish up its guidance regarding AI because that will allow AI to be deployed more fully, but it will also set the United States up to have the certainty needed to be the continued leader in this space.  </p><p>GUTHRIE: Okay, thank you. And I wanted to go to Mr. Anderson for a question. During this health--this public health crisis, Federal Trade Commission has continued its working--it's work protecting consumers, providing guidance to businesses, and protecting competition in the marketplace throughout the pandemic, in addition to the work that states are doing to protect consumers from scams. Mr. Anderson, in addition to protecting Americans privacy, are there any recommendations you believe that we need to consider as we prepare for a possible second wave--second wave of COVID-19? </p><p>ANDERSON: Well, I do think we need to give serious thought to bringing all tools that we can bear to protect consumers here. I mean, I was interested in some of your comments you made earlier about using technology in whatever way possible to protect consumers and--and there may be a place for looking at algorithms that detect patterns of fraud detect patterns of fraud, so I think those types of things using technology as--as a means of protection are worth exploring.  </p><p>Just to give an example, in the robocall area, which I know is an area that you all probably hear about all the time, it's a huge source of complaints for us, we--the--the world changed their out while back where all the calls started coming from overseas. Scammers were using technology to spoof the calls and part of the solution going forward I think has to be a technological solution at least in part, which is why our office was not satisfied with some of the progress being made on that front. We spearheaded and offered with other states to work with telecom companies to, with better tools to block and identify robo-calls, give consumers some tools. So I think this idea of looking at technology is--is a good one.  </p><p>I think looking at ways in which information and education best reaches the public and is most easily understood by the public to help them prevent some scams, I'm just sort of brainstorming here in response to your question, is a good thing to look at. So I think looking at all sorts of possibilities and taking a very broad minded approach to it is a--is a good way to go.  </p><p>GUTHRIE: Okay. Okay, thank you very much. I only have 15 seconds left, so it's hard to ask another question, so I'll yield back and thank you for your--your answers today. Appreciate it and thank you for being here.   </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: And now--the gentleman yields back, and now representative and my friend from Illinois, Congresswoman Robin Kelly.  </p><p>KELLY: Thank you, Madam Chair and thank you for putting this hearing together. Until a vaccine or effective treatment is available for COVID-19, successful management of the pandemic will rely on tried and true public health measures like contact tracing to keep our communities safe. Effective contact tracing will allow health officials to not only document the spread of the virus, but also alert those who may have been exposed to the virus.  </p><p>Unfortunately, scammers pretending to be contact tracers from public health departments have been targeting seniors and those less attack tech savvy duping them into turning over sensitive personal and financial information or tricking them into downloading a malicious software. Mr. Anderson, what effect do these scams have on the public health efforts to do legitimate contact tracing to combat COVID-19 and how can consumers tell if the text, call, or email is even legitimate and who can the consumers call if they feel like they have been duped? Who should they contact? </p><p>ANDERSON: By think that's a great and timely question because we are just starting to see a number of different contact tracing type scams emerge. And one example, which I think you alluded to is a situation where a consumer will receive a call from a--it's a scammer, but they're saying that the consumer has come in contact with someone who had COVID-19 and to begin the start of the contact tracing process, the consumer needs to immediately provide some sort of payment to the caller. And that--that's just a scam.  </p><p>And a big red flag there is that my understanding is that no one from a legitimate health department or anyone operating a legitimate contact tracing operation will ask for payment like that and directly call the consumer and ask for a payment. And that's a standard type of scam that we see in many different forms where a sense of urgency is created and in response to something of the moment and there's a demand for an immediate payment. And especially if they are asking for a payment via wire transfer or a gift card, all those things are big red flags.  </p><p>So you know, we've been trying to warn consumers about those types of scams. Another scam we've seen is a job related contact tracing scam where there are jobs out there for people to be employed and help with the contact tracing process, but we've unfortunately seen some phony job postings that we've checked with our public health authorities that aren't legitimate and we're trying to stop those, put an end to those and we've warned the public about those as well. So that's a very timely topic and worth warning people about.  </p><p>KELLY: And what more do you think the FTC could be doing to assist in your efforts in North Carolina and helping consumers? And if you could be brief, because I wanted to ask Ms. Greenberg if she had anything else to add. So Mr. Anderson. </p><p>ANDERSON: Sure. And I would say--and we share information and work with the FTC. We welcome sharing information with them, welcome them as a partner. I always think just in my personal view, we could bring more joint enforcement actions together with the Federal Trade Commission in addition to just sharing information. So I know you wanted me to be brief, so I'll stop there, but I'm happy to talk further with you offline about that if you want. </p><p>KELLY: Sounds good. Ms. Greenberg, do you have anything else to add, what the federal government could be doing to help stop these scams and help consumers? </p><p>GREENBERG: Yeah, well we--we need to ramp up this whole area of contact tracing and consumers are already having--health officials are already having trouble reaching consumers about contact tracing. This is an unprecedented situation. You don't usually have people calling you and say we need to get your information, we need to check this. </p><p>And of course, the scammers go in. They fill these voids always in a time of national crisis. They are going to come in tornadoes and floods and to this pandemic has just unleashed a torrent of--of scams. So there--what Mr. Anderson said about money upfront, that's a red flag always. There are also just phishing scams where they're trying to get your information.  </p><p>And so what I would say is get the--the caller's phone number, address, who they are attached to, with their email addresses. We always advise consumers trust but verify. And this is an unprecedented situation with contact tracing. But there are ways to verify this information.  </p><p>So especially for seniors, if they were home alone, they need to have another adult who's taking care of them, a family member to verify all this information. So they are not giving their Social Security away, their--their bank account information away, that's--that's relate the--the threat that we are seeing out there.  </p><p>KELLY: Thank you so much. Time's up. I yield back.  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: I just want to remind people if anybody is there that is not actually on the screen, you will not be called on to speak and of course to unmute yourself. Next is Representative Gianforte. </p><p>GIANFORTE: Thank you, Chair Schakowsky and Republican Leader McMorris Rodgers for the opportunity to speak on the important issues preventing--preventing COVID scams. COVID-19 has put our communities into uncertain times. at the height of the pandemic, 100,000 Montanans were out of work.  </p><p>Unfortunately, Where normal human beings see hardship and react with compassion, scammers seek to further destroy the livelihoods of hardworking Montanans. One of the scammers favorite tools is still that robo-call. now it's easier than ever for scammers to impersonate medical professionals or government representatives from Medicare or Medicaid to push misleading information or to swindle vulnerable--vulnerable Montanans out of their savings.  </p><p>While the committee has worked hard to address the scourge of robo-calls, there is still work to be done. In April, I sent a letter to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai and Attorney General Barr expressing the need to begin implementation of the TRACE Act and aggressively pursue illegal robo-callers. Not two days later, the FCC took new enforcement measures against telecom companies that facilitate robo-calls from overseas.  </p><p>It's important that this committee continue to work in a bipartisan manner to provide law enforcement the tools they need to crack down on scammers and protect hard working Montanans. In this pandemic, however, it's also important that we provide businesses with the tools they need to get our economy know going and get Montanans back to work.  </p><p>There's an opportunity to foster growth an emerging technologies to strengthen our economy. I introduced the Advancing Gig Economy Act to conduct a study on the impact of the gig economy on U.S. businesses conducting Interstate Commerce. The study will provide states with greater clarity around the gig economy and better inform future legislation to grow the gig economy.  </p><p>It's important that America remains a global leader in fostering a growing emerging technology. As a tech entrepreneur and executive, I know how important American leadership is in emerging tech. It's critical for the federal government to promote innovation And growth by securing supply chains, safeguarding compute--consumers, and using a light touch regulatory environment.  </p><p>Now Mr. Quaadman, in your testament--testimony, you identified how delivery services in the gig economy have stepped up to provide important assistance to local restaurants, health workers, and food banks. Moving forward, what role do you see the gig economy playing as our nation recovers from the economic shock of COVID-19? </p><p>QUAADMAN: thank you very much for that question, Congressman. And you're right. I mean, the gig economy has been an important lifeline not only for consumers, but for some very hard hit industries such as the restaurant industry. As we've discussed, we recently had an event at the chamber where the CEO of emphasis actually was talking about this issue and as he was discussing it, he said that 5 percent of the current workforce could be characterized as being gig workers. This is probably going to go up to somewhere to 20 to 25 percent over the next, you know, 10 years or so.  </p><p>That means we're--those workers are going to have to go through career long learning because they're going to be doing many different jobs, sometimes simultaneously. And it's going to create some challenges. Now, there are some there are some advantages that gig workers will have too, right, in terms of being able to control their schedules and all, but you know, we're seeing work--work business relationship that is going to be different than what it has been in the past and it's going to--it's going to create some policy--policies that are going to have to be addressed such as within education. </p><p>GIANFORTE: Okay. Thank you, Mr. Quaadman. Just to get that correct, you said the percentage of gig workers will go from 5 percent to 25 percent of--of what universe is that? </p><p>QUAADMAN: Of the workforce-- </p><p>GIANFORTE: --Of the entire workforce. </p><p>QUAADMAN: Yes. </p><p>GIANFORTE: So you're--you're predicting a 5X increase in that number of workers that are actually in the gig economy?  </p><p>QUAADMAN: Yeah--yes. </p><p>GIANFORTE: Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much for those insights. And Madam Chair, before I yield back, I'd like to offer this article from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on how gig economy companies are helping Americans during this pandemic for the record. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Yes. It will be entered into the record at the end of the hearing. </p><p>GIANFORTE: Okay. I'd like to thank you, Madam Chair and the Republican leader for this important hearing and I yield back the remainder of my time.  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentleman yields back and now I recognize our representative Ben Ray Lujan for five minutes. </p><p>LUJAN: Thank you, Madam Chair and ranking members for organizing this important hearing on how we can protect our constituents from COVID-19 scams. This is a difficult moment for our country. We've lost more than 130,000 Americans due to COVID-19. We are now at 3 million cases. The national unemployment rate is at 11 point 1 percent.  </p><p>Ms. Greenberg, I was struck by some of the numbers you shared in your testimony. Since the start of 2020, the Federal Trade Commission reports it has received more than 120,000 consumer complaints related to COVID-19 and we know that these numbers dramatically understate the problem. Most people across the country don't know how to report or if to report to the FTC.  </p><p>Google is tracking 18 million COVID-19 malware and phishing emails every day in an estimated 30 billion of stimulus funds may end up in criminals hands because of fraud. These numbers represent real suffering and loss.  </p><p>That's why I plan to introduce the stopping COVID scams act of 2020, which would allow the FTC to levy several penalties on COVID-19 scammers. Ms. Greenberg, do you believe that consumers would benefit if Congress gave the FTC the Federal Trade Commission stronger enforcement tools to hold COVID-19 scammers accountable? </p><p>GREENBERG: Yes, Congressman. We--we do believe that the FTC needs stronger civil enforcement power. We would support legislation, the stopping COVID scams bill that you're talking about I think would be a very effective tool. As Mr. Anderson has said, we need to expand the tools that law enforcement has during this--this terrible crisis.  </p><p>So a stronger FTC with civil penalty authority would provide stronger consumer protections even if we weren't currently facing this tsunami of COVID-19 scams. And at the very least, we think the FTC should have the tools. It needs to go after scammers who are taking advantage of the moment to defraud millions of consumers. So we would be proud to enter to support your bill once it gets introduced, Congressman Lujan, and we thank you for your leadership and helping to protect consumers.  </p><p>LUJAN: And Mr. Anderson, the legislation would also allow attorney generals to impose civil penalties on scammers. As you mentioned in your testimony state attorneys general often work with the Federal Trade Commission. Can you briefly describe how state attorney generals partnered with the FTC to protect consumers? </p><p>ANDERSON: Sure. It happens in several different ways. One is the sharing of information I alluded to earlier where we have calls or other mechanisms for sharing information with each other. Many states, such as North Carolina are plugged into the FTC's Consumer Sentinel database and we are able to see the complaints that the FTC receives in North Carolina and elsewhere and we also put our own North Carolina State complaints in that database.  </p><p>I believe we were the first state to do that because we believe mutual sharing of information like that is valuable both for our office and for federal authorities like the FTC. So there are information sharing mechanisms like that which I think are very helpful. And--and we have brought some joint enforcement cases with the FTC, which I think are--and--and U.S. DOJ and other federal authorities.  </p><p>And I think it's useful for federal authorities to partner with the states, as I alluded to earlier. I--I like to see more of that in some ways. I think a lot of times there are people high up in federal agencies that want to see the agency partner with states, but it doesn't always work its way down to the staff attorneys and some of those agency building their cases. So I'd really like to see us bring some more joint enforcement efforts together. And we've done that and been successful and I think there are good things for us to do. I think we just need to do more of it. </p><p>LUJAN: I appreciate that very much. since the beginning of this crisis, E-commerce spending has significantly increased. Earlier this week, I was proud to have FTC Commissioner Chopra join me with my Congress from my Casa Facebook Live town halls to discuss how many Mexicans can protect themselves during this crisis.  </p><p>He shared with me that he has significant concerns that online platforms are not doing enough to stop fake counterfeit goods, including PPE and disinfecting products from being sold on their platforms. In addition, he's worried that these platforms allow goods and products to falsely claim that they are made in the U.S. Ms. Greenberg, yes or no, are honest country of origin disclosures important to consumer shopping online? </p><p>GREENBERG: Yeah. We are strong supporters of consumers having information about where the product is made and there's a lot of fraud around made in America claims. </p><p>LUJAN: Thank you, Ms. Greenberg-- </p><p>GREENBERG: --Some of our sister--yeah. Yeah. </p><p>LUJAN: And Mr. Anderson, same question, yes or no? </p><p>ANDERSON: Briefly, it's a concern, I think, and it's important to look at misrepresentations being made along those lines about where products are made, yes.  </p><p>LUJAN: I appreciate that. Madam Chair, I have some other questions will be submitting to the record, but we thank you, all of our colleagues for this important hearing. And I yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentleman yields back and now I recognize--now I recognize Mr. Carter for five minutes. </p><p>CARTER: Thank you, Madam Chair. And thank all the witnesses for being here. This is a very important subject, particularly for our senior citizens', so we all need to work diligently on this. Mr. Quaadman, I want to--I want to thank you for--also for testifying and for your representation of the chamber. It's important that--that we utilized the private sector.  </p><p>I mean, we can--obviously we need to--to pressure and to make sure that the agencies are doing their part, but we need the assistance of the private sector in this as well. And I wanted to ask you, have any of your member companies--how are they utilizing their technology to--to protect especially older citizens, older American citizens? Have you got any examples of--of how they view they've used technology this way? </p><p>QUAADMAN: Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Carter. So companies are using machine learning AI algorithms to be able to understand transaction Histories and the like. And to be able to try and spot fraud early on and, you know, and this is true not only for older Americans, but for all customers. So they are trying to deploy all those tools that have--that were actually fairly successful before COVID in bringing down some of the incidents in terms of identity theft and then the like.  </p><p>And also, additionally, as I mentioned, we have--as I mentioned, TransUnion offering free tools. There are others that are doing this as well to try and give tools to consumers to protect themselves. And finally, I would just say we've been working with other agencies such as let's say with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to ensure that firms can stay in close touch with their consumers to be able to spot fraud. And if they do spot something, to address it with the consumer and make sure that they can resolve an issue quickly.  </p><p>CARTER: Have you had any specific incidents that you can remember that--that this worked? </p><p>QUAADMAN: Yeah, so we've actually been working as I've mentioned, pretty closely with the Department of Homeland security regarding counterfeit goods. Believe it or not, there are such things as counterfeit toilet paper and things like that. So we've actually been fairly successful trying to get those products outside--out of the marketplace for many of the reasons that we've all been talking about today as well. So enforcement is also very important here. </p><p>CARTER: Okay. I wanted to tell all the panelists that on the onset of this pandemic, I introduced bipartisan legislation called Combating Pandemic Scams Act and this this legislation was actually to--to help all Americans, but particularly older Americans as to help them with the government response. And it really called for all the agencies to--mobile agencies to come together with the FTC as the lead so that we could get the information where we had examples of scams so that they could submit those examples and have it on our website where they could actually go and look at examples of--of where people had tried to pull off scams like this.  </p><p>And I wanted to ask you, Mr. Quaadman, have any of your--you mentioned that that some of your companies have been working with some of the agencies. Any of them work with FTC and--as well?  </p><p>QUAADMAN: Yeah, I believe those discussions are ongoing. And in fact, we are reviewing your legislation. We're also reviewing Ms. Rochester's legislation because providing information to consumers is important for them to protect themselves. And I'll just say as well, some of the examples that Mr. Greenberg and Mr. Anderson have raised is what consumers should be looking for are very important and public education is a very key component for consumer protection here.   </p><p>CARTER: Good. Mr. Anderson, I would imagine that in North Carolina, this is a particular problem And I appreciate all of your work that you're doing in this. And again, I want to mention my bill, the Combating Pandemic Scams Act that requires the FTC and the other partners to--to make publicly available information on how to spot and report scams along--along with making sure that it's accessible. And that end user friendly. I wanted to ask you, would you help you in your position and help the citizens in North Carolina? </p><p>ANDERSON: I do think generally that looking--taking it very serious look at what can be done to help seniors is very important. As you point out, they--they are particular targets of scams and I think looking at--at the best way to get information out to that population and try to help them avoid scams is a good thing to really be giving serious thought to. And I think having experts and people at agencies that are involved in consumer protection and sharing information, really looking at the best way to help give seniors the tools to not fall for these scams is, in general, a good thing to be looking at. </p><p>CARTER: Good. Well again, thank all of you. This is very important work and thank you, Madam Chair, and I yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentleman yields back and now I recognize the vice chair of the committee, Representative Tony Cardenas.  </p><p>CARDENAS: Thank you very much, Madam Chairwoman. Can you hear me?  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Yep. </p><p>CARDENAS: Okay. Thank you so much. Appreciate it to the ranking member of the full committee and the subcommittee and all the support we have to come together like this before the public and to dialogue about how important it is that their hard earned dollars are protected and their livelihoods, especially when it comes to seniors and the most vulnerable.  </p><p>The Federal Trade Commission is the nation's premier agency for economy wide civil endorsement enforcement of laws and protecting the American people. From July 2018 two today, the FTC has helped return a little more than $10 billion back to families pockets. It's critical therefore that the FTC have the power to defend consumer interest, including the power to ensure that ripped off consumers can get their money back.  </p><p>We gave the FTC the authority in section 13-B of the FTC Act as courts have recognized for the past three decades. But unfortunately, lately that authority has been undercut by some judicial assault. Last year, a couple of federal appeals court decisions limited the FTC's ability to get money back for our consumers for American consumers who have been harmed by scams and other frauds. Ms. Greenberg, do you agree that Congress should do what is necessary to ensure the FTC can continue to return money to their--to victims? </p><p>GREENBERG: Yeah. We think it's a very important function of the Federal Trade Commission to get money back for victims who've been defrauded by companies who stolen their hard earned dollars and yes, we'd support that. </p><p>CARDENAS: Okay, thank you. Do you have a rough estimate of how much money and dollar amount has been lost or taken away from consumers since the start of this pandemic? </p><p>GREENBERG: I think the estimate is in the 80--$180 million that has been lost through scams from the pandemic--from the start of the pandemic. </p><p>CARDENAS: Okay, that's from the start of the pandemic, but at the same time, is that an uptick or is that just par for the course? </p><p>GREENBERG: It's certainly and uptick according both to the state law enforcement and federal law enforcement agencies. </p><p>CARDENAS: What are the--your thoughts on the consequences of this authority being fully eliminated? </p><p>GREENBERG: Being fully eliminated? </p><p>CARDENAS: Yeah. </p><p>GREENBERG: That would be devastating I think to the effort to protect consumers and to restore funds that were ill gotten gains (INAUDIBLE) entitled to get that back and we need law enforcement agencies to have the power to get that money back to consumers. </p><p>CARDENAS: So if this were fully eliminated, that means that fine would be in very likely pay with these bad actors, correct? </p><p>GREENBERG: Most certainly, if bad actors know that they will not be held accountable for taking consumers money, they will double down on those efforts. </p><p>CARDENAS: Mr. Anderson, when it comes to your work, and do you value or are you able to do your work over at the attorney general's office better because you have partners like the FTC, or could you do it on your own? </p><p>ANDERSON: We certainly like having partners like the FTC and other partners. I mean, I think there's so much work to be done in consumer protection area that we certainly devote all the time and resources that we have to bear to protect North Carolina consumers, but there's a lot going on out there.  </p><p>And I think the more civil enforcement cops on the beat, if you will that are protecting consumers, the better. So it really does take I think an effort on all fronts to try to bring maximum protection for consumers. </p><p>CARDENAS: Thank you. I've taken the opportunity to personally discuss 13-B with the chair of the FTC and he is definitely in favor of making sure that we, Congress enhances that clarity of their authority that we believe, Congress believes I think overall that that authority has been given, unfortunately had some, in my personal opinion, some rogue judges that had grossly misinterpreted the intent and the 13-B step by set by Congress.  </p><p>So I'm going to give the last 30 seconds I have, a softball question to the Republican witness, Mr. Quaadman. Mr. Quaadman, Do you agree that about 99 percent of American businesses are good actors? </p><p>QUAADMAN: Yes, Sir.  </p><p>CARDENAS: Okay, thank you for your brief answer because I--I do agree. As a former business owner myself, when you're out there in the field trying to do business, it really breaks your heart to see bad actors out there and they make everybody look bad and they hurt the public, they hurt industries, and they just hurt everybody.  </p><p>And one last thing I'd like to say is I'm very proud of the American businesses and--and the kind of overall 99.9 percent of following the rules and following the laws end respecting business. But unfortunately, we do need enforcement for those few bad actors in an economy with the trillions of dollars that really, really hurt too many people to the tune of millions and millions of families and devastate them in some cases. So thank you so much. I apologize for going over my time. Madam Chairwoman, I yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentleman yields back and now, I recognize Mr. Burgess for five minutes. </p><p>BURGESS: Okay, did that unmute? </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: There, we can hear you now. </p><p>BURGESS: All right. Good deal. Mr. Quaadman, thanks to all of our witnesses for being here today. You have--Mr. Quaadman, I was particularly was enthusiastic about in your testimony where you talked about the collaboration of the private sector with the government and the--the creation of that national data set and the incorporation of the artificial intelligence to be able to sift through large volumes of information. I will tell you-- </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: --(INAUDIBLE) back on-- </p><p>BURGESS: --I'm sorry? </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: I apologize. I was not muted. </p><p>BURGESS: Are we good?  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: It's a little blurry, but we can hear you. </p><p>BURGESS: Everything's sharp here. I don't know what's the matter on your end, Tony.  </p><p>CARDENAS: We can hear you. We can see you and hear you. It's a little (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p>BURGESS: Okay. Again, Mr. Quaadman, your testimony about how the private sector has stepped up in this and the creation of that open research data set I think just can't emphasize how important that is in allowing our researchers both public and private to sift through just the vast amounts of information and now to be able to actually incorporate some artificial intelligence, some machine learning to be able to really hone in on some things. Are you are you able to share with us any areas where that has delivered--produced significant overhaul? </p><p>QUAADMAN: Well, I raised one example before, but just to re-emphasize it, through the use of AI and that--that open data set, BenevolentAI was able to go through thousands and tens of thousands of studies and the like and were able to identify at rheumatoid arthritis drug that Eli Lilly had developed years ago and that that was a possible drug treatment for--for COVID-19.  </p><p>Similarly, there have been some other--there have been some other treatments as well that have been targeted in a very similar way and are going through the clinical process as well. Said this, as I was mentioning, this has actually shaved off months if not years in development of treatments and vaccines. And that's--that's something that has never happened before. And it's only because of where we are technologically today. </p><p>BURGESS: And you know, I agree. American innovation is what's going to get us out of this crisis and this to the extent that you facilitated innovation with that open data set, incredibly important and I--I actually have wondered the amount of data that is now collected on the vast numbers of patients who been treated, yeah, it does seem like we should be able to come to some conclusions recognizing randomized clinical trials take time, but observational studies are useful and some of those look back studies I think it can--can help us identify therapies or things that we shouldn't be doing, things that therapeutically or--are not useful and--and this was just such a--such a significant part of what you're contributing. I did want to highlight that.  </p><p>And--and it's different. I--I was here when we had Ebola, I was here when we had Zika, I was here when we had the swine flu. I don't recall the collaboration between the public and private sectors like we are seeing right now. Warps weed. We're going to have a hearing on some of the vaccine developers later on in the month. That's a good thing. But this is a--this is, in my experience, this is unprecedented. And again, it's going to produce a deliverable far quicker than anyone thought possible. </p><p>QUAADMAN: Agreed. Agreed. And it's--and this is something that, you know, we--we expect to continue and we hope to see we hope to see things come to market hopefully relatively soon.  </p><p>BURGESS: Yeah, it can't be soon enough. Just on the issue I can't see the clock from where I said, so chairwoman, you'll just have to interrupt me if I--if I go over, but I did want to ask you about the liability issue that you brought up, Mr. Quaadman. My senator over on the Senate side, Senator Cornyn of course is--is working on pretty broad legislation dealing with--with some of the liability questions that you brought up.  </p><p>You point out in your testimony timely, temporary, and targeted, so we've had some experience with other national crises where this type of timely targeted and temporary liability protection has been useful. Is that something that you've explored at the U.S. chamber? </p><p>QUAADMAN: Yes. I mean, this is something that has--has happened before and has been successful before. One of the points I want to mention as well is just how broad based the coalition is here that is looking for liability relief. It's the business community. It's not for profits, it's education, it's government agencies that are looking for this and we've actually seen some states implement this as well as Congress in other areas. So we think this is very important where businesses are looking for uniformity across the line in order to be able to comply, particularly if their operating over state lines, and that's why congressional action is so important here.  </p><p>BURGESS: They're looking for certainty as well. </p><p>QUAADMAN: Yes.  </p><p>BURGESS: And so when--when we come to the question of opening the schools up in the fall and the CDC guidelines, I agree with you that is someone is following those guidelines, there should be a measure of liability protection. Some of the difficulty occurs in that sometimes the guidelines change and--and that change may happen relatively suddenly, which is another reason that that liability protection is just so critical to being able to provide those services. </p><p>QUAADMAN: Yeah. Agreed. </p><p>BURGESS: Well, I--in whatever time I have left, Mr. Anderson, I so appreciate it your testimony on the--on the payment mechanisms and certainly that should be a red flag to someone and certain types of payment mechanisms are not. They're so far outside the mainstream, so far outside the norm that certainly we should raise the red flags-- </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: --Where way-- </p><p>BURGESS: --So I just so appreciate you bringing that to our attention today. I think that's an important part. And--and I'll yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentleman yields back and now, I recognize congressman Bobby Rush, my colleague from Illinois. You there, Bob? Unmute.  </p><p>RUSH: All right. Thank you, Madam Chair. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: There you go. </p><p>RUSH: All right. Ms. Greenberg, in your testimony, you discussed how consumers' vulnerability to unfair and deceptive practices has been exacerbated by COVID-19. One of the potential vulnerabilities relies in the FTC's funeral rule. That's updated in 1994. That funeral rule does not account for the way our economy functions today, especially ignoring during the COVID 10 pandemic.  </p><p>That is why last month I, along with nine of my colleagues on the committee sent a letter to the FTC asking them among other things to require funeral homes to post their prices online and to provide them in a standardized format. In your opinion, is this something you believe The FTC should require? And if so, why? And if not, why not? </p><p>GREENBERG: Thank you for the question, Congressman Rush. Yes, this has been a longstanding consumer position. Certainly our organizations and sister organizations. We do believe that there should be a requirement that funeral homes post their prices online. We know that that information would certainly benefit consumers.  </p><p>The funeral industry has over the years had a reputation for inflating prices, for it changing the rules with families who are encountering and are in the middle of very vulnerable situations where they've lost a loved one. So at a time when consumers should be focused on grieving, they should not have to deal with getting the runaround from unscrupulous funeral--funeral directors.  </p><p>RUSH: Right. </p><p>GREENBERG: So providing clear information upfront we think will help families. We couldn't agree more with your--the position you took in the letter. Let's post that information. Give it to consumers so that they can compare prices. </p><p>RUSH: Ms. Greenberg, COVID-19 has revealed for all Americans to see the deep fault lines that exists in our society as it relates to health care, law enforcement, unemployment--unemployed unemployment and various other issues. Are there any similar fault lines that exist in the consumer protection area of our society? </p><p>GREENBERG: Well, I think you're absolutely right that COVID has revealed the disparities. Communities of color are paying a higher price than--than any other, particularly the African American community during this COVID crisis. So one of the things that we noted is that that New York Times was trying to publish some of this information about disparities and they actually had to sue the CDC to obtain data on the disparities affecting communities of color.  </p><p>So it is really revealed this chasm of treatment. We've got issues of access to health care. we've got states that 13 states that have failed to expand Medicaid. We have Cobra that's in the--Cobra coverage that's in the HEROES Act. The Senate has not taken up and needs to come in our opinion. So we think it's really a--an insult to communities of color who have faced the brunt of losses from this pandemic. </p><p>RUSH: Should there--on the landscape of consumer protective--protection organizations, would you submit support of--of a consumer protection organization and that really speaks directly--and speaks directly for minorities and communities of color? </p><p>GREENBERG: Yes, we--we certainly would and we think that they are--that there needs to be much more focus on the disparities that this pandemic has created. So the answer is yes, we will work with you on that. </p><p>RUSH: All right. Mr. Anderson, thank you for highlighting the plight of our--the plight of our nation's seniors. In my district and across the country, too many seniors have been subject to unscrupulous assisted living facilities trying to steal residents' stimulus checks under the guise of payments the facility is entitled to.  </p><p>That is why I was glad to see the FTC highlight this problem in May and why I sent a letter to CMS to see what they were doing to stop this practice. unfortunately, CMS has limited jurisdiction in these situations. My question is, other than increasing awareness, what can be done to prevent this malfeasance? </p><p>ANDERSON: Well certainly, if consumers and seniors have that practice happen to them, I'd encourage them to report it to, you know, in North Carolina, they can report it to our office. We'll get it in the right hands and, you know, we if we hear of something inappropriate happening, we'll--will follow up on it and--and take appropriate action on it or will refer it to the right entity. It might be a Medicaid fraud type entity, but it's it's something if it happens to consumers, they should report it to the authorities for possible enforcement action. You know, we certainly don't want that type of activity reoccurring. </p><p>RUSH: Thank you. I yield back, Madam Chair.  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentleman yields back and going with next--with everyone that's on the committee before we get to people who have waived on and I call--I now ask my friend Doris Matsui to do her five minutes. </p><p>MATSUI: Thank you very much, Madam Chair, for this very, very important hearing. It is really something that's necessary today and I thank the witnesses for being here with us also.  </p><p>I wanted to follow up more on older Americans. According to AARP, before the coronavirus, one in four older adults were socially isolated. now we know that that number is much higher today. Because they're doing their part to limit their risk of exposure to the virus by staying at home. At the same time, they are spending more time online and increase risk of being targeted by COVID-19 scam activity.  </p><p>Now, not all older adults are emailing or texting, but I suspect most are receiving robo-calls from COVID fraudsters. Ms. Greenberg and Mr. Anderson, what's the best way to reach older adults offline about the scams we are discussing here today? </p><p>GREENBERG: Yes, older adults are besieged by robo-calls and even calls, you know, their--on their mobile or their--their landlines. And it's been exacerbated terribly by the pandemic. Education for family members, ensuring the family member, your older family member is not by themselves or doesn't make any financial decisions without checking with another family member.  </p><p>Also, we--we talked about I think Mr. Anderson And others asked about how about letting us know what the scams are. A lot of people don't understand how a scam works. We've got grandparent scams, we've got, romance scams and these--the scammers are very clever. So we need to expose people to how a scam looks, with the anatomy is of a scam and--and if there's lots of education to do, but yes, we-- </p><p>MATSUI: --Okay. What can nonprofits and NGOs play in spreading information about common COVID frauds or scams? </p><p>GREENBERG: We have a fraud.org site. We have a--a fraud newsletter that goes out very broadly. We work with state attorneys general, we work with the FTC and a lot of companies. The kinds of companies Mr. Quaadman mentioned can play a very important role in spreading this information, what are the red flags of scams. </p><p>MATSUI: All right. Thank you very much. During this crisis, it's apparent that everyone feels comfortable reaching out for help when they need it. For this to happen, we need our government at all levels to accommodate as many languages as possible.  </p><p>In California, we have a significant Spanish speaking population and I believe it is important that they have options available to them to discuss testing, health care, and Product Safety complaints in Spanish. Mr. Anderson, can you describe your efforts in North Carolina to ensure Spanish speakers have options to large lodge complaints and are there other steps you've taken to expand options for consumers when filing complaints? </p><p>ANDERSON: Yes. We agreed that that's important and--and we try to make it as easy as possible for Spanish speaking populations to lodge complaints with us. We have employees on staff that speak Spanish so that when calls come in, they can speak in Spanish to those consumers over the phone. We have our consumer complaint form in Spanish on our website. When we put out alerts and other consumer information, we often try to put that information out in Spanish.  </p><p>We reach out to some of the news media publications that Spanish speaking populations subscribe to and pay attention to to try to help get the word out. So I think there are lots of things that can be done there and I--I agree it's important. In the consumer protection world, you want everyone possible to know about these things and sometimes that means communicating in the language that people are going to understand.  </p><p>MATSUI: And I also believe it's important to reach out to other groups that work with Spanish speaking population, whether it be churches or other groups that I know there are many available. I think that they would be very, very willing to help out also.  </p><p>Now, you know, while the FTC, DOJ, and FTR have roles to play in cracking down on fraudulent or ineffective products to market to consumers, we also need enforcement efforts in web platforms and social media companies. Ms. Greenberg, do you believe these companies are devoting insufficient resources to adequately protect consumers from seeing fraudulent ads? </p><p>GREENBERG: We think there's a lot more room for improvement. Some of them have done very, very good work and reaching out. But as we know, Facebook published ads that Consumer Reports, the magazine offers them with false information and they did not check the ads and they published those--those advertisements with, you know, deceptive advertising to consumers.  </p><p>So that exposed a gap, so we're asking these companies you've got to step up. You've got to do much better. And some are better than others, but I think there's a role for Congress to play here and we'd love to work with you on this. </p><p>MATSUI: All right. Well, thank you very much and I see my time is gone. I yield back. Thank you.  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentlewoman yields back and now I recognize for his questions for five minutes, Congressman McNerney. </p><p>MCNERNEY: Well, I thank the chair and the ranking members and I think the--the witnesses. This is an important hearing and it has a lot of impact on my district in my communities. But before I start with questions, I'd like to make a comment.  </p><p>Mr. Quaadman, in your testimony you mentioned the importance of broadband connectivity. In my district, 34 percent of my constituents don't have broadband service at home, and that's why I'm proud that the House passed the HR 2, which would ensure that all Americans are able to have broadband. This legislation included the digital equity act that I authored along with Representatives Clark and Lujan, which would provide federal funding to address grabs--gabs and broadband adoption and promote digital literacy. If we want to fully unleash economic opportunities in our nation, we need significant investments in our communities internet structure and deregulation alone will not bridge the digital divide in districts like mine.  </p><p>Ms. Greenberg, in your written testimony, you noted that since the beginning of 2020, and this quote has been followed up by myself and Mr. Lujan and you gave it during your testimony, the FTC has received more than 120,000 complaints about scams, identity theft and other types of fraud linked to COVID-19. Of those complaints, nearly have indicated a monetary loss of 87--$78 million. How much do you think the number the FTC complaints and monetary losses compares to the actual number of monetary losses in cases that have gone unreported?  </p><p>GREENBERG: Well, what we know is that most people will not report a loss and will not reach out to federal agencies. They either don't know that there is a federal agency or a state agency, they don't know how to reach those or they even exist to provide remedies and people are embarrassed because maybe they got scammed, so they're not going to report them.  </p><p>So I would say the number is probably tenfold higher from our experience and maybe even worse than that. We--we, you know, we're just estimating. But a very underreported. </p><p>MCNERNEY: Sure. That makes sense. Mr. Anderson, is there any additional insight on unreported losses that you might have? </p><p>ANDERSON: Not in terms of numbers, but I would just generally say that it's always been our feeling that even though we receive a lot of complaints from the public, it's typically just the tip of the iceberg. In North Carolina, we typically receive each year between 10,000 and 20,000 complaints consumer related from North Carolina, consumers, but again, we believe that is just the tip of the iceberg, that people don't report for various reasons.  </p><p>You know, one message I think that it's important to get out there to consumers that Ms. Greenberg brought up is that consumers shouldn't be embarrassed to report things when they've been victimized by scams. I mean, they--everyone in our society, I mean, I have seen, I'm not going to mention names, but I've seen PHDs be, you know, subjected to scams. I've seen high ranking government officials. It--these scams are very ingenious and we want people to report them.  </p><p>We need the information in order to get the information out and protect other people. So people it shouldn't be embarrassed about reporting them. I hope we can kind of continue to try to get that message out and encourage commutes consumers to report these things and try to help out their fellow citizens from falling prey to them. </p><p>MCNERNEY: Okay, thank you for that. Ms. Greenberg, in 2016 the FTC, and you know we always feel the FTC is--is under resourced, but they found that the Black and Latino communities felt tend to be subject to fraud at higher rates and tend to under report cases to the FTC. So while the consumer education alone is not enough, do you think that it would be helpful for the FTC to increase the outreach to these communities about how to protect themselves against scams and steps they--steps they should be taking? </p><p>GREENBERG: We'd love to see the FTC to have the resource--resources to reach out. Go to town halls, work with your office, do meetings in--in the various congressional districts, talk to people in churches, in--in community gathering places, community centers. The more people know about fraud, the better they are at recognizing it. And it's a very effective tool, but you have to know what a fraud looks like.  </p><p>Like Mr. Anderson said, I've--I've had various very sophisticated friends and family members fall for frauds because the fraudsters aren't very good at what they do. They know--they read people well and they know what a scam looks like and so no one should be embarrassed about going forward. But knowing what they look like and how to recognize is important. So yes, I do support the FTC being much more pervasive in communities across the country.  </p><p>MCNERNEY: Okay, and I'm almost about out of time, so I don't expect an answer, but I'd like to understand a little bit better about peer to peer scams, peer to peer financing scams. So maybe we can have a question for the record on that, and I yield back.  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentleman yields back. And now I recognize for five minutes Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester. </p><p>BLUNT ROCHESTER: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman and thank you also to the witnesses. Amid a global pandemic that is creating unprecedented social economic upheaval, the last thing anybody needs, the last thing any American needs is to have to worry about scammers. And I'm hearing reports, really awful reports of practices where people are acting as impostors, as hospitals or doctors demanding of my constituents payment for the medical debts that they or their loved ones may have incurred due to being treated for COVID-19.  </p><p>And with staggering unemployment, people are struggling to find a job, and that's making them susceptible to work at home scams that offer a way out of economic woes. But only after they provide a down payment, often via a wire transfer. But I think the most egregious to me, some of the worst examples are scammers that target seniors in nursing homes, praying on their isolation born from this public health emergency. And we've heard a lot of members on this call talk about the impacts on seniors.  </p><p>I--I have a bipartisan bill with Mr. Walberg and also our subcommittees' own Mr. Hudson. The Stop Senior Scams Act that would bring it stakeholders together to proactively stop senior scams. In fact, the Senate companion just passed to the Senate in June and we have 13 endorsing organizations, including the National Consumers League and AARP and I urge my colleagues on the committee if you're not already a sponsor, a cosponsor, please join us and please support this bipartisan bill.  </p><p>To the panel, can you tell the committee why you support this bill and, you know, what--what specifically you are seeing that are happening to seniors right now? And I know Mr. Quaadman, I actually heard you reference our bill a couple of times as well, so I'm going to start with Ms. Greenberg and then if I could ask Mr. Anderson and Mr. Quad--Quaadman. </p><p>GREENBERG: Yes. Thank you, congresswoman. And yes, this is a--an opportunity to support and protect our seniors. They are extremely vulnerable during this pandemic and we--we think your bill is--is so needed right now to stop senior scams. Great that it's a bipartisan bill, delighted that it passed in the Senate and my fellow consumer advocates and I are so pleased that you introduced it. We want to work with you on getting it into--into law. </p><p>BLUNT ROCHESTER: Great. Thank you. So much. Mr. Anderson. </p><p>ANDERSON: Yes. I think it's important. I have looked at the bill and without taking official--official position on it or anything, I wish I had a positive reaction to what the bill that's trying to--to do. I think, again these scams that are targeting seniors are very important to go after and look at. I think taking a very close look, which I understand was part of the intent of the bill at how seniors are navigating marketing and scams in the digital world and--and how the world has changed with technology and different things that can be done to share information and--and make educating scams better for consumers. I think the--what the bill is trying to do is all very positive, I think. I think it--it looks like it's doing good things to me. </p><p>BLUNT ROCHESTER: Thank you, Mr. Anderson. And Mr. Quaadman, if you have any comments. </p><p>QUAADMAN: Sure, Ms. Rochester. First off, agree as well that increased information is important for customers to protect themselves. Public education is obviously a very important step in doing so as well. Looking at your bill in terms of hearing, obviously that's what your bill is trying to do. We are currently reviewing it and will be happy to have further discussions with you on it. </p><p>BLUNT ROCHESTER: Thank you so much. And for any of you, if you could just share what else you think we need to do in Congress to protect seniors. We can start with Ms. Greenberg again. </p><p>GREENBERG: We--we need to reinforce--when you do your town halls, we need to reinforce with our federal agencies and our state agencies don't allow seniors to be isolated and make financial decisions that could cost them or their families a lot of that money. So it's really important that they stay connected, that they have somebody that they can call.  </p><p>There are some things that you can do to protect the finances of seniors. You know there alone, there socially isolated and they may make some decisions that are not in their best financial interest. So Congress can I think do a lot to shine a light on how we use our federal agencies to inform can--seniors--seniors and their family members about better and stronger protections and to make sure they're not socially isolated. </p><p>BLUNT ROCHESTER: Thank you. I've run out of time and thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Mr. Walberg, you've been very patient waiting And I am very happy to now recognize you for five minutes.  You need to unmute. Can you unmute? </p><p>WALBERG: Thank you. Can you hear me?  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Yes. </p><p>WALBERG: Can you hear me? </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Yes. </p><p>WALBERG: We just dropped--which is dropped two of our--three of our Chicago grandkids off And I now realize I'm a senior, so this is a perfect hearing for today. I guess I don't realize. I was just reconfirmed.  </p><p>But thank you for this hearing, thanks for allowing me to wave on and I guess Lisa Blunt Rochester asked some of my questions. I think that's why we've Co-sponsored the legislation together because of our concerns that are going on. We know that in the digital age, scammers are out there, seniors--seniors are--are there with their hard earned money, the savings, et cetera, and so we know that they're going after them.  </p><p>Let me ask one--one question that I don't believe has been asked yet today. And then I'd like to ask Mr. Anderson and Mr. Quaadman if you could expand upon, talk about what companies can do to prevent frauds and scams against seniors combat some specifics more towards seniors than anyone else because that's really is a population that is challenged right now.  </p><p>I know how many phone calls I get every day, some of which I know are scams. So talk to us, Mr. Anderson and Mr. Quaadman about specifics that you've seen or could expect companies to do to help out. </p><p>ANDERSON: So one thing I'll say that I think is worth exploring is are there more things that financial institutions or banks could do to stop seniors from sending out large transfers of money when they've been subjected to one of these telemarketing scams? And there are some things that they are already doing, but I think part of the intent of the bill is to look at what can be done there, training that can occur at the banks, and education that banks can do before a senior wires, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars of their life savings off to a scammer. So I think that's worth--one thing worth exploring.  </p><p>I think maybe exploring some things involving that payment processing, whether it's wire transfers, gift cards, and if there are ways to, you know, prevent seniors from sending out large sums of money via scams and those payment processing mechanisms is something worth exploring and thinking about. We could spend a lot of time talking about these things, but those are some things that have come to mind in the interest of brainstorming. And I'll turn it over to the other panelists. </p><p>WALBERG: Okay, thank you. Mr. Quaadman  </p><p>QUAADMAN: Sure. Thank you, Mr. Walberg. As I mentioned before, there--there's a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes with companies in terms of using algorithms and AI to--to look at transactions and to try and spot them and get in touch with consumers quickly. There are also a number of different tools I had mentioned as well that companies do make available for consumers to protect themselves and to be more aware of what we should be doing.  </p><p>There is probably better public education that should happen to make seniors aware of what those tools are and how they can use them. So I think there's, again, I think there's been a bit of a partnership that we can have between the industry and as well with government to make sure that we can help educate on that and--and to help further deployment of tools. </p><p>WALBERG: Well, I appreciate that and I would also encourage my colleagues on Energy and Commerce specifically on this committee if you haven't signed on as a Co-sponsor of--of our bill, Stop Senior Scams Act, we certainly would appreciate it. We want to see it move forward and to help seniors, myself included. Thanks, Madam Chairwoman, and I will yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you. Yeah, I think there's a few of us on the committee who would benefit from that, at least according to age. And I thank--I thank all of the--the witnesses for your participation today. I think this was a very, very useful hearing for us. I'm sure we'll be taking measures and keep them in mind as we--as we move forward.  </p><p>I understand there are some documents for that record and subsequent to that, I am--we will adjourn the hearing, but you know, anyone who doesn't want hear the document, or it does want to, that's next. We have a document from the Internet Association on fair pricing, a document from the Internet Association on the counter--counterfeit goods, a letter from the Toy Association, an article entitled University Engineers, Architects Design--Design 3D Printers--Design, 3D Printer Nasal Swabs, an article entitled Robots Delivering Food to College Campuses this Fall, an article entitled Researchers Develop New Techniques to Print Electronic Sensors Directly on Organs, and an article entitled Researchers are Tapping Black--Blockchain Tools in Fighting Against Coronavirus. There's more. </p><p>An article entitled How Gig Economy Companies are Stepping Up to Help Americans Amid the Cohort--COVID-19 Pandemic, an article entitled How--I can't see under that--How AI Protects People From Online Scams, and a statement from the AAFA.  </p><p>Is that it? Okay. And that is--is that. And without objection, those will be entered into the record. And I remind members that pursuant to committee rules, they have 10 business days to submit additional questions for the record to be answered by witnesses who have appeared. I'm asking the witnesses if your--yes, you're still--still there to respond promptly to any questions that they may have. And this time--where's my homemade gavel? The subcommittee is adjourned. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60BT-P921-F15W-H1XV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Member--we'll begin with member statements and I will begin by recognizing myself for five minutes.  </p><p>Good morning and thank you for joining us here today given what's going on in the--in the world. It's really impressive to see the--the turnout that is here today. And I welcome everyone. In the two plus decades since the creation of the Internet, we've seen life for Americans and their families transformed in many positive ways. The Internet provides new opportunities for commerce, education, information, and connecting people.  </p><p>However, along with these many new opportunities, we have seen new challenges as well. Bad actors are stocking the online marketplace using deceptive techniques to influence the consumers deceptive designs to fool them--are we okay? Okay. Deceptive designs to--to fool them into giving away personal information, stealing their money, and engineering and other unfair practices.  </p><p>The Federal Trade Commission works to protect Americans from many unfair and deceptive practices, but a lack of resources, authority, and even a lack of will has left many American consumers feeling helpless in this digital world. Adding to that feeling of helplessness, new technologies are increasing the scope and scale of the problem. Deep fakes, man--manipulation of video, dark patterns, bots, and other technological--technologies are hurting us in direct and indirect ways.  </p><p>Congress has, unfortunately, taking a laissez-faire approach to regulation of unfair and deceptive practices online over the past decade. And platforms have let them flourish. The result is big tech failed to respond to the grave threats posed by deep fakes and evidence--as evidenced by Facebook scrambling to--scrambling to announce at new policy that strikes me as wholly inadequate, we'll talk about that later, since it would have done nothing to prevent the alternative--the--the--the video of Speaker Pelosi that amassed millions of views and prompted no action by the online platform.  </p><p>Hopefully, our discussion today can change my mind about that. Underlying all of this is Section 230 of the communications decency act, which provides online platform links like Facebook a legal liability shield for third-party content. Many have argued that this liability shield results in online platforms not adequately policing their platforms, including online piracy and extremist content.  </p><p>Thus, here we are with big tech wholly unprepared to tackle the challenges we face today. A toppling concern for this subcommittee must be to protect consumers readiness, regardless of whether they are online or not. For too long, big tech has argued that e-commerce and digital platforms deserve special treatment and a light regulatory touch. We are finding out that consumers can be harmed as easily online as in the physical world and in some cases, that online dangers are greater.  </p><p>It is incumbent on us to, in this subcommittee, in the subcommittee, to make clear that protecting the--the protections that apply to in person commerce also apply to virtual space. I think that witness--I thank the witnesses for their testimony today and I recognize Ranking Member Rodgers for five minutes. </p><p>MCMORRIS RODGERS: Thank you. Thank you Chair Schakowsky. Happy New Year, everyone. Welcome to our witnesses. I appreciate the chair leading this effort today to highlight online deception. I do want to note that last Congress Chairman Walden also held several hearings on platform responsibility.  </p><p>Disinformation is not a new problem. It was also an issue 130 years ago when Joseph Pulitzer and the New York world and William Randolph Hearst and the New York Journal led the age of \"yellow journalism.\" Just like click debate on online platform today, fake and sensational headlines sold newspapers and boosted advertising revenue. With far more limited sources of information available in the 1890s, the American people lost trust in the media. To rebuild trust, newspapers had to clean up their act. Now the Pulitzer is associated with something very different.  </p><p>I believe we are at a similar inflection point today. We are losing faith in sources we can trust online. To rebuild it, the subcommittee, our witness panel, and members of the media are putting the spotlight on abuses and deception. Our committees past leadership and constructive debates have already led to take action. Just the slip week, Facebook announced a new policy to combat deep thanks in part by utilizing artificial intelligence. I appreciate Ms. Bickert for being here to discuss this in greater detail.  </p><p>Deep fakes and disinformation can be handled with innovation and empowering people with more information on the platforms they choose and trust and makes for far more productive outcomes when people can make the best decisions for themselves rather than relying on the government to make decisions for them. That's why we should be focusing on innovation for major breakthroughs, not more regulations or government mandates. As we discussed ways to combat manipulation online, we must ensure that America will remain the global-- </p><p>[*]MCMORRIS RODGERS: --(INAUDIBLE) AI development. There is no better place in the world to raise people's standard of living and make sure that this technology is response--is used responsibly. Software is already available to face swap, lip-synch, and create facial reenactment to fabricate content. As frightening as it is, we can be also be using AI to go bat--after the bad actors and fight fire with fire.  </p><p>We can--we cannot afford to shy away from it, because who would you rather lead the world in machine learning technology, America or China? China is sharing its AI surveillance technology with other authoritarian governments like Venezuela. It's also using this technology to control and suppress ethnic minorities, including the Uighurs in Chinese concentration camps. The New York Times has reported just last month that China is collecting DNA samples and could be using this data to create images of faces.  </p><p>Could China be building a tool to further crack--track and crack down on minorities and political dissidents? Imagine the propaganda and lies that could develop with this technology behind the great Chinese firewall where there is no free speech or an independent press to hold the Communist Party accountable.  </p><p>That is why America must leave the world in AI development. By upholding our American values, we can use this as a force for good and save people's lives. For example, AI technology and deep learning algorithms can help us detect cancers earlier and more quickly. Clinical trials are already underway and making big--major breakthroughs to diagnose cancers. The continued leadership of our innovators is crucial to make sure that we have the tools to combat online deception. To win the future in a global economy, America should be writing the rules for this technology so that real people, not an authoritative--authoritarian state like China are in empowered.  </p><p>I'm also glad that we're putting a spotlight on dark patterns. Deceptive laws, fake reviews, and bots are the latest version of robocall scams. I'm pleased that the FTC has used its Section 5 authority to target this fraud and protect people. We should get their input as to how we discuss how to handle dark patterns. We also must be careful where we legislate so that we don't harm the practices that people enjoy. </p><p>A heavy-handed regulation will make it impossible for online retailers to provide discounts. This would especially hurt lower and middle income families. In a digital marketplace, services people enjoy should not get swallowed up by strict definition of a dark pattern. How we make these distinctions is important, so I look forward to today's discussion. I want to thank the panel and then I--I yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentlelady yields back. And the chair now recognizes Mr. Pallone, chair of the full committee, for five minutes for his opening statement. </p><p>PALLONE: Thank you, Madam Chair. Americans increasingly rely on the Internet for fundamental aspects of their daily lives. Consumers shop online for products ranging from groceries to refrigerators. They use the Internet to tele commune--telecommute or to check the weather and traffic before leaving for the office, and they use social media networks to connect with family and friends and as a major source of news and information. </p><p>When consumers go online, they understandably assume that the reviews of the products that they buy a real, that the people on their social networks are human, and that the news and information they are reading is accurate. And unfortunately, that is not always the case. Online actors, including nation-states, companies, and individual fraudsters, are using online tools to manipulate and deceive Americans.  </p><p>While some methods of deception are well known, many are new and sophisticated, fooling even the most savvy consumers. Today, technology has made it difficult if not impossible for typical consumers to recognize what's real and what's fake. And why exactly are people putting so much effort into the development and misuse of technology? Because they know that trust is the key to influence and taking advantage of people. Whether for social, monetary, or political gain, if bad actors can make people believe a lie, then they can manipulate us into taking actions we wouldn't otherwise take. </p><p>In some instances, we can no longer even trust our eyes. Videos can be slowed to make someone appear intoxicated. Faces can be Photoshop on to someone else's body. Audio can be edited in a way that a--that a person's words are basically taken out of context. And the extent of such manipulation has become extreme. Machine learning algorithms can now create completely fake videos known as deepfakes that look real. Deepfakes can show real people saying or doing things that they never said or did. </p><p>For example, face swapping technology has been used to place actor Nicholas Cage into movies where he never was. Actor/director Jordan Peele created a deepfake supposedly showing President Obama insulting President Trump. The most common use of deepfakes is nonconsensual pornography, which has been used to make it appear as if celebrities have been videotaped in compromising positions. And deepfake technology was also used to humiliate a journalist from India who was reporting on an eight-year-old rape victim. </p><p>Advances in algorithms are also behind the glut of social media bots, automated systems that interact on social media as if they were real people. These bots are used by companies and other entities to build popularity of the brands and respond to consumer service requests. Even more alarming is the use of these bots by both state and non-state actors to spread disinformation, which can influence the very fabric of our society and our politics. </p><p>And manipulation can be very subtle. Deceptive design, sometimes called the dark patterns, capitalize on knowledge of our senses, operate to trick us into making choices that benefit the business. Have you ever tried to unsubscribe from a mailing list, and there's a button to stay subscribed that's bigger and more colorful than the unsubscribe button? And that's deceptive design.  </p><p>Banner ads have been designed with black spots that look like dirt or hair on the screen to trick you into tapping the ad on your smartphone. And there's so many other examples. And since these techniques are designed to go unnoticed, most consumers have no idea they're happening. In fact, they're almost impossible for experts in types of techniques to detect. And while consume--while computer scientists are working on technology that can help detect each of these deceptive techniques, we're in a technological arms race. As detection technology improves, so does the deceptive technology. Regulators and platforms trying to combat deception are left playing a Whack A Mole.  </p><p>Unrelenting advances in these technologies and their abuse raise significant questions for all of us. What is the prevalence of these deceptive techniques? How are these techniques actually affecting our actions and decisions? What steps are companies regulators taking to mitigate consumer fraud and misinformation? So, I look forward to beginning to answer these questions with our expert witness panel today so we can start to provide more transparency and tools for consumers to fight misinformation and deceptive practices.  </p><p>And--and Madam Chair, I just want to say I think this is a very important hearing. I was just telling my colleague, Kathy Castor, this morning about a discussion that we had at our chairs meeting this morning, where the topic was brought up. And I--and I said, oh, we are having a hearing on this today. So, this is something a lot of members and obviously the public care about. So, thank you for having the hearing today. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentleman yields back. And now the chair recognizes Mr. Walden, the ranking member of the full committee for five minutes for his opening statement. </p><p>WALDEN: Good morning, Madam Chair. Thanks for having this hearing, and welcome to everyone in the--I guess this is the second hearing of the new year. There's one that started earlier upstairs, but we welcome you all here. This is an important topic, and glad to hear from our witnesses today, even those who I'm told have health issues this morning. But thanks for being here.  </p><p>As with anything, the Internet presents bad actors or those seeking to harm others some ample opportunities to manipulate the users and take advantage of consumers, which often tend to be some of the most vulnerable in the population. Arguably, the digital ecosystem's such that harmful acts are easily exacerbated. And as we all know, false information or fake videos spread at breakneck speeds. That's why, when I was chairman of this committee, we tried to tackle this whole issue with platform responsibility head on. We appreciate the input we got from many.  </p><p>Last Congress, we, as you heard, held hearings and legislated on online platforms not fulfilling their good Samaritan obligations, especially when it comes to online human trafficking, companies use of algorithms and the impact such algorithms have on influencing consumer behavior, we took a look at that, improving/expanding the reach of broadband services so rural and urban consumers of all ages can benefit in a connected world from the positive aspects of the Internet, explaining the online advertising ecosystem, preservation and promotion of cross-border data flows, a topic we need to continue to work on, other related issues we face in the connected world such as cyber security, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence to name just a few. </p><p>We also invited the heads of the tech industry to come and explain their practices right in this hearing room. Two of the committee's highest profile hearings in recent memory focused squarely on platform responsibility. The CEO Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, came and spent about 5.5 hours right at that table to answer some pretty tough questions on the Cambridge Analytica debacle, as well as provide the committee with more insight into how Facebook collects consumer information and what Facebook does with that information. </p><p>We also welcomed the CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, to provide the committee with more insight into how Twitter operates, decisions Twitter makes on his platform, and how such decisions impact consumers specifically so voices don't feel silenced.  </p><p>I'm pleased that Chairman Pallone brought in the CEO of Reddit last year and hope the trend will continue as we understand this ever evolving and critically important ecosystem from those that sit on the top of it. This hearing today helps with that. As this group of experts shine a light on questionable practices, I hope it can yield further fruitful results. Such efforts often lead to swifter actions than any government action can get done. </p><p>Following our series of hearings, there's proof that some companies are cleaning up their platforms, and we appreciate the work you're doing. For example, following our hearing on Cambridge Analytica, Facebook made significant changes to its privacy policies. And Facebook reformatted its privacy settings to make more accessible and user-friendly, eased the ability for its users to control and delete their information, took down malicious entities on its platform, and invested in programs to preserve and promote legitimate local news operations. </p><p>And during that hearing, Representative McKinley actually-- </p><p>[*]WALDEN: --worked pretty hard on some specific ads he had seen illegally selling opioids without prescriptions on Facebook and as a result Facebook removed those ads. In fact we got a call I think as Mr. Zuckerberg was headed to the airport that afternoon that those have already been taken down. </p><p>Also notable through the global Internet forum to counterterrorism platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have been working together to tackle terrorist content and importantly disrupt violent extremist ability to promote themselves, share propaganda and exploit digital platforms and we thank you for that work. Now this is not to suggest the online ecosystem is perfect, it is far from it and these companies be doing more to clean up their platforms? Of course and I expect them to and I think you are all working on that. </p><p>So let me be very clear. This hearing should serve as an important reminder to all online platforms that we are watching them closely. We want to ensure we do not harm innovation but as we have demonstrated in a bipartisan fashion in the past when we see issues or identify clear harms to consumers, we do not see online entities take appropriate action. </p><p>We are prepared to act. So Madam Chair thanks for having this hearing. This is tough stuff. I have a degree in journalism. I am a big advocate of the First Amendment and it can be messy business to on one hand call on them to take them things we don't want and still stay on the right side of the First Amendment because vigorous speech even when that's inaccurate is still protected in the First Amendment and if you go too far then we yell at you for taking things down that we liked and if you don't take down things we don't like then we yell at you for that so you are kind of in a bit of a box and yet we know 230 is an issue we need to revise and take a look at as well. </p><p>And then speaking of revise I--I had to chuckle that we all get the opportunity to revise and extend our remarks throughout this process and clean up our bad grammar so maybe some of what we have is kind of fake reporting but anyway we will leave that for another discussion on another day and with that ideal back Madam Chair. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentleman yields back and the chair would like to remind members that burst to committee rules all members written statements, opening statement shall be made part of the record. </p><p>I would now like to introduce our witnesses for today's hearing. Ms. Monika Bickert vice president of Global Policy Management at Facebook. I want to acknowledge and thank you. Ms. Bickert I know that you are not feeling well today and may want to abbreviate some of your testimony but we thank you very much for coming anyway. </p><p>I want to introduce Dr. Joan Donovan, research director of the technology and social Change Project at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Policy and Public Policy--Politics and Public Policy at Harvard's Kennedy School. </p><p>Mr. Justin Hurwitz, assistant professor of law and director of (INAUDIBLE) governance--Governance and Technology Center at the University of Nebraska College of Law and director of Law and Economics Programs at the International Center for Law and Economics and finally Dr. Tristan Harris who is the executive director for the Center for Humane Technology. We want to thank our witnesses for joining us today. We look forward to your testimony. </p><p>At this time the chair will recognize each witness for five minutes to provide their opening statement. Before we begin I would just like to explain the lighting system for those who may not know it. In front of you are a series of lights. The lights will initially be green at the start of your opening statement. The light will turn to yellow when you have one minute remaining and if you could please begin to wrap up your testimony at that point and then the light will turn red when your time has expired. </p><p>So Ms. Bickert you are recognized for five minutes. </p><p>BICKERT: Thank you Chairwoman Schakowsky, Ranking Member McMorris Rodgers and other distinguished members of the subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. My name is Monika Bickert. I am the vice president for Global Policy Management at Facebook and I am responsible for our content policies. </p><p>As the chairwoman pointed out I am a little under the weather today so with apologies I'm going to keep my remarks short but will rely on the written testimony I have submitted. We know that we have an important role to play at Facebook in the addressing manipulation and deception on our platform and we have many aspects to our approach including our community standards which specify what we will remove from the site and our relationship with third-party fact checkers through which fact checking organizations can rate content is falls. We put a label over that content saying that this is false information and reduce its distribution. </p><p>Under the community standards there are some types of misinformation that we have removed such as attempts to suppress the vote or to interfere with the senses. And we announced yesterday a new prong in our policy where we will also remove videos that are edited or synthesized using artificial intelligence or deep learning techniques in ways that are not apparent to the average person. That wouldn't mislead the average person to believe that the subject of the video said something that he or she did not in fact say. </p><p>To be clear manipulated media that does not fall under this new policy definition is still subject to our other policies and our third-party fact checking. That means that although deep fakes are still an emerging technology one area where Internet experts have seen them is in nudity and pornography. All of that violates our policies against nudity and pornography and we would remove it. </p><p>Manipulated videos are also eligible to be fact checked by these third-party fact checking organizations that we work with to label and reduced distribution of misinformation. We are always improving our policies and our enforcements and we will continue to do the engagement we have done outside the company with academics and experts to understand the new ways that these technologies are emerging and affecting our community. </p><p>We would also welcome the opportunity to collaborate with other industry partners and  interested stakeholders including academics, civil society and lawmakers to help develop a consistent industry approach to these issues. Our hope is that by working together with all of these stakeholders we can make faster progress in ways that benefit all of society. Thank you and I look forward to your questions. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you and now Dr. Donovan you are recognized for five minutes. </p><p>DONOVAN: Thank you chair--Chairwoman Schakowsky, Ranking Member McMorris Rodgers, Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member Walden for having me today. It is truly am honored to be invited. </p><p>I lead a team at Harvard Kennedy Shorenstein Center that researches online manipulation and deception and I have been a researcher of the Internet for the last decade. So I know quite a bit about changes in policies as well as the development of platforms themselves and what they were intended to do. </p><p>One of the things that I want to discuss today is online fraud which is a great deal more widespread than many understand. Beyond malware spam and phishing attacks, beyond credit card scams and product knockoffs there's a growing threat from new forms of identity fraud enabled by technological design. Platform companies are unable to manage this alone and Americans need governance. Deception is now a multimillion-dollar industry. </p><p>My research team trucks dangerous individuals and groups who use social media to pose as political campaigns, social movements, news organizations, charities, brands and even average people. This emerging economy of misinformation is a threat to national security. Silicon Valley corporations are largely profiting from it all key political and social institutions are struggling to win back the public's trust. Platforms have done more than just giving users a voice online they have effectively given them the equivalent of their own broadcast station emboldening the most malicious among us. </p><p>To wreak havoc with the media manipulation campaign all one bad actor needs his motivation, money also helps but that's enough to create chaos and divert significant resources from civil society politicians newsrooms and healthcare providers and even law enforcement who are tasked with repairing the damage. We currently do not know the true cost of misinformation. Individuals and groups can quickly weapon my social media causing others financial and physical injury. For example fraudsters using President Trump's image may in logo and voice have siphoned millions from his supporters by claiming to be part of his reelection coalition. In an election year disinformation and donations scams should be of concern to everyone. </p><p>Along with my co-researchers Brian Friedman(SP) and Brandy Collins Dexter(SP) I have studied malicious groups particularly white supremacist and foreign actors who have use social media to inflame racial divisions. Even as these imposters are quickly identified by the communities they target it takes time for platforms to remove inciting content. A single manipulation campaign can create an incredible strain on breaking news cycles effectively turning many journalist into unpaid content moderators and drawing law enforcement toward false leads. </p><p>Today I argue that online communication technologies need regulatory guardrails to prevent them from being used for manipulative purposes and in my written testimony I have provided a longer list of ways that you could think about technology differently. But right now I would like to call attention to deceptively edited audio and video to drive clicks, likes and shares. This is the AI technology commonly referred to as deep fakes and what I would also like to point out with my co-researcher Britt Paris(SP) that we have argued that cheap fakes are a wider threat like the doctored video Speaker Pelosi last week's decontextualized video of Joe Biden seemingly endorsing a white supremacist talking point poses another substantial challenge because the Biden video was clipped from non-augmented footage of platforms refused to date down this cheap fake. </p><p>Millions of mills platforms like radio towers have provided amplification power and as such they have a public interest obligation and I point out here that platforms are highly centralized mechanisms of distribution all the Internet is not so I'm not trying to conflate platforms with the Internet. This is why we place the burden of moderation on platforms and not with ISPs. </p><p>The world online is the is the real world and this crisis of counterfeits threatens to disrupt the Americans live our lives. Right now malicious actors jeopardize how we make informed decisions about who we get to vote for and what causes we support while platform companies have designed systems that facilitate this manipulation. We must expand the public understanding of technology by guarding against consumer right--guarding consumer rights against technological abuse including a cross sector effort to curb the distribution of harmful and malicious content. As Dana Boyd and I have written platform companies must address the power of amplification and distribution separately from content so that media distribution is transparent and accountable. I urge Congress to do the same. </p><p>Platforms politics and regulation in technology must work in tandem or else the future is forgery. Thank you. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you and now Mr. Hurwitz you are recognized for five minutes. </p><p>HURWITZ: Thank you Ms. chairwoman along with members of the committee for the opportunity to speak to you today. I would also be remiss if I did not think my colleague Christian Stout and Research Assistant Justin McCauley for helping drafting my written testimony. </p><p>I am a law professor so I apologize, I have written a short law review article for my written testimony which I (INAUDIBLE) read. I will turn to discussing that-- </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Make sure your mic--is your mic on? Pull it up. There you go. </p><p>HURWITZ: I will turn to discussing the short law review article that I have written for you as my testimony and assign to you to read in a moment. Before I turn to that want to make a couple of book recommendations. If you really want to understand what is at stake with dark patterns you should start by reading Brett Frischman(SP) and (INAUDIBLE) recent book Reengineering Humanity. </p><p>In my spare time I am a door to door book salesman. I have a copy here. Their book discusses how modern technology, data analytics combined with highly programmable environments are creating a world in which people are to use their term programmable. This book will scare you. </p><p>After you read that book you should then read Cliff(SP) (INAUDIBLE) and Robert(SP) (INAUDIBLE) recent book user-friendly. This was just published in November. It discusses the importance and difficulty of designing technologies that seamlessly operate in line with user expectations as user-friendly technologies. This book will help you understand the incredible power of user-friendly design and fill you with hope for what design makes possible along with appreciation for how difficult it is to do design well. Together these books will show you both sides of the coin. </p><p>Dark patterns are something that this committee absolutely should be concerned about but this committee should also approach the topic with great caution. Design is powerful but it is incredibly difficult to do well. Efforts to regulate bad uses of design could easily harm efforts to do and use design for good. How is that for having a professor testify? I have already assigned to books in a law review article, my own, for you to read some of the key ideas from that article in the next three minutes or so. Dark pattern is an ominous term. It is itself a dark pattern. It's a term for a simple concept. People behave in predictable ways. These behavioral patterns can be used to program us in certain ways and the concern is that sometimes we can be programmed to act against our own self-interest.  </p><p>So I have some examples, if we can look at the first example. This is something from the Internet. If you look at this for a moment, who here feels manipulated by this image? It's okay to say yes. I do. The designer of this image is using his knowledge of how people read text in an image to make it feel like the image is controlling us, making us control how our eyes are following it in predicting where we are going to go next. Weird stuff.  </p><p>Let's look at another example. Again, you can definitely tell from the Internet. Again, who feels like this image is manipulative? The image--previous image was harmless, but this one hits at the worker power of dark patterns. Most of you probably missed the typos in the first line and then the second line until the text pointed them out to you. What if this had been a contract in this trick was used to insert a material term or distract you from a material term in the contract the you are agreeing to? This is now gone from weird stuff to scary stuff.  </p><p>On the other hand, these same tricks can be used for good. In this same example, what if this trick were used to highlight and easily missed but important concern for consumers to pay attention to? This could be beneficial content to consumers. Design is not mere aesthetics. All design influences how decisions are made. It is not possible to regulate bad design with also--without also affecting good design.  </p><p>So how much of a problem are dark patterns? Recent research--research shows that websites absolutely are using them, sometimes subtly, sometimes overtly to influence users. In other research shows us that these tactics can be effective, leading consumers to do things that they otherwise wouldn't do. We've already heard some of examples of these so I won't repeat what's already been discussed. Rather, I'd like to leave you with a few ideas about what, if anything, we should do about them.  </p><p>First, dark patterns are used both online and off-line. Stores use their floor plans to influence what people by. Advertisers make consumers feel a sense of need and urgency for products. Try canceling a subscription service or returning a product. You will likely be routed through a maddening maze of consumer service representatives. If these patterns are a problem online, they are a problem off-line to. We shouldn't focus on one to the exclusion of the other.  </p><p>Second, while these tricks are annoying, it's unclear how much they actually harm consumers or how much benefit they may confer. Studies of mandatory disclosure laws, for instance, find that they have limited effectiveness. On the other hand, these tricks can also be used to benefit consumers. We should be cautious with relations that may fail to stop bad conduct while reducing the benefits of good conduct.  </p><p>Third, most of the worst examples of dark patterns very likely fall within the FTC's authority to regulate deceptive acts or practices. Before the legislature takes any action to address these concerns, the FTC should attempt to use its existing authority to address them. It's already hearing--having hearings on this--these issues. If this proves ineffective, the FTC should report to you, to Congress, on these practices.  </p><p>Fourth, industry has been responsive to these issues and, to some extent, has been self-regulating. Web browsers and operating systems have made many bad design practices harder to use, design professionals scorn dark patterns as practices, industry standardization and best practices and self-regulation should be encouraged. Fifth, regulator should-- </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: (OFF-MIC)  </p><p>HURWITZ: Yes. Last and building on all the above, this is an area well suited to cooperation between industry and regulators, efforts at self-regulation should be encouraged and rewarded. Perhaps even more important given the complexity of the systems, industry should be at the frontline of combating them. Industry has greater design expertise and ability to experiment than regulators, but there is an important role for regulation to step in where industry fails to please itself. In a true professor fashion-- </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: (OFF-MIC)  </p><p>HURWITZ: Thank you. I look forward to discussion. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: (OFF-MIC) Mr. Harris, you are now (OFF-MIC) for--for five minutes. </p><p>HARRIS: Thank you, Chairwoman Schakowsky, and--and members; really appreciate you inviting me here. I'm gonna go off script. I--I come here because I'm incredibly concerned. I actually have a lifelong experience with deception and how technology influences people's minds. </p><p>I was a magician as a kid, so I've started off by seeing the world this way. And then I studied a lab called the Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab, actually with the founders of Instagram. And so, I know the culture of the people who built these products and the way that is designed intentionally for mass deception. </p><p>I think there's--the thing I most want to respond to here is we--we've often framed these issues as we've got a few bad apples. We've got these bad deepfakes. We've got to get them off the platform. We've got this bad content. We've got these bad bots. What I want to argue is this is actually--and we've got these dark patterns. What I want to argue is we have dark infrastructure. </p><p>This is now the infrastructure by which 2.7 billion people, bigger than the size of Christianity, make sense of the world. It's the--it's the information environment. And if someone went along, private companies, and built nuclear power plants and--all across the United States and they started melting down and--and they said, well, it's your responsibility to have hazmat suits and build--you know, have a radiation kit, that's essentially what we're experiencing now. The responsibility is being put on--on consumers when in fact, if it's the infrastructure, it should be put on the people building that infrastructure. </p><p>There's specifically two areas of harm I want to focus on, even though when this becomes the infrastructure, it controls all of our lives. We wake up with these devices. We checked our phones 150 times a day. It's the infrastructure if we're going to bed. The children spend as much time on these devices as they do at the hours of school. So, no matter what you're putting in people's brains--kids' brains at school, you've got all the hours they spend at--you know, on their phones.  </p><p>And let's take the kids' issue. So, as infrastructure, this is not--the business model of this infrastructure is not aligned with the fabric of society. How much have you paid for your Facebook account recently for your YouTube account? Zero. How are they worth more than $1 trillion in market value? They monetize our attention. </p><p>The way they get that attention is by influencing you and getting--using these dark patterns or tricks to do it. So, the way they do with children, is they say how many likes or followers do you have? So, they basically get children addicted to getting attention from other people. These filters, likes, and such, etc., beautification filters that enhance your self-image.  </p><p>And after two decades in decline, the mental health of teen girls, high depressive symptoms--there's an image here that they'll be able to show--went up 170 percent after the year 2010 with the rise of Instagram, etc., okay? These are your children. These are your constituents. This is a real issue. It's because we're hacking the self-image of children. </p><p>On the information ecology front, the business model--think of it like we're drinking from the Flint water supply of information. This is the--of the business model is polarization because the whole point is I have to figure out and calculate whatever keeps your attention, which means affirmation, not information by default. It polarizes us by default.  </p><p>There's a recent Upturn study that it actually costs more money to advertise across the aisle that it does to advertise to people with your own same beliefs. In other words, polarization has a home-field advantage in terms of the business model. </p><p>The natural function on these--of these platforms is to reward conspiracy theories, outrage, what we call the race to the bottom of the brainstem. It's the reason why all of you at home have a crazier and crazier constituents who believe crazier and crazier things and you have to respond to them. I know you don't like that. </p><p>Russia is manipulating our veterans by--we have totally open borders while even protecting our digital--our physical borders. We left the digital border wide open. Imagine a nuclear plant who said we're not going to actually protect the nuclear plants from Russian cyber attacks. Well, this is sort of like Facebook building the--the information infrastructure and not protecting it from any bad actors until that pressure is there. </p><p>And this is leading to a kind of information trust meltdown, because no one even has to use deepfakes for essentially people to say, well, that must be a faked video, right? So, we're actually at the last turning point, kind of an event horizon, where we other protect the--the foundations of our information and trust environment or we let it go away. </p><p>And, you know, we say we care about kids' education, but we allow, you know, technology companies to--to basically tell them that the world revolves around likes, clicks, and shares. We say we want to, you know, come together, but we allow technology to profit by dividing us into echo chambers. We say America should lead on the global stage against China with a strong economy, but we allow technology companies to degrade our productivity and mental health while jeopardizing the development of our future workforce, which is our children. </p><p>And so, while I'm finishing up here, I just want to say that, instead of trying to design some new federal agency, some master agency, when technology has basically taken all the laws of the physical world--taken all the infrastructure in the physical world and a virtualized it into a virtual world with no laws, what happens when we have no laws for an entire virtualized infrastructure? </p><p>You can just bring some new agency around and regulate all of the virtual world. Why don't we take the existing infrastructure, existing agencies, who already have purview, Department of Education, Health and Human Services, National Institute of Health, and have a digital update that expands their jurisdiction to just ask, well, how do we protect the tech platforms in the--in the same areas of jurisdiction?  </p><p>I know I'm out of time, so thank--thank you very much. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you. So, now we have concluded our witness's opening statements. At this time, we will move to member questions. Each member will have five minutes to ask a question of our witnesses. I will begin by recognizing myself for five minutes. </p><p>UNKNOWN: (OFF-MIC)  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Ah, I see. So, as--as chair of the subcommittee, over and over again I'm confronted with new evidence that big tech has failed in regulating itself. When we had Mark Zuckerberg in here, I kind of did a review of all the apologies that we've had from him over--over the years. And I'm concerned that Facebook's latest effort to address misinformation on the platforms leaves a lot out. </p><p>I want to begin with some questions of you, Ms. Bickert. So, the--the deepfakes policy only covers video, as I understand it, that have been manipulated using artificial intelligence or deep learning. Is that correct? </p><p>BICKERT: Thank you, Chairwoman Schakowsky. The policy that we announced yesterday is confined to the definition that we set forth about artificial intelligence being used in a video to make it appear that somebody is saying something (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Okay. So, I--I only have five minutes. So, the--the--the video, for example, of Speaker Pelosi was edited to make her look like she was drunk wouldn't have been taken down under the new policy. Is that right, yes or no? </p><p>BICKERT: It would not fall under that policy, but it would still be subject to our other policies that address misinformation.  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: And as I read the deepfakes policy, it only covers video where a person is made to appear like they said words that they didn't actually say, but it doesn't cover videos where just the image is altered. Is that true? </p><p>BICKERT: Chairwoman Schakowsky, there are--that is correct about that policy. We do have a broader approach to misinformation that would put a label--we would actually scare the image and put a screen over it that says false information and directs people to information from fact checkers. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: So, Ms. Bickert, I--I really don't understand why Facebook should treat fake audio differently from fake images. Both can be highly misleading and result in significant harm to individuals and undermine democratic institutions. </p><p>Dr. Donovan, in your testimony you noted that \"cheat fakes\" are more prevalent than deepfakes. Do you see any reason to treat deepfakes as--and cheat fakes differently? </p><p>DONOVAN: (OFF-MIC) </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Microphone. </p><p>DONOVAN: Of course, as if I'm not loud enough. One of the things that is--cheap fakes leverage is what's sort of great about social media, is that it makes things clippier or smaller. And so, I understand the need for separate policies, but also the cheap fakes issue has not been enforced. Not--just speaking more broadly about social media platforms in general, there is completely uneven enforcement, see you can still find that piece of misinformation within the wrong context in multiple places. </p><p>And so, the policy on deepfakes is both--narrow, and I understand why. But also one thing that we should understand is presently there is no consistent detection mechanism for even finding deepfakes at this point. And so, I'd be interested to know more about how they are going to seek out either on upload--not just Facebook, but YouTube-- </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: --I'm going--I'm going to have to cut you off at this point because I do want to ask Mr. Harris. Given the prevalence of deceptive content online, are platforms doing enough to stop the dissemination of misinformation? And what can government do to prevent such manipulation of consumers? Should government be seeking to clarify the principle that, if it's illegal off-line, then it's illegal online? </p><p>HARRIS: Yes, a good example of that. So first is no, the platforms are not doing enough, and it's because their entire business model is misaligned with solving the problem. And I don't vilify the people because of that, it's just their business model is against the issue.  </p><p>We used to have Saturday morning cartoons. We protect the children from certain kinds of advertising, time place and manner restrictions. When YouTube for--when YouTube gobbles up that part of the attention economy, we'll lose all those protections. So why not bring back the protections of Saturday morning?  </p><p>We used to have fair price equal price election ads on TV. The same price for each politician to reach someone. When Facebook gobbles up election advertising, we just removed all of those same protections. So we're basically moving from a lawful society to an unlawful, virtual Internet society, and that's what we have to change. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you. I--I yield back. I recognize--now the chair recognizes Ms. Rogers, our subcommittee ranking member, for five minutes. </p><p>MCMORRIS RODGERS: Thank you, Madam chair. I referenced how misinformation is not a new problem, but certainly with the speed of information, how it can travel in the online world as its harm is increasing. That said, I have long believed that the way to address information is more transparency, more sources, more speech, not less.  </p><p>This is important not just in an election cycle, but also in discussions around public health issues, natural disasters, or any number of significant events. I'm worried about this renewed trend where some wants the government to set the parameters and potentially limit speech and expression. Ms. Bickert, how does free speech and expression factor into Facebook's content decisions, and can you please explain your use of third-party fact checkers? </p><p>BICKERT: Thank you. We are very much a platform for free expression. It's one of the reasons that we work with third-party fact checking organizations because what we do if they've ranked something false is we share more information on the service, so we put a little over it, this is false information, but then we show people here's what fact checkers are saying about the story. We work with more than 50 organizations worldwide and those organizations are chosen after meeting high standards for fact checking. </p><p>MCMORRIS RODGERS: Thank you. As a follow-up with the total volume of traffic you have, clearly human eyes alone cannot keep up. So artificial intelligence and machine learning have a significant role to identify not only deep fakes, but also other content that violates your terms of service. Would you just explain a little bit more to us how you use AI and the potential to use AI to fight fire with fire? </p><p>BICKERT: Absolutely. We do use a combination of technology and people to identify potential information to send to fact checkers. We also use people and technology to try to assess whether or not something has been manipulated in the media that would be covered by the policy we released yesterday. So with the fact checking program, we use technology to look for things like, let's say somebody has shared an image or a news story and people--friends are commenting on that saying don't you know this is a hoax or this isn't true? That's the sort of thing our technology can spot and send that content over to fact checkers.  </p><p>But it's not just technology. We also have ways for people to flag if they are seeing something that they believe to be false. That can send content over to fact checkers and then the fact checkers can also proactively choose to rate something that they are seeing on Facebook. </p><p>MCMORRIS RODGERS: Thank you. Professor Hurwitz, can you briefly describe how user interfaces can be designed to shape consumer choice and how such designs may benefit or harm consumers? </p><p>HURWITZ: They can be used--they can be modified created structured in any number of ways. We've heard examples, font size, text placement, the course of interaction with the website or even just a phone menu system. These can be used to guide users into making uninformed decisions or to highlight information that users should be paying attention to. This broadly falls into the category of nudges and behavioral psychology that's intention intensely researched area. It can be used in many ways. </p><p>MCMORRIS RODGERS: Right, and you highlighted some of that in your testimony. Would you explain how the FTC can use its existing section 5 authority to address most of the concerns raised by dark pattern practices? </p><p>HURWITZ: Yes. Very briefly, I could lecture for a semester on this, not to say that I have, the FTC has a broad history, long history of regulating unfair and deceptive practices and advertising practices. It's deception authority, false statements--statements that are material to a consumer, making a decision that is harmful to the consumer, they can use adjudication, they can enact rules in order to take action against platforms or any entity online or off-line that deceives consumers. </p><p>MCMORRIS RODGERS: Do you think that they are doing enough? </p><p>HURWITZ: I would love to see the FTC do more in this area, especially when it comes to rule making and in court enforcement actions because the boundaries of their authority are unknown, unsorted, untested. This is an area where bringing suits, bringing litigation that tells us what the agency is capable of, which this body needs to know before it tries to craft more legislation or give more authority to an entity. If we already have an agency that has power, let's see if--what it's capable of. </p><p>MCMORRIS RODGERS: Right, okay. Thank you, everyone. I appreciate you all being here. Very important subject and I appreciate the chair for hosting, for having this hearing today. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: I thank that ranking member who yields back, and now I recognize the chair of the full committee, Mr. Pallone, for five minutes. </p><p>PALLONE: Thank you, Madam chair. I've got a lot to ask you, so I'm going to ask you for your responses to be brief, if possible. But in your various testimonies, you all talked about of variety of technologies and techniques that are being used to deceive and manipulate consumers. You've heard about user interfaces designed to persuade and sometimes trick people into making certain choices, deep fakes and cheap fakes that show fictional scenarios that look real and algorithms designed to keep people's eyes locked on their screens, and we know these things are happening.  </p><p>But what's less clear is how and the extent to which these techniques are being used commercially and on commercial platforms. So first, let me ask Dr. Donovan. As a researcher who focuses on the use of these techniques, do you have sufficient access to commercial platform data to have a comprehensive understanding of how disinformation and fraud is conducted and by whom </p><p>DONOVAN: (OFF-MIC) </p><p>PALLONE: Your--yeah, your mic. </p><p>DONOVAN: The brief answer is no, and that's because we don't have access to the data as it is, there's all these limits on the ways in which you can acquire data through the interface and then the other problem is there was a very good faith effort between Facebook and scholars to try to get a bunch of data related to the 2016 election that. That fell apart, but a lot of people put an incredible amount of time, money, and energy into that effort and it failed around the issues related to privacy and differential privacy.  </p><p>What I would love to see also happen is Twitter has started to give data related to deletions and account takedowns. We need a record of that so that when we do audit these platforms for either financial or social harms that the deletions are also included and marked. Because even if you can act like a data scavenger and go back and get data when things are deleted, sometimes they're just gone for good. And those pieces of information are often the most crucial. </p><p>PALLONE: Thank you. Mr. Harris, should the government be collecting more information about such practices in order to determine how best to protect Americans? </p><p>HARRIS: Yes. Here's an example. So unlike other addictive industries, for example, addiction is part of the deception that's going on here. The tobacco industry doesn't know which users are addicted to smoking. The alcohol industry doesn't know exactly who is addicted to alcohol, but unlike that, each tech company does know exactly how many people are checking for more than, 100 times a day between certain ages. They know who's using it late at night and you can imagine using existing agencies, say Department of Health and Human Services, to be able to audit Facebook on a quarterly basis and say hey, tell us how many users are addicted between these-- </p><p>[*]HARRIS: --(INAUDIBLE) What are you doing next quarter to make adjustments to reduce that number and every day they are the ones issuing the questions and the responsibility in the resources have to be deployed by the actor that has most of them which would in this case would be Facebook and there's a quarterly loop between each agency asking questions like that, forcing accountability with the companies for the areas of their existing jurisdiction. So I'm just trying to figure out is that a way that we can scale this to meet the scope of the problem when you realize this is happening to 2.7 billion people. </p><p>PALLONE: Thank you. This week Facebook released a new policy on the how it will handle the fakes. So Ms. Bickert under your policy deep fakes are and I am paraphrasing videos manipulated through artificial intelligence that is intended to mislead and are not parodied or satire. Did I get that right? </p><p>BICKERT: Yes, that's right.  </p><p>PALLONE: Okay. Now I understand that Twitter and YouTube either do not have or use the same definition for deep fakes and that is indicative--indicative of a lack of consistent treatment of problematic content across the major platforms and hate speech or abusive behavior on one side is permitted on another. There seems to be very little consistency across the marketplace which leaves consumers at a loss. </p><p>So let me go to Dr. Donovan again is there a way to develop a common set of standards for these problematic practices so that consumers are not facing different policies on different websites? Your mic again. </p><p>DONOVAN: I got it. I--I think it is possible to create a set of policies but you have to look at the features that are consistent across these platforms. If they do for instance use attention to a specific post in their algorithms to boost popularity then we need a regulation around that especially because bots or unmanned accounts for lack of a better term are often used to accelerate content and to move content across platforms. </p><p>These are things that are usually purchased off platform and they are considered a dark market product but you can purchase attention to an issue and so as a result there has to be something more broad that goes across platform but also looks that the features and then also tries to regulate some of these markets that are not built into the platform themselves. </p><p>PALLONE: All right. Thank you. Thank you Madam Chair. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you. Mr. Bucshon you are recognized for five minutes. </p><p>BUCSHON: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. Sorry I have two of these hearings going on at the same time so I am back and forth. I appreciate the hearing and the opportunity to discuss the spread of misinformation on the Internet but I want to stress that I am concerned over the efforts to make tech companies the adjudicators of truth in quotation marks. </p><p>In a country founded on free speech we should not be allowing private corporations in my view or for that matter the government to determine what qualifies as the and again in quotation marks the truth. Potentially censoring a voice because that voice disagrees with mainstream opinion. That said I totally understand the difficulty and the challenges that we all face together concerning this issue and how we are together trying to work to address it. </p><p>Ms. Bickert can you provide some more information on how Facebook might or will determine if a video misleads? What factors might you consider? </p><p>BICKERT: Thank you. Just to be clear there are two ways that we might be looking at that issue. One is with regard to the deep fakes policy that we released yesterday and we will be looking to see specifically what type of (INAUDIBLE) were--were we seeing artificial intelligence and deep learnings? Was that part of the technology that was led to change or fabricate a video in a way that really wouldn't be evident to the average person and that will be a fundamental part of determining whether there is misleading. Separately-- </p><p>BUCSHON: Can--can I ask a question then? Who is the this might sorry I want you to quit coughing so you can hear me. The question then I mean I am playing devil's advocate here who is the average person? </p><p>BICKERT: Congressman these are exactly the questions that we have been discussing with more than 50 experts as we have tried to write this policy and get it in the right place. </p><p>BUCSHON: I appreciate what you are doing. I am not trying to be difficult here. </p><p>BICKERT: No, these--these are real challenging issues. It is one of the reasons that we think generally the approach to misinformation of getting more information out there from accurate sources is effective. </p><p>BUCSHON: And you stated in your testimony that once a fact checker rates a photo or a video as false or partly false Facebook reduces the distribution. Is there a way for an individual who may have posted these things to protest the decision? </p><p>BICKERT: Yes, congressman. They can go directly to the fact checker. We make sure there is a mechanism for that and they can do that either if they dispute it or if they have amended whatever it was in their article that was the problem. </p><p>BUCSHON: Right because I--I would say I mean people with good lawyers can dispute a lot of things but the average citizen in Southwest Indiana who pose something online there needs to be in my view a fairly straightforward process that the average person whoever that might be can understand to protest or dispute the fact that their distribution has been reduced. Thank you. </p><p>Mr. Hurwitz you have discussed that the FTC current authority to address start pattern however I would be interested to know your thoughts on how consumers can protect themselves from these patterns and advertisements. Is the only solution through government action or can the consumer education help highlight these advertisement practices? </p><p>HURWITZ: The most important thing for any company especially in the online context is trust, the trust of the consumers. Consumer education, user education is important but I think that is fair to say with condolences perhaps to Ms. Bickert Facebook has a trust problem. Consumers, if users stop trusting these platforms, if hearing such as this shine a light on bad practices then they are going to have a hard time retraining users and consumers. That puts a great deal of pressure. </p><p>In addition stability of practices. If we have one dark pattern is to constantly change the user interface so users don't know how it operates. If we have stability, if we have platforms that operate in consistent predictable ways that helps users become educated, helps users understand what practices are and learn how to operate in this new environment. Trust on the Internet is different; we are still learning what it means. </p><p>BUCSHON: And I know you went over this but can you talk again about how these start pattern practices took place before the Internet and are currently happening in brick-and-mortar stores and other areas, mail pieces that politicians send out I mean I just want to reiterate again this is a broader problem than just the Internet. This is something that has been around for a while. </p><p>HURWITZ: Yeah, dark patterns, these practices they go back to the beginning of time. Basic fundamentally they are persuasion. If I want to convince you of my worldview, if I want to convince you to be my customer, if I want to convince you to be my friend I am going to do things that influence you. I am going to present myself to you in ways that are going to try and get you to like me or my product. </p><p>If you come into my store and ask for a recommendation what size tire do I need for my car my sales representative is going to give you information, the store is going to be structured these have been used consistently throughout (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>BUCSHON: Yeah. My--my time has expired. My point was that when we look at this problem we need to take in my view take a holistic approach of how what has happened in the past stand with the emerging technology how we address that consistently and not just target specific industries. Thank you. I yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentleman yields back I now recognize Congresswoman Castor for five minutes. </p><p>CASTOR: Well thank you chairwoman Schakowsky for calling this hearing. You know the Internet and online platforms have developed over time without a lot of safeguards for the public and government here we exercise our responsibility to keep the public safe whether it's the cars we drive, the water we drink, airplanes, drugs that are for sale and really the same should apply to the Internet and online platforms. </p><p>You know there is a lot of illegal activity being promoted online where the First Amendment just does not come into play and I hope we don't go down that rabbit hole because we are talking about human trafficking, terrorist plots, illicit sales of firearms, child exploitation and now what we have swamping these online platforms that control the algorithms that manipulate the public are the deep fakes, these dark patterns, artificial intelligence, identity theft but these online platforms remember they control these algorithms that--that steer children and adults, everyone in certain directions and we have got to get a handle on that. </p><p>For example Mr. Harris one manipulative design technique is the autoplay feature. It is now ubiquitous across video streaming platforms particularly billions of people that go onto YouTube or Facebook. This feature automatically begins playing a new video after the current video ends, the next video is determined using an algorithm designed to keep the viewers' attention. This platform driven algorithm drives - back often drives the proliferation of illegal activities and dangerous ideologies and conspiracy theories, makes it much more difficult for the average person to try to get truth-based content. </p><p>I am particularly concerned about the impact on kids and you have raise that and I appreciate that. You discuss how the mental health of kids today really is at risk. Can you talk more about the context in which children may be particularly harmed by these addiction maximizing algorithms and what parents can do to protect kids from becoming trapped in the YouTube vortex and what you believe our responsibility is as policymakers? </p><p>HARRIS: Thank you so much for your--for your question. Yes, this is very deeply concerning to me. So laying it out with more than 2 billion users think of these on YouTube as 2 billion Truman shows. Each of you get a channel and a supercomputer is just trying to calculate the perfect thing to confirm your view of reality. </p><p>This by definition fractures reality into 2 billion different polarizing channels each of which is tuned to bring you to a more extreme view. The quick example is a imagine a spectrum of all of the videos on YouTube laid out on one line and on my left side over here you have the calm Walter Cronkite rational science side of YouTube and the other side you have crazy town you have UFOs, conspiracy theories, Alex Jones crazy, crazy stuff. No matter where you start if I am YouTube you could start in the calm section or you could start in crazy. </p><p>If I want you to watch more am I going to steer you that way or that way? I'm always going to steer you towards crazy town so imagine taking the ant colony of 2.1 billion humans and then just tilting it like that. Three examples of the per your kids example 2 years ago on YouTube if a teen girl watched a dieting video it would auto (INAUDIBLE) videos because those were more extreme. If you watched a 9/11 news video, it would recommend 9/11 conspiracy theories. If you watched the videos about the moon landing, it would recommend flat Earth conspiracy theories. </p><p>Flat Earth conspiracy theories were recommended hundreds of millions of times. This might sound just funny and, oh, look at those people, but actually this is very serious. I have a researcher friend who's studied this. If the flat Earth theory is true, it means not just that all of government is lying to you, but all of science is lying to you. Think about that for a second. That's like a meltdown of all of our rational epistemic understanding of the world. </p><p>And as you said, these things are autoplaying. So, the autoplay is just like a--it--it hacks your brain's stopping cue. So, as a magician, how do I know if I want you to stop? I put a stopping cue in and your mind wakes up. It's like a right angle and a choice. If I stop drinking--of the water that's the bottom of the glass, I have to make conscious choice. Do I want more? But we can design it so it just--the bowl never stops. We can just keep refilling the water and you never--never stop. </p><p>And that's how we basically have kept millions of kids addicted. In places like the Philippines, people watched YouTube for 10 hours a day, 10 hours a day. </p><p>CASTOR: And this has--this has significant cost to the public, and that's the--that's one of the points I hope people will understand. As Dr. Donovan says, there's economy of misinformation now. These online platforms now are passing along--they're monetizing, making billions of dollars. Meanwhile, public health costs, law enforcement costs are adding up to--to the public, and we have a real responsibility to tackle it--tackle this and level the playing field. </p><p>HARRIS: And by not acting, we're subsidizing our societal self-destruction. I mean, we're subsidizing that right now, so yeah, absolutely. Thank you so much. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: I recognize Representative Burgess for five minutes. </p><p>BURGESS: And thank you. Thanks for holding this hearing. Apologize; we have another health hearing going on upstairs, so it's one of those days you've got to toggle between the import--important issues. </p><p>Mr. Hurwitz, let me start by asking you--and this is a little bit off-topic but it's important. In 2018, United States District Court for West--Western Pennsylvania indicted seven Russians for conducting a physical cyber acting--hacking operation in 2016 against Western targets, including the United States Anti-Doping Agency in response to the revelation of Russia's state-sponsored doping campaign. </p><p>These hackers were representatives of the Russian military, the GRU. According to the indictment, the stolen information was publicized by the GRU as part of a related influence and disinformation campaign designed to undermine the legitimate interests of the victims. This information included personal medical information about United States' athletes. </p><p>So, these GRU hackers used the fictitious identities and fake social media accounts to research and probe victims and their computer networks. While the methods that we're talking about today are largely in the context of the perhaps deceiving voters or consumers and the harmful potent--for potential effects is actually quite large. So, in your testimony, you--you defined the dark pattern or the practice of using designed to prompt desired if not necessarily desirable behavior. Can these dark patterns be used to surveil people and find ways to hack them in the service of broader state-sponsored operations? </p><p>HURWITZ: Yes, absolutely they can. And this goes to the broader context in which this discussion is happening. We're not only talking about consumer protection, we're talking about a fundamental architecture. The nature, as I said before, of trust online is different, all of those cues that we rely on for you to know who I am when you see me sitting here.  </p><p>We've gone through some vetting process to be sitting here. We have identities. We have telltale cues that you can rely on to know who I am and who you are. Those are different online, and we need to think about trust online it differently. One point--one example that I'll highlight that goes to a industry-based solution and, more important, the nature of how we need to think about these things differently in the context of targeted advertising and political advertising in a particular, how do we deal with targeted misinformation for political ads? </p><p>Well, one approach, which Facebook has been experimenting with, is instead of saying you can't speak, you can't advertise. If I target and added a group of speakers, Facebook will let someone else target and add to that same group where they've been experimenting with this. It's a different way of thinking about how we deal with establishing trust or responding to untrustworthy information. We need more creative thinking. We need more research about how do we establish trust in the online environment. </p><p>BURGESS: Well, thank you, and thank you for those observations. Ms. Bickert, if I ever doubted the power of Facebook, three years ago that doubt was completely eliminated. One of your representatives actually offered to do a Facebook event in the district that I represent in Northern Texas. And it was not political. It was a business-to-business. It's how--you know, how to facilitate and run your small business more efficiently, and wanted to do a program.  </p><p>And we selected a Tuesday morning and I asked how big a venue should we get, thinking maybe 20, 30. And I was told 2,000; expect 2,000 people to show up. I'm like 2,000 people in a Tuesday morning for a business-to-business Facebook presentation? Are you nuts? The place was standing room only, and it was the power of Facebook getting the word out there that this is what we're doing. And it was one of the most well attended events I've--I've ever been to as an elected representative.  </p><p>So, if I'd ever doubted the power of Facebook, it was certainly brought home to me how it just exactly the--the kind of equity that you're able to wield. But recognizing that, do you have a sense of the type of information on your platforms that needs to be fact checked because you do have such a--an enormous amount of equity? </p><p>BICKERT: Yes, congressman, and--and thank you for those words. We're concerned not just with misinformation. That is a concern and that's why we've developed the relationships we have now with more than 50 fact checking organizations. But we're also concerned with abuse of any time--type.  </p><p>I am responsible for managing that, so whether it's terror propaganda, hate speech, threats of violence, child exploitation content, content that promotes eating disorders, any of that violates our policies and we go after it proactively to try to find it and remove it. That's what my team does. </p><p>BURGESS: You feel you've been successful? </p><p>BICKERT: I think we have had a lot of successes and we are making huge strides. There is always more to do. We've begun publishing reports in the past year and a half or so every six months where we actually show, across different abuse types, how prevalent is this on Facebook from a--from doing a sample. How much content do we find this quarter and--and remove, and how much did we find before anybody reported it to us? </p><p>The numbers are--are trending in a good direction in terms of how effective our enforcement measures are, and we hope that that will continue to improve. </p><p>BURGESS: As policymakers, can we access that--that fund of data to, say for example, get the number of anti-vaccine issues that have been propagated on your platform? </p><p>BICKERT: Congressman, I can follow up with you on the reports we have and--and any other information. </p><p>BURGESS: Thank you. I'll yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: If I could just clarify that question, is that information readily available to consumers or no? </p><p>BICKERT: Chairwoman, the reports I just mentioned are publicly available. And we can follow up with any detailed requests as well. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: I recognize Mr. Veasey for five minutes for questioning. </p><p>VEASEY: Thank you, Madam Chair. Outside of self-reporting, what can be done to help educate communities that may be specifically targeted by, you know, all these different platforms? I--I was wondering, Mr. Harris, if you could address that specifically just because I think that a--a great deal of my constituency and--and even on the Republican side, I think a great deal of their constituencies are probably being targeted based on things like race and income, religion and what have you. And is there anything outside of self-reporting that can be done to--to just help educate people more? </p><p>HARRIS: Yeah, there's--there's so many things here. And as you mentioned, in the 2016 election, Russia targeted African-American populations. I think people don't realize--I think every time a campaign is discovered, how do we back notify people, all of whom were affected, and say you were the target of an influence operation? </p><p>So, right now every single week we hear reports of Saudi Arabia, Iran, Israel, China, Russia all doing various different influence operations. Russia was recently going after U.S. veterans. Many veterans would probably say that's a conspiracy theory, right? But Facebook is the company that knows exactly who was affected, and they could actually back notify every time there's an influence operation, letting those--those communities know that this is what happened and that they were targeted.  </p><p>We have to move from this is a conspiracy theory to this is real. I--I've studied cult deprogramming for a while, and how do you wake people up from a cult when they don't know they're in? You have to show them essentially the techniques that were used on them to manipulate them. And every single time these operations happen, I think that has to be made visible to people.  </p><p>And just like we said, you know, we have laws and protections. We have a Pentagon to protect our physical borders. We don't have a Pentagon to protect our digital borders. And so, we depend on however many people Facebook chooses to hire for--for those teams. One example of this, by the way, is that the City of Los Angeles spends 25 percent of its budget on security. Facebook spends a 6 percent of its budget on security, so it's under spending the City of LA by about four times.  </p><p>So, you know, you can just make some benchmarks and say are they solving the problem? They've got 2.2 billion fake accounts, Facebook has, that they took down, fake accounts. So, they have 2.7 billion real accounts, and then there was 2.2 billion fake accounts. And, you know, you--I'm sure they got all of them I think would be the line to--to use here.  </p><p>VEASEY: Ms. Bickert, you know, given the fact that it does seem like these foreign agents, these foreign actors are targeting people specifically by their race, by their economics, by what region of the country that they live in, is Facebook doing anything to--to--to gather information or to look at--at how specific groups are being targeted, if our--if African-Americans are being targeted for political misinformation, if--if whites that live in rural America, if there being targeted for political misinformation, if people based on their likes--like, if you could gather information--if these foreign actors could gather information based on people--based on things that they like? </p><p>So, let's say that you were--you were white and you lived in a rural America and you liked One America News and you liked these other things, that you may be more likely to be--to believe in these sorts of conspiracy theories, like are--are you sure that some of the things that people are sharing on your platform or likes and dislikes are to be used as part of that scheme as well? Could you just--could you answer both of those? </p><p>BICKERT: Yes, congressman. Thank you for the question. There are, broadly speaking, two things that we do. One is trainings and tools to help people, especially those who might be most at risk, recognize ways to keep themselves safe from everything from hacking to scams and other abuse. </p><p>Separately, whenever we influence operations under our, what we call this coordinated inauthentic behavior. We removed more than 50 such networks in the past year. Anytime we do that, we are very public about it because we want to expose exactly what we are seeing and will even include examples in our posts saying here's a network. It was in this country, it was targeting people in this other country. Here are examples of the types of posts that they were putting in their pages. We think the more we can shine a light on this, the more we'll be able to stop it. </p><p>VEASEY: But--but, before my time expires, but if people are being specifically if their whites and, Dr. Burgess' district being specifically targeted because of certain television or news programming that they like, if they are African-Americans that are being specifically targeted because Russian actors may think that they lead a certain way in politics, don't you think that information ought to be analyzed more closely instead of relying on--instead of just leaving it up to that user to be able to figure all of this out? Especially when people work odd hours and may only have time to--to digest what they immediately read, and they may not have opportunity to go back in and analyze something so deeply as far as what you're saying? </p><p>BICKERT: Congressman, I appreciate that and I will say attribution is obligated and understanding the intent behind some of these operations is complicated. We think the best way to do that is to make them public, and we don't just--we don't just do this ourselves, we actually work hand-in-hand with academics and security firms who are studying these types of things so that they can see, and sometimes will say as we take down a network, we have done this in collaboration or conversation with, and we will name the group. So there are groups who can look at this and together, hopefully shine light on who the actors are and why they're doing what they're doing. </p><p>VEASEY: Thank you. I yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: I recognize Mr. Latta for five minutes. </p><p>LATTA: Well, thank you, Madam chair, and thanks very much for holding this very important hearing today. And thank you to our witnesses for appearing before us and it's really important for Americans to get this information.  </p><p>In 2018, the experts out there estimated that criminals were successful in stealing over $37 billion from our older Americans through different scams through the Internet, identity theft, friends, family abuse, and imposter schemes. Last year in my district, I had the Federal Trade Commission and the IRS out for a senior event so that seniors could be educated on the threat of these scams and how to recognize, avoid, ward off and how to recover from them.  </p><p>Congress recognized that many of these scams carried out through these manipulative and illegal Robo calls that combat these scams, I introduced the Stop Robocalls Act, which was recently signed into law as part of the TRACED Act, which I'm very glad the president signed over the Christmas holiday. While I'm glad that we were able to get this done, I continue to be concerned with the ability of scammers to evolve and adapt to changes in the law by utilizing new technologies and techniques like deep and cheap fakes.  </p><p>And Ms. Bickert, I don't want to pick on you, and I really appreciate you being here today, especially since you're a little under the weather. And I also appreciated reading your testimony last night. I found it very interesting and enlightening. I have several questions. As more and more seniors are going online and joining Facebook to keep in contact with their family, friends, neighbors, and your testimony, you walked us through Facebook's efforts to recognize misinformation and what the company is doing to combat malicious actors using manipulated media. Is Facebook doing anything specifically to help protect seniors from being part targeted on the platform or educating them on how to recognize fake accounts or scams? </p><p>BICKERT: Thank you for the question. We are, indeed, and that includes both in person trainings for seniors, which we've done and will continue to do. We also have a guide that can be more broadly distributed that publicly available that is a guide for seniors on the best ways to keep themselves safe. But I want to say more broadly, and as somebody who was a federal terminal prosecutor for 11 years looking at that sort of behavior, this is something we take seriously across the board. We don't want anybody to be using Facebook to scam somebody else and we look proactively for that sort of behavior and remove it. </p><p>LATTA: Well, just a quick follow-up, it's--I think it's really important because, you know, from what we've learned and a lot of times is that seniors don't report things because they're afraid that, boy, you know, I've been taken I don't want to tell my relatives, I want to tell my friends because they're afraid of losing some of what they might have. And not just on the money side, but how they can get out there. And so I think it's really important that we always think about our seniors.  </p><p>And just a follow-up because at the workshop that we had that in the district last year, the FTC stated that one of the best ways to combat scams is to educate the individuals on how to recognize the illegal behavior so they can turn in--they can turn that into educate their friends and neighbors. In addition to your private sector partnership, would Facebook be willing to partner with agencies like the FTC to make sure the public is informed about scammers operating on their platform? </p><p>BICKERT: Congressman, I'm very happy to follow-up on that. We think it's important for people to understand the tools that are available to keep themselves safe online. </p><p>LATTA: Ms. Donovan? </p><p>DONOVAN: Yeah, one of the things that we should also consider is the way in which people are targeted by age for. I looked at reverse mortgage scams, retirement funding scams, fake healthcare supplements, you know, when you do retire, it becomes very confusing, you're looking for information, and if you're looking primarily on Facebook and then posting about it, you might be retargeted by the advertising system itself. And so even when you're not information seeking, Facebook's algorithms and advertising are giving other third parties information that--and then serving advertising to seniors. And so it is a persistent problem </p><p>LATTA: Thank you. Again, Ms. Bickert, if I could just follow up quickly with my remaining 30 seconds, many of the scammers look for ways to get around Facebook's policies, including through the development and refinement of new technologies and techniques. This Facebook dedicating the resources and exploring ways to proactively combat scams instead of reacting after the fact? </p><p>BICKERT: Yes, congressman, we are. I've been overseeing content policy content policies for about seven years now. And in that time, I would say that we've gone from being primarily reactive in the way that we enforce our policies to now primarily proactive. We are really going after abusive content and trying to find it. We grade ourselves based on how much we are finding before people reported to us, and we are now publishing reports of that effect. </p><p>LATTA: Thank you very much. Madam Chairman, my time has expired and I yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentleman yields back and I now recognize Mr. O'Halleran from five minutes. </p><p>O'HALLERAN: I want to thank the chairwoman for holding this important and timely meeting here today hearing. I echo the concerns of my colleagues. The types of deceptive online practices that have been discussed today are deeply troubling. I've continually stressed that a top priority for Congress should be securing our U.S. elections. We can see dangerous consequences if the right tools are not in place to prevent the spread of misinformation online. This is a national security concern.  </p><p>As a former law enforcement officer, I understand that laws and be meaningless if they are not enforced. I look forward to hearing more from our witnesses about the FTC's capabilities and resources to combat these deceptive online practices. Dr. Donovan, in your testimony, you say that regulatory guardrails are needed to protect users from being misled online. I share your concerns about deception and manipulation online, including the rise in use of the dark patterns, deep fakes and other kinds of bad practices that can harm consumers. Can you explain in more detail what sort of regulatory guardrails are necessary to prevent these instances? </p><p>DONOVAN: I'll go into one very briefly. One of the big questions is if I post something online that's not an advertisement, it's not, you know, I'm just trying to inform my known networks, the problem isn't necessarily always that there is a piece of fake content out there, the real problem is the scale, being able to reach millions, right?  </p><p>2010, 2011, we lauded that as a virtue of platforms. It really emboldened many of our important social movements and raised some incredibly important issues. But that wasn't false information, it wasn't meant to deceive people, it wasn't meant to siphon money out of other groups. At that time too, you weren't really able to scale donations, you want really--it was much harder to create networks of fake accounts and pretend to be an entire constituency. And so when I talk about regulatory guardrails, we have to think about distribution differently than we think about the content.  </p><p>And then, we can also assuage some of the fears that we have about freedom of expression by looking at what are the mechanisms by which people can break out of their known networks? Is it advertising? Is it the use of fake accounts? How are people going viral? How are posts going viral, information going viral?  </p><p>The other thing I'd like to know from the government perspective is does the FTC--FTC had enough insight into platforms to monitor that, to understand that. And if they don't, if they don't know why and how tens of millions of dollars are being siphoned out of Trump's campaign, then that's also another problem and we have to think about what is transparency, what does auditing look like in a very meaningful way. </p><p>O'HALLERAN: And Doctor, do you believe then that the FTC has the adequate authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act to take action against individuals and companies engaged in deceptive behavior practices online? And I--I do want to point out a Wall Street Journal report that said of the millions of dollars, 200 and some million dollars of fines that they've only collected about $7000 since 19--since 2015. </p><p>DONOVAN: Wow. I think that you do have to look a lot closer at what the FTC has access to and how they can make that information actionable. For example, proving that there's substantial injury, if only one group has access to the known costs or knows the enormity of a scam, then we have to be able to expedite the transfer of data-- </p><p>[*]DONOVAN: --that we are not relying on journalists or researchers or civil society organizations to investigate. I think that the investigatory powers of the FTC have to also include assessing substantial injuries. Thanks. </p><p>O'HALLERAN: Thank you, Dr. Mr. Harris do you believe the agency has enough resources to responsibly, swiftly and appropriately address the issues? And I just want to point out that we flatlined them all of the time and on the other side the industry continues to expand at exponential rates and so I-- </p><p>HARRIS: (INAUDIBLE) that is the issue that you're pointing to is that the problem creating aspects of the technology industry because they operate at exponential scales create exponential you know issues, harms, problems, scams, etc., and so how do you, you know, have a small body reach such large capacities? This is why I am even thinking about how can we have a digital update for each of our different agencies who already have jurisdiction over whether it's public-health or children or scams or deception and just have them ask the questions that then are forced upon the technology companies to use their resources to calculate, and report back, set the objection, set the goals for what they are going to in the next quarter to deal with it. </p><p>O'HALLERAN: Thank you, Mr. Harris and I yield. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The chair now recognizes Mr. Carter for five minutes. </p><p>CARTER: Thank you Madam Chair and thank all of you for being here. This is extremely important and extremely important to all of our citizens. I want to start by saying that you know when we talk about deep fake and cheap fake to me that is somewhat black-and-white, I can understand it. But Mr. Hurwitz when we talk about dark patterns I think that is more gray in my mind and I will just give you an example. </p><p>I was a retailer for many years and I grew up in the South, okay? We had a grocery store chain many some of you may be familiar with it, Piggly Wiggly and I always heard that the way they got their name and I have tried to fact check it but I couldn't find it but in a way I always heard the way they got their name is they are range their stores to when you went in you had to kind of wiggle all of the way around before you could get back out so that you would buy more things. </p><p>It was like a pig wiggling through the farmyard or something and they came up with Piggly Wiggly. That is marketing and you know another example is all of us go to the grocery store. When we are at the grocery store and you are in the checkout line you have got all of these things up there that they are trying to get you to buy, they are not necessarily or you can argue that they are impulse items then again you could also make the argument that when you get hold of you say geez I wish I would have gotten that at the grocery store, I wish I would have gotten these batteries or the Band-Aids or whatever. How do you differentiate between what is harmful and what is beneficial? </p><p>HURWITZ: Great question because it is gray and as I said previously dark patterns the term itself is a dark pattern intended to make us think about this as dark. There are some clear categories, clearer lies, clear false statements where we are talking about classic deception. That is pretty straightforward but when we are talking about more behavioral nudges it becomes much more difficult. Academics have studied nudges for decades at this point and it is hard to predict when they are going to be effective, when they are not going to be. </p><p>In the FTC context the deception standard has a materiality requirement so there needs to be some demonstration that a practice is material to the consumer harm and that is a good sort of framework. If we don't have some sort of demonstrable harm requirement and causal connection there--I am a law professor, causation is a basic element of any legal claim. If you don't have some ability to tie the act to the harm you are in dark waters for due process. </p><p>CARTER: So do you think we should be instructing the FTC to conduct research on this as to what is going on here? </p><p>HURWITZ: I think more information is good information. The FTC is conducting some hearings already. I think greater investigation is very powerful. Also that the FTC understands what they should be doing so they can use this information to establish rules or materiality is difficult to establish. </p><p>The FTC can issue a rule, go through a rulemaking process which makes it easier to substantiate an enforcement action subsequently and even to respond in part to a previous question to the extent that one of the FTC core powers even if it doesn't like this as an enforcement authority is to report to this body and say look, we are seeing this practice, it is problematic, we don't have the authority, can you do something about it and perhaps this body will act in give it power, perhaps this body will take direct action or perhaps the platforms and other entities will say wow, the jig is up, we should change our practices before Congress does something that could be even more detrimental to us. </p><p>CARTER: Right. Mr. Harris did you have something? </p><p>HARRIS: Yes, I--I have studied this topic for also about a decade so you ask what's different about this, you've got the pig going through the thing, you've got the supermarket aisle, you've got the last minute of sort of last-minute purchase items. There's two distinct things that are different. The first is that this is infrastructure we live by. This is your--this is when you talk about children waking up in the morning and you have autoplay you don't--that's not like the supermarket where I occasionally go there and I just made some purchases and I am at the very end of it and that is the one moment, the one little micro situation of deception or marketing which is okay, in this case we have children who are like spending 10 hours a day so imagine a supermarket you are spending 10 hours a day and you wake up in that supermarket and that is the degree of intimacy and sort of scope in our lives that is the first thing. </p><p>The second thing is the degree of asymmetry between the persuader and the persuade the. So in this case you've got somebody who knows a little bit more about marketing who is arranging the shelf space so that the things in the top bar at eye level versus at problem level, that is one very small amount of asymmetry but in the case of technology we have a supercomputer pointed at your brain meaning the Facebook newsfeed sitting there and using the vast resources of 2.7 billion people's behavior to calculate the perfect thing to show you next and to not be discriminate about whether it is good for you, whether it's true, whether it's trustworthy or whether it's credible and so it knows way more about your weaknesses than you know about yourself in the degree of asymmetry is far beyond anything we have experienced (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>CARTER: And you want the federal government to control that? </p><p>HARRIS: I think we have to ask questions about when there is that degree of asymmetry about intimate aspects of your weaknesses and its business model is to exploit that asymmetry. It is as if a psychotherapist who knows everything about your weaknesses uses it with a for-profit advertising business model. </p><p>HURWITZ: The challenges that can also go the other way. It can be used to a strength. Mr. Harris-- </p><p>CARTER: Yes, yes. </p><p>HURWITZ: Mr. Harris use the example earlier of what if autoplay is shifting us towards conspiracy theories? Okay, that is a dark pattern, that is bad. What if instead it was using us to shift us the other way to the light, to greater education? If we say autoplay is bad then we are taking both of those options off the table. This can be used for good and the question that you ask about how do we differentiate between good uses and bad that is the question. </p><p>CARTER: Thank you, Madam Chair. I yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: (INAUDIBLE) is recognized for five minutes. </p><p>CARDENAS: Thank you Madam Chair and thank you so much for holding this very important hearing that unfortunately I think most Americans don't understand how important this is to every single one of us especially to our children and future generations. </p><p>There is an app, TikTok? Is it a deep fake maker? Five days ago TechCrunch reported that ByteDance the parent company of the popular video sharing app TikTok may have secretly built a deep fake maker although there is no indication that TikTok intends to actually introduce this feature the prospect of deep fake technology being made available on such a massive scale and on a platform that is so popular with kids raises a number of troubling questions. So my question to you Mr. Harris is in your testimony you discussed at length a multitude of ways that children are harmed by new technology. Can you talk about why this news may be concerning? </p><p>HARRIS: Yes, thank you for the question. So deep weeks is a really complex issue. I think if you look at how other governments are responding to this don't mean to look at China for legal guidance but they see this as so threatening to their society the fabric of truth and trust in their society that if you post a deep fake without labeling it clearly as a deep fake you can actually go to jail. </p><p>So they are not thing if you post a deep fake you go to jail, they are saying if you post it without labeling it you go to jail. You can imagine a world where Facebook says if you post a deep fake without labeling it we actually maybe suspend your account for 24 hours so that you sort of feel and we label your account to other people who see your account. </p><p>CARDENAS: Hold on a second. My--my colleague on the other side of the aisle just warned quote and you want to have a government control this? You just gave an example of where private industry could in fact create deterrents-- </p><p>HARRIS: That's right. </p><p>CARDENAS: --to bad behavior. </p><p>HARRIS: They could (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>CARDENAS: Not the government but actual industry. Okay, go ahead. </p><p>HARRIS: So that's--that's right and so they--they can create and that's the point is instead of using the AI whack-a-mole (SP) approaches where the engineers at Facebook, how many engineers it Facebook speak the 22 languages of India? </p><p>And so, they--they can create--and that's the point, is instead of using these AI Whack A Mole approaches where the engineers at Facebook--how many engineers at Facebook speak the 22 languages of India, right, where there was an election last year?  </p><p>They're--they are controlling the information infrastructure not just for this country but for every country, and they don't speak the languages of the countries that they operate in, and they're automating that. And instead of trying to use AI where they're just missing everything going by--yes, they've made many investments. We should celebrate that. There's people working very hard. It's much better than it was before.  </p><p>But they have created a digital Frankenstein where there is far more content advertising variations of texts, lies, etc., than they have the capacity to deal with. And so, you can't create problems way beyond the scope of your ability to address them. It'd be like creating nuclear power plants everywhere with the risk of meltdown without actually having a plan for security. </p><p>CARDENAS: Now--now, getting back to your example where industry could, in fact--for example Facebook, could say we're going to suspend your account for 24 hours or something like that. With all due respect, in that example Facebook might lose a little bit of revenue as well as the person that they're trying to deter from bad action is likely going to lose revenue as well, correct? </p><p>HARRIS: That's correct, but maybe that's an acceptable cost given that we're talking about the total meltdown of trust. </p><p>CARDENAS: Yes, but maybe it--it's acceptable when you look at it intellectually and honestly. But when you look at it whether or not private industry is going to take it upon themselves to actually impact their shareholders' revenue, that's where government has a place and space to get involved and say proper actions and reactions need to be put in place so that people can understand that you can't and you shouldn't just look at this from a profit center motive. </p><p>HARRIS: That's right. </p><p>CARDENAS: Because in this world, sometimes the negative actions are more profitable for somebody out there than positive good actions. And the--and that's one of the things that's unfortunate. And you talk about languages around the world, but the number one target, in my opinion, for these bad actions for both financial gain and also the tearing down of the fabric of the democracy of the greatest nation on the planet, the United States, is the United States.  </p><p>We are the biggest target for various reasons. Two main reasons is because we're supposed to be the shining light on the hill for the rest of the world of what a good democracy should be like. And secondly, we are by far and away the largest economy and the biggest consumer group of folks on the planet. So, therefore, there is a motive for people to focus on the profit and focus on their negative bad intentions against our interest, the--the interests of the American people. Is that accurate? </p><p>HARRIS: That's--that's exactly right. And this is a national security--I see this as a long term--I mean, the polarization dynamics are--are accelerating towards Civil War level things, hashtag Civil War is coming.  </p><p>There's--our colleague, Renee DiResta (PH), says if you can make it trend, you can make it true when you're planting these suggestions and getting people to even think those thoughts, because you can manipulate the architecture. We're profiting--as I said, we are subsidizing our own self-destruction if the government doesn't say that these things can't just be profitable. </p><p>CARDENAS: Thank you to the witnesses. And thank you, Mr. Harris. I--I've run out of time. I wish I had more time. Thank you. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentleman yields back. And now I recognize Mr. Soto for five minutes. </p><p>SOTO: Thank you, Madam Chair. It's been my experience that a lie seems to be able to travel faster on the Internet than the speed of light, while the truth always goes at such a snail's pace. And I suppose that's because of the algorithms we see. </p><p>I want to start with deepfakes and cheap fakes. We know through New York Times Vi Sullivan (PH) that defamation of public figures require actual malice, and some of these just appear to be malicious on their face. I appreciate the labeling, Ms. Bickert, that Facebook is doing now. That's something that we actually were pondering in our office as well. But why wouldn't Facebook simply just take down the fake Pelosi video? </p><p>BICKERT: Thank you for the question. Our approach is to give people more information so that if something is going to be in the public discourse they will know how to assess it, how to contextualize it. That's why we work with the fact checkers. </p><p>I will say that in the past six months it's feedback from academics and--and civil society groups that has led us to come up with stronger warning screens. So-- </p><p>SOTO: --Would that be labeled under your current policy now as false, that video? </p><p>BICKERT: I'm sorry, which video? </p><p>SOTO: Would the fake Pelosi video be labeled as false under your new policy you just announced?  </p><p>BICKERT: Yes, and--and it--it was labeled false at the time. We did--we think we could have gone that to the fact checkers faster, and we think the label that we put on it could have been more clear. We now have the label for something that has been rated false. You have to click through it, so it actually obscures the image, and it's as false information and it says this is been rated false by fact checkers. You have to click through it and you see information from the fact checking source. </p><p>SOTO: Thanks. In 2016, there was a fake Trump rally put together by Russians in Florida, complete with Hillary Clinton in a prison and a fake Bill Clinton. Could a fake rally be created today through Facebook in the United States by the Russians under existing technology? </p><p>BICKERT: The network that created that was fake and inauthentic and we removed it. We were slow to find it. I think our enforcement has gotten a lot better. And as a data point for that, in 2016 we removed one such network. This past year, we removed more than 50 networks. Now, that's a global number, all over the world. But these are organizations that are using networks of accounts, some fake, some real, in an attempt to obscure who they are or to push false information. So-- </p><p>SOTO: --So, could happen again right now? </p><p>BICKERT: Our--our enforcement is not perfect. However, I am--we've made huge strides, and that is shown by the dramatic increase in the number of networks that we removed. And I will say that we do it not just by ourselves, but we work with security firms and academics who are studying this to make sure we're staying on top of it. </p><p>SOTO: What do you think Facebook's duty is, as well as other social media platforms, to prevent the spread of lies across the Internet? </p><p>BICKERT: I'm sorry. Could you repeat that? </p><p>SOTO: What do you think Facebook and other social platforms duty is to prevent the spread of lies across the Internet? </p><p>BICKERT: I can speak for Facebook. We think it's important for people to be able to connect safely and with authentic information. And my team is responsible for both. So, there is our approach to misinformation where we tried to get people--label content that is false and get them accurate information, and then there is everything that we also do to remove abusive content that violates our standards. </p><p>SOTO: Thank you, Ms. Bickert. Dr. Donovan, I saw you reacting to the fake Trump rally aspect. Could that still happen now under existing safeguards in social media? </p><p>DONOVAN: Yeah, and the reason why it can still happen is because of the--the platform's openness is now turning into a bit of a--a vulnerability for the rest of society. So, what's dangerous about events like that is--the kind of research we do, we are often trying to understand, well, what's happening online and what happens when the wires--the interaction between the wires and the weeds. When people start to be mobilized, start to show up places, that to us is one order of magnitude much more dangerous. </p><p>SOTO: What do you think we should be doing as government to help prevent something (OFF-MIC)? </p><p>DONOVAN: There is ways in which--I think when people are using particularly events features, group features, there has to be added transparency about who, what, when, where the--those--those events are being organized by. And there have been instances in Facebook very recently where they've added transparency pages, but it's not always clear who's behind what page and for what reason they're launching a protest. What's dangerous though is that actual constituents show up. Real people show up as--as fodder for this. And so we have to be really careful that they don't stage different parties like they did in Texas across the street from one another at the same time. And so we don't want to have, you know, manipulation that creates this serious problem for law enforcement as well as others in the area. </p><p>SOTO: Thanks. My time has expired. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: I now recognize Congresswoman Matsui for five minutes. </p><p>MATSUI: Thank you very much, Madam chair, and I really appreciate the witnesses here today upon--especially on this really important issue. I introduced the Blockchain Promotion Act with Congressman Guthrie to direct the Department of Commerce to convene a working group of stakeholders to develop a consensus-based definition a blockchain. Currently, there is no common definition, which has hindered its deployment.  </p><p>Blockchain technology could have interesting implications in the communications space, including new ways of identity unification. This technology is unique in that it can help distinguish between critical and non-credible news sources in a decentralized fashion rather than relying on one company or organization to serve as a sole gatekeeper. I would like, really, I have a lot of questions I'd like succinct answers to this. Ms. Donovan, do you see value in promoting impartial decentralized methods of identity verification as a tool to combat the spread and misinformation.  </p><p>DONOVAN: I think in limited cases, yes, especially around purchasing of advertising, which is allowing you to break out of your known networks and to reach other people, especially if those advertising features do allow you to target very specific groups. I'm interested in learning more about this consensus on definition because I also think it might help us understand what is a social media company, what are there--how do we define their broadcasted mechanisms, how do we define them related to the media--media company as well as the other kinds of products that they build, and I think it would also get us a lot further in understanding what it is we say when we say deep fakes or even AI. </p><p>MATSUI: Sure. Okay. That European Commission has recently announced that it would be supporting research to advance blockchain technology to support a more accurate online news environment. The entire panel, just a yes or no is sufficient, do you believe the U.S. should be keeping pace with Europe in the space? Yes or no? As far as blockchain, do you think that European Commission is supporting research to advance blockchain technology to support a more accurate, online news development? Do you believe that the U.S. should be keeping pace with Europe regarding this? </p><p>BICKERT: This is not my area. Generally, we think research (OFF-MIC) </p><p>MATSUI: Okay. Ms.--Dr. Donovan, I'd probably say you-- </p><p>DONOVAN: --Yeah, more research could help us understand this better. </p><p>MATSUI: Mr. Hurwitz, yes or no? </p><p>HURWITZ: Around the world, many are outpacing us in blockchain. </p><p>MATSUI: Okay. Mr. Harris? </p><p>HARRIS: It's not my area, but I know that China is working on a decentralized currency and could basically get all of the countries in which it's been getting them to their infrastructure with these huge belt and road plans. If they switch the global currency to their decentralized currency, that's a major national security threat and would change the entire world order. I think much more work has to be done to the U.S.--in the U.S. to protect against China gaining currency advantage and changing the world reserve currency. </p><p>MATSUI: Thank you. It's an undisputed fact reaffirmed by America's intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in our 2016 and '18 elections through targeted and prolonged online campaigns. We know that Russia is ramping up for 2020 and the American voters are at once will once again be exposed to new lies, falsehoods, and misinformation designed to so division in our democratic process.  </p><p>While I was glad to see that recent funding bill included $425 million in election security grants, this is only part of a much larger solution to protect the most fundamental function of our democracy. Social media companies need to take clear, forceful action against foreign attempts to interfere with our elections. Mr. Harris, how have the various election interference strategies evolved from the 2016 and 2018 election cycles? </p><p>HARRIS: You know, I'm actually not an expert on exactly what Russia is doing now. What I'll say is I think that we need a mass public awareness campaign to inoculate the public. Think of it as like a cultural vaccine. There's actually precedent in the United States for this. So back in the 1940s, we had the Committee for National Morale and the Institute for Propaganda Analysis that actually did a domestic awareness campaign about the threat of fascist propaganda.  </p><p>You've probably seen the videos from, they're black-and-white, from 1947. It was called don't be a sucker. They had us looking at a guy spouting fascist propaganda and someone is starting to not and then the guy taps him on the shoulder and says now son, that's fascist propaganda and here's how to spot it. We actually saw this as a deep threat, a national security threat to our country. We could have another mass public awareness campaign now and we can have the help of the technology companies to collectively use their distribution to distribute that inoculation campaign so everybody actually knew the threat of the problem. </p><p>MATSUI: Does the rest of the panel agree with Mr. Harris on this, to have this public awareness campaign? </p><p>HURWITZ: Broadly, I'll just note that it runs the risk of being called a dark pattern if the platforms are starting to label certain content in certain ways, so there's a cross current of our discussion to note there. </p><p>MATSUI: Okay well, we don't count any solutions now. I appreciate it and I run out of time. Thank you very much. </p><p>BICKERT: Congresswoman, I would--I would just point to the ads library that we have put in place over the past few years, which has really brought an unprecedented level of openness to political advertising so people can now see who is behind an ad, who paid for it, and we verify the end of identity of those advertisers. </p><p>MATSUI: It might be difficult for most people out there to really do that, you know, unless it's right in front of them. So but I'm glad that that's happening, but I think we should have much more exposure about this. Thank you. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: I now recognize Mr. McNerney for five minutes. </p><p>MCNERNEY: Well, I think the chair and I think the witnesses. Your testimonies have been very helpful and I appreciate it. But I have to say, with big power, comes a big responsibility and I'm disappointed, in my opinion, that Facebook hasn't really stepped up to that responsibility.  </p><p>Back in June, I sent a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg and I was joined by nearly all the Democrats on the committee. In this letter, we noted that we are concerned about the potential conflict of interest between Facebook's bottom line and addressing misinformation on its platform. Six month later, I remain very concerned that Facebook is putting its bottom line ahead of addressing this information. </p><p>Ms. Bickert, Facebook's content monetization policy--monetization policy states that content that depicts or discusses subjects in the following categories may face reduced or restricted monetization and misinformation is included in the list. It's troubling that your policy doesn't simply ban misinformation. Do you think there are cases where misinformation can and should be monetized? Please answer yes or no. </p><p>BICKERT: Congressman, no. If we see somebody that is intentionally sharing this information, and we make this clear in our policies, they will lose the ability to monetize. </p><p>MCNERNEY: Okay, well that sounds different from what's in your company's stated policy. But the response I received from Facebook to my letter failed to answer many of my questions. For example, I asked the following question that was left unanswered and I'd like to give you a chance to answer it today. How many project managers this Facebook employee whose full-time job it is to address misinformation? </p><p>BICKERT: Congressman, I don't have a number of PMs. I can tell you that across my team, our engineering teams, and our content review teams, this is something that's a priority. Building that network of the relationships with more than 50 fact checking organizations is something that has taken the efforts of a number of teams across the company. </p><p>MCNERNEY: Does that include software engineers? </p><p>BICKERT: It does because there's--for all of--for any of these programs, you need to have an infrastructure that can help recognize when something might be misinformation, allow people to report when something might be in misinformation, get things over to the fact checking organizations-- </p><p>MCNERNEY: --So I'm going to ask you to provide that information. How many full-time employees, including software in the engineers, are employed in that--in--are identifying this information. </p><p>BICKERT: We're happy to try to follow-up and answer. </p><p>MCNERNEY: Another question that was left unanswered is on average from time--from the time of content that's posted on Facebook's platform, how long does it take for Facebook to flag suspicious content to third-party fast checkers--third-party fact checkers to review the content and Facebook to take remedial action once the content--when the review is completed? </p><p>BICKERT: Congressman, the answer depends. This could happen very quickly. We actually allow fact checking organizations to proactively rate content they see on Facebook. So they-- </p><p>MCNERNEY: --Do you think that will be fast enough to keep deep fakes from going viral or other misinformation from going viral? </p><p>BICKERT: If they rate something proactively, then it happens instantly. And we also use technology and user reporting to flag content to them and we often see that they will rate it very quickly. </p><p>MCNERNEY: Well, I'm moving on. I'm very concerned that Facebook is not prepared to address the misinformation on its platform in advance of--in advance of this year's election. Will you commit to having a third-party audit conducted by June 1 of Facebook's practices for combating the spread of misinformation on its platform and for the results of this audit to be made available to the public? </p><p>[*]BICKERT: Congressman, we're very happy to answer any questions about how we do what we do. We think transparency, it is important, and we are happy to follow up with any suggestions that you have. </p><p>MCNERNEY: We--we would--I would request a third-party audit. I'm not--I'm not talking the--the civil serve--civil rights audit, an independent third-party audit to be conducted at Facebook by June 1st.  </p><p>BICKERT: Congressman, again, we're a very transparent about what our policies and practices are, and we are happy to follow up with any specific suggestions. </p><p>MCNERNEY: Mr. Harris?  </p><p>HARRIS: I'm a just going to say their third-party fact checking services are massively understaffed, underfunded, and a lot of people are dropping out of the program. And the amount of information flowing through that channel is far beyond their capacity to respond. More or less, fact checking isn't even really the--the relevant issue. </p><p>I think if you look at the clearest evidence of this is a Facebook's own employees wrote a letter to Mark Zuckerberg saying you are undermining our election integrity efforts with your current political ads policy. That says it all to me. And that letter was leaked to the New York Times about a month ago.  </p><p>I think that those people, because they're closest to the problem, they do the research queries, they understand how bad the issue is--look, we're on the outside. We don't actually know. It's almost like they're Exxon but they also own the satellites that would show us how much pollution there is. So, we don't actually know in the outside, so all we can do is trust people like that on the inside that are saying this is far less than what we would like to do, and they still have not updated their policy. </p><p>MCNERNEY: All right. Thank you. I'll yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: I recognize Congresswoman Dingell for five minutes for questions. </p><p>DINGELL: Thank you, Madam Chair. And thank all of you for being here today. This is a subject that really matters to me like it does all of us. But in the past, we've treated what little protections people have online as something that's a separate from those we have in our day-to-day lives offline. </p><p>But the line between what happens online and offline is virtually nonexistent. Gone are the days when we can separate one from the other. Millions of Americans have been affected by data breaches and privacy abuses. The numbers are so large that you can even wrap your head around them. </p><p>I mean, I've talked to members here and they don't even at times understand what has happened or how people have collected data about us. The resources to help folks protect themselves after the fact are desperately needed. But what's really happening is that the cost of failure to protect sensitive information is being pushed on millions of people who are being breached and not trying to do anything. </p><p>It's a market externality, and that's where the government, I believe, must step in. If you go to the pharmacy to fill a sub--prescription, you assume that the medicine you're going to get is going to be not--it's going to be safe. It's not going to kill you. If you go outside, you assume that the air you breathe, you assume, is going to be safe or we're trying to make it that way.  </p><p>And that's because we have laws that protect people from a long list of known market externalities, and the burden is in place on their ability to find out is the medicine you're taking okay, safe, and is the air you're breathing clean? We're still working on that, but it's one we've identified. This shouldn't be any different from marks--market externalities that are digital.  </p><p>So, Ms. Bickert, I will--I have sent a letter to Facebook today which has a lot of questions that didn't lend themselves to answer here, so I hope that they will be answered. But I'd like to get yes or no answers from the panel on the following questions. And I'm going to start this way with that Mr. Harris because we always start with you, Ms. Bickert, and we'll give you a little--and thank you for being here even though you're sick. </p><p>Do you believe that the selling of real time cell phone location without user's consent constitutes a market externality? Mr. Harris? </p><p>HARRIS: I don't know with that specific one, but the entire surveillance capitalism system produces vast harms that are all on the balance sheets of societies, whether that's the mental health of children, the manipulation of--of elections, the breakdown of polarizations. That'd be-- </p><p>DINGELL: --But it's a market externality? </p><p>HARRIS: It's absolutely all market externality.  </p><p>DINGELL: Okay. Let's go down--Mr. Hurwitz?  </p><p>HURWITZ: Based on the economic definition of an externality, no, it is not. However, it can be problematic. </p><p>DINGELL: Dr. Donovan? </p><p>DONOVAN: In line with Gus. </p><p>DINGELL: Ms. Bickert? </p><p>BICKERT: I'm not an economist, but we do think user consent is very important. </p><p>DINGELL: Do you--well, second question, yes or noes. Do you believe that having 400 million pieces of personally identifiable information made public, including passport numbers, names, addresses, and payment information is a market externality? Mr. Harris? </p><p>HARRIS: Similarly, on sort of the classic economic definition, I don't know if that would specifically qualify. But it's deeply alarming. </p><p>HURWITZ: Same answer. </p><p>DONOVAN: Agreed.  </p><p>BICKERT: Same answer.  </p><p>DINGELL: So, are you all agreeing with Mr. Harris? </p><p>HURWITZ: Same answer as I gave previously. It's not the-- </p><p>DINGELL: --I just wanted to-- </p><p>HURWITZ: --technical economic definition-- </p><p>DINGELL: --see if we had gotten you to understand what a bother it is. </p><p>Three, do you believe that having 148 million individuals' personally identifiable information, including credit card numbers, driver's license, and Social Security numbers made public is a market externality? Mr. Harris? </p><p>HARRIS: I can see it sort of like an oil spill externality. </p><p>DINGELL: Mr. Hurwitz? </p><p>HURWITZ: The same answer.  </p><p>DINGELL: So, you don't think it's a problem? </p><p>HURWITZ: I don't--I don't not think it's a problem. I wouldn't categorize it as an externality and use it as a just--that's-- </p><p>DINGELL: --So, you don't think we've got to protect people from that? </p><p>HURWITZ: No, that's not what I'm saying. I--I have an economics background. I rely on a more technical definition of an externality. </p><p>DINGELL: Dr. Donovan? </p><p>DONOVAN: It's an incredibly important problem. </p><p>DINGELL: Ms. Bickert? </p><p>BICKERT: Yes, I would echo Dr. Donovan.  </p><p>DINGELL: Do you believe that having the data of 87 million users taken and used for nefarious political purposes is a market externality? Mr. Harris? </p><p>HARRIS: I think it's the same answer as before.  </p><p>DINGELL: Yep. </p><p>HARRIS: It's--it's causing-- </p><p>HURWITZ: --If I break into your house and steal your stuff and sell it on the black market, that is not an externality. However, it is a problem. </p><p>DINGELL: Dr. Donovan? </p><p>DONOVAN: Well, I wouldn't characterize it as a break-in. It was facilitated by the features built into the platform, and I--it's a huge problem. </p><p>DINGELL: Thank you. Ms. Bickert? </p><p>BICKERT: Again, we think that user control and consent is very important. </p><p>DINGELL: Okay. I'm going to do the last question. I'm out of time, so you're going to have to be fast. And finally, do you believe that simply asking whoever took it to please delete it is an appropriate response? Mr. Harris? </p><p>HARRIS: It's very hard to enforce that. And the--the--once the data is out there, it's distributed everywhere. </p><p>DINGELL: And for the--yeah.  </p><p>HARRIS: So, we have to live in a world where now we assume that this is just out there.   </p><p>DINGELL: It's out there.  </p><p>HURWITZ: You need to solve the problem on the front end.  </p><p>DINGELL: Dr. Donovan? </p><p>DONOVAN: That never should have been allowed in the first place. </p><p>DINGELL: Ms. Bickert? </p><p>BICKERT: Again, we think that it is very important to give people control over their data, and we're doing our best to make sure that we are doing that. </p><p>DINGELL: So, I'm out of time, but thank you, Madam Chair. </p><p>BLUNT ROCHESTER: Thank you. The gentlewoman yields and I recognize myself for five minutes. Thank you to the chairwoman in her absence, and thank you to the panelists. This is a vitally important conversation that we're having. </p><p>(INAUDIBLE) is outpacing policy and the people and so we are feeling the impacts in our mental health, we are feeling it in our economy, we are feeling it in our form of government and so this is a very important conversation and I would like to start with a few questions that are kind of off of the dark patterns and those issues that really do deal with the idea of deceptive and manipulative practices and it is just a basic question, it is a yes or no are the--and--and it is really surrounding the platforms that we have and the ability for people with disabilities to use them. Our each of you or any of you familiar with the term universal design and I will just ask Mr. Harris? </p><p>HARRIS: Vaguely, yes. </p><p>BLUNT ROCHESTER: Mr. Hurwitz? </p><p>HURWITZ: Vaguely, yes. </p><p>DONOVAN: Yes. </p><p>BICKERT: Vaguely, yes. </p><p>BLUNT ROCHESTER: Vaguely, okay so there were a lot of vaguely's and I don't have time to really talk about what universal design is but I think as we look at how people are treated in our society universal design and looking at people with disabilities is one of the areas that I would like to follow up with each of you on. </p><p>I would now like to turn my time to a discussion about dark patterns and every single member of Congress and every one of our constituents is virtually everyone has been affected by this in some respect every day whether it's giving up our location data or manipulated into purchasing products that they don't need or providing sensitive information that enables scams, many of us are targeted and while the failure to address dark patterns harms individuals one of the areas that is of deeper concern to me is the challenge for us as a society as a whole. </p><p>Cambridge Analytic, that scandal in and of itself was a great example for all of us of it wasn't just an individual that was harmed, it was our society and we see some of the remnants of it to this day and so I--I heard someone say to me yesterday that they hoped that this hearing was not just a hearing but a real wake-up call, a wake-up call to our country and so my first question is to Mr. Harris. Do you believe that oversight of dark patterns and the other deceptive and manipulative practices discussed here are well suited for industry self-regulation? </p><p>HARRIS: No, absolutely not. </p><p>BLUNT ROCHESTER: And I would like to follow up with Ms. Bickert. Does Facebook have a responsibility to develop user interfaces that are transparent and fair to its users? </p><p>BICKERT: We definitely want that and--and yes I think we are working on new ways to be transparent all of the time. </p><p>BLUNT ROCHESTER: Does Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act provide immunities to Facebook over these issues? </p><p>BICKERT: Section 230 is an important part of my team being able to do what we do so yes, it gives us the ability to proactively look for abuse and remove it. </p><p>BLUNT ROCHESTER: But--but does it provide immunities you would say yes? </p><p>BICKERT: I'm sorry what's--what is the specific--section 230 does provide us certain protections the most important from my standpoint is the ability for us to go after abuse on our platform but separately it is also an important mechanism for people who use the Internet to be able to post to platforms like Facebook. </p><p>BLUNT ROCHESTER: I guess one of my concerns here for asking that question is we are having a big conversation about the balance of freedom of speech in addition to the ability for people to yell fire in a crowded place and so I'm going to turn back to Mr. Harris. How do you think that we in Congress can develop a more agile and responsive response to the concerning trends on the Internet? You mentioned a digital update of federal agencies. Can you talk a little bit about that as well? </p><p>HARRIS: Just as you said that the problem here is we have--this is EO Wilson(SP) the problem of humanity is we have Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions and accelerating godlike technology. When your steering wheel goes about a light year behind your accelerating godlike technology the system crashes. So the whole point is we have to give digital update to some of the existing institutions health and human services, FCC, FTC. </p><p>You can imagine every category of society and saying where do we already have jurisdiction about each of these areas and asked them to come up with a plan for what their digital update is going to be and put the tech companies in a direct relationship where every quarter there is an audit and there is a set of actions that are going to be taken to--to ameliorate these harms. That is the only way I can see this scaling this absent creating a whole new digital federal agency which will be you know way too late for these issues. </p><p>BLUNT ROCHESTER: I--I know I am running out of time but my other question really was going to be Ms. Bickert on the role that you see of government. I think we are having a lot of conversations here about freedom of speech and also the role of government and so as a follow-up I would like to have a conversation with you about what you see as the--that role of government versus self-regulation and how we can make something happen here. </p><p>The bigger concern is for us to make sure that we are looking at this both as an individual level but also as a society and I yield my time and recognize the gentlewoman from New York Ms. Clarke. </p><p>CLARKE: I thank you very much Madam Chair and I think our ranking members. I think our panelists for their expert witness here today. </p><p>Deep fakes currently pose a significant and unprecedented threat. Now more than ever we need to prepare for the possibility that foreign adversaries will use deep fakes to spread this information and interfere in our election which is why I have successfully secured language in the NDAA requiring notification be given to Congress if Russia or China seek to do exactly this. </p><p>But deep fakes has been and will be used to harm individual Americans. We have already seen instances of women's images being superimposed on pornographic videos and these tools become more affordable and accessible excuse me as these tools become more affordable and accessible we can expect deep fakes to be used to influence financial markets, discredit dissidents and even insight violence. </p><p>That is why I have introduced the first house bill to address this threat, the deep fakes accountability act which requires creators to label deep fakes as altered content, updates our identity theft statutes for digital impersonation and requires cooperation between the government and private sector to develop detection technologies.  </p><p>I am now working on a second bill to specifically address how online platforms deal with deep fate content. So Dr. Donovan cheap fakes, we have often talked about deep fakes where the technology footprint of the content has changed but can you talk a bit more about the national security implications of cheap fakes such as the Pelosi video which--where footage is simply altered instead of entirely fabricated? </p><p>DONOVAN: One of the most effective political uses of a cheap fake is to draw attention and shift the entire media narrative towards false claim and so particularly what we saw last week with the Biden video was concerning because you have hundreds of newsrooms kick into gear to dispute something, a video and platforms have allowed it to scale to a level where the public is curious and are looking for that content and then are also coming into contact with other nefarious actors and networks and so-- </p><p>CLARKE: What would you say can be done by government to counteract the threat? </p><p>DONOVAN: There--there has to be I think you are moving very much in the direction I would go to where we need to have some labels, we need to understand the identity threat that it poses and that there needs to be broader cooperation between governments. As well I think that the cost to journalism is very high because all of the energy and resources that go into tracking, mapping and getting you know getting public information out there I think the platform companies can do a much better job of preventing that harm up front by looking at content when it does seem to go wildly out of scale with the usual activity of an account and to--to proactively look at things where if you do see an uptick of 500,000 views on something may be there needs to be proactive content moderation. </p><p>CLARKE: Very well. Ms. Bickert, Facebook is a founding member of the deep fake technology challenge but detection is only partially technologic--a technology issue. We also need to have a definition of what fake is and a policy for which kinds of fake videos are actually acceptable. One of the--one of the things that I did was excuse me last summer you informed Congress that Facebook is working on a precise definition for what constitutes a deep fake excuse me. Can you update us on those efforts especially in light of your announcement yesterday? And specific--specifically how do you intend to differentiate between legitimate deep fakes such as those created by Hollywood for entertainment and malicious ones? </p><p>BICKERT: Thank you for the question. The policy that we put out yesterday is designed to address the most sophisticated types of manipulated media and this fits within the definition of what many academics would call deep fakes so that we can remove it. </p><p>Now beyond that we do think it is useful to work with others in industry and civil society and academia to actually have common definition so we are all talking about the same thing and those are conversations that we have been a part of in the past six months. We will continue to be a part of those and we are hoping that working together with industry and other stakeholders we will be able to come up with comprehensive definitions. </p><p>CLARKE: Should the intent of the deep fake or rather its subject matter be the focus? </p><p>BICKERT: I'm sorry. Could you repeat that? </p><p>CLARKE: Should the intent of the deep fake or the subject matter be the focus? </p><p>BICKERT: From our standpoint it is often difficult to tell intent when we are talking about many different types of abuse but--but also specifically with deep fakes or misinformation and that is why if you look at our policy definition it doesn't focus on intent so much as what the effect would be on the viewer. </p><p>CLARKE: Thank you very much. I yield back. Thank you Madam Chair for allowing my participation today. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Let's see. Where am I? That--that concludes the questioning. I have things I am going to put into the record and maybe the ranking member does as well but I did want to make can ending comment and I would welcome her to do the same if she wishes. </p><p>So we--we had a discussion that took us to the grocery store but we are now in a new world that we are discussing that is hugely bigger. When we talk about Facebook and as you say in your testimony Facebook is a community of more than 2 billion people spanning countries, cultures and languages across the globe but I think that there is now such an incredible and justified distrust of how we are being protected we know in the physical world we do have laws that apply and that expectations of consumers are that those will be somehow there to protect us but in fact they aren't. </p><p>We live then in the virtual world in the digital world and a place of self-regulation and it seems to me that that has not satisfied expectations of consumers correctly and we don't have institutions right now even when they have the authorities have the funding, have the expertise, I am thinking of the Federal Trade Commission just as an example to do what it needs to do. But we don't have a regulatory framework at all to that I think hopefully in a bipartisan way we can think about and it may include things like just the kinds of audits that you were talking about Mr. Harris which would not necessarily create new regulatory laws but made--but we may need to. And to me that is the big take away today when--when you have communities that are bigger than any country in the entire world that are essentially making decisions for all of the--the rest of us. And we know that we've been victimized, that the government of the United States of America does need to respond. That's a--that's my take away from--fro</p><p>m this hearing. And I--I appreciate hearing from the ranking member. </p><p>MCMORRIS RODGERS: Well, I thank--I thank the chair, and I thank everyone for being here. I think it is important that we all become more educated. I wanted to bring to everyone's attention that the FTC is holding a hearing on January 28th regarding voice cloning. </p><p>I think that it is a--it is important that all of us are participating, becoming better educated, and helping make sure that we are taking steps as we move forward. Clearly, this is a new era. And in one hand, we can celebrate that America has led the world in innovation and technology and improving our lives in many ways. There's also this other side that we need to be looking at and making sure that we are taking the appropriate steps to keep people safe and secure. </p><p>So, we will--we'll continue this important discussion and continue to become better educated. Today's hearing was a great part of that. Thank you, chair. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you very much. I would like to insert into the--the--the record the--I seek unanimous consent to enter the following documents into the record; a letter from the SAG AFTRA, a letter from Our Street, a paper written by Jeffrey Wesling (PH) of the Our Street Institute, a report from the ATRA Project on Facebook. And so I seek unanimous consent. Without objection, then so ordered.  </p><p>And so, let me thank our--all of our witnesses today. We had good participation from members despite the fact that there were other hearings going on. I remind members that pursuant to committee rules they have 10 business days to submit additional questions for the record to the--to be answered by the witnesses, and hopefully in a reasonably short--short time. I hope that there will be prompt answers.  </p><p>And at this time, the subcommittee is adjourned. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y07-4MT1-F15W-H2F5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

And today we will be holding a hearing entitled Mainstreaming Extremism: Social Media's Role in Radicalizing America.  And due to the COVID-19 public health emergency--What am I on? Okay--emergency today's hearing is being held remotely. All members and witnesses will be participating via video, via video conference.  </p><p>As part of our hearing microphones will be set on mute for the purpose of eliminating inadvertent background noise, which I'm often guilty of. Members and witnesses, you will need to unmute your microphone each time that you wish to speak. Additionally, members will need to be visible on the screen in order to be recognized. If we don't see, if you you're not there, then you will not be able to be called upon. </p><p>Documents for the record can be sent to Chloe Rodriguez at the--at--at the email address that we've provided to staff. All documents will be entered into the record at the conclusion of the hearing. So now, member opening statements will be held and I will recognize myself for five minutes. So good morning, and I want to thank everybody for joining us today for a virtual hearing on social media's role in spreading extremism.  </p><p>Throughout our nation's history we have seen extremism undermine public faith in our institutions, incite violence, sow division and spread hate speech. Whether it be the Ku Klux Klan or Neo-Nazis or bullying of vulnerable individuals, these attacks are not new to Americans but what is different today is the way that social media algorithms can amplify hate speech.  </p><p>Despite--despite the many conveniences and benefits for communication, our over time social medias dark side has grown and divided Americans at a time when we really need to pull together. As big tech develop the online ecosystem, and monetized its functions to their enormous benefit, these companies have done little really to protect Americans from the dangers that are lurking in the dark corners. Driven by profit and power and in the face of obvious harm these mega companies successfully have convinced governments all over the world to essentially leave them alone, lest we disturb the delicate garden that they are tending to.  </p><p>Big tech has helped by nations and has stoked genocide in others--in our nation and stoked genocide. Consider Myanmar, where we saw mass murder of the Rohingya people and these companies have profited at every turn.  Consider the QAnon conspiracy theory that has thrived online for years now. Q followers believe that the entire world is controlled by a secret cabal of child abusers who will eventually drink the blood of victims. The FBI has linked the group to domestic terror and considers it a continuing terrorism threat.  </p><p>I would like to commend our colleagues, Adam Kinzinger, Tom, Malinowski, and Denver Riggleman for confronting this threat head on. There is no doubt that--that controversy and extremism drives engagement and therefore profit. Algorithms that amplify extremist views also--also amplify profit for these platforms. A 9/11 conspiracy video has been seen 22 million times on Facebook in the last week. Each view keeps eyeballs on the platform and dollars rolling in.  </p><p>Nowhere has Facebook been more negligent than in its oversight of its group function. Facebook--Facebook groups promoting misogyny have grown by 10 percent, and anti-LGBT groups have grown by 22 percent, and groups promoting antisemitism have grown by 27 percent in the last week. In a recent interview with an engineer at--at Facebook he said that the group recommendation algorithm is quote, \"The scariest feature of the platform, the darkest--the darkest manifestation.\" And then he went on further to say a user entering one of the groups, and Facebook essentially pigeonholes them into a lifestyle they can never really get out of.\" </p><p>I wanted to let you know that next week I will be circulating a draft legislated proposal that aims to fundamentally alter these companies business models and give consumers and regulators the--the recourse when these companies fail in their basic commitments--in their stated basic commitments to consumers. And I certainly hope all of you will take a close look at that.  </p><p>I want to, at this point, thank the witnesses for their testimony and recognize for five minutes, the ranking member, Cathy Rodgers, and you have five minutes. Thank you. </p><p>RODGERS: Thank you, Madam Chair. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our hearing focused on social media. </p><p>As with any disruptive technology, the internet certainly has its faults, especially when platforms are used to cause real harm, especially if companies are not fulfilling their responsibilities. However, I hope we all recognize how the internet is still an overwhelming force for good, especially in these challenging times. It gives Americans a platform for their voices to be heard, it keeps us connected to our loved ones, it offers unprecedented access to information and unlimited opportunities for innovation.  So I appreciate our witnesses for being here today to share how we can all strive for a better and safer internet for all.  </p><p>Freedom of speech is central to American democracy. It's what sets us apart from nearly every other nation on Earth and yet this bedrock principle is increasingly under attack. Free speech is not absolute and there are certainly exceptions, like when it comes to physically harming others or oneself. However, I am extremely concerned when platforms apply inconsistent content moderating policies for their own purposes, whether as an excuse to take responsibility for failing to enforce content standards fairly or by altering speech to settle scores with political or competitive opponents.  </p><p>There's no clear example of a platform using its power for political purposes, then Twitter, singling out President Trump while also leaving blatant threats of violence by activists Democratic candidates and authoritarian foreign leaders untouched. Twitter's rules say that they are intended to ensure all people can participate in public conversation freely and safely but that's not what we are seeing. To further its leadership's political agenda, Twitter has instead embraced an inconsistent application of its own standards.  </p><p>For political speech we disagree with the answer should not be censorship, the answer should always be more speech. And for harmful speech it should be removed, regardless of the political leanings of the speaker or the moderator. Sadly, Twitter has fallen well short in encouraging healthy discourse online. For example, the following are--are blue check-mark tweets and accounts that exist on Twitter today. Unlike President Trump, they haven't been fact checked or tagged for violation of standards by at Jack (SP). The World Health Organization shared this propaganda from the CCP, \"Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human to human transmission of the novel  hashtag coronavirus.\" That's false. </p><p>Another example, as a well known online activists of the left, who is repeatedly doxed and falsely accused innocent people of heinous crimes, like falsely accusing a Texas State Trooper of rape, he also accused an innocent man of murdering a 7-year-old girl, death threats were also sent to the man's family and he ultimately took his own life. This online activists also used Twitter to threaten the lives of innocent police officers in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Twitter said this didn't violate their standards.  </p><p>This tweet is word for word from a candidate challenging Republican Congressman Brian Mast. She tweeted, \"Is that really the new rule we want, killing is okay if it's a--a bad guy? It's now open season on Trump, Barr, Kavanaugh, Pompeo.\" Can you imagine if the president or any Republican said that about Democrats? My only hope is that the Secret Service took this threat more seriously than Jack. These are only a few examples of blatant hypocrisy by Twitter. Bottom line, Twitter continues to tag the president's tweets with increased frequency as we approach the election but they've ignored violent threats against Republicans, allowed for propaganda pushed by the Chinese Communist Party, tolerated doxing, and the incitement of violence against police officers, and also let clear threats by the Supreme Leader of Iran go on challenged.  </p><p>This doesn't add up and it doesn't build trust in the fair enforcement of--of Twitter's content standards. It begs the question, what's the point of their terms of service and content policies if Jack is intentionally applying them differently depending upon who the user is? Is Twitter a fair and safe platform for free speech and the battle of ideas or a platform were content bias is acceptable as--as long as it influences the election in favor of the political whims of the woke mob? </p><p>If the majority is truly concerned about platforms having an effect on the upcoming election I hope that they will join me in demanding accountability from this platform that is blatantly putting its thumb on the scale for one side over the other. And I yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentlelady yields back and now the chair of the full committee is recognized, Mr. Pallone for five minutes.  </p><p>PALLONE: Thank you, Chairman Schakowsky.  </p><p>Extremists who sow chaos and division, incite violence and impose their radical beliefs and ideologies remain an ever present threat to our welfare, society and way of life in the U.S. and the magnitude of that threat has become painfully clear in recent years. Eleven worshippers massacred in a rampage at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. More than 46 shoppers killed or injured in a mass shooting targeting so-called Mexicans at a shopping center in El Paso. Nine black worshippers murdered by a white supremacist during a Bible study in Charleston. Two killed and wounded by a vigilante shooter in Kenosha, Wisconsin.  </p><p>Extremists are even exploiting COVID-19 to divide our nation and the time of crisis. According to the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness in March, a New Jersey white supremacist group altered its propaganda and social media posts to falsely claim that immigration and Jewish people are behind the pandemic. Their members have since attended anti-lock-down events to push these egregiously false claims.  </p><p>So there's just a lot of anger and resentment across this country. Only last night we saw pleas for justice in the Brianna Taylor case left unanswered by the judicial system and this led to violence in the streets, including the shooting of two police officers. And such violence is obviously unacceptable. We have to work to promote civility and unity. The right to peacefully assemble and seek redress from the government is a constitutional right but I fear that extremists online and in the streets are taking advantage of these turbulent times to divide our nation and threaten its people.  </p><p>Acts of violence, disruption and misinformation represent a troubling trend of increasing extremist activity across the country. Four of the six most deadly years for domestic extremist killings have occurred since 2015. And experts warn that current political and social polarization coupled with increasing economic disparity are ideal conditions for even further increases in extremism.  </p><p>Now, while extremism is not new methods for indoctrination, radicalizing and mobilizing individuals have evolved over the past decade. The internet, an efficient tool for the dissemination of hate and radical ideologies traditionally left in the fringes of society, has become the predominant incubator for extremism. And social media platforms have served as the predominant outlet for bigotry, conspiracy theories and incitements to violence.  </p><p>Social media companies represent their platforms as forms for connecting people but the ability to connect like-minded people and the--and--and susceptible individuals is being exploited by extremists to recruit and radicalize Americans.  </p><p>Now, we have seen too many stories of young people, many of whom are socially and physically isolated, who found a sense of belonging with people who turn out to be members of a hate group. They get lured by gradually more extreme content and then risk the threat of losing these new social connections if they do not conform and conforming too often includes taking part in acts of hatred, intimidation, even violence.  </p><p>This is deeply concerning and this activity is magnified by social media's business model, which only makes the problem worse. The primary goal of social media platforms is gaining more active users. Their profitability depends on growth and engagement, more eyes on their pages for longer periods of time to more advertising dollars. And as research has shown, lies outreach and novelty a more engaging and neutral bland content.  </p><p>It's not that employees at these companies make a conscious choice to allow this hateful content but their algorithms are programmed to optimize growth of engagement, often without consideration of the content that achieves it. And these algorithms don't just let harmful content exist on the platform, they actually amplify it. The delusion of harmful content drowns out counter-messaging, content that could correct misinformation, and discredit the ideologies and actions of violent extremists. Because people are already overwhelmed, it's clear that this bad speech--speech cannot be connected solely with more speech.  </p><p>Rather than acknowledge and tackle the root of the problems social media companies address only the public relations aspect. They rely heavily on user reporting to address extremist content, allowing this information and inciting content to be viewed thousands of times before it's flagged to remove.  </p><p>What's more, there's no doubt that some political figures are fanning the flames of extremism. This toxic political rancor is contributing to the rise of right wing extremists in particular, which has become the greatest terrorist threat facing our nation today. The majority of all terrorist incidents in the U.S. since 1994 were committed by right wing extremists.  So we've had several hearings over the past few years trying to shine light on these problems and imploring social media companies to act. It's clear they don't want to do it on their own so I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about their experiences and their ideas for how Congress can make a difference.  </p><p>I have no doubt, Madam Chair, that we have to have. This is not going to correct itself on its own. So thank you for having the hearing. And I yield back to the chairwoman. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentleman yields back.  </p><p>And now, it is my pleasure to recognize Mr. Walden, the ranking member of the full committee, for five minutes for his opening statement.  </p><p>WALDEN: Well, good morning, Madam Chair and Mr. Chairman. Thanks for having this hearing. I really want to welcome our witnesses to--to learn your perspectives and hear your experience.  </p><p>My colleagues have heard me say a few times over the years I've been on the committee, I have a degree in journalism, was in the radio business for more than two decades, and I think it's given me an--an important perspective on free speech and our liberties at guaranteed in the Constitution. It's also provided important perspectives on the responsibilities that platforms have to ensure voices can be heard.  I've said before, it--it feels like social media is--has really become a cancer on civility and I--think all sides can probably agree on that. The challenge is what do we do about it while protecting our first amendment rights?  </p><p>You can learn a lot from history. In fact, if you think back to radio 1938, Orson Welles had that radio program that inspired panic and dramatizing a Martian invasion with an adaptation of HG Wells' novel, The War of the Worlds. Despite notices that it was fiction, people still believed it was real at the time and it set off a furor.  </p><p>Unfortunately, in today's social media age furor set off by misinformation has become all too common. It spreads more quickly and further and it's often harder to recognize. In fact, this year following the tragic death, the murder of George Floyd in May, Washington, D.C. experienced its own strange occurrence online. With no disclosure, it was fictional content. Under a hashtag at D.C. Blackout that went viral on Twitter claims were made but the internet service and gone down by no legitimate news sources corroborating that information. That viral campaign went unfettered on Twitter for hours and spread the platforms.  </p><p>To quote The Washington Post, \"The thread's filled with untrue claims that authorities had somehow blocked protesters from communicating from their smartphones to crack down on the unrest, which included looting and some fires.\" It's included images of Washington burning, images we would learn later were from a television show, not from real life.  </p><p>During this event, we now know that were fake and hijack accounts involved with the misinformation campaign around the events in Washington. And despite its ability to quickly spot trends for its own political purposes, as well as suspect--suspect activity in account, it concerns me that Twitter was not able to fully spot this misinformation platform.  People of every ethnicity, age, gender, and religion are harmed when these events escalate and bad actors look to turn peaceful protest into violent riots. The platform (INAUDIBLE) they must do better and support their users to share publicly how they plan to do that.  </p><p>In fact, Chairman Pallone, Chairwoman Schakowsky, subcommittee Republican leader Rodgers, and I, wanted the CEOs of these companies to be here today. It's not the first time we've requested they appear. And it's always helpful and appropriate when the leaders of these amazingly successful American companies come before congressional committees and explain their practices, which they did over three years ago while I was chairman of the committee. Some have been willing to appear but others like Google have yet to do so.  </p><p>Users of their service deserve answers, like Ms. Dumpson, who should feel safe to study at a place of her choosing. Police officers like Mr. Donahue, who has to worry about his brothers and sisters in uniform being targets of vicious violence. I hope to be more enlightened from the questions and debate that we have here today.  I also want to share my disappointment that the majority's memo for today's hearing did not include ambush-style killings of law enforcement officers as a form of mainstreaming of extremism. Let me be clear, extremism, the result in violence is wrong. And that includes the terrible ambush-style killings of law enforcement officials.  </p><p>The Democrats memo stated that from 1994 to 2020 a quarter of terrorist incidents and 22 deaths were committed by left wing extremists who opposed capitalism, imperialism, and colonialism and supported decentralized political systems such as anarchism. That number should, sadly, be a lot higher but the memo looked the other way when it came to ambush-style killings of law enforcement officials. You have to ask why? Think about how that must make their families feel.  </p><p>Our great country's had a rough time in 2020. I think we'll all be glad to put this year in the rear-view mirror. But along the way, I hope we've realized how modern tools of communication can easily be misused, abused, should I say, and how important it is that we all work together to both protect free speech without ripping the fabric of the country and to protect the safety and well being of online users. Hopefully, the platform's will rise to the challenge and do more voluntarily, otherwise, Congress will have to step into this fray.  </p><p>With that, Madam Chair, I yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The--the gentleman yields back.  </p><p>And material would like to remind members that pursuant to committee rules, all members written opening statements shall be made part of the--of the record.  And now, I would like to introduce our witnesses for today's hearing. Mark Ginsburg is President of the Coalition for a Safe Web--for a Safer Web.  Taylor--I'm sorry, Dumpson, she is a hate crime survivor and cyber-harassment target. I want to thank her for her personal testimony.  </p><p>John--John Donahue is a fellow at Rutgers University, Miller Center for Community Protection and Resilience and former Chief of Strategy on Initiatives at the New York City Police Department.  And finally, Tom Kendall, who is Chief Executive Officer of Moment.  So we will--we want to thank our witnesses for joining us today. We look forward to your testimony. And we will begin with Mr. Ginsburg and you've got five minutes for your opening statement--for your testimony. Thank you.  </p><p>GINSBURG: Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Madam Chairman. And to all members of the committee. Thank you for having me.  </p><p>I believe me, whether--whatever may be your political persuasion, I share your pain. The Coalition for a Safer Web is a relatively new, nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. Our mission is to promote new technological and policy initiatives to protect Americans against the threat of internet-based radicalization and extremist violence.  </p><p>I want to particularly recognize my vice president Eric Feinberg, who has done so much to help further the mission of our organization.  </p><p>As was stated by all the members, a poisonous blue of extremist groups from both fringes of the political spectrum, both here and abroad, have succeeded in hijacking and gaming social media platforms to radicalize Americans. The best evidence is the increase in arrest by the FBI and local authorities of radicalized domestic terrorist attracted to Neo-Nazi ideology, so-called Antifa ideology, radical Islamic groups, anarchists, et cetera, as we have seen constantly in the cities that have been under siege, including Portland. And this is only gotten worse since the pandemic and the terrible events in Charlottesville. The threat is so acute that the FBI considers domestic extremist groups a first tier threat.  </p><p>Because the business model of major social media companies is dependent on digital revenue, there is no financial or legal incentive to independently enable oversight or vigorous accountability denied as long as section 230 of the Communications Decency Act provides a shield to these platforms.  </p><p>Major social media companies, and I'm referring to Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter, are consistently breaking their pledges to do better to protect Americans from extremist content. Meanwhile, radical groups trolling for converts have revised ingenious methods to evade detection, assisted by extremists supporting web communications and hosting channels, many operating with European-based and Russian government support.  </p><p>I want to now turn to YouTube. YouTube's management has evaded congressional immediate scrutiny as it hides behind its parent Alphabet and Google. It's a puzzle to me, since YouTube stands out in a radical hit parade is one of the worst purveyors of extremism. And I'd like to give you an example that really has set us off.  </p><p>It has ignored repeated demands, demands that I myself have communicated to its CEO, Susan Wojcicki, to remove, listen to this, tens of thousands of videos instructing would-be terrorists how to construct terrorist weapons, including pipe bombs, pipe bombs that we use by the Boston Marathon bombers, pipe bombs that were in the knapsack of the man who committed to shooting at Parkland High School. And the list goes on and on.  </p><p>In addition, YouTube hosts uploaded virulent via video games, inviting young users to target Jews and blacks. For young Americans YouTube has become a veritable black hole of digital shark-bait to radicalize and train users to fall prey to social medias amplification algorithm rabbit holes. </p><p>I'd like to now say a few words about Facebook. Time and again Facebook has assured Congress in the public it has permanently removed extremist content, deemed a violation of its ever shifting terms of service, but we at our organization continue to find it. Exhibit A is the live stream Christ Church video, which Facebook's executives have said time and again it is permanently de-platformed. Of the 15 Christ Church videos that we in our organization have located on Facebook and on Instagram since January 20th, 13 remain, others using language accounts, including Arabic, Russian, and even Yiddish.  Moreover, Facebook's artificial intelligence flagged these videos as graphic violence, sort of giving it an R rating, enabling them to remain. Really? Is that the way Mr. Zuckerberg permanently de-platforms such content that he has promised to do? </p><p>We have assessed that Facebook's AI is simply untrained to detect previously de-platformed content tied to non-English speaking accounts. Four people in--in our organization are able to find what legions of Facebook engineers are unable to do so. Moreover, Facebook has failed to take down QAnon accounts, which we revealed in a recent report and also amplified by an investigation by The New York Times just a few days ago. </p><p>I think that there's a reason why Facebook refuses to take the action necessary. First, if it adopted the type of technology that we recommend it would require it to disclose the gap between its pledge and performance by letting individuals such as ours to access its API. And it's not prepared to let third party technology innovators to access API.  </p><p>I want to close by saying a word about Telegram. Telegram is a platform of encrypted communications that has become in effect the most important purveyor of extremist radicalization, linking transnational extremist groups between Europe and the United States. Telegram's Dubai-based management is culpable for enabling the spreading of the QAnon conspiracy and Neo-Nazi and radicalization back to the United States using Russian government trolls.  We hope that Congress will join our call to action to urge our ally the United Arab Emirates, as well as both Apple and Google to. in effect, de-platform Telegram. And I'll have more to say about that and our questions.  </p><p>Thank you very much, Madam Chairman. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you. The gentleman yields back.  </p><p>I do want to encourage the witnesses to stick to the five minute timeline. And Ms. Dumpson, it is yours for five minutes. </p><p>DUMPSON: Good morning, Chairman Pallone, Chairwoman Schakowsky, Ranking Member Walden, and Ranking Member McMorris Rodgers, and members of the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce. Thank you for the opportunity to share my personal experience and perspective about the role of social media companies in radicalizing America and perpetuating extremism and hate on their platforms.  </p><p>Unfortunately, I know firsthand that online hate ruins lives by stoking fear, silencing voices, and causing harm to people's physical and professional safety, all of which have a serious lasting effect on victims and their families. And just because it happens digitally does not mean it should be taken less seriously. Hate should never be normalized.  Nigger agitator, niggress, and sheboon were just a few of the words used by Andrew Anglin, known white supremacists, founder of the Neo-Nazi website, the Daily Stormer and co-organizer of Charlottesville Unite the Right rally to describe me after I became the first black woman to hold the position of student government president at the American University in May 2017. </p><p>On May 1, 2017, the day after I was sworn in as president, a mass perpetrator hung bananas from blackboard and nooses from light posts and bus stops around my campus, as you can see in this picture right here. The bananas were labeled with aka and aka freak, making reference to that predominantly black sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated, of which I am a member, and made reference to Harambe, referencing the gorilla that was killed at the Cincinnati Zoo in 2016.  </p><p>As this vile act gained national attention and was investigated by the Department of Justice as a hate crime, my story must have come to Andrew Anglin's attention. By May 4, 2017, Anglin had taken it upon himself to incite a coordinated cyber-harassment campaign to encourage his followers to, \"Send me some words of support,\" and by doxing and providing his followers with direct links to my Facebook and Twitter pages.  </p><p>In other words, Anglin and his followers posted my personal information online with the intent for the information to be used to harass, stalk, and threaten me, and to be used against me for an unlawful purpose. Due to his notoriety amongst those in the white supremacist community, Anglin's followers heeded his call to action.  Since Anglin's troll storm, some of the threatening racist and sexist comments directed at me on social media platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter include but are not limited to, \"I'll take a few years for painting the street with her blood.\" \"I wish I knew her address, I would send her a noose so she can go hang herself and do the world a favor.\" \"I think I'd take my chances with hiding her small tit body after her fatal accident.\" \"To smash her in the head with a bike lock hard enough to split her head open with a wound that needed stitches. I've seen you only get probation for that offense.\" There are more statements similar to those in my--and can be seen in my written testimony. </p><p>As a result of this experience, I was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, anxiety, and depression, and lost 15 percent of my body weight. I also experience flashbacks and triggers and am forced to take increased measures to protect myself and my family. Most importantly, the harassment that Anglin incited on various social media platforms continues to this day, despite England's troll storm being initiated over three years ago.  </p><p>I am now used to reviewing, filtering, identifying, screen-shotting and saving multiple threatening and harassing comments on a monthly basis in the event that the comments rise to the level of a true threat, specifying time, place, and manner of attack--but I should not have to be. This is why I sued Anglin, The Daily Stormer's parent company, and two other defendants in federal court for violating the District of Columbia's Human Rights Act, which prohibits individuals from interfering with someone's use of a public accommodation, with pro bono representation by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the Washington Lawyers Committee, and Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP. </p><p>In Dumpson versus Ade Judge Rosemary Collyer set precedent by ruling that online racist and gender-based harassment can interfere with an individual's equal access to a place of public accommodations, as I had to make significant changes to how I navigated on a day to day basis, both on and off campus.  Weeks ago, Facebook was yet again apathetic to racism and incitement to violence and the Call to Arms Event that resulted in the Kenosha shooting was flagged over 450 times but once again, Facebook did nothing. Unfortunately, this does not surprise me because out of the hundreds of times that I have reported the hate directed at me on Facebook and other platforms the social media companies have never contacted me, despite it being brought to their attention.  I speak from experience when I say that when online social media companies are left to regulate themselves instances of hate, bigotry, and prejudice run rampant under the guise of free speech. Today, extremists are using the internet for the purposes of recruiting, organizing, and mobilizing members of their digital community to commit threatening acts online and in person.  </p><p>In 2017, HR 3067, the Online Safety Modernization Act was introduced, which would have provided federal protections against doxing and swatting, however, it was not signed into law. This is why I'm a big supporter of initiatives like ADL's Backspace Hate and a stop hate for profit campaign to raise awareness and combat harmful online activities, including cyber-harassment, swatting, and doxing. But civil rights activists and organizations cannot do this work alone, Congress must act.  </p><p>In my written remarks, I offer six ways that Congress can act to address the rise in hate crimes, both on and--online and on in person in partnership with the AD and I look forward to discussing some of these recommendations and the question and answer portion of this hearing. Thank you. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you very much for your personal testimony.  </p><p>And I want to recognize Mr. Donahue for five minutes for his testimony. </p><p>DONAHUE: Thank you, Chair Schakowsky. I'm pleased to testify today about the serious public safety concerns and specifically, challenges to law enforcement, raised by the growing phenomenon of cyber social extremism and its power to influence violence domestically. The challenge has both strategic and tactical considerations for law enforcement, which I will discuss in more detail.  </p><p>To begin, we know that social media, the use of it for promoting ideas and opinions and encouraging participation in civic--in civic discourse is well documented. The platforms are mobile and ubiquitous. And platforms want participation. They've become astonishingly effective in capturing and leveraging human behavioral data right down to the individual.  </p><p>Here in the U.S., where we cherish constitutional rights to free speech and peaceable assembly, social media has been embraced to share ideas and opinions on any topic at any time. But what is recently observable from open source social media data is that there is an exponential growth in participation around revolutionary and extremist themes across the ideological spectrum. But why is that a problem? As I heard it a little bit earlier.  </p><p>The earliest stages of the ISIS Caliphate social media was used to effectively motivate some youth to take up arms in support of that designated foreign terrorist organization right here in America. Recruitment started on the surface web and gradually moved to encrypted communications to shield criminal conversations from law enforcement. I saw what happens with extremist ideology and what it can do on the streets of New York.  </p><p>Then that same cycle is happening domestically, with movements on the far right and the far left. A report I co-authored earlier this year with my colleagues from the Network Contagion Research Institute shows how on social media memes become viral, evolve, permitting extremists to plant hateful and revolutionary ideas right in the public eye, often disguised as jokes or code words to those in the know.  </p><p>You've heard about the Boogaloo, the far right militia movement. And in protests over pandemic lock-down, Boogaloo people played out there inside jokes by wearing Hawaiian shirts and carrying semi-automatic weapons at protests in the center of major American cities, and memes shared on Boogaloo message boards gamified assaults on law enforcement, encouraging violence through jargon known in the video gaming community. And while it appears that the online malicious sphere is inhabited exclusively by the far right extremist, they are not by any means alone.  </p><p>In a report released this month my colleagues in the NCRI quantified that online violent, and I'll kick in other far less social media spaces, sought exponential growth, upwards of 1,000 percent, during the most recent period of unrest in America. These anti-government/anti-police messages broke into the mainstream, including Facebook and Twitter, where they have their greatest reach. Encouragement of violence, designs for ghost guns, dehumanizing opponents, advocating physical attacks on law enforcement and elected officials, and sharing tactical countermeasures to legitimate governmental activity to control, riot its criminal behaviors.  </p><p>All of these topics and more are shared on public forums and pushed to people's smartphones. These may be original ideas and they don't have to--they may be original ideas and thoughts but they don't propagate themselves. It's the algorithm that drive profit for social media companies that push that information into people's social media feeds. That's the strategic challenge. What extremists thoughts and ideologies are pulsing through the internet and social media and who should understand how such ideologies are evolving?  </p><p>What's apparent is that regardless of the ideology criminal behavior during recent civil unrest were motivated in part by what's happening online. That's the tactical issue. For example, protest activity is constitutional and police are sworn to protect it. It's the criminal activity that's an issue for the civil society and police.  </p><p>And intelligence gathering brings its own tensions and limitations. Law enforcement needs information to prepare for the safety of all at these events. That's smart government and safeguards are in place to prevent overreach. Frankly, much of what law enforcement needs comes from open source but social medias--social media companies have unilaterally limited when, how and what they will share. And when trying to, particularly when they're trying to address life safety issues, social media companies continually stymie public safety. Law enforcement has a tough time when policing in the best of times. So what can be done?  </p><p>Despite social media companies efforts to minimize the availability of streaming extremist messages, like we just heard, the self-imposed standards are ad hoc and more likely to resemble a game of whack-a-mole. And to be certain, social media companies are not in a position to identify those who will mobilize to violence, law enforcement is and must remain vigilant to identify an act beforehand, but the time-frames are remarkably short.  </p><p>We know before the murderous attack the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh in October of 2018 that the murderer was said on a website, \"I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics. I'm going in.\"  </p><p>While law enforcement is the last line of defense against extremists who mobilize to violence, it is ironic that they've become the ultimate target. The outcomes of extremist movements are not predictable and the time for acknowledging social media platforms culpability in this phenomenon and rapidly working to preserve civil society is upon us.  </p><p>I thank you for the opportunity to testify today. And I yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentleman yields back. Thank you.  </p><p>And now, Mr. Kendall, it is your time for five minutes. </p><p>KENDALL: Thank you chairpersons Pallone and Chairperson Schakowsky, and ranking members Walden and Rodgers, for inviting me to speak today.  </p><p>When I started working in technology my hope was to build products that brought people together in new and--and productive ways. I wanted to improve the world that we all lived in. Instead social media services that I and others have built, it's torn people apart with alarming speed and intensity. At the very least, we have eroded our collective understanding as a country. At worst, I fear we are pushing ourselves to the brink of civil war. I feel shamed by this outcome and I am deeply concerned by it so I'm compelled to talk to you all about what we can do to further limit the damage and maybe even undo some of it.  </p><p>My path in technology started at Facebook, where I was the first director of monetization. I was later the president of Pinterest for five years and since leaving three years ago, I've been the CEO of Moment, which is a technology company focused on reversing many of the troubling outcomes created by social media.  </p><p>At Facebook, I believe we sought to mine as much human attention as possible and turn it into historically unprecedented profits. To do this we didn't simply create something useful and fun, we took a page from Big Tobacco's playbook, working to make our offering addictive at the outset. Tobacco companies initially just sought to make nicotine more potent but eventually that wasn't enough to grow the business as fast as they hoped so they added sugar and menthol to cigarettes so users could hold the smoke in their lungs for longer periods.  </p><p>At Facebook, a simple directory of people, engaged millions of users and kept them returning to the service almost every day. But business realities necessitated that we make the service even more engaging so we added updates, photo tagging, and likes, which made status and reputation primary and laid the groundwork for the growing mental health issues we see resulting from these services.  </p><p>I left the company in 2010 but I continue to watch the company evolve and see the outcomes unfold. The next page in Big Tobacco's playbook was to add bronchodilators to cigarettes. This allowed the smoke to get in contact with more surface area of the lungs. Allowing for misinformation, conspiracy theories, and fake news to flourish were Facebook's bronchodilators. But that incendiary content wasn't enough, tobacco companies then added ammonia to cigarettes to increase the speed with which nicotine traveled to the brain.  </p><p>Facebook's ability to deliver this incendiary content to the right person at the right time in the exact right way through their algorithms, that is their ammonia and we now know it fosters tribalism and division. Social media preys on the most primal parts of your brain, it provokes, it shocks, and it enrages.  </p><p>With misinformation these companies hide behind the First Amendment and assert that they stand for free speech but the algorithms continually choose which voices each of us actually hear. I don't think it's free speech that these companies revere. Instead, Facebook in their cohorts worship at the altar of engagement and cast other concerns aside, raising the voices of division, anger, hate, and misinformation to drown out the voices of truth, justice, morality, and peace.  </p><p>On a personal level, I'm aware that I've benefited from these addictive business models and this deepens my sense of responsibility for where we are and my sense of obligation to help us improve things. I don't believe that I could have at the time where the work I contributed to would lead but for my role I do bear responsibility and accordingly, I've dedicated my time and resources to undo as much damage as I can. I don't believe social media is the root cause of every problem we're facing but I believe it may be the most powerful accelerant in history.  </p><p>I'm not a lawyer, legislator but I can't imagine where we'd be if we hadn't held tobacco companies accountable for making so many people sick and yet, this is what we've allowed social media companies to do--and I believe it has to change. These services are making a sick. These services divide us. It's time we take account of the damage and it's time we put in place the necessary measures to protect ourselves and our country. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentleman yields back. And that--we now have concluded witness opening statements.  </p><p>At this time, we will move to member questions. Each member will have five minutes to ask questions of our witnesses. And I will start by recognizing myself for five minutes.  </p><p>The--the title of the hearing is Mainstreaming Extremism. How did we get here? And how can we fix it? To answer those questions we need to take a deep look at online platforms which are--which are increasingly great part of our daily lives.  </p><p>Mr. Kendall, while you were with Facebook or--and Pinterest, yeah, did you--did--did people within the company discuss the potential harms that a new product or feature could pose to users or to society? Were there times that the company chose to--to release the product or feature designed despite the potential harm that it could cause? </p><p>KENDALL: This was primarily an issue at--at Facebook, much less of an issue with at--at Pinterest. I would say at Facebook, you know, the primary discussion around harm was--was--revolved around privacy, right, user--user privacy, and--and we raised concerns about that. In--in many cases of new product releases I would say the MO of the company was that oftentimes, those concerns were ignored. What superseded that was--was a view that, look, more features that connect more people is good for the network and good for the world. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: But let me ask you another question on that line I assume that Facebook considered legal liability risks when deciding how and whether to launch a--a new product. In your experience was a product's ability to facilitate extremism, racism, or violence considered, in that legal risk assessment? </p><p>KENDALL: It--it was considered but--but then heavily--heavily discounted. I mean, I think that, you know, the--the--the timeline of the FTC imposing threats against Facebook and then those being ignored for years and years and years and years, until really last year when there was a $5 billion fine, I think highlights the pattern, which is that they don't respond to constraints, they don't respond to threats. where they appear to respond, and I think privacy is a--a good path to look at, is when there are real economic costs to the business.  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: I see. Thank you. </p><p>Ms.--Ms. Dumpson, I--I just want to thank you for the personal testimony and the personal pain that it must bring you even today to repeat that. I want to see if you could tell a little more about what the online attacks meant for your life. And--and in your written testimony, you talk about the--the--the--the--how it changed--the--the changes that you have had to--to make. I wonder, how did you deal with going to classes and to--and participate in normal activities or didn't you? </p><p>DUMPSON: Thank you, Congresswoman.  </p><p>When the hate crime initially happened in May 2017, it happened during finals week so I missed my final exams. I was forced to drop my minor in sociology, as the material that I was reading in class was very triggering for my own PTSD that I was learning and trying to figure out how to cope with. I had to take classes incomplete. I incurred a number of expenses because I was walking--or I was taking a car instead of walking or getting on a bus as the bananas were hung from bus-stops. I had to install security cameras at my home. I had to travel to an undisclosed location, even when we filed the lawsuit. And I specifically had to decrease my social media usage.  </p><p>And so to the point about the answer to hate speech is more speech, it actually is--that's--that's a faulty notion because it assumes that more speech is actually going to be more counter-speech and not more hate speech. And what I've experienced is that I had, as a millennial, I had to completely decrease and almost halt my social media usage and the way that I communicate with my friends, the way I communicate with my family, because I am at risk for doxing. I'm continuously, because unfortunately, like other people who experience this kind of harassment, once your information is out there it never goes away. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: That is painful to hear. And I thank you, and I yield back.  </p><p>And now, I recognize our ranking member for five minutes of questions. </p><p>RODGERS: Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. And Ms. Dumpson, I too, just want to say thank you for being here and sharing your story. I think it's outrageous and unacceptable that anyone would be targeted and have to endure what you have. So thanks for sharing.  </p><p>I was going to start with Mr. Donahue. I--I too want to thank you for your years of service. You and your brothers and sisters in the blue put your lives on the line every day to protect and secure our communities.  </p><p>We're--we're definitely living through some troubling times and unfortunately, we're seeing where platforms are being used today by politicians to push dangerous movements like Defund the Police, city councils are trying to dismantle local police forces and individuals use social media to intentionally put officers lives on the lines.  </p><p>Mr. Donahue, do you have a message or platforms like Twitter about the real world implications of what is happening on their platform? </p><p>DONAHUE: Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you, Congressmember Rodgers.  </p><p>And I--I have colleagues from around the country, from Boston and--and Pennsylvania to--to Texas, that are feeling the strain of what is being played out on social media towards policing and towards the right approach to trying to protect civil society. Platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, and others are propagating all those anti-police/anti-government messages. They're the same platforms that--that--that delivered horrendous content to Ms. Dumpson.  </p><p>And the challenges that we face at--at a tactical level to platforms like Twitter and--and Facebook is that they're incredibly difficult to deal with from a--from a law enforcement perspective. And--and to amplify what Mr. Kendall had said, it is true that they're more concerned about privacy because that's where the push-back has come. But the anonymity that is also ripe on those platforms make it equally more difficult to try and protect people like Ms. Dumpson and police officers that are in the line of fire, literally, at violent protests around the country. </p><p>RODGERS: Thank you. </p><p>Ambassador Ginsburg, in your written statement you--you discussed Telegram and how it was used by Antifa and other groups to recruit individuals in Portland, Oregon to engage in violent protests against police. Can you explain what you saw there and whether you believe app stores should do more to vet apps being used for nefarious purposes? He's muted, I think. You're muted.  </p><p>GINSBURG: Sorry. Thank you, Congresswoman.  </p><p>RODGERS: Try again, yeah.  </p><p>GINSBURG: Totally. Thank you.  </p><p>We've issued three reports in the last two months about how Telegram was utilized by both anarchists and white nationalist groups to not only target police but also to instigate violence against protesters on the other side and to not only instigate and incite but we saw that Telegram and communications were actually directing where rioters should go to the least protected police sites or where police were located.  </p><p>And so what we really saw here is how Telegram has become, in effect, probably the worst mobile application in both the Google and Apple store that is serving as a, in effect, a major conveyor of radicalization, and most importantly, a--a very dangerous app that has been hijacked by everybody who is sending QAnon QDrops to QAnon supporters, to direct individuals and--and rioters to attack the authorities, and most importantly, to radicalize and to let German and Russian government trolls and German Neo-Nazi groups to push even more radical content across the Atlantic into Telegram accounts in the United States, of which there are over 200 million worldwide. So just imagine. </p><p>RODGERS: Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Yep. Very good. Thank you.  </p><p>Finally, Mr. Donahue, you were also, in your written statement, you talked about the surge in anti-police, anti-anarchists messaging on the far left of social media and the memes and hashtags that are advocating the murder of law enforcement. Can you explain how social media platforms and Twitter have played a role in the nationwide coordinated violence that we've seen recently? </p><p>DONAHUE: Yeah, absolutely.  </p><p>What we've seen--and what we've seen more recently is the--is the emergence of certain code words, things that in my 32 years of policing I had not heard before, and I'll reference them, it's ACAB or F12. These are terms that never existed and I'd--I'd never seen it anywhere.  </p><p>And in the months after the murder of George Floyd, in the short months after that, the--the type of vitriol directed at police, directly as a consequence of that, and demanding the murder of police officers on Twitter and Facebook. And those--those memes and--and slogans shot up 300 to 1,000 percent. And these are things that have never been seen before. So that's how the type of activity that we're talking about and the--the consequences on police that were literally trying to protect peaceful protesters have turned violent against us. </p><p>RODGERS: Thank you. I yield back. Thank you for the extra time. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Yeah.  </p><p>Let me now--can you hear me? Am I on mute? I'm good. Okay. </p><p>And now I'm going to call on Kathy Castor for five minutes. It looks like Frank Pallone is not here, our ranking member, so Ms. Castor, you're recognized for five minutes. </p><p>CASTOR: Well, thank you, Chairwoman Schakowsky. Thanks to all of our witnesses.  </p><p>Ms. Dumpson, you are courageous. Thank you for sharing your story and working so that others don't have to experience the hate and harassment that you've lived through.  </p><p>Mr. Donahue, my heart goes out to our public safety officers who are being targeted. It's outrageous and--and we've--we've got to--we've got to make all of this stop  </p><p>You know, this subcommittee has held a number of important hearings on the ways social media companies and online--online platforms are harming consumers and society but I think this hearing today might be the most important.  </p><p>The online surveillance of individuals through online platforms has evolved now into dangerous manipulation. The surveillance and manipulation goes on without permission and knowledge of individuals and even worse, online platforms like Facebook and YouTube make billions of dollars as this goes on with this stomach churning stew of illegal activity, like the sale of opioids, child sex trafficking, fomenting of violence, online abuse.  </p><p>So the witnesses today have testified about how social media companies and online platforms are amplifying the extremist views and radicalizing people across America and across the planet. This manipulation is having real world consequences and I'm especially worried about children. Our children are being surveilled, they're being exposed to extremist content and being manipulated--and the long-term consequences are very serious.  </p><p>So I've introduced the Kids Internet Design and Safety Act or KIDS Act, along with Vice Chair Clark and Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton. It's similar to Senator Markey's bill in the Senate. It would make it unlawful for platforms to--directed to children to amplify, promote or encourage extremist views or fail to implement a mechanism for users to report suspected violation.  </p><p>So Congress needs to act. I'm going to look forward to Chair Schakowsky's draft bill because I'm eager to act here, </p><p>Mr. Ginsburg, how are online platforms promoting extremist messaging to children and what are the best steps that parents can take right now to protect their kids? </p><p>GINSBURG: Thank you, Madam--Congresswoman, for the question.  </p><p>I go back to the example of YouTube and how young teenagers are being lured onto video games that--which, of course, is something that young children and--and young adults like to use, that in effect, bait them into--from shooting at--at Israeli soldiers wearing Jewish stars of David by Nazi soldiers.  </p><p>When they log on to there--those accounts you have to understand the fungibility of looking at YouTube and Facebook and Twitter as one big social media platform. Because we tend not--we tend to make a mistake of segregating these systems but in the end one radical account on Facebook all of a sudden lures a young kid from YouTube onto Facebook and onto Twitter. And--and that's part of the problem with all of their ridiculously different terms of service.  </p><p>Number two, the other thing that we've seen is TikTok and that hasn't been mentioned here. TikTok has used the parody of a Bruno Mars song, Locked Out of Heaven, to parody the Holocaust. Now, there were young kids dressed up in concentration camp garb on this TikTok video, tweets, who had no idea, of course, that--what they were doing were appearing to be doing. And the fact that TikTok permitted this to happen, it's not the first time. This is an example of where--now that TikTok has become such a major issue here in the United States, the idea that a video like that would be permitted to be--having young kids participate in it as a parody of the Holocaust, well, it speaks for itself. </p><p>CASTOR: Yeah, that's sick. I mean, that's just playing sick.  </p><p>So it seems like section 230 is an impediment to protecting our kids. What's your view? </p><p>GINSBURG: Absolutely. Section 230 is the holy grail for social media companies. And we long have advocated that the by the--the partisan divide about section 230 needs to come to terms with the fact that as long as 230 is on the books social media companies will only have a moral and not a legal or financial responsibility to protect our young people, as well as Americans. </p><p>CASTOR: And to--to close, Mr. Kendall, I watched The Social Dilemma last night and I heard you loud and clear that you don't let your kids onto social media at all. And I recommend all of you while you're staying safe at home to watch this Netflix--The Social Dilemma. It's quite illuminating.  </p><p>So thank you, I yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you I would second that advice. The Social Dilemma.  </p><p>And let me now recognize Congressman Bucshon for five minutes for his questions. </p><p>BUCSHON: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.  </p><p>And, you know, it's--it's pretty clear to me that Ms. Dumpson's story alone should be enough to convince the U.S. Congress to address this issue. </p><p>Social media sites are no longer just platforms innocently posting content and we need to reconsider whether or not they're more traditional news outlets. And governments around the world are going to have to address this and have an honest discussion here in the U.S. about section 230.  </p><p>Mr. Donahue, I appreciate the difficult line that law enforcement must walk in protecting the public and in that regard, putting themselves in harm's way. It's a tough job so I worry about the impediments that stand in the way of those duties. For this reason, I was especially stunned by the reference in your testimony that since 2016, Twitter specifically has intentionally ended sharing information with law enforcement, potentially lifesaving information.  </p><p>Since Jack Dorsey hasn't taken us up on our request to testify this year, can you tell me why Twitter stopped sharing information with law enforcement?  </p><p>DONAHUE: Absolutely. And I was part of the New York City Police Department's Intelligence Bureau at the time that that decision was made. And it put police agencies around the country in the dark as to certain information that's collected by--by Twitter, specifically by Twitter, and was available to third-party providers of information that--that anyone marketing companies, people that are amplifying messages to target you for--you know, what type of soap you should buy, or what type of razors you should use.  </p><p>But they intentionally changed their terms of service so that that type of information, publicly available to anyone else would no longer be available to law enforcement. And they did that at the request of a--of the American Civil Liberties Union. It's the question--it keeps going back to the question of privacy. There are ways to protect people's privacy without hamstringing law enforcement.  </p><p>I would just like to add one more thing, Congress members, is that it is very difficult for law enforcement to get in touch with social media companies who--who have on their sites concerning, life-threatening information that could be acted on to save people's lives or prevent catastrophe. And--and that needs to change. </p><p>BUCSHON: Yeah, I mean, I just don't quite understand why if--you know, regular citizens know information that could lead directly to harm or death to other citizens or that--you know, we are basically compelled by law in many ways to address that.  </p><p>I was a physician before and so I understand this concept. And present these things--you know, if, for example, if someone is brought to the hospital whose a risk to themselves or others--you know, we're bound to report that and that person needs legally adjudicated but why social media companies that have information that could be harmful to others--you know, don't feel if that's the case. I do you think we can balance civil liberty concerns and the need to protect the public, don't you? </p><p>DONAHUE: Absolutely. There are--and--and--and I take the heart that you were a physician because then you understand the importance of--of HIPAA protections on--on privacy on--on people's health records and privacy. And there--there are schemes that people have--legislative schemes, regulatory schemes that people have envisioned that would mirror HIPAA as a framework for how this type of information, human behavioral data might be protected from the social media companies themselves.  </p><p>And--and I there are--there are people that are far better off talking about that than me but I've seen those potential opportunities. And--and we know that HIPAA works, and we--and there has got to be a way to find the way to break that--that sharing of very valuable human behavioral data that then forces certain information to people cell phones to their--to their smartphones that enables them to act. </p><p>BUCSHON: Yeah, I mean, I can't agree more. I also would want to associate myself with Cathy McMorris Rodgers's opening statement as regards to bias. You know, I think even though we may identify bias that today appears to be mostly against the president of the Republican party, tomorrow it may be against the Democrat president of the United States. And it was, in fact, when President Obama was president.  </p><p>This is not a partisan issue. We need to address it. And I look forward to Congress further discussing. And with that, I yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentleman yields back. And I now recognize Robin Kelly, for five minutes. </p><p>KELLY: Thank you, Madam Chair, for holding this very timely hearing on social media and the spread of extremist content.  </p><p>I want to thank my Greek sister, for coming forward. Thank you so much. Thank you for your strength. Thank you for sharing. Thank you for teaching us. I know it's not an easy thing to do but thank you and to Mr. Donahue, I have five family members that are or were NYPD so just had to say hi to you. </p><p>DONAHUE: Oh, very good. Thank you. </p><p>KELLY: You know, we're really concerned about--you know, with elections around the corner--you know, what's happening and we know we need to pay very close attention to what's shared online.  </p><p>Mr. Kendall, you were Facebook's director of monetization for approximately five years. And you were instrumental in developing their advertising business. During your discussions at Facebook to monetize the product, I assume there was a close connection between monetization and engagement. How much in increasing engagement drive decision making at Facebook? </p><p>KENDALL: Engagement drove everything at Facebook and I assume--I'm not there, I haven't been there for 10 years, I assume it continues to drive everything today. You know, we initially used engagement as sort of a proxy for user benefit. You know, it seemed to be this indicator that users liked what they were seeing.  </p><p>But we started to realize that--that engagement could also mean that they were sufficiently sucked in that they couldn't work in their own best long-term interests to get off the platform when it wasn't making them feel good. Or when they felt like they were getting cornered by--you know, various messages or sucked into--into groups whose beliefs didn't necessarily align with their own. So we started to see real-life consequences. But--you know, they just weren't given much weight. Engagement always--always won. It always trumped. </p><p>KELLY: Most of the mainstream platforms say they're doing a lot to combat extremist content, hate speech, and the like. But it's clearly not enough from story we heard today, is there any incentive for Facebook and other social media companies to stop or try to prevent harmful content, like conspiracy theories or extremist ideology? </p><p>KENDALL: I mean-- </p><p>KELLY: (--INAUDIBLE) and share.  </p><p>KENDALL: I mean, there's no incentive to stop. And there's an incredible incentive to keep going and get better, right? In my--in my opening statement, I talked about ammonia. They're incentivized to go find the next ingredient that will be all the more--more powerful.  </p><p>And I--I just don't believe that's going to change unless there are financial or civil or criminal penalties associated with the harm that they--they create. I think without enforcement, they're just going to continue to be embarrassed by the mistakes. And they'll talk about empty platitudes about--you know, oh, gee, we--we--we hope we can get better operationally next time. But I don't believe anything systemic will change.  </p><p>KELLY: So you don't believe social media companies are capable of changing their own behaviors based on current law? </p><p>KENDALL: No, I just think the incentives to govern--well, I think the incentives to keep going, to keep the status quo are just too lucrative at the moment. </p><p>KELLY: So there's no moral consciousness it sounds like. </p><p>KENDALL: Yeah, I mean, I just don't think that--I mean, I think the--the objective is to--is--is to create value for shareholders, which is about giving--you know, driving revenue-driving profits and that's just a function of how much time people spend on the service. And people spend more time, the more we make them angry, the more we enrage them, the more we addict them.  </p><p>KELLY: Okay. </p><p>Mr. Ginsberg, in your testimony, you documented multiple instances of disturbing content being spread on social media platforms. How do you believe social media companies should treat content that's going viral? Should a human review content if it reaches a certain threshold or will AI magically solve these content monetization issues? </p><p>GINSBERG: Thank you. As we point--as I pointed out in testimony, what is the problem, for example, with Facebook is that its amplification algorithm is totally consistent with its efforts to in effect de-platform radical content. And worse, it's even unable to identify the toxic content that comes across accounts in other languages. And we can't even understand that because, with all the technicians, you would think that they understand that radical content is common across their platforms in Arabic or Russian or German, etc.  </p><p>And one other things if I may add, the advertising industry has a responsibility here. It is the revenue leverage that is the only leverage--the only financial leverage on social media platforms. And I really hope we see the committee in the future will bring in representatives of the advertising industry, which formed the Global Alliance for Responsible Media to in effect try to force social media companies to be held to account. But they're both fungible, they all need each other. But the fact remains is that the ad agency can help more to do here than what they're doing right now. </p><p>KELLY: Thank you, my time is up. I yield back.  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Now happy to recognize my friend, Buddy Carter, for five minutes. </p><p>CARTER: Thank you, Madam Chair. And thank all of you for being here and for participating in what is truly a--an extremely important subject matter. And--you know, this is--this is bipartisan, this should concern all of us and I think it does concern all of us.  </p><p>Let me begin by saying that social media companies have moved to more aggressively moderate and police the content on their platforms but the approaches vary significantly. While some of the efforts are able to go after accounts and posts that clearly violate their terms, they also ignore or refuse to take down other content. For example, Twitter refused earlier this year to remove a tweet by Iran's supreme leader which called for the destruction and genocide of the Israeli people. Twitter responded that these tweets were not in violation of their policy.  </p><p>I want to start with you, Mr. Donahue, and ask you, can you explain to me as best you can how some platforms maintain policies that are inconsistent and create more problems? </p><p>DONAHUE: So, while I am not a--a coder, I--I understand what is being published online in those forums, their--their content and their individual corporate terms of service, which people who post on it are free to do so and accept those terms of service. But they vary based on both the platform, the--the jurisdiction, where they're--where they are incorporated, and what is--what's supposed to be driving their--their profit motives.  </p><p>And I listened to Ambassador Ginsberg and--and Mr. Kendall very clearly that--that it is a--it's the profit motive that drives it. And--and when you look at hyperbolic statements like the one you just spoke about and yet having a response, I take it at its face value that--that they said, \"No, that doesn't violate our terms of service and posting.\" That's a real--that's--that's a real concern. And--and we've seen it with respect to things that are happening here in the U.S. and I could--I could expand upon that with regard to extremist, disturbing content about advocating the murder of police officers.  </p><p>CARTER: Absolutely. Thank you. Mr. Donahue.  </p><p>Mr. Ginsberg, when he asked you, antisemitism is a problem that continues to show its head. It's more than a problem. It's a--it's--it's awful. And it's something we need to eliminate. How can these anti-Semitic posts be rationalized as not being in violation of Twitter's rules? I don't get it. Can you explain that to me? </p><p>GINSBERG: They make it up as they go along, Congressman. I mean, depending on the prevailing winds and the amount of pressure on them, most of what we see in terms of, for example, antisemitism right now is from QAnon accounts, which itself has a major component of antisemitism in it. And the real problem here is that each of these companies have their own terms of service and they decipher them and interpret them as they want.  </p><p>Which is one of the reasons why I said in my testimony, we're calling for the creation of a social media standards board that would create a harmonized code of conduct across the industry that was modeled after the 1970s Financial Accounting Service Board that harmonized all the different standards that the banking industry had. </p><p>CARTER: Let me ask you something. I'll start with you Mr. Donahue but I'd also like Mr. Ginsberg to respond to this. How--is there any telltale characteristics that--that abusers that can help to identify some of these things, some of these posts? Are there any consistencies there? </p><p>DONAHUE: So one of the things that's really complicated and--and we've seen this in some of the work that I did with the Network Contagion Research Institute is--is that it's the context in which things are said and that--and that really requires talented analysts. And in my--in my prepared testimony, it's the idea that while--while concerning content can be--can be somewhat understood by some of the--the technologies that the companies have put in place.  </p><p>It also requires eyes on and--and that's why the coded messages the very, very disturbing message that was posted on December 20, 2014, before the assassination of two New York City police officers was a text that was a--was a social media post by the assassin that said, \"Let's go put some wings on pigs.\" And that wasn't picked up because it wasn't contextualized beforehand. So it's the idea that people have to put eyes on it to understand what it means. </p><p>CARTER: Mr. Ginsberg? </p><p>GINSBERG: I just want to add very quickly, Congressman, that one of the things that we see in the spread of antisemitism on social media is the enormous role that fringe deep and dark web chat rooms and messaging boards play in promoting antisemitism onto major social media platforms. I don't know if you're familiar with GAB, or AKUN, or the other fringe boards that have become safe havens for white nationalist, Neo-Nazi groups, which of course, are not the attention of this hearing. But I want to assure you are just as responsible for the spread of antisemitism into our mainstream--our mainstream discourse than anything else. </p><p>CARTER: Well, thank you. And thank you for your indulgence, Madam Chair, and thank all of you for your participation. I yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: And now it is my pleasure to recognize Mr. O'Halleran for five minutes. </p><p>O'HALLERAN: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and ranking member, I appreciate being able to host this committee today for you. </p><p>Social media sites have proven ripe for disinformation and extremist content. Social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have responded differently to extremist content on their platforms in attempting to moderate the most vile content. </p><p>However, these efforts remain disjointed, and frankly insufficient. What has resulted has been a dramatic increase in the usage of social media by extremists over the past 15 years. These failures do not just result in isolated incidents neither to end domestic law enforcement agencies are paying attention.  </p><p>In May 2019, the FBI's assistant director of their Counterterrorism Division, Michael McGarrity, noted in testimony to the House Homeland Security Committee, radicalization to violence of domestic terrorists is increasingly taking place online, where violent extremists can use social media for the distribution of propaganda, recruitment, target selections, incentivize to violence. Through the internet, violent extremists around the world, have access to our local communities to target and recruit and spread their messages of hate on a global scale. As we saw in the recent attack in the New Zealand.  </p><p>Social media has provided these individuals with a platform like no other and other like-minded individuals to virtually congregate and the results are similar-minded attacks. More needs to be done and additional government coordination with social media sites is necessary to prevent the spread of extremist content.  </p><p>We also need to discuss the role that fringe social media sites play in spreading--spreading extremist content. Sites like 8chan have spawned domestic terrorists in those sites lack even the basic interest in content moderation. Real attacks that have resulted in the loss of life have occurred and no tangible progress has been made in stopping this.  </p><p>Mr. Donahue, I have a question for you. Thank you for first of all joining us today. And can you speak to you based on your experience as a former New York City Police Chief, how the communication between federal agencies and local police departments can be improved to better respond to the threat that extremist actors pose to civil society? </p><p>DONAHUE: Thank you very much, Congress member. You raised Mike McGarrity's name and his testimony last year. As a matter of fact, the New York City Police Department assembled a religious and ethically motivated violent extremist investigative squad as a consequence of what the FBI had been seeing and--and are actively investigating occurrences of that type of activity in the New York Region.  </p><p>But what is--is significantly lacking is that ability to create for smaller jurisdictions, small municipalities, and less well-funded jurisdictions, the ability to reach out when an issue occurs, or when these types of concerns of the strategic concerns that I spoke about earlier, come to the fore. Because smaller jurisdictions, there's 18,000 local and state, county police departments around the United States. They're not a monolith. And they certainly don't have individualized capacities to do it.  </p><p>They need to leverage fusion centers to be able to get information from the--the social media companies, as well as being able to further disseminate that information, both up and down the chain from the federal--from federal authorities and from the localities. There are structures in place to make sure that--that civil liberties are protected. And I believe that we have a lot of energy in that direction to be able to strengthen those relationships. However, the social media companies need to be willing partners or there has to be a cudgel used to bring them to the table. </p><p>O'HALLERAN: Madam Chair, I see my time is short. So I will yield. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you, gentleman, for yielding them. Now, I recognize Congresswoman Blunt Rochester for five minutes.  </p><p>BLUNT ROCHESTER: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. And I want to especially thank the witnesses today for this very important hearing. And especially Taylor Dumpson.  </p><p>Taylor, your courage to stand up against hate groups, like the Daily Stormer and racist bullies inspires each of us to do more and your work to shine a light on these issues is so important now more than ever. One of the things that you said is that hate should not be normalized and that is one of the big messages that I'm going to take away from this hearing. And I wanted to ask you, I know five minutes was not a lot of time, but if there was anything else that you wanted to share with us as members of the subcommittee that you didn't get a chance to say in that five-minute opening. Any advice to us? </p><p>DUMPSON: Thank you. One of the things I wanted to bring to y'all's attention is that from the very first moment that I became a hate crime survivor, I've been fighting back against this through almost every free moment between going to school, spending time with my family and friends. But I've been sharing my story with students, with academics, religious communities, legal professionals, and elected officials to really get at the changing the hearts and minds and also changing the law.  </p><p>But every hate crime survivor shouldn't be expected to respond and react the way that I have. Unfortunately, when the hate crime happened on May 1st it received national media attention, which meant the cameras were in my face less than three days after the initial event. So I didn't really have much of a choice to step into this role. But since I'm here, I'm dedicated to using my platform to bring these issues to attentions of Congress members.  </p><p>So for that, I want to kind of pivot to how Congress can act in this space. Congress can do three things immediately to address the rise of online extremism and hate, which is to first increase hate crime reporting and data collection by incentivizing and encouraging state and local law enforcement agencies to more comprehensively collect and report on hate crimes to the FBI. As well as increasing their trauma-informed preparedness because I know that in the times where I've reported my instances of hate and--and harassment to law enforcement officers, they have not been trauma-informed, they have not always responded to me, and they've not all--they've not always been technologically competent to be able to address and act on the harms and threats that I've received.  </p><p>The second thing is to hold perpetrators accountable and to better support survivors by enacting federal doxing and swatting legislation and strengthening protections for victims and targets of hate crime and cyber harassment. I was able to sue three individuals and one corporation but I was not able to sue the thousands of people that have continued to harass me to this day.  </p><p>And then the third thing is to compel social media companies to be accountable and to be transparent by supporting research and enacting legislation so that people like me don't have to experience hate crimes in person or on digitally on a daily basis. And it's clear that the hate and social media--sorry, it's clear that tech companies are not doing themselves accountable. And so it really is up to Congress to act here. </p><p>BLUNT ROCHESTER: Thank you so much, Taylor.  </p><p>And then I wanted to ask and I will submit some questions for the record for some of the other witnesses because of the--of time. But I was able to send a letter with members of our committee as well as other members to Facebook regarding civil rights and--and the actions that they're going to take. We've received a lackluster response. I would--would love to know from Ambassador Ginsberg as well as Mr. Kendall if there are examples of platforms that have taken good steps to address extremism? And if so, who are they? </p><p>GINSBERG: Well, each one of these platforms will be able to demonstrate a certain amount of progress and they taught try to tout that in every testimony that they produce before the Congress. But the problem is, is that they're doing it at their own speed and to say that one platform is doing worse or the other, better than the other is to, in effect, belie the fact that all of them are making--are creating the same mess and compounding it even more so with the support of these fringe platforms and with the support of other internet techniques and technical platforms like Telegram.  </p><p>So I--I would say that, for example, that Facebook could be doing a much better job if it, in effect, joined other organizations in supporting a more comprehensive, harmonized code of conduct and, in effect, said, we will not let Telegram be dictating to us what radical content should come on our platform. They're not doing enough of that at all. </p><p>BLUNT ROCHESTER: In the last 20 seconds, Mr. Kendall, can you just hit on--I know, you've talked about the monetization. I know, you've talked about the algorithms, anything that you want to share in the last 15 seconds? </p><p>KENDALL: Well, I--I just think the current policies are incomplete and they're incomplete everywhere, because the incentives aren't there to put in place good policies. So obviously--you know, you can't incite violence but you can lie and incite hate. And we all know that that leads to violence. There's no accountability. </p><p>BLUNT ROCHESTER: Thank you all so much for your testimony and we will be submitting additional questions for the--for the record. Thank you so much and I yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentlewoman yields back and going to the next member of the--of the subcommittee. I recognize Darren Soto for five minutes. </p><p>SOTO: Thank you, Madam Chair.  </p><p>According to a 2018 MIT study, a false story reaches 1,500 people six times quicker on average than a true story does. And while false stories outperform the truth on every subject, including business, terrorism and war, science and technology, and entertainment, fake news about politics regularly does best.  </p><p>The rapid distribution of lies and hate and social media threatens the foundation of our republic. Foreign nations are intruding in our elections, in commerce, and in our lives. Impressionable members of our population are being radicalized, then sorted into massive national political extremist networks, and lives are being destroyed.  </p><p>Members, we are the lawmakers, we have the duty to protect the American public online and we have the power to do so. This subcommittee specifically is charged with the duty and power to reform. We simply need the will to act. And make no mistake about it members, social media extremism and criminality is not invincible, it is not unstoppable, and it is not unsolvable.  </p><p>We can establish social media platform liability to compensate victims and force changes in business behaviors. And we could regulate algorithms to stop proliferation of faults and violent information. And the fact that these companies are no longer the nation's startups just beginning to develop these technologies is important. They are now a mature industry, the social media industry. Its companies are found among the ranks of Fortune 500 companies, even Fortune 100 companies.  </p><p>Mr. Kendall, we can simply make social media companies liable for damages and court for criminal activity perpetrated on their platform. Do you think this would be a sufficient costly enough incentive for social media companies to more actively police their networks for criminality? </p><p>KENDALL: I do. I mean, I think that the--I think the--all we can do is sort of look at precedent and look at--look at what's happened particularly with Facebook historically, which is that the threats around privacy and they're getting their act together around user information didn't do anything. And it wasn't until 2019 when there was a $5 billion dollar fine and then ongoing structural penalties put in place for violations that they cleaned it all up and we haven't heard anything about it since. </p><p>SOTO: Thanks, Mr. Kendall. I agree we. Right now these costs are externalized to society, we need to internalize them to the companies themselves because right now they're not internalizing them.  </p><p>Mr. Dumpson, I'm so sorry to hear about what happened to you. We appreciate your courage in telling your very personal story. Do you think that social media networks were at all culpable in the perpetration of hate crimes against you? </p><p>DUMPSON: Thank you for your question, Congressman.  </p><p>Yes, I do. And that's because the social media companies while they continue to say that they're working on these issues, they've never responded or address these issues. One example is just like three days ago on YouTube. Somebody commented underneath of an interview that I did about a year ago. There are about 2 million views on that--that video and it's on YouTube. But there are 13,000 comments. And one of the comments was, \"She probably tied those bananas from nooses herself,\" as if to suggest that I was behind the hate crime that was enacted on May 1st when there's video footage there.  </p><p>And the harassment that I continue to receive from these platforms has not been taken down despite my efforts, my friends efforts, my family members efforts to report these things continuously. Some of the harassment's also more threatening, like statements, and I quote, \"I wonder what color the blood looks like. I think I'd punch her in the face and take a battery charge for three years.\" And people have even gone so far as to place threatening calls over the phone. And so it seems to me so there's no--there's no limit or no--no stopping on how far extremists are willing to go to spread their message and to target survivors and victims. </p><p>SOTO: Thank you, Ms. Dumpson. Mr. Gimber--Ginsberg, how do we regulate to adjust algorithms to limit the proliferation of false information? What would be your recommendation?  </p><p>GINSBERG: My recommendation is that there's software technology that it was developed, including by our own vice president, Eric Weinberg, that has the ability to machine learn and teach algorithms to identify extremist content. If I told you that Facebook's algorithms are untrained to identify radical content, for example, in different languages, and yet, there's third-party technology out there that could help teach those algorithms to do so you would want to ask why wouldn't Facebook want to acquire that technology, correct? </p><p>SOTO: Absolutely. So the technology does exist, we just merely need to require them to internalize those costs through loss.  </p><p>Thank you so much. I yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentleman yields back. And now I--I'm happy to call on Doris Matsui for her five minutes of questions. </p><p>MATSUI: Thank you so much, Madam Chair. And I want to thank all the witnesses for appearing here today. The discussion has been sobering and important and this topic cannot be more topical or pressing--pressing. When you think about everything else that's happening with over 200--over 200,000 deaths from COVID-19 and Americans taking it to the streets to demand justice and equity, opportunities for extremists (AUDIO GAP) online to undercut our efforts are significant. We need to take action; I appreciate all of you for being here.  </p><p>In particular, Ms. Dumpson, you're very brave. And I think any one of us could be subjected to the hate that you have been subjected to in a manner--in a different separate manner, perhaps but to have that constantly on your mind and surrounding you, that is something that we have to address. You have to monitor this all the time. It is part of your life. And I have to say that it is something that I don't think any one of us would wish on anybody at all, even the persona that we don't like the most.  </p><p>But I--you were talking about before the correlation of the vitriol in posts targeting you and the amount of times they're shared or viewed, which means that as they continue and people like them, and they continue sharing them they are out there. And as you said before, you can't pull them back at all. So, for you, do you see that constantly continuing now in the sense that even though you have done everything you possibly can, it is still out there. </p><p>DUMPSON: Thank you, Congresswoman. And yes, every time that I do events like this, whether I am speaking to students, whether I am speaking on a panel, whether I'm speaking to Congress, anytime my name is out there, it's synonymous with hate crimes. It's synonymous with the Daily Stormer but then that--that provokes these online trolls to go out of their way to find me. So I've been personally monitoring one particular interview that I did with CNN, in September of last year and I've been monitoring it over the past year. And I've seen a number of trends within that just one comment thread alone. </p><p>That post was not just posted on--on YouTube. It's also been posted on Twitter. It's also been posted on Facebook and so I don't have the--I don't have the capacity to go and find all the different things with my name in it. It's impossible. And it's also very triggering for PTSD and depression and anxiety to read the threats that are directed at you every day. And so my mom and my dad try and get me not to read it but it's very important for me--it's very important for me to see it though because, unfortunately, because there are not protections in place at this current time, I don't have anybody else that's responsible for doing that. And so I'm going to be out here in the world going blind if I'm not going out of my way to monitor and make sure that I'm on top of my safety but that responsibility shouldn't rest on me. </p><p>MATSUI: Absolutely. You know, as we discussed, while Facebook or another company may remove a post for violence, these posts can be copied as happened with you and shared through alternative channels.  </p><p>Mr. Kendall, in your opinion--you know, why have social media companies struggled to address this phenomena? And are they devoting sufficient resources to tackling this problem? They say they have but what can we do to really encourage them to do so? </p><p>KENDALL: Well, I don't think they're doing enough.  </p><p>MATSUI: Yeah.  </p><p>KENDALL: And as I said earlier, I think it's--it's really just a function of incentives. Their incentives are to grow revenue and maximize profit because that keeps the valuation of their company high, that keeps their employees happy and retained. And it allows them to continue to dominate as a platform. So I just don't think the incentives are there. I think the capability is there. And we've seen that in their compliance with privacy. And--and I saw that when I was there in terms of their ability to marshal resources and--and technology know-how to solve really tough problems that were seemingly intractable but then they were able to solve. </p><p>MATSUI: So you're--you're basically privacy comes up an awful lot here. We always believe in our own privacy and how important that is. But to me from the discussion here, that privacy has come up an awful lot as the way to get into this as a cudgel, so to speak, to really alert them that we are looking at this in a way that would affect them, most importantly, where their bottom line is.  </p><p>So is that something that all you would agree to as far as trying to tackle this? Mr. Ginsberg?  </p><p>GINSBERG: Yeah, well, I would like to just point out what European countries have done--you know, there's a such a transatlantic divide between us struggling here with what to do with social media companies. And when you send an executive from Facebook or YouTube across the pond, they are actually facing a totally different much more strict regimen of laws that would hold them both also criminally liable for failing to take down the content within a certain period of time.  </p><p>I know that these laws obviously can't be replicated here. But the subcommittee would benefit I think, from understanding how many different national laws have been adopted to deal with these privacy issues. France, for example, is just about to pass a new hate law to in effect punish social media for doing precisely the type of activity that is so unfortunately affecting Ms. Dumpson. </p><p>MATSUI: Thank you very much. We can go on and on with this conversation. Madam Chair, thank you. I yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentlelady yields back and now I'm recognizing member of the subcommittee, Mr. McNerney, for five minutes. </p><p>MCNERNEY: Well, I thank the chairwoman and I thank the witnesses, very--a tough testimony, very interesting and useful. And it seems to me that this is a bipartisan issue. Both sides want to move forward on this, so I look forward to seeing progress.  </p><p>My first comments are directed at Mr. Kendall. Last year, I sent a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg expressing my concerns about the conflict of interest at Facebook between their bottom line and addressing the spread of political disinformation. I asked a series of questions at the hearing about their content moderation practices and handling of disinformation. This includes the process of using third-party fact-checkers. Something that company often points to because they don't want to be quote arbitrators of truth.  </p><p>One of the questions I asked in the letter and Facebook failed to answer and then I asked again when they testified and they still fail to answer was about the average time it takes from when a suspicious content is posted on Facebook's platform for Facebook to flag the content for the third-party fact-checkers--for the third-party fact-checkers to review the content and for Facebook to take remedial action after review is completed.  </p><p>Despite Facebook's answer--failure to answer congressional inquiries, a journalist discovered that the--in the entire month of January only 300 pieces of Facebook content in the United States underwent third-party fact checking and that most of the content undergoing this process had been posted on Facebook's platform for a week or longer.  </p><p>Mr. Kendall, once content is posted on Facebook, what is the timeframe during which most of the sharing consumption and monetization occurs? </p><p>KENDALL: Congressman, thanks for the question. I couldn't--I don't have the expertise to--to answer that question. </p><p>MCNERNEY: Okay. Thank you. Well-- </p><p>KENDALL: --I have seen graphs around this--you know, or--you know, in my career, and certainly, when something is time relevant, and incendiary, it spreads very quickly, very fast, and it generates a tremendous amount of engagement. And so, I would say with--with time-sensitive, incendiary content--you know, you make a disproportionate amount of the money in the first 24 hours, possibly even the first hour. </p><p>MCNERNEY: Correct. That's--that's exactly my understanding. Would you agree that a company relying on content review process that isn't--like this one isn't prioritizing, addressing the spread of disinformation on this platform and that it doesn't have a real incentive to do so. </p><p>KENDALL: I would agree.  </p><p>MCNERNEY: Thank you. The American public does deserve more than a press release. Every time a social media company announces that they have taken down a fake account. </p><p>UNKNOWN: (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>MCNERNEY: I'm sorry. They--I have to start that sentence over again. The American public deserves more than a press release every time a social media company announces that they have taken down a fake account or when they're looking into making a minor change around the edges, which is what they usually do. With 40 days to go until the election and with early voting and mail already getting underway, I am extremely concerned that these companies aren't doing enough.  </p><p>Mr. Kendall, what meaningful steps should social media companies being taken--taking right now to combat the spread of social-political disinformation on their platforms? </p><p>KENDALL: Well, I think it's--it's hard for me to know exactly how the resources are allocated. I haven't been there for--for--for 10 years. But it seems to me that the same amount of resources that they have applied to driving this sort of unprecedented engagement, both in terms of the technology and financial resources but also the people should be applied to these systemic and societal problems. </p><p>MCNERNEY: They have the resources, there's no question in my mind about that. </p><p>Mr. Ginsberg, President Trump has repeatedly repeated--retweeted posts by alt-right programmers and promoters and conspiracy theorists. The President of the United States has even gone on to quote fascists like Mussolini. What are the consequences when the government is calling a group a terrorist organization in one breath and the president is supporting their idea in another? </p><p>GINSBERG: It's very dangerous. I mean, I can record it directly to the QAnon phenomena where there's hundreds of thousands of accounts that have crossed the pond then ricocheted back with even more radical content. And they--and obviously, the president is a central player in this QAnon phenomenon. So he, in effect has become the hero among the most virulent Neo-Nazis German as the--as the new leader of this QAnon initiative to do--to defend the state in Germany. I mean, could you be as any surprised as I am that Mr. Trump is a hero in Germany to the largest Neo-Nazi group in Europe? </p><p>MCNERNEY: Thank you. I yield back.  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: And I now recognize Congresswoman Dingell who I know was here at the beginning and I'm glad to see that you're here now for your five minutes for questions. </p><p>DINGELL: Thank you, Madam Chairman. Thanks for holding this hearing which is really critical and thank you to all of the witnesses that are here today.  </p><p>During this pandemic, we all are feeling more isolated than ever, which has left more people turning to the internet and social media in search of community. I have great concern that the pandemic and the isolation caused by it will exasperate this issue that we're talking about today. I'm really concerned about how this country is being divided by fear and hatred and how it is threatening the safety and security of individuals as we've seen in Ms. Dumpson's testimony but I've seen with other people that I know in my very own community, which I'll talk to, hopefully before our end.   </p><p>Extremist groups recruit and radicalize individuals by finding people who are socially isolated and give them a sense of belonging. And now, due to the necessary measures to combat COVID-19 people find themselves like they have nobody to talk to or connect to, which is putting them at greater risk of being brought in by these extremist groups. So it's crucial that we examine the impact that COVID-19 has had on this, the proliferation of extremist content, and the measures we need to take to combat radicalization division and hate.  </p><p>This is of critical importance. I think I'm going to move directly given time to something that impacts my own community, which is home to one of the largest Arab American populations in the country. It's well documented that militia and extremist groups have used platforms such as Facebook to organize events, often including a call to arms designed to intimidate specific communities, such as the Muslim and Arab communities, and incite violence. I quite frankly, have had people outside my home with assault weapons. Me. Myself. So I really know firsthand, I probably shouldn't have said that publicly because I don't want to see more of them.  </p><p>And many of these instances, pages and events are reported to Facebook but the companies don't give a damn. They show a pattern of negligence in responding to or removing the content that promotes violence against vulnerable communities. In July 2020, Relman Colfax released their civil rights audit report of Facebook's policies and practices. The report detailed the need for further investment in addressing and studying organized hate against Muslims and other targeted groups on the platform. These findings were presented clear and present danger to these groups and inaction continues to contribute to the violence being perpetuated against these communities in the United States and abroad.  </p><p>Mr. Kendall, I listened to the testimony and the many thoughtful questions and answers today. There's a lot of ideas out there. We talked about changing incentives. But what else can be done to hold companies accountable when these communities are targeted on the platforms? </p><p>KENDALL: Well, I think at the moment, from a policy standpoint, the only thing that is at least by virtue of the policy that leads to a takedown of content is when violence is inside it. But as I mentioned earlier, if you incite hate and rage, or demonize that group that doesn't get taken down. But we all know that that kind of content leads to violence. It's just not directly connected to the platform, right, because the violence wasn't planned on the platform, at least not explicitly.  </p><p>And so I think that we've got to get clear on some sort of gradient around hate speech, even when it doesn't incite violence explicitly because we all know it leads to it. And so I think lawmakers need to ideally work with the companies to figure out from a gradient standpoint, what is the line at which an opinion becomes hate speech and when that line gets crossed, I think that--I think the content needs to either be flagged or taken down. </p><p>DINGELL: So, Madam Chairwoman, I do want to request unanimous consent to submit for the record the civil rights audit report conducted by Relman Colfax and the press release by Muslim advocates detailing multiple cases where Facebook was warned of the hateful content and failed to take direct actions.  </p><p>I've very little time left, Mr. Kendall, but how--what's violence? Is being outside somebody's home with an assault weapon violence? Or is that hate? Or is that fear? How do we protect free speech but keep somebody safe? How do we actually have or shape these standards? How--I think it's something we've got to do. We really need to be worried about what's happening in this country.  </p><p>KENDALL: Congresswoman, I think you got to start somewhere. I think you could start by doing it in the first place. You know, I think that there were probably similar challenges with pornography and similar challenges with--with nudity on certain platforms where that's not a legality issue but these platforms are somehow able to keep all nudity off. Now, that's a little bit more objective.  </p><p>But pornography is in instances is--is much more subjective and much more nuanced and gray but we tackle that challenge. And we now have technologies in place that help us with that. And I just feel like there's got to be a way to do that with respect to hate language. </p><p>DINGELL: I agree. Thank you.  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Ans as for your requests, your documents will be added at the end of the hearing. And I see that the chairman of the full committee, Frank Pallone, is here and I'm happy to recognize you for five minutes. </p><p>PALLONE: Thank you, Chairman Schakowsky. I was down on the floor, dealing with the energy package.  </p><p>I did want to comment though on what the ranking member, Mr. Walden, said about police ambush attacks, I thought he implied that these should be attributed to left-wing extremists. But unfortunately, police are targeted by extremists of all sorts. In fact, two recent ambush-style attacks perpetrated by right-wing extremists were motivated by the Boogaloo movements ideology. So I hope that this hearing addresses extremism without partisan finger-pointing because I think it comes from both the left and the right.  </p><p>I wanted to start with Ambassador Ginsberg. We all know the platform share talking points, hate speech has no place in our platform, violence, and extremism are not tolerated here. There's no safe haven for terrorists on our site. But far too often that rhetoric doesn't match the reality. Hateful and violent common is running rampant on most platforms.  </p><p>Early this year, it took repeated pleas to Facebook from--from my--from my friend, Rabbi Kotler (SP) who's from Lakewood. And we got together with him and government officials to get a local Ocean CountyNew Jersey hate group's page removed. But soon after it was removed, the group started several new pages. So it's--it's very hard to get these, these things changed. And I went through it myself with some of the anti-Semitic rhetoric that was on there.  </p><p>Ambassador Ginsberg, you've stated in the past that you often find extremist material on social media sites before the social media company itself finds it. Can you expand on that? How effective are social media platforms in dealing with extremist content? And what more could they be doing? </p><p>GINSBERG: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well, it really comes down to technology and what technology companies like Facebook are willing to adopt. I've explained in my prior comments that Facebook's algorithms are not able to detect extremist content, for example, that is used by extremist groups in other languages, even Yiddish.  </p><p>And so for example, there's technology out there that is called machine learning technology that would train the algorithms to more expeditiously identify extremist content if Facebook would allow this third-party technology to peer into its API, which is in effect, the Holy Grail or the cliff notes of their algorithms. And that's the problem. I have not seen any instance, where Facebook or any other platform has permitted any third-party to look into the under--the underbelly of their algorithms because of, I think, they're afraid that we will find out that they really don't want to see a complete 100 percent takedown of extremist content.  </p><p>PALLONE: So you're talking about more transparency about the algorithms or whether--or the ability to evaluate and improve them? Is that basically what you're discussing, you want to talk a little more about that, the transparency and how you know that if the research is if experts had access, they would be able to improve them and prevent extremism? </p><p>GINSBERG: Yes, absolutely. And I think the reason is that their legal counsel in each of these companies serve as bars to having this technology adopted because these counsel and I've been told this by Facebook's product counsel, that they do not want to introduce third-party technologies with fear that courts would interpret that as having these platforms accept responsibility for content and therefore could have perhaps vitiate Section 230. So you're in a vicious circle here. </p><p>PALLONE: Well, let me ask you one thing. There's about a minute left. What role--oh--you know, actually, I wanted to ask Mr. Kendall. Mr. Kendall, if I can move to you. There's about a minute left here on my time. What about personalization? What role does personalization play in--in amplifying radical content? </p><p>KENDALL: I think it's central, Congressman. You know, Facebook has an unrivaled ability to deliver content to the right person at the right time and the exact right way. And so right now, what they've created I'm concerned about is 3 billion or nearly 3 billion echo chambers, individual echo chambers that just reinforce what people believe. And--and unfortunately, and I don't think this is with the intention by the leaders there. Unfortunately, the algorithm moves people to more radical positions over time because that movement is good for business. If the content that I show you tomorrow is more incendiary, I believe you're going to spend more time on the platform and that means that more revenue is generated. </p><p>PALLONE: All right, thanks a lot. Thank you, Chairwoman. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you. And it looks like maybe last but not least, the people who have not spoken yet. The vices chair of the committee, Mr. Cardenas. You are recognized for five minutes. </p><p>CARDENAS: Thank you, Madam Speaker. And thank you so much for having this important hearing.  </p><p>I have a letter in my hand. That has to do with what highlights the escalation of hate on online platforms and the need for civil rights advocacy in the social media and content modernization space. I would like to submit this letter from the National Hispanic Media Coalition for the record. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Without objection. </p><p>CARDENAS: Thank you so much, Madam Speaker. And thank you all for your testimony today and especially Ms. Dumpson for your bravery, and for sharing your personal ordeal. </p><p>2,200 ads. 2,200 is the number of ads the current president administration has run on Facebook referring to Latino immigrants as, quote, \"an invasion.\" It took 12 hours for a person to drive across the state of Texas to El Paso. The New York Times reported that 19 minutes before the first 911 call alerted the authorities to a mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, a hate-filled, anti-immigrant manifesto appeared online.  </p><p>Twenty-three people, the majority of which are Mexican Americans, died in August of 2019 due to what was referred to in the whites supremacist manifesto as \"Hispanic invasion in Texas.\" This is not a one-off issue. White supremacist groups are increasing their use of social media as a tool to distribute the message of hate to a loyal and captive audience.  </p><p>My first question is to you Ms.--Ms. Dumpson, and once again, thank you so much for your bravery. According to the FBI annual report in 2017, hate crimes overall spiked by 17 percent were more than half of the reported crimes were motivated by race. In 2018, they increased even more reaching a 16-year high in 2018. Based on your experience, Ms. Dumpson, to what extent does inaction by social media companies contribute to the manifestation of online hate in the real world? </p><p>DUMPSON: Thank you, Congressman.  </p><p>Unfortunately, silence is complicity and when social media companies fail to act, they are complicit in the violence that's spread. They're complicit in the harm that is cause and they perpetuate these kinds of acts in the future. Unfortunately, when these companies don't use their platforms for good, they allow these things to like, as you said, run rampant. They allow their platforms to be utilized in this way. And so by failing to act I--I--it leaves me to only wonder what other intent do you have your platform to be used? And what other way can you desire your platform to be used?  </p><p>But this is precisely why I shared in my testimony that I've been working with a very diverse coalition of NGOs led by the ADL, the NAACP, The Color of Change, LULAC and others to engage these corporations and over 60 social media celebrities reaching out to billions of followers through the Stop Hate for Profit campaign, which has been calling on Facebook and social media companies to better address hate on their platforms. But, in particular, these--this coalition hasn't succeeded with Facebook yet and so I truly do think that congressional legislation action is needed. </p><p>CARDENAS: Thank you, Ms. Dumpson.  </p><p>Anti-immigrant groups demonize immigrants by promoting theories and conspiracies online that paint immigrants as outsiders who are planning to invade the country and take it over. Some anti-immigrant activists, for example, have embraced it. Aztlan or Reconquista conspiracy theory, the idea that Mexican immigrants are plotting to take over the southwestern part of the United States. This theory uses fear and hate to prop up claims that Mexican immigrants do not want to assimilate into American society.  </p><p>Ambassador Ginsberg, what is being done to mitigate hate in America and harassment aimed at the immigrant, Latino, and communities of color on social media? (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>GINSBERG: Clearly, Congressmen, totally not enough and we were most concerned about the role the Russian government and extremist groups that are anti-immigrant are using subsidiaries in Eastern Europe to promote anti-immigrant accounts in the United States. And as you all know, that anybody can enter into a queue and on theory, an anti-immigrant component, and when you add the QAnon phenomenon to the--to the extremists that are being promoted by Russian trolls to in effect, attack immigrant groups and minority groups in the United States, it's a real toxic swamp. And I do not see anything near the velocity of takedowns by social media companies, which already they are well aware of this phenomena and this danger. </p><p>CARDENAS: Thank you, Ambassador Ginsberg. And my time has expired. I yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: And now, after having waited through most of this hearing and I thank you for that, I recognize Bill Johnson for five minutes. </p><p>JOHNSON: Madam Chairman, thanks for--for letting me sign on to--to the committee hearing today. This is an important one and--and Ms. Dumpson, I tell you, no one should have to go through what you've gone through and that's what makes the topic of today's hearing so vitally important.  </p><p>Mr. Donahue back in 2016, I served on the House Energy and Commerce and Judiciary Committee's joint Encryption Working Group. One of the recurring takeaways from several meetings was the need for increased collaboration between tech companies and law enforcement, particularly law--local law enforcement agencies that don't really have the resources that are enjoyed by the FBI or large police departments like the New York Police Departments, which you've worked for previously.  </p><p>We heard that many of these smaller departments don't know who to call or what resources are available to them when they need assistance from a tech company. This is particularly concerning as the use of encryption is prevalent and the use of social media platforms by extremist groups continues to grow. So I understand at the New York Police Department, you were involved in policing strategy and intelligence as part of your responsibilities. Did your responsibilities include working with technology companies? And if so, what was your experience? </p><p>DONAHUE: Thank you very much, Congress member.  </p><p>I--I actually want to borrow something from--what something that Ms. Dumpson said a little bit earlier. That the police are generally not technologically savvy and that holds true with the majority of police departments in the United States. You know, the majority of police departments in United States have fewer than 15 police officers for their jurisdiction. That's--that's the fact. That 65 percent of the police departments of the 18,000 only have 15 officers or less and the--to expect that they're all cognizant of the technology companies and the work that the technology companies do or how to extract evidence that's in plain sight about harassment, or violence, the calls to violence is--is actually asking too much.  </p><p>Now there are-- </p><p>JOHNSON: --Did you--did you actually work with any technology companies in your role to try and get some of that information? </p><p>DONAHUE: So the answer is yes. And the answer is there were varying degrees of success. And over the course of our time, in dealing with the big ones, Google, Facebook, Twitter, they were--they were relationships that were formed ad hoc, and those types of relationships can't endure over the course of time. There needs to be structures in place and places where police can rely on working closely with the tech companies because 18,000 people over the course of--you know, 365 days, the likelihood of getting the right person on the phone at the right time is almost impossible.  </p><p>There are, as I said a little bit earlier, there are fusion centers that help channel that information back to the--to the companies but there are no phone numbers, no way to get in contact with the--with the social media companies for a smaller jurisdiction that--that would make it easy to engage for life safety purposes, or to get evidence of the crimes that happened to Ms. Dumpson. </p><p>JOHNSON: Okay. </p><p>DONAHUE: According to the crime center and that's the fact. </p><p>JOHNSON: All right, well, let me--let me--let me ask you another question. And in your testimony, you stated that major law enforcement associations are working to establish a framework to improve reporting mechanisms between the public law enforcement and social media service providers and that's encouraging to hear. So what suggestions do you have to those that are focused on that issue? What suggestions do you have for improving this critical relationship between tech companies and law enforcement? And--and is there a role for Congress to play in that? I mean, I'm--I'm not a big regulation guy. You know, I think--I think market-driven solutions and--and keeping the solutions at the local level is most important but is there something Congress should be doing? </p><p>DONAHUE: So there are--there's frameworks that are being worked on by the International Association of Chiefs of Police and National Fusion Center Associations. Those--those ideas about bringing people to the table and--and specifically to what you say is how can Congress force that the--the social media companies to the table and I think that's--that's essential.  </p><p>That's the cudgel and--and whether it's a responsible framework for--for providing and building those--those channels through the Fusion Centers or through major organizations, they can be supported through--through grants to--to Bureau of Justice Assistance to help improve technology assistance to law enforcement. So there are--there are ways to help that happen. But it has to be with the--with the social media company. They cannot walk away from their obligations because we're seeing what happens in the streets in America. </p><p>JOHNSON: Okay, Madam Chairman, my time is expired. Thanks, again, for letting me hop onto  the committee. And I appreciate it very much.  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you for your participation. </p><p>Normally, we would end up this point, I just wanted to ranking member, Ms. Rogers, if she would allow one more question, each of us. I certainly want one if you can and then adjourn so that we can make it to the vote. </p><p>RODGERS: That's fine.  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Okay, so I wanted to ask Mr. Kendall, a question. I did watch you on the--the social dilemma, that wonderful documentary. And one of the things that you talked about is that platforms are able to actually tweak algorithms for whatever they need. I don't know. Maybe that's the ammonia factor that you were talking about like with the tobacco companies. And--and so they can manipulate those--those things.  </p><p>But what I really wanted to get to is, what are the things? You're saying--I mean--I've heard apology after apology from Mr. Zuckerberg, I mean, ad nauseam. And oh, too bad about the genocide in Myanmar. We missed that. Sorry. Oops. But the kinds of things that we can do and I want to ask you about 230, the--the clause that allows for protecting these media companies from any kind of liability. At least, that's the way it's been interpreted. How important is it for us to change that? And I also wanted to then to ask, Mr. Ginsberg, to respond to that. 230.  </p><p>KENDALL: Congresswoman, thank you. I think it's critically important. I'm not--I'm not exactly sure where to draw the lines from the standpoint that I do think section 230 was--was instrumental in allowing some of these companies at the outset to innovate and create--and create these platforms in the first place. But I do think at a certain size, these--these technology platforms do become media companies and--and I think at that point need to be treated as such. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you. And can I also hear--did he leave?  </p><p>GINSBERG: No, I'm still here.  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Oh, there you are. Okay. </p><p>GINSBERG: Madam Chairwoman--Chairman, the fact is that Section 230 has been, as an effect, been the beneficiary of $33 million in lobbying effort by social media companies to avoid it being amended in Congress. I would remove its liability, remove their--their immunity from content liability.  </p><p>They even went so far as shoving Section 230 on to the USMCA in order to make it more difficult for Congress to amend it. There's no doubt in my mind and in the mind of most people who have examined this that without removing the content immunity granted under Section 230, these companies will never assume the type of obligation that you the members of Congress need to have them assume. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: I thank you for that. Is this one of the most important or are there other are just a couple more that we should add to the list of things we should--we should be considering? </p><p>GINSBERG: I also--I'd also would just make one more recommendation. In the absence of an amendment to Section 230, I do think that the Congress should consider how to encourage the advertising industry to do more to leverage their influence to insist that social media companies do more because these advertising industries, companies are interested in brand safety. Well, brand safety is going out the window the more radicalization occurs and so they need to do more and they need to step up. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Mr. Kendall, do you have any last advice to us too? </p><p>KENDALL: Well, I really like Mr. Ginsberg's point about, look, let's--let's definitely hold the technology companies accountable. But let's also look at who is--who's--who's paying the technology companies and I think they bear some--some responsibility. So I think the advertising industry can certainly help--help us change. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Right. Well, thank you. </p><p>Ms. Rogers, did you want to ask a question? </p><p>RODGERS: Well, given that they've called votes, I think I'm going to say thank you to all of our--our--our panelists today, our witnesses. Your--your perspectives were all very insightful and helpful. I think in all of this also, it underscores the importance of us as Congress taking action on privacy to--to really further hold companies accountable for how they are collecting data and how they're using that data and selling that data. I think that it's--it's one of the--it's only been underscored during COVID that--that there is not trust and--and it was underscored again today. There's not trust between citizens and these--the companies and how data is being used and--and--and--and then we have all these kind of stories that are very concerning.  </p><p>So I--I think there's a lot of work to be done. I want to say thanks for being here. And thank you chair for your leadership on this. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you so much. </p><p>(INAUDIBLE) to just before we adjourn. I definitely want to thank all of our witnesses. It was really, really important--this--I think one of the most important hearings that--that we've had that really cries out now, I believe for congressional action.  </p><p>Before closing, we have some documents that I will read into the record and I request unanimous consent to enter the following documents into the record. They include a statement by Representative Malinowski; a blog post by Neil Freed (SP) entitled, quote, Time for the--Time for the Section 30 Pendulum to Swing, unquote; a letter from CCIA and NetChoice; a letter from Julia Sanchez (SP), senior fellow at the Cato Institute; a letter from Will Duffy--I'm sorry, Duffield, policy analyst at the Cato Institute; a letter from the Humane Society Legislative Fund; a letter from--let's see, who is that? </p><p>A letter from Consumer Reports; a letter from the National Hispanic Media Coalition, Facebook Civil Rights Audit Final Report; a press release from the Newseum Advocates (SP) entitled, quote, Facebook Ignores Warning about Event Page Abuse. And that--those are the--the documents and without objection, so ordered.  </p><p>I remind members who really aren't here right now, that pursuant to committee rules that they have 10 business days to submit additional questions for the record. But I do want to ask witnesses who may get those questions to answer and respond as promptly as--as possible. And at this point, the subcommittee, with additional thanks though, one more time. This subcommittee is adjourned. </p><p>KENDALL: Thank you very much. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YF-DKV1-F15W-H01N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

GREG WALDEN (R-ORE.), EX-OFFICIO </p><p>[*]DOYLE: The committee will now come to order. The chair now recognizes himself for five minutes, for an opening statement.  </p><p>Online content moderation has largely enabled the Internet experience that we know today. Whether it's looking up restaurant reviews on Yelp, catching up on S&amp;O on YouTube or checking in on a friend or a loved one on social media, these are all experiences that we've come to know and rely on. </p><p>And the platforms we go to do these things have been enabled by user generated content, as well as the ability of these companies to moderate that content and create communities. </p><p>Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, has enabled that ecosystem to evolve. By giving online companies the ability to moderate content, without equating them to the publisher or speaker of that content, we've enabled the creation of massive online communities of millions and billions of people to come together and interact. Today, this committee will be examining that world that Section 230 has enabled, both the good and the bad. </p><p>I'd like to thank the witnesses for appearing before us, today. Each of you represents important perspectives, related to the content moderation and the online ecosystem. Many of you bring up complex concerns in your testimony. And I agree that this is a complex issue. </p><p>I know that some of you have argued that Congress should amend 230, to address things such as online criminal activity, disinformation and hate speech. And I agree. These are serious issues. </p><p>Like too many other communities, my hometown of Pittsburgh has seen what unchecked hate can lead to. Almost a year ago, our community suffered the most deadly attack on Jewish Americans, in our nation's history. The shooter did so, after posting a series of anti-Semitic remarks on a friend's site, before finally posting that he was going in. </p><p>A similar attack occurred in New Zealand and the gunman streamed his despicable acts on social media sites. </p><p>And while some of these sites move to quell that the spread of that content, many didn't move fast enough and the algorithms meant to help sports highlights and celebrity selfies go viral, helped amplify a heinous act. </p><p>In 2016, we saw similar issues, when foreign adversaries used the power of these platforms against us to disseminate disinformation and foment doubt, in order to sew division and instill distrust in our leaders and institutions. Clearly, we all need to do better and I would strongly encourage the witnesses before us, that represent these online platforms and other major platforms, to step up. </p><p>The other witnesses on the panel bring up serious concerns with the kind of content available on your platforms and the impact that content is having on society. And as they point out, some of those impacts are very disturbing. You must do more to address these concerns. </p><p>That being said, Section 230 doesn't just protect the largest platforms, or the most fringe websites. It enables common sections on individual blogs, people to leave honest and open reviews and free and open discussion about controversial topics. </p><p>The kind of ecosystem that has been enabled by more open online discussions has enriched our lives and our democracy. </p><p>The ability of individuals to have voices heard, particularly, marginalized communities, cannot be understated. The ability of people to post content that speaks truth to power has created political movements in this country and others that have changed the world we live in. </p><p>We all need to recognize the incredible power this technology has good, as well as the risk we face, when it's misused. </p><p>I want to thank you all, again, for being here and I look forward, today, to our discussion. And I'd now like to yield the balance of my time to my good friend, Ms. Matsui. </p><p>MATSUI: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the witnesses for being here, today. In April, 2018, Mark Zuckerberg came before Congress and said, \"It was my mistake and I'm sorry,\" when pushed about Facebook's role in allowing Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election. Fast-forward, 555 days, I fear that Mr. Zuckerberg may not have learned from his mistake. </p><p>Recent developments confirm what we have all feared. Facebook will continue to allow ads that push falsehoods and lies, once again making its online ecosystem fertile ground for election interference in 2020. </p><p>The decision to remove blatantly false information should not be a difficult one. The choice between deepfakes, hate speech, online bullies and a fact driven debate should be easy. If Facebook doesn't want to play referee about the truth in political speech, then they should get out of the game. </p><p>I hope this hearing produces a robust discussion because we need it now, more than ever. </p><p>Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Thank you. </p><p>DOYLE: Thank you. Gentlelady yields back. Chair now recognizes Mr. Latta, Ranking Member for the subcommittee for five minutes, for his opening statement. </p><p>LATTA: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding today's hearing and thank you very much to our witnesses for appearing before us. And again, welcome to today's hearing on content moderation and a review of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. </p><p>This hearing is a continuation of a serious discussion we began last session, as to how Congress should examine the law and ensure accountability and transparency for the hundreds of millions of Americans using the Internet, today. </p><p>We have an excellent panel of witnesses that represent a balanced group of stakeholders who are far more closely tied to Section 230. They range from large to small companies, as well as academics and researchers. </p><p>Let me be clear, I'm not advocating that Congress repeal the law. Nor am I advocating for Congress consider niche carve outs that could lead to a slippery slope of the death by 1,000 cuts that some have argued would up end the Internet industry, if the law was entirely repealed. </p><p>But before we discuss whether or not Congress should make modest nuance modifications to the law, we should first understand how we got to this point. It is important to look at Section 230 in context and when it was written. At the time, the decency portion of Telecom Act of 1996, included other prohibitions on objectionable or lewd content that polluted the early Internet. </p><p>Provisions that were written to target obscene content were automatically struck down by the Supreme Court but the Section 230 provisions remain. Notably, CDA 230 was intended to encourage Internet platforms that interactive computer services like CompuServe, America Online, to proactively take down offensive content.  </p><p>As Chris Cox stated on the House floor, \"We want to encourage people like Prodigy, like CompuServe, like America Online, like the new Microsoft Network, to do everything possible for us, the consumer, to help us control, at the portals of our computer, at the front door of our house, what comes in and what our children see.\" </p><p>It is unfortunate, however, that our courts took such a broad interpretation in Section 230, simply granting a broad liability protection, without platforms, having to demonstrate that they are doing quote, \"everything possible.\" </p><p>Instead of encouraging use of the sword that Congress envisioned, numerous platforms have hidden behind the shield and used procedural tools to avoid litigation with having, without having to take the responsibility. </p><p>Not only are good Samaritans sometimes being selective in taking down harmful or illegal activity, but Section 230 has been interpreted so broadly that bad Samaritans can skate by without accountability. </p><p>That's not to say all platforms never use the tools afforded by Congress. Many do a great, I think we do great things. Many of the bigger platforms are making billions, and that's with a B, accounts annually. </p><p>But often times, these instances are the exception, not the rule. Today, we will dig deeper into those examples and learn how platforms decide to remove content, whether it's with the tools provided by Section 230, or with their own self constructed terms of service. Under either authority, we should be encouraging enforcement to continue. </p><p>Mr. Chairman, I thank you for holding this important hearing, so that we can have an open discussion on Congress; intent of CDA 230 and if we should reevaluate the law. We must ensure the platforms are held reasonably accountable for activity on their platform, without drastically affecting the innovative startups. </p><p>And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. </p><p>DOYLE: Gentleman yields back. I should have mentioned, this is a joint hearing, between our committee and the Committee on Consumer Protection and Commerce. And I would like to recognize the chair of that committee for five minutes, Ms. Schakowsky. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and good morning and thank all the panelists for being here, today. </p><p>The Internet certainly has improved our lives in many, many ways and enabled Americans to more actively participate in society, education and commerce. </p><p>Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act has been at the heart of the United States Internet policy, for over 20 years. Many say that this law allowed free speech to flourish, allowing the Internet--the Internet to grow into what it is today. </p><p>In the early days of the Internet, it was intended to encourage online platforms to moderate user generated content to remove offensive, dangerous and, or illegal content. </p><p>The Internet has come a long way, since the law was first enacted. The amount and sophistication of user postings has increased exponentially. Unfortunately, the number of Americans who report experiencing extremism, extreme online harassment, which includes sexual harassment, stalking, bullying and threats of violence, have gone up, over the last two years. Thirty seven percent of users say that they have experienced that, this year. </p><p>Likewise, extremist, extreme, extremism, hate speech, election interference and other problematic content is proliferating. The spread of such content is problematic, that's for sure, and actually causes some real harm that multibillion-dollar companies, like Facebook, Google and Twitter, can't or won't fix. </p><p>And if this weren't enough cause--if this weren't enough cause for concern, more for profit businesses are attempting to use Section 230 as a liability shield actively that they can, that they have nothing to do with third party content or content moderation policy. </p><p>In recent, in a recent Washington Post article, Uber executives seem to be open, opening the door to claims to claiming fast immunity from labor, criminal and local traffic liability, based on Section 230. </p><p>This would represent a major unraveling of 200 years of social contract, community, social contracts, community governance and congressional intent. </p><p>Although, also, at issue is the Federal Trade Commission's Section 5, authority on unfair or deceptive practices. The FTC pursues Section 5 cases on website generated content. But the terms of service violations for third party content may also be precluded by the 230 immunity. </p><p>I wanted to talk a bit about injecting 230 into trade agreements. It seems to me that we've already seen that now in the Japan Trade Agreement and there is a real push to include that now in the Mexico, Canada, U.S. Trade Agreement. There is no place for that. I think that the laws in these other countries don't really accommodate what the United States has done about 230. </p><p>The other thing is, we are having a discussion, right now, an important conversation about 230. And in the midst of that conversation, because of all the new developments, I think it is just inappropriate, right now, at this moment, to insert this liability protection into--into trade agreements. </p><p>And as a member of the working group that is helping to negotiate that agreement, I am pushing hard to make sure that it just isn't there. I don't think we need to have any adjustment to 230. It just should not be in trade agreements. </p><p>So, all of the issues that we are talking about, today, indicate that there may be a larger problem, that 230 no longer is achieving the goal of encouraging platforms to protect their users. And today, I hope that we can discuss holistic solutions, not talking about eliminating 230 but having a new look at that, in the light of the many changes that we are seeing into the world of big tech, right now. </p><p>We want to, I look forward to hearing from our witnesses and how it can be made even better for consumers. And I yield back. Thank you </p><p>DOYLE: Gentlelady yields back. Chair now recognizes the Ranking Member of the committee, Ms. McMorris Rodgers. </p><p>MCMORRIS RODGERS: Good morning. Welcome to today's joint hearing on online content management. As a Republican leader on the Consumer Protection in Commerce Subcommittee, my priority is to protect consumers, while preserving the ability for small businesses and startups to innovate. In that spirit, today we are discussing online platforms and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. </p><p>In the early days of the Internet, two companies were sued for content, posted on their website by users. One company sought to moderate content on their platform. The other did not. </p><p>In deciding these cases, the court found the company that did not make any content decisions was immune from liability. But the company that moderated content was not. </p><p>\"It was after these decisions that Congress created Section 230. Section 230 is intended to protect, quote \"interactive computer services from being sued over what users post, while also allowing them to moderate content that may be harmful, illicit or illegal.\" </p><p>This liability protection has played a critically, a critical and important role in the way we regulate the Internet. It's allowed small businesses and innovators to thrive online, without the fear of frivolous lawsuits from bad actors, looking to make a quick buck. </p><p>Section 230 is also largely misunderstood. Congress never intended to provide immunity only to websites who are, quote, \"neutral.\" Congress never wanted platforms to simply be neutral conduits but in fact, wanted platforms to moderate content. The liability protection also extended to allow platforms to make good faith efforts to moderate material that is obscene, lewd, excessively violent or harassing. </p><p>There is supposed to be a balance to the use of Section 230. Small Internet companies enjoy a safe harbor to innovate and flourish online, while also incentivizing companies to keep the Internet clear of offensive and violent content by empowering these platforms to act and to clean up their own site. </p><p>The Internet also revolutionized the freedom of speech by providing a platform for every American to have their voice heard and to access an almost infinite amount of information, at their fingertips. </p><p>Medium and other online logs have provided a platform for anyone to write an op-Ed. Wikipedia provides free in-depth information on almost any topic you can imagine, through mostly user generated and moderated content. </p><p>Companies that started in dorm rooms and garages, are now global powerhouses. We take great pride in being the global leader in tech and innovation. But while some of our biggest companies certainly have grown, have they matured? </p><p>Today, it's often difficult to go online without seeing harmful, disgusting or somewhat illegal content. To be clear, I fully support free speech and believe society strongly benefits from open dialogue and free expression online. </p><p>I know that there's been some calls for big government to mandate or dictate free speech or ensure fairness online. And it's coming from both sides of the island. </p><p>So, I share similar concerns that others have expressed and that are driving some of these policy proposals. I do not believe these proposals are consistent with the first amendment. </p><p>Republicans successfully fought to repeal the FCC's fairness doctrine for broadcast regulation, during the 1980s. And I strongly caution against advocating for a similar doctrine, online. </p><p>It should not be the FCC, FTC, or any government agency' job to moderate free speech, online. Instead, we should continue to provide oversight of big tech and their use of Section 230 and encourage constructive discussions on the responsible use of content moderation. </p><p>This is a very important question that we're going to explore, today, with everyone on the panel, how do we ensure that companies with enough resources are responsibly earning their liability protection? We want companies to benefit, not only from the shield but also use the sword Congress afforded them to rid their sites of harmful content. </p><p>I understand it's a delicate issue and certainly very nuanced. I want to be very clear. I'm not for gutting Section 230. It's essential for consumers and entities in the Internet ecosystem. Misguided and hasty attempts to amend or even repeal Section 230, for bias or other reasons, could have unintended consequences for free speech and the ability for small businesses to provide new and innovative services. </p><p>But at the same time, it's clear, we've reached a point where it's incumbent upon us, as policymakers, to have a serious and thoughtful discussion about achieving the balance on Section 230. </p><p>I thank you for the time and I yield back. </p><p>DOYLE: Gentlelady yields back. Chair now recognizes Mr. Pallone, chairman of the full committee for five minutes, for his opening statement. </p><p>PALLONE: Thank you, Chairman Doyle. The Internet is one of the single greatest human innovations. It promotes free expression, connections and community. It also fosters economic opportunity with trillions of dollars exchanged online, every year. </p><p>And one of the principal laws that paved the way for the Internet to flourish is Section 230, of the Communications Decency Act, which of course, is part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. And we enacted this section to give platforms the ability to moderate their sites, to protect consumers, without excessive risk of litigation and to be clear, Section 230 has been an incredible success. </p><p>But in the 20 years, since Section 230 became law, the Internet has become more complex and sophisticated. In 1996, the global Internet reached only 36 million users, or less than 1 percent of the world's population. Only one in four Americans reported going online, every day.  </p><p>Compare that to now, when nearly all of us are online, almost every hour that we're not sleeping. Earlier this year, the Internet passed 4.39 billion users, worldwide. And here in the U.S., there are about 230 million smart phones that provide Americans instant access to online platforms. </p><p>The Internet has become a central part of our social, political and economic fabric in a way that we couldn't have dreamed of, when we passed the Telecommunications Act. </p><p>And with that complexity and growth, we also have seen the darker side of the Internet grow. Online radicalization has spread, leading to mass shootings in our schools, churches and movie theaters. International terrorists are using the Internet to groom recruits. Platforms have been used for the illegal sale of drugs, including those that sparked the opioid epidemic. </p><p>Foreign governments and fraudsters have pursued political disinformation campaigns, using new technology, like deepfakes, designed to sew civil unrest and disrupt democratic elections. </p><p>And there are constant attacks against women, people of color and other minority groups. And perhaps, most despicable of all, is the growth and horrendous sexual exploitation of children online. </p><p>In 1998, there were 3,000 reports of material depicting the abuse of children, online. Last year, 45 million photo and video reports were made. And while platforms are now better at detecting and removing this material, recent reporting shows that law enforcement officers are overwhelmed by the crisis. </p><p>And these are all issues that we can't ignore and tech companies need to step up with new tools to help address these serious problems. Each of these issues demonstrates how online content moderation has not stayed true to the values underlying Section 230, and has not kept pace with the increasing importance of a global Internet. </p><p>And there's no easy solution to keep this content off the Internet. As policymakers, I'm sure we all have our ideas about how we might tackle the symptoms of poor content moderation online, while also protecting free speech. But we must seek to fully understand the breadth and depth of the Internet, today, how it's changed and how it can be made better. We have to be thoughtful, careful and bipartisan, in our approach. </p><p>So, it's with that in mind that I was disappointed that Ambassador Lighthizer, U.S. Trade Representative, refused to testify, today. The U.S. has included language, similar to Section 230, in the United States, Mexico, Canada Agreement and the U.S. Japan Trade Agreement. Ranking member Walden and I wrote to the ambassador in August, raising concerns about why the USTR has included this language in trade deals, as we debate them, across the nation. </p><p>And I was hoping to hear his perspective on why he believes that that was appropriate because including provisions in trade agreements that are controversial to both Democrats and Republicans, is not the way to get support from Congress, obviously. </p><p>So hopefully, the ambassador will be more responsive to bipartisan requests, in the future. And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. </p><p>DOYLE: Gentleman yields back. Chair would to like remind members that, pursuant to committee rules, all member's written opening statements shall be made part of the record. </p><p>WALDEN: Can I be made part of that? </p><p>DOYLE: Oh, I apologize. The chair now yields to my good friend, the Ranking Member Walden. </p><p>WALDEN: Oh, how times have changed. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>DOYLE: For five minutes </p><p>WALDEN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to welcome our witnesses, today. Thank you for being here. It's really important work. And I will tell you at the outset, we've got another subcommittee meeting upstairs. So, I'll be bouncing in between. But I have all your testimony and really look forward to your comments. </p><p>It's without a question, a balanced roster of experts in this field. So, we're really blessed to have you here. In last Congress, we held significant hearings that jump started the discussion on the state of online protections, as well as the legal basis underpaying the modern Internet ecosystem, as you've heard today. </p><p>And of course, the future of content moderation is algorithms now determine much of what we see online. That's an issue our constituents want to know more about. </p><p>Today, we'll undertake a deeper review of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act portion of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. </p><p>In August of this year, as you just heard, Chairman Pallone and I raised the issue of the appearance of export language mirroring Section 230 in trade agreements. We did that in a letter to the U.S. Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer. </p><p>We expressed concerns of this Internet policy being taken out of the context of its intent and that, in the future, the Office of the United States Trade Representative should consult our committee, in advance of negotiating on these very issues. </p><p>Unfortunately, we have learned that derivative language of Section 230, appeared in an agreement with Japan and continues to be advanced in other discussions. We're frustrated about that and I hope the administration's paying attention and listening because they haven't up to this point, on this matter. </p><p>The USTR does not appear to be reflecting the scrutiny, the administration itself says they're applying to how CDA 230's being utilized in American society. That makes it even more alarming for the USTR to be exporting such policies, without the involvement of this committee. </p><p>Be clear, this section of the '96 Telecom Act served as a foundation for the information age. So, we're here, by no means to condemn but rather to understand what truly is and see that the entirety of this section is faithfully followed, rather than cherry picking just a portion. </p><p>But I want to go back to the trade piece. This is, you know, I thought the letter to the ambassador was going to send the right message. We're not trying to blow up USTR., or USMCA. I voted for every trade agreement, going forward. I'm a big free trader. But we're getting blown off on this and I'm tired of it. So, let it be clear. </p><p>And then we found out it's in the Japan Agreement. So, you know, clearly, they're not listening to our committee, or us. So, we're serious about this matter. We've not heard from the USTR and this is a real problem. So, take note. </p><p>If we all refer to Section 230 as the 26 words that created the Internet, as has been popularized by some who are already missing the mark, since by our word count, which you can use software to figure out, that excludes the good Samaritan obligations in Section C2. </p><p>So, we should start talking more about that section as the 83 words that can preserve the Internet. All of the sections and provisions of CDA 230 should be clearly taken together and not apart. And many of our concerns can be readily addressed, if companies just enforce their terms of service. </p><p>To put that in better context, I believe a quick history lesson is in order. Today's Internet looks a lot different than the days that CompuServe and Prodigy and the message boards dominated the Internet in the '90s. While the Internet is more dynamic and content rich than ever before, there were problems in its infancy managing the vast amounts of speech, occurring online. </p><p>As our friend Chris Cox, former member, the author of the legislation, alum of this committee, pointed out on the House floor during debate over his amendment, \"No matter how big the army of bureaucrats, it's not going to protect my kids because they do not think the federal government will get there in time.\" That's his quote. </p><p>So, Congress recognized then, as we should now, that we need companies to step up to the plate and curb harmful and illegal content from their platforms. The Internet's not something to be regulated and managed by government. </p><p>Upon enactment of CDA 230, clearly bestowed on providers and users the ability to go after the illegal and harmful content, without fear of being held liable in court. Now, while the law was intended to empower, we have seen social media platforms slow to clean up sites, while being quick to use immunity from legal responsibility for such content. </p><p>In some cases, Internet platforms have clearly shirked their responsibility for the content on their platforms. The broad liability shield now in place, through common law, has obscured the central bargain that was struck. And that is the Internet platforms with user generated content are protected from liability, in exchange for the ability to make good faith efforts to moderate harmful and illegal content. </p><p>So, let me repeat for those that want to be included in the interactive computer services definition, enforce your own terms of service. </p><p>I look forward to an informative discussion, today, on the differentiating constitutionally protected speech from illegal content, how we should think of CDA 230 protections for smaller entities versus large ones, and how various elements Internet ecosystem shape what consumers see, or don't see. </p><p>So, with that, Mr. Chairman, thank you for having this hearing and I look forward to getting all the feedback from the witnesses. But indeed, I have to go up to the other hearing. So, thank you very much. </p><p>DOYLE: So, the administration doesn't listen to you guys either, huh. </p><p>WALDEN: I'll--my statement spoke for itself pretty clearly, I think. We'll find out if they're listening, or not. </p><p>DOYLE: Gentleman yields back. I will reiterate that members, pursuant to the committee rules, all member's written opening statements will be made part of the record.  </p><p>We now want to introduce our witnesses for today's hearing.  </p><p>Mr. Steve Huffman, Co-founder and CEO of Reddit, welcome. </p><p>Ms. Danielle Keats Citron, Professor of Law at Boston University School of Law, welcome. </p><p>Dr. Corynne McSherry, Legal Director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, welcome. </p><p>Ms. Gretchen Peters, Executive Director of the Alliance to Counter Crime Online, welcome. </p><p>Ms. Katherine Oyama, Global Head of Intellectual Property Policy for Google, welcome. </p><p>And Dr. Hany Farid, Professor at the University of California at Berkley. </p><p>Welcome to all of you. We want to thank you for joining us, today. We look forward to your testimony. At this time, the chair will recognize each witness for five minutes to provide their opening statement.  </p><p>Before we begin, I'd like to explain our lighting system. In front of you is a series of lights. The light will, initially, be green at the start of your opening statement. The light will turn yellow, when you have one minute remaining. Please wrap up your testimony, at that point. When the light turns red, we just cut your microphone off. No, we don't but try to finish before then. </p><p>So, Mr. Huffman, we're going to start with you and you're recognized for five minutes. </p><p>HUFFMAN: Thank you, good morning. Chairpersons, Ranking Members, members of the committee, thank you for inviting me. My name is Steve Huffman. I'm the co-founder and CEO of Reddit and I'm grateful for this opportunity to share why 230 is critical to our company and the open Internet. </p><p>Reddit moderates content in a fundamentally different way than other platforms. We empower communities and this approach relies on 230. Changes to the 230 pose an existential threat, not just to us, but to thousands of startups, across the country. And it would destroy what little competition remains in our industry. </p><p>My college roommate and I started Reddit in 2005, as a simple user powered forum to find news and interesting content. Since then, it's grown into a vast community driven site, where millions of people find, not just news and a few laughs, but new perspectives and a real sense of belonging. </p><p>Reddit is communities, communities that are both created and moderated by our users. Our model has taken years to develop, with many hard lessons learned, along the way. </p><p>As some of you know, I left the company in 2009 and for a time, Reddit lurched from crisis to crisis, over questions of moderations that we are discussing, today. </p><p>In 2015, I came back because I realized the vast majority of our communities were providing an invaluable experience for users and Reddit needed a better approach to moderation. </p><p>The way Reddit handles content moderation, today, is unique in the industry. We use a governance model akin to our own democracy, where everyone follows a set of rules, has the ability to vote and to self-organize and ultimately, share some responsibility for how the platform works. </p><p>First, we have our content policy, the fundamental rules that everyone on Reddit must follow. Think of these as our federal laws. We employ a group, including engineers and data scientists, collectively known as the anti-evil team, to enforce these policies. </p><p>Below that, each community creates their own rules, state laws, if you will. These rules, written by our volunteer moderators, themselves, are tailored to the unique needs of their communities, and tend to be far more specific and complex than ours. The self-moderation our users do every day is the most scalable solution to the challenges of moderating content, online. </p><p>Individual users play a crucial role, as well. They can vote up or down on any piece of content, posts or comments, and report it to our anti-evil team. Through this system of voting and reporting, users can accept or reject any piece of content, thus, turning every user into a moderator. </p><p>The system isn't perfect. It's possible to find things on Reddit that break the rules but its effectiveness has improved with our efforts. Independent academic analysis has shown our approach to be largely effective in curbing bad behavior. And when we investigated Russian attempts at manipulating our platform in 2016, we found that, of all accounts that tried, less than 1 percent made it past the routine defenses of our team, community moderation and simple down votes from everyday users. </p><p>We also constantly evolve our content policies. And since my return, we've made a series of updates addressing violent content, deepfake pornography, controlled goods and harassment. </p><p>These are just a few of the ways we've worked to moderate in good faith, which brings us to the question of what Reddit would look like, without 230. For starters, we'd be forced to defend against anyone with enough money to bankroll a lawsuit, no matter how frivolous. It's worth noting that the cases most commonly dismissed under 230, are regarding defamation. </p><p>As an open platform where people are allowed to voice critical opinions, we'd be a prime target for these, effectively enabling censorship, through litigation. </p><p>Even targeted limits to 230 will create a regulatory burden on the entire industry, benefiting the largest companies by placing a significant cost on smaller competitors. While we have 500 employees and a large user base, normally more than enough to be considered a large company, in tech today, we are an underdog, compared to our nearest competitors, who are public companies 10 to 100 times our size. </p><p>Still, we recognize that there's truly harmful material on the Internet and we are committed to fighting it. It's important to understand that, rather than helping, even narrow changes to 230 can undermine the power of community and hurt the vulnerable. </p><p>Take the opioid epidemic, which has been raised in discussions on 230. We have many communities on Reddit where users struggling with addiction can find support to help them on their way to sobriety. Were there a carveout on this area, hosting them may simply become too risky, forcing us to close them down. </p><p>This would be a disservice to people who are struggling. Yet, this is exactly the type of decision that restrictions on 230 would force on us. </p><p>Section 230 is a uniquely, American law with a balanced approach that has allowed the Internet and platforms like ours to flourish, while also incentivizing good faith attempts to mitigate the unavoidable downsides of free expression. </p><p>While these downsides are serious and demand to the attention of both, us in industry and you in Congress, they do not outweigh the overwhelming good that 230 has enabled. </p><p>Thank you. I look forward to your questions. </p><p>DOYLE: Thank you, Mr. Huffman. Ms. Citron, you're recognized for five minutes. </p><p>CITRON: (OFF-MIC)  Thank you for having me and for having such a thoughtful bench, with me on the panel. </p><p>When Congress adopted Section 230, 20 years ago, the goal was to incentivize tech companies to moderate content. And although Congress, of course, wanted the Internet, what they could imagine it, at that time, to be open and free, they also knew that openness would risk offensive material. And I'm going to use their words. </p><p>And so, what they did was devise an incentive, a legal shield for good Samaritans who were trying to clean up the Internet. Both accounting for the failure removed so under filtering and over filtering of content. </p><p>Now, the purpose of this statute was fairly clear but it's interpretation, the words weren't. And so, what we've seen our courts massively over extending Section 230, to sites that are irresponsible in the extreme and that produce extraordinary harm. We've seen the liability shield be applied to sites whose entire business model is abuse. So, revenge porn operators and sites that all they do is curate users deepfake sex videos, they get to enjoy immunity or in have from liability. </p><p>And interestingly, not only is it bad Samaritans who have enjoyed the legal shield from responsibility but it's also sites that really have nothing to do with speech. The traffic and dangerous goods, like armslist.com.  </p><p>And the costs are significant. This overbroad interpretation allows bad Samaritan sites, reckless irresponsible sites, to really have cost some people's lives. And I'm going to take the case of online harassment because I've been studying it for the past 10 years. </p><p>The costs are significant and, especially, to women and minorities. Online harassment that's often hosted on these sites is costly to people's central life opportunities. So, when a Google search of your name contains rape threats, your nude photo without your consent, your home address because you've been docs'd, and live defamation about you, it's hard to get a job and it's hard to keep a job. </p><p>And also for victims, they are driven off-line, in the face of online assaults. They are terrorized. They often change their names and they move. </p><p>And so, in many respects, the calculus, the free speech calculus, is not necessarily a win for free speech, as we're seeing really diverse viewpoints and diverse individuals being chased off-line. </p><p>So now, the market, I think ultimately, is not going to solve this problem. So many of these businesses, they make money off of online advertising and salacious, negative and novel content that attracts eyeballs. </p><p>So, the market itself, I don't think we can rely on, to solve this problem. So of course, legal reform. The question is, how should we do it. I think we have to keep Section 230. It has tremendous upsides. But we should return it to its original purpose, which was to condition the shield on being a good Samaritan, on engaging in what Ben Wittes and I have called reasonable content moderation practices. </p><p>Now, there are other ways to do it. In my testimony, I sort of, sort of draw up some solutions. But we've got to do something because doing nothing has cost. It says to victims of online abuse that their, their speech and their equality is less important than the business profits of some of these most harmful platforms. </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>DOYLE: Chair now recognizes Dr. McSherry for five minutes. </p><p>MCSHERRY: Thank you. As Legal Director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, I want to thank the chairs, Ranking Members, and members of the committee for the opportunity to share our thoughts with you, today, on this very, very important topic. </p><p>For nearly, excuse me, for nearly 30 years, EFF has represented the interests of technology users, both in court cases and in broader policy debates to help ensure that law and technology supports our civil liberties. </p><p>Like everyone in this room, we are well aware that online speech is not always pretty. Sometimes, it's extremely ugly and it causes serious harm. </p><p>We all want an Internet where we are free to meet, create, organize, share, debate and learn. We want to have control over our online experience and to feel empowered by the tools we use. </p><p>We want our elections free from manipulation and for women and marginalized communities to be able to speak openly about their experiences. </p><p>Chipping away at the legal foundations of the Internet, in order to pressure platforms to better police the Internet, is not the way to accomplish those goals. Section 230 made it possible for all kinds of voices to get their message out to the whole world, without having to acquire a broadcast license, own a newspaper or learn how to code. </p><p>The law has, thereby, helped remove much of the gatekeeping that once stifled social change and perpetuated power imbalances. And that's because it doesn't just protect tech giants. It protects regular people. </p><p>If you forwarded an email, a news article, a picture or piece of political criticism, you've done so with the protection of Section 230. If you maintained an online forum for a neighborhood group, you've done so with the protection of Section 230. If you use Wikipedia to figure out where George Washington was born, you benefited from Section 230. And if you are viewing online videos documenting events real time, in northern Syria, you're benefiting from Section 230. </p><p>Intermediaries, whether social media platforms, news sites or email forwarders, are protected by Section 230, just for their benefit. They're protected so they can be available to all of us. </p><p>There is another very practical reason to resist the impulse to amend the law to pressure platforms to more actively monitor and moderate user content. Simply put, they're bad at it. </p><p>As EFF and many others have shown, they regularly take down all kinds of valuable content, in part, because it's often difficult to draw clear lines between lawful and unlawful speech, particularly, at scale. And those mistakes often silence the voices of already marginalized people. </p><p>Moreover, increased liability risk will inevitably lead to over censorship. It's a lot easier and cheaper to take something down than to pay lawyers to fight over it, particularly, if you're a smaller business, or a nonprofit. </p><p>And automation is not the magical solution. Context matters very often when you're talking about speech and robots are pretty bad at nuance. For example, in December 2018, blogging platform Tumblr announced a new ban on adult content. In an attempt to explain the policy, Tumblr identified several types of content that would still be acceptable, under the new rules. Shortly thereafter, Tumblr's own filtering technology flagged those same images as unacceptable. </p><p>Here's a last reason. New legal burdens are likely to stifle competition. Facebook and Google can afford to throw millions at moderation, automation and litigation. Their smaller competitors, or would be competitors, don't have that kind of budget. So in essence, we would have opened the door to a few companies and then slammed that door shut for everyone else. </p><p>The free and open Internet has never been fully free or open. And the Internet can amplify the worst of us, as well as the best. But at root, the Internet still represents and embodies an extraordinary idea, that anyone with a computer device can connect with the world, tell their story, organize, educate and learn. </p><p>Section 230 helps make that idea a reality and it's worth protecting. </p><p>Thank you and I look forward to your questions. </p><p>DOYLE: Thank you, Dr. McSherry. Ms. Peters, you're recognized for five minutes. </p><p>PETERS: Thank you. Distinguished members of the subcommittee, it's an honor to be here, today, to discuss one of the premier security threats of our time, one that Congress is well-positioned to solve. </p><p>I'm the Executive Director of the Alliance to Counter Crime Online. Our team is made up of academic, security experts NGOs and citizen investigators who have come together to eradicate serious organized crime and terror activity on the Internet. </p><p>I want to thank you for your interest in our research and for asking me to join the panel of witnesses here, to testify. Like you, I hope to hear the testimony of the U.S. Trade Representative because keeping CDA 230 language out of America's trade agreements, is critical to our national security. </p><p>Distinguished committee members, I have a long history of tracking organized crime and terrorism. I was a war reporter and I wrote a book about the Taliban and the drug trade. That got me recruited by U.S. military leaders to support our intelligence community. </p><p>I mapped transnational crime networks and terror networks for special operations command, the DEA and CENTCOM. In 2014, I received State Department funding to map wildlife supply chains. And that's when my team discovered that the largest retail markets who are endangered species are actually located on social media platforms, like Facebook and WeChat.  </p><p>Founding the Alliance to Counter Crime Online, which looks at crime more broadly than just wildlife, has taught me the incredible range and scale of illicit activity happening online. It is far worse than I ever imagined. We can and must get this under control. </p><p>Under the original intent of CD 230, CDA 230, there was supposed to be a shared responsibility between tech platforms, law enforcement and organizations like ACCO. But tech firms are failing to uphold their end of the bargain. Because of broad interpretations by the courts, they enjoy undeserved safe harbor for hosting illicit activity. </p><p>Distinguished committee members, the tech industry may try and convince you, today, that most illegal activity is confined to the dark web but that's not the case. Surface web platforms provide much the same anonymity, payment systems and a much greater reach of people. </p><p>We're tracking illicit groups, ranging from Mexican drug cartels to Chinese triad that have weaponized social media platforms. I'm talking about U.S. publicly listed social media platforms to move a wide range of illegal goods. </p><p>Now, we're in the midst of a public health crisis, the opioid epidemic, which is claiming the lives of more than 60,000 Americans, a year. But Facebook, the world's largest social media company, only began tracking drug activity, drug postings on its platform, last year. And within six months, the firm identified 1.5 million posts selling drugs. That's what they admitted to removing. </p><p>To put that in perspective, that's 100 times more postings than the notorious dark website, the Silk Road, ever carried. </p><p>Study after study by ACCO members and others, have shown widespread use of Google, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, YouTube to market and sell Fentanyl, oxycodone and other highly addictive, often deadly substances, to U.S. consumers, in direct violation of U.S. law, federal law.  </p><p>Every major Internet platform has a drug problem. Why? Because there is no law that holds tech firms responsible, even when a child dies buying drugs on an Internet platform. Tech firms play an active role in facilitating and spreading harm. There algorithms, originally designed, well-intentioned, to connect friends, also help criminals and terror groups connect to a global audience. ISIS and other terror groups use social media, especially Twitter, to recruit, fund raise and spread their propaganda. </p><p>The ACCO Alliance, among others, includes an incredible team of Syrian archaeologists recording the online trafficking of thousands of artifacts, plundered from ancient sites and sold, in many cases, by ISIS supporters. This is a war crime. </p><p>We're also tracking groups on Instagram, Google and Facebook, where endangered species are sold, items ranging from rhino horn and elephant ivory to live chimpanzees and cheetahs. </p><p>In some cases, the size of these online markets is literally threatening species with extinction. I could continue to sit here and horrify you, all morning. Illegal dog fighting, live videos of children being sexually abused, weapons, explosives, human remains, counterfeit goods, it's all just a few clicks away. </p><p>Distinguished committee members, the tech industry routinely claims that modifying CDA 230 is a threat to freedom of speech. But CDA 230 is a law about liability, not freedom of speech. </p><p>Please try and imagine another industry in this country that has ever enjoyed such an incredible subsidy from Congress, total immunity, no matter what harm their product brings to consumers. Tech firms could have implemented internal controls to prevent illicit activity from occurring but it was cheaper and easier to scale, while looking the other way. </p><p>They were given this incredible freedom and they have no one to blame but themselves for squandering it. We want to see reforms to the law, to strip immunities for hosting terror and serious crime content, to regulate that firms must report crime and terror activity to law enforcement and appropriations to law enforcement to contend with this data. </p><p>Distinguished committee members, if it's illegal in real life, it ought to be illegal to post it online. It is imperative we reform CDA 230 to make the Internet a safer place for all. </p><p>Thank you very much. </p><p>DOYLE: Gentlelady yields back. Ms. Oyama, you're recognized for five minutes. </p><p>OYAMA: Chairman Doyle, Chairwoman Schakowsky, Ranking Members Latta and McMorris Rodgers, distinguished members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you, today. </p><p>I appreciate your leadership on these important issues and welcome the opportunity to discuss Google's work in these areas. My name is Katy Oyama and I'm the Global Head of IP Policy at Google. In that capacity, I also advise the company on public policy framework for the management and moderation of online content of all kinds. </p><p>At Google, our mission is to organize and make the world's information universally accessible and usable. </p><p>Our services and many others are positive forces for creativity, learning and access to information. This creativity and innovation continues to yield enormous economic benefits for the United States. However, like all means of communication that came before it, the Internet has been used for both, the best and worst of purposes. </p><p>And this is why, in addition to respecting local law, we have robust policies, procedures and community guidelines that govern what activity is permissible on our platforms and we update them, regularly, to meet the changing needs of both, our users and society. </p><p>In my testimony, today, I will focus on three areas, the history of 230 and how it has helped the Internet grow, how 230 contributes to our efforts to take down harmful content and Google's policies across our products. </p><p>Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act has created a robust Internet ecosystem where commerce, innovation and free expression thrive, while also enabling providers to take aggressive steps to fight online abuse. Digital platforms help millions of consumers find legitimate content, across the Internet, facilitating almost $29 trillion, in online commerce, each year. </p><p>Addressing legal content is a shared responsibility and our ability to take action on problematic content is underpinned by 230. The law not only clarifies when services can be held liable for third-party content but also creates the legal certainty necessary for services to take swift action, against harmful content of all types. </p><p>Section 230's good Samaritan provision was specifically introduced to incentivize the self-monitoring and to facilitate content moderation. It also does nothing to alter platform liability for violations of federal criminal laws, which are expressly exempted from the scope of the CDA. </p><p>Over the years, the importance of Section 230 has only grown and is critical in ensuring continued economic growth. A recent study found that, over the next decade, 230 will contribute an additional 4.25 million jobs and $440 billion in growth to the economy. </p><p>Furthermore, investors in the startup ecosystem have said that weakening online safe harbors would have a recession like impact on investments. </p><p>And internationally, 230 is a differentiator for the U.S. China, Russia and others take a very different approach to innovation and to censoring speech online, sometimes including speech that is critical of political leaders </p><p>Perhaps, the best way to understand the importance of 230 is to imagine what might happen, if it weren't in place. Without 230, search engines, video showing platforms, political blogs, startups, review sites of all kinds would either, not be able to moderate content at all, or they would over block, either way, harming consumers and businesses that rely on their services, every day. </p><p>Without 230, platforms could be sued for decisions around removal of content from their platform, such as the removal of hate speech, mature content or videos relating to pyramid schemes. And because of 230, we can and do enforce rigorous policies that ensure that our platforms are safe, useful and vibrant for our users. </p><p>For each product, we have a specific set of rules and guidelines that are suitable for the type of platform, how it is used and the risk of harm associated with it. These approaches range from clear content policies and community guidelines, with flagging mechanisms to report content that violates them, to increasingly effective machine learning that can facilitate removal of harmful content at scale, before a single human user has ever been able to access it. </p><p>For example, in the three month period from April to June, 2019, YouTube removed over 9 million videos from our platform for violating our community guidelines. And 87 percent of this content was flagged by machines first, rather than by humans. And of those detected by machines, 81 percent of that content was never viewed by a single user. </p><p>We now have over 10,000 people, across Google, working on content moderation. We've invested hundreds of millions of dollars for these efforts. </p><p>In my written testimony, I go into further detail about our policies and procedures for tackling harmful content on search, Google Ads and YouTube. </p><p>We are committed to being responsible actors who are part of the solution. Google will continue to invest in the people and the technology to meet this challenge. </p><p>We look forward to continued collaboration with the committee, as it examines these issues. </p><p>Thank you for your time and I look forward to taking your questions.  </p><p>DOYLE: Thank you. Dr. Farid, you have five minutes. </p><p>FARID: Chairman, chairwoman, ranking members, and members of both subcommittees, thank you for the opportunity to speak with you, today. </p><p>Technology, as you've already heard, and the Internet have had a remarkable impact on our lives and society. </p><p>Many educational, entertaining and inspiring things have emerged in the past two decades in innovation but at the same time, many horrific things have emerged; a massive proliferation of child sexual abuse material, the recruitment and radicalization of domestic and international terrorists, the distribution of illegal and deadly drugs, the proliferation of mis and disinformation campaigns, designed to sew civil unrest, incite violence and disrupt democratic elections, the proliferation of dangerous, hateful and deadly conspiracy theories, the routine and daily harassment of women and underrepresented groups in the forms of threats of sexual violence and revenge and nonconsensual pornography, small and large scale fraud and spectacular failures to protect our personal and sensitive data. </p><p>How, in 20 short years, did we go from the promise of the Internet to democratize access to knowledge and make the world more understanding and enlightened to this litany of daily harbors? A combination of naivete, ideology, willful ignorance and the mentality of growth at all cost, have led the Titans of tech to fail to install proper safeguards on their services. </p><p>The problem that we face today, however, is not new. As early as 2003, it was well known that the Internet was a boom for child predators. Despite early warnings, the technology sector dragged their feet through the early and mid-2000's and did not respond to the known problem at the time, nor did they put in place the proper safeguards to contend with what should have been the anticipated problems that we face today. </p><p>In defense of the technology sector, they are contending with an unprecedented amount of data, some 500 hours of video uploaded to YouTube, every minute, some one billion daily uploads to Facebook and some 500 million tweets, per day. </p><p>On the other hand, these same companies have had over a decade to get their houses in order and have simply failed to do so. And at the same time, they have managed to profit handsomely by harnessing the scale and volume of the data that's uploaded to their services, every day. </p><p>And these services don't seem to have trouble dealing with unwanted material, when it serves their interest. They routinely and quite effectively remove copyright infringement and they effectively remove legal, adult pornography because otherwise, their services would be littered with pornography, scaring away advertisers. </p><p>During its 2008 congressional testimony, Mr. Zuckerberg repeatedly invoked artificial intelligence, AI, as the savior for content moderation and we are told, 5 to 10 years. </p><p>Putting aside that it's not clear what we should do in the intervening decade or so, this claim is almost certainly overly optimistic. So for example, earlier this year, Facebook's chief technology officer showcased Facebook's latest AI technology for discriminating images of broccoli from images of marijuana. </p><p>Despite all of the latest advances in AI and pattern recognition, this system is only able to perform the task with an average accuracy of 91 percent. This means that, approximately, one in 10 times, the system is simply wrong. </p><p>At a scale of a billion uploads a day, this technology cannot possibly automatically moderate content. And this discrimination task is surely much easier than the task of identifying a broad class of child exploitation, extremism and disinformation material. </p><p>The promise of AI is just that, a promise. And we cannot wait a decade or more with the hope that AI will improve by some nine orders of magnitude, when it might be able to contend with automatic, online content moderation. </p><p>To complicate things even more, earlier this year, Mr. Zuckerberg announced that Facebook is implementing end to end encryption on its services, preventing anyone, the government, Facebook, from seeing the contents of any communications. Blindly implementing end to end encryption will make it even more difficult to contend with a litany of abuses that I enumerated at the opening of my remarks. </p><p>We can and we must do better, when it comes to contending with some of the most violent, harmful, dangerous and hateful content online by simply reject the naysayers that argue that it is to from a policy or technological perspective or those that say that reasonable and responsible content moderation will lead to the stifling of an open exchange of ideas. </p><p>Thank you and I look forward to taking your questions. </p><p>DOYLE: Thank you, Dr. Farid. Well, we've concluded our openings. We're going to move to member questions. Each member will have five minutes to ask questions of our witnesses. And I will start by recognizing myself for five minutes. </p><p>I have to say, when I said at the beginning of my remarks, this is a complex issue, it's a very complex issue. And I think we've all heard the problems. What we need to hear is solutions. </p><p>Let me just start by asking all of you, just by a show of hands, who thinks that online platforms could do a better job of moderating their content on their websites. So, that's unanimous and I agree. And I think it's important to note that we all recognize that content moderation online is lacking in a number of ways and that we all need to address this issue better.  </p><p>And if not, you who are the, you know, the platforms and the experts in this technology. And you put that on our shoulders, you may see a law that you don't like very much and that has a lot of unintended consequences for the Internet. </p><p>So, I would say to all of you, you need to do a better job. You need to have an industry getting together and discussing better ways to do this. The idea that you can buy drugs online and we can't stop that, to most Americans hearing that, they don't understand why that's possible, why it wouldn't be easy to identify people that are trying to sell illegal things online and take those sites down. </p><p>Child abuse, it's very troubling. On the other hand, I don't think anybody on this panel is talking about eliminating Section 230. So, the question is, what is, what is the solution between not eliminating 230 because of the effects that would have, just on the whole Internet, and making sure that we do a better job of policing this. </p><p>Mr. Huffman, Reddit is, you know, a lot of people know of Reddit but it's really a relatively small company, when you place it against some of the giants. And you host many communities and you rely on your volunteers to moderate discussions. But I know that you've shut down a number of controversial sub-Reddits that have spread deepfakes of violent and disturbing content, misinformation and dangerous conspiracy theories.  </p><p>But what would Reddit look like, if you were legally liable for the content your users posted, or for your company's decision to moderate user content in communities? </p><p>HUFFMAN: Sure, thank you for the question. What Reddit would look like would be, we'd be forced to go to one of two extremes. </p><p>In one version, we would stop looking. We would go back to the pre-230 era, which means, if we don't know, we're not liable. And that, I'm sure, is not what you intend and it's certainly not what we want. </p><p>It would be not aligned with our mission of bringing community and belonging to everybody in the world. </p><p>The other extreme would be to remove any content or prohibit any content that could be remotely problematic. And since Reddit is a platform where 100 percent of our content is created by our users, it fundamentally undermines the way Reddit works. </p><p>It's hard for me to give you an honest answer of what Reddit would look like because I'm not sure Reddit, as we know it, could exist in a world where we had to remove all user generated content. </p><p>DOYLE: Yeah. Dr. McSherry, you know, you talk about the risk to free speech, if Section 220 were being repealed or substantially altered. But what other tools could Congress use to incentivize online platforms to moderate dangerous content and encourage a healthier online ecosystem? What are--what would your recommendation be, short of eliminating 230? </p><p>MCSHERRY: Well, I think a number of the problems that we've talked about today, so far, which I think everyone agrees are very, very serious. And I want to underscore that, are actually often addressed by existing laws that target the conduct, itself. </p><p>So for example, in the armslist case, we had a situation where what armslist, the selling of the gun that was so controversial, was actually perfectly legal, under Wisconsin law. </p><p>Similarly, many of the problems that we've talked about, today, are already addressed by federal criminal laws that already exist. And so they are, Section 230 is not a barrier because, of course, there is a carve out for federal criminal laws. </p><p>So, I would urge this committee to look carefully at the laws that actually target the actual behavior that we are concerned about and, perhaps, start there. </p><p>DOYLE: Ms. Peters, you did a good job horrifying us with your testimony. What solution do you offer, short of repealing 230? </p><p>PETERS: I don't propose repealing 230. I think that we want to continue to encourage innovation in this country. It's our core economic, core driver of our economy. </p><p>But I do believe that, if CDA 230 should be revised, so that if something is illegal in real life, it is illegal to host it online. I don't think that that is an unfair burden for tech firms, certainly, some of the wealthiest firms in our country should be able to take that on. </p><p>I myself, have a small business. We have to run checks to make sure when we do business with foreigners, that we're not doing business with somebody that's on a terror blacklist. It isn't so difficult for companies like Google and Reddit to make sure that they're not hosting an illegal pharmacy-- </p><p>DOYLE: --I see my time is getting away, expired. So, but I thank you and I think we get the gist of your answer.  </p><p>Chairman now yields to my Ranking Member for five minutes. </p><p>LATTA: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And again, thanks to our witnesses. Ms. Oyama, if I could start with you. </p><p>A recent New York Times article outlined the horrendous nature of child sex abuse online and how it has exponentially grown, over the last decade. My understanding is tech companies are only legally required to report images of child abuse, only when they discover it. They're not required to actually look for it. </p><p>While I understand you make voluntary efforts to look for this type of content, how can we encourage platforms to better enforce their terms of service or proactively use their sword provided by subsection C2 of Section 230 to take good faith efforts to create accountability within platforms? </p><p>OYAMA: Thank you for the question and, particularly, for focusing on the importance to section C2 to incentivize platforms to moderate content. </p><p>I can say that, for Google, we do think that transparency is critically important. And so, we publish our guidelines. We publish our policies. We publish on YouTube a quarterly transparency report where we show, across the different categories of content, what is the volume of content that we've been removing. </p><p>And we also allow for users to appeal. So, if their content is stricken and they think that was a mistake, they also have the ability to appeal and track what is happening with the appeal. </p><p>So, we do understand that this piece of transparency is really critical to user trust and for discussions with policymakers on these critically important topics. </p><p>LATTA: Thank you. Ms. Citron, a number of defendants have claimed Section 230 immunity in the courts, some of which are tech platforms that may not use any user generated content, at all. Was Section 230 intended to capture those platforms? </p><p>CITRON: (OFF-MIC) I keep doing that. So, platforms that are solely responsible for the content, there's no user--the question is, there's no user generated content and it's their creating the content. That's the question without being covered by the legal shield in 230? I'm asking, is that the question? </p><p>LATTA: Right. </p><p>CITRON: Yeah, no, they would be responsible for the content that they created and developed. So Section 230, that legal shield would not apply. </p><p>LATTA: Thank you. Mr. Farid, are there tools available, like photo DNA or copyright ID, to flag the sale of illegal drugs online? If the idea is that platforms should be incentivized to actually scan their platforms and take down blatant illegal content, shouldn't key words or other indicators associated with opioids be searchable through an automated process? </p><p>FARID: The short answer is yes. There's two ways of doing content moderation. Once the material has been identified, typically by a human moderator, whether that's child abuse material, any illegal drugs, terrorism related material, whatever it is, that material copyright infringement can be fingerprinted, digitally fingerprinted, and then stopped from future upload and distribution.  </p><p>That technology has been well understood and has been deployed for over a decade. I think it has been deployed anemically, across the platforms and not nearly aggressively enough. That's one form of content moderation that works today.  </p><p>The second form of content moderation is what I call the day zero, finding the Christ Church video on upload, that is incredibly difficult and still requires law enforcement, journalists, or the platforms, themselves, to find. But once that content has been identified, it can be removed from future uploads.  </p><p>And I will point out, by the way, that today, you can go on to Google and you can type, \"buy Fentanyl online,\" and it will show you, in the first page, illegal pharmacies where you can click and purchase Fentanyl. That is not a difficult find. This is, we're not talking about the dark web. We're not talking things buried on page 20. It is on the first page. And in my opinion, there is no excuse for that. </p><p>LATTA: Let me follow up because you said it's anemic when some of the, what the platforms might be doing out there. You know, last year in this room, we passed over 60 pieces of legislation in dealing with the drug crisis that we have in this country, Fentanyl being one of them. And you just mentioned that anybody can just type in Fentanyl and you can find it. </p><p>Okay, because again, what we're trying to do is make sure we don't have, you know, the 72,000 deaths that we had in this country, you know, over a year ago, and with over 43,000 being associated with Fentanyl. </p><p>So okay, how do we go in to the platform and say, we have got to enforce this because we don't want this stuff flowing in from China. And how do we do that? </p><p>FARID: Well, this is what the conversation is. So, I'm with everybody else on the panel. We don't repeal 230 but we make it a responsibility, not a right., If your platform can be weaponized in the way that we have seen, across the board, a litany of things that I had in my opening remarks, surely, something is not working. If I can find on Google, in page one, and not just me, my colleagues on the table also, investigative journalists, we know this content is there. It's not hiding. It's not difficult. </p><p>And we have to ask the question, is that if a reasonable person can find this content, surely, Google with its resources, can find it, as well. And now, what is the responsibility. </p><p>And I think you said earlier, too, is that you should just enforce your terms of service. So, if we don't want to talk about 230, let's talk about terms of service. The terms of service of most of the major platforms are actually pretty good. It's just that they don't really do very much to enforce them in a clear, consistent and transparent way. </p><p>LATTA: Well, thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, my time has expired and I yield back. </p><p>DOYLE: Gentleman yields back. Chair now recognizes Ms. Schakowsky, chair for the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection for five minutes. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Oyama, you said in one of the sentences that you presented to us that, without 230, I want to see if there's any hands that would go up that we should abandon 230. Has anybody said that? Okay, so this is not the issue. This is a sensible conversation about how to make it better. </p><p>Mr. Huffman, you said, and I want to thank you for, we had a, I think, a really productive meeting yesterday, explaining to me what your organization does and how it's unique. But you also said in your testimony that Section 230 is a unique American law.  </p><p>And so, but yet, when we talked yesterday, you thought it was a good idea to put it into a trade agreement dealing with Mexico and Canada. If it's a unique American law, let me just say, that I think trying to fit it into the regulatory structure of other countries, at this time, is inappropriate. </p><p>And I would like to just quote, I don't know if he's here, from a letter that both, Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member Walden wrote, some time ago, to Mr. Lighthizer, that said, \"We find it inappropriate for the United States to export language mirroring Section 230, while such serious policy discussions are ongoing.\" </p><p>And that's what's happening, right now. We're having a serious policy discussion. But I think what the Chairman was trying to do, and what I want to do, is trying to figure out, what do we really want to do to amend or change, in some way. And so, again, briefly, if the three of you that have talked about the need for changes, let me start with Ms. Citron, what you want to see in 230. </p><p>CITRON: So, I'd like to bring the statute back to its original purpose, was to apply to good Samaritans who were engaged in responsible and reasonable content moderation practices. And we have the language to change the statute that would condition that we're not going to treat a provider or user of an interactive service.  </p><p>That engages in reasonable content moderation practices as a publisher or a speaker. So, it would keep the immunity with conditions-- </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: --Let me just suggest that, if there's language, I think we'd like to see a suggestion. Ms. Peters, if you could, and I think you pretty much scared us, as to what is happening and then, how we can make 230 responsive to those concerns. </p><p>PETERS: Thank you for your question, Chair Schakowsky. We would love to share some proposed language with you about how to reform 230 to protect better against organized crime and terror activity on platforms. </p><p>One of the things I'm concerned about that lot of tech firms are involved in is when they detect illicit activity or it gets flagged to them by users, their response is to delete it and forget about it. </p><p>What I'm concerned about is that two things. Number one, that essentially, is destroying critical evidence of a crime. It's actually helping criminals to cover their tracks, as opposed to a situation like what we have for the financial industry and even aspects of the transport industry. If they know that illicit activity is going on, they have to share it with law enforcement and they have to do it in a certain timeframe. </p><p>I certainly want to see the content removed. But I don't want to see it simply deleted. And I think that is an important distinction. I would like to see a world where the big tech firms work, collaboratively, with civil society and with law enforcement to root out some of these evil entities that are-- </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: --I--I--I--I'm going to cut you off, just because my time is running out and I do want to get to Dr. Farid with the same thing. So, we would welcome concrete suggestions. </p><p>FARID: Thank you. I agree with my colleague, Professor Citron. I think 230 should be a privilege, not a right. You have to show that you're doing reasonable content moderation. </p><p>I think we should be worried about the small startups. If we start regulating now, the ecosystem will become even more monopolistic. So, we have to think about how do we make carveouts, or small platforms who can now compete where these companies did not have to deal with that regulatory pressure. </p><p>And the last thing I will say is, the rules have to be clear, consistent and transparent. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Thank you. I yield back. </p><p>DOYLE: Chair now recognizes Ms. McMorris Rodgers for five minutes. </p><p>MCMORRIS RODGERS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Section 230 was intended to provide online platforms with a shield from liability, as well as a sword to make good faith efforts to filter, block or otherwise address certain offensive content online. </p><p>Professor Citron, do you believe companies are using the sword enough and if not, why do you think that is? </p><p>CITRON: We are seeing the dominant platforms. So, I've been working with Facebook and twitter for about eight years. And so, I would say the dominant platforms and folks on this panel, at this point, are engaging in what I would describe at a broad level, is fairly reasonable content moderation practices. </p><p>I think they could do far better on transparency about what they mean by when they forbid hate speech. What do they mean by that? What's the harm that they want to avoid? And examples. And they could be more transparent about the processes that they use when they make decisions, right, to have more accountability. </p><p>But what really worries me are the, sort of, renegade sites, as well, the 8chans, who foment incitement with no moderation, dating apps that have no ability to ban impersonators and have IP addresses and frankly, sometimes, it's the biggest of providers, not the small ones who know they have a legality happening on their platforms and do nothing about it. </p><p>MCMORRIS RODGERS: And why are they doing that, why are they-- </p><p>CITRON: --Because of Section 230 immunity. So, the dating app Grindr comes to mind, hosting impersonations of someone's X and the person was using Grindr to send thousands of men to this man's home. Grindr heard 50 times from the individual who was being targeted, did nothing about it. Finally, when they responded, after getting a lawsuit, their response is, our technology doesn't allow us to track IP addresses. But Grindr is fairly dominant in this space.  </p><p>But when the person went to SCRUFF, it's a smaller dating site. The impersonator was, again, you know, posing as the individual, sending men to his home and SCRUFF responded right away. They said, we can ban the IP address and took care of it. </p><p>So, I think the notion that the smaller versus large, by my lights, is there's good practices, responsible practices and irresponsible, harmful practices. </p><p>MCMORRIS RODGERS: Okay, thank you for that. Mr. Huffman and Ms. Oyama, your company policies specifically prohibit illegal content or activities on your platforms. </p><p>Regarding your terms of services, how do you monitor content on your platform to ensure that it does not violate your policies? Maybe I'll start with Mr. Huffman. </p><p>HUFFMAN: Sure, so in my opening statement, I described the three layers of moderation that we have on Reddits. Our company's moderation and our team, this is the group that, both writes the policies and enforces the policies. </p><p>Primarily, the way they work is enforcing these policies at scale. So, looking for aberrational behavior, looking for known problematic sites or words. We participate in the cross industry, hash sharing, which allows us to find images, for example, exploitative of children that are shared, industry wide, or for fingerprints, thereof. </p><p>Next are our community moderators. These are the people who, these are users and then, following up the users themselves, those two groups participate together in removing content that's inappropriate for their community and in violation of our policies. We have policies against hosting--our content policy is not very long but one of the points is, no illegal content. So, no regulated goods, no drugs, no guns, anything of that sort, controlled-- </p><p>MCMORRIS RODGERS: --So, you're seeking it out and if you find it, then you get it off the platform. </p><p>HUFFMAN: That's right because 230 doesn't provide us criminal liability protection. And so, we're not in the business of committing crimes or helping people commit crimes. That would be problematic for our business. So, we do our best to make sure it's not on our platform. </p><p>MCMORRIS RODGERS: Thank you. Ms. Oyama, would you address that and then, just what you are doing, if you find that illegal content? </p><p>OYAMA: Thank you, yes. Across YouTube, we have very clear content policies we publish, both online. We have YouTube videos that give more examples and some specific ways so people understand. </p><p>We are able to detect, of the 9 million videos that we removed from YouTube in the last quarter, 87 percent of those were detected first, by machines. So, automation is one very important way. </p><p>And then, the second way is human reviewers. So, we have community flagging or any user that sees problematic content can flag it and follow what happens with that complaint. We also have human reviewers that look and then, we're very transparent in explaining that. </p><p>When it comes to criminal activity on the Internet, you know, of course CDA 230 has a complete carveout. So, in the case of Grindr, you know, we have policies against harassment. But in the case of Grindr, where there was real criminal activity, my understanding is there's a defendant in that case and there's a criminal case for harassment and stalking, that are proceeding against him. </p><p>And so, in certain cases, you know, opioids again, controlled substance under criminal law, there's a section that says, I think, you know, controlled substances on the Internet, sale of controlled substances on the Internet, that's a provision. </p><p>In cases like that where there's actually a law enforcement role, we would, you know, if there's correct legal process, then we would work with law enforcement to, also, provide information under due process, or a subpoena. </p><p>MCMORRIS RODGERS: Thank you, okay. My time has expired. I yield back. </p><p>DOYLE: Thank you. Ms. DeGette, you're recognized for five minutes. </p><p>DEGETTE: Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. I really want to thank this panel. I'm a former constitutional lawyer, so, I'm always interested in the intersection between criminality and free speech. And in particular, Professor Citron, I was reading your written testimony, which you confirmed with Ms. Schakowsky about how Section 230 should be revised to both--to both continue to provide first amendment protections but also, to return the statute to its original purpose, which is to let companies act more responsibly, not less. </p><p>And in that vein, I want to talk, during my line of questioning, about online harassment because this is a real, sexual harassment, this is a real issue that has just only increased. Anti-defamation league reported that 24 percent of women and 63 percent of LGBTQ individuals, have experienced online harassment because of their gender or sexual orientation. </p><p>And this is compared to only 14 percent of men. And 37 percent of all Americans of any background, have experienced severe online harassment, which includes sexual harassment, stalking, physical threats and sustained harassment. </p><p>So, I want to ask you, Professor Citron, and also, I want to ask you, Ms. Peters, very briefly, to talk to me about how Section 230 facilitates illegal activities and do you think it undermines the value of those laws. And if so, how? Professor Citron. </p><p>CITRON: So, let me say that, in cases involving harassment, of course, there's a perpetrator and then, the platform that enables it. And most of the time, the perpetrators are not pursued by law enforcement. So, in my book, Hate Crimes in Cyberspace, I explore the fact that law enforcement really, they don't get the--they don't understand the abuse. They don't know how to investigate it. </p><p>In the case of Grindr, police, there were like 10 protective orders that were violated and law enforcement in New York has done nothing about it. So, it's not true that we can always find the perpetrator, nor especially in the cases of stalking, harassment and threats. </p><p>We see a severe under enforcement of law, particularly, when it comes to gendered harms. </p><p>DEGETTE: And that's really where it falls to the sites, then, to try to-- </p><p>CITRON: Right. </p><p>DEGETTE: --Protect. Ms. Peters, do you want to comment on that? </p><p>PETERS: I just wanted to say that, in this issue, there needs to be something akin to like a cyber restraining order so that, if somebody is stalking somebody on Grindr or OkCupid or Google, that site can be ordered to, you know, to block that person from communicating with the other. </p><p>DEGETTE: Okay, and even under Section 230 immunity, can platforms ignore requests to take down this type of material? </p><p>PETERS: They have.  </p><p>DEGETTE: Professor Citron, you're nodding your head. </p><p>CITRON: They do and they can, especially, if those protective orders are coming from state criminal law. </p><p>DEGETTE: Okay, I wanted to ask you, Dr. McSherry, sexual harassment continues to be a significant problem on Twitter and other social platforms. And I know Section 230 is a critical tool that facilitates content moderation. But as we've heard in the testimony, a lot of the platforms aren't being aggressive enough to enforce the terms and conditions. </p><p>So, what I want to ask you is, what can we do to encourage platforms to be more aggressive in protecting consumers and addressing issues like harassment? </p><p>MCSHERRY: I imagine this hearing will encourage many of them to do just that. </p><p>DEGETTE: But you know, we keep having hearings-- </p><p>MCSHERRY: --No, no, no, I understand. Absolutely. And I understand that. So, I actually think that many, many of the platforms are pretty aggressive, already, in their content moderation policies. I agree with what many have said here, today, which is that it would be nice, if they would start by clearly enforcing their actual terms of service, which we share a concern about because, often, they're enforced very inconsistently. </p><p>And that is very challenging for users. A concern that I have is, if we institute what I think is one proposal, which is that, whenever you get a notice, you have some duty to investigate. That can actually backfire for marginalized communities because one of the things that also happens is, if you want to silence someone online, one thing you might do is flood a service provider with complaints about them. </p><p>And then, they end up being the ones who are silenced, rather than the other way around. </p><p>DEGETTE: Dr. Farid, what's your view of that? </p><p>FARID: Pardon me. </p><p>DEGETTE: What's your view of what Dr. McSherry just said. </p><p>FARID: There is two issues at hand, here. When you do moderation, you risk over moderating or under moderating. What I would argue is we are way, way under moderated. </p><p>When I look at where we fall down and where we make mistakes and take down content we should, and I weigh that against 45 million pieces of content, just last year to NCMEC and child abuse material, and terrorism and drugs, the weights are imbalanced. We have to, sort of, rebalance and we have to try to get it right. </p><p>We are going to make mistakes but we're making way more mistakes in allowing content, right now, than we are on not allowing. </p><p>DEGETTE: Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. </p><p>DOYLE: Gentlelady yields back. Chair now recognize Mr. Johnson for five minutes. </p><p>JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and to you and to Chairman Schakowsky, for holding this very important hearing. You know, I've been in information technology for most of my adult life. And social responsibility has been an issue that I have talked about, a lot. </p><p>You know, in the absence of heavy-handed government and regulating, that's, I think, the absence of regulations are--is what has allowed the Internet and the social media platforms to grow, like they have.  </p><p>But I hate to--I hate to sound clicheish but that old line from the Jurassic Park movie, you know, sometimes we're more focused on what we can do, and we don't think about what we should do. </p><p>And so, I think that's--that's what we--where we find ourselves with some of this. We've heard from some of our witness's accessibility of a global audience through internet platforms as being used for illegal and illicit purposes, like terrorist organizations and even for the sale of opioids, which continues to severely impact communities across our nation, particularly, in rural areas like I live in in Eastern and Southeastern Ohio. </p><p>However, internet platforms also provide an essential tool for legitimate communication and the free, safe and open exchange of ideas, which has become a vital component of modern society in today's global economy. </p><p>I--I appreciate hearing from all of our witnesses as our subcommittees examine whether Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is empowering internet platforms to effectively self-regulate under this light touch framework. </p><p>So, Mr. Huffman, in your testimony, you discussed the ability of, not only Reddit employees but it's users to self-regulate and remove content that goes against Reddit's stated rules and community standards. </p><p>Do you think other social media platforms, for example, Facebook or YouTube, have been able to successfully implement similar self-regulating functions and guidelines? If not, what makes Reddit unique in their ability to self-regulate? </p><p>HUFFMAN: Sure. Thank you, Congressman. I am only familiar with the other platforms to the extent that you probably are, which is to say, I'm not an expert. </p><p>I do know that they are not sitting on their hands. I know they are making progress. But Reddit's model is unique in the industry in that we believe that the only thing that scales with users is users. </p><p>And so, when we're talking about user generated content, sharing some of this burden with those people in the same way that, in our society here in the United States, there are many unwritten rules about what is acceptable or not to say. </p><p>The same thing exist on our platforms. And by allowing and empowering our users and communities to enforce those unwritten rules, it creates an overall more healthy ecosystem. </p><p>JOHNSON: Okay. Ms. Oyama, in your testimony, you discussed the responsibility of determining which content is allowed on your platforms, including balancing respect for diverse  viewpoints and giving a platform for marginalized voices. </p><p>Would a system like Reddit's up votes and down votes impact the visibility of diverse viewpoints on platforms like YouTube? And do dislikes on YouTube impact the videos visibility? </p><p>OYAMA: Thank you for the question. As you've seen, users can give thumbs up or thumbs down to a video. It's one of many, many signals. So, it certainly wouldn't be determinative in terms of a recommendation of a video. On YouTube, that would mostly be for--for relevance. </p><p>And really appreciate your point about responsible content moderation. I did want to make the point that on the piece about harassment and bullying, we did remove 35,000 videos from YouTube just in the last quarter, and we can do this because of CDA 230. </p><p>Whenever someone's contents are removed, they may also be upset. So, there could be cases against a service provider for defamation for breach of contract. </p><p>And service providers, large and small, are able to have these policies and implement procedures to identify bad content and take it down because of the provisions of CDA 230. </p><p>JOHNSON: Okay. Well, I've got some other questions that I'm going to submit for the record, Mr. Chairman. But let me just summarize with this because I want to stay within my time, and you are going to require me to stay within my time. </p><p>So, you know, in the absence of regulations, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, that takes social responsibility to a much higher bar. </p><p>And I would suggest to the entire industry of the internet, social media platforms, we better get serious about this self-regulating, or you are going to force Congress to do something that you might not want to have done. With that, I yield back. </p><p>DOYLE: Gentleman yields back. Chair recognizes Ms. Matsui for five minutes. </p><p>MATSUI: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to, once again, thank the witnesses for being here today. Ms. Oyama and Mr. Huffman, last week, the Senate Intel Committee released a bipartisan report on Russia's use of social media. </p><p>The report found that Russia used social media platforms to sow sociology discord and influence the outcome of the 2016 election. </p><p>What role can Section 230 lay in ensuring that platforms are not used again to disrupt our political process? Ms. Oyama or Mr. Huffman, comments. </p><p>OYAMA: Thank you. Again, CDA 230 is critically important for allowing services like us to protect citizens and users against foreign interference in elections. </p><p>It's a critical issue, especially, with election cycle coming up. We found on Google across our systems in the 2016 election, fortunately, due to the measures we've been able to take in ad removals, there were only two accounts that had infiltrated our systems. </p><p>They had a spend of less than $5,000 back in 2016. And we continue to be extremely vigilant. So, we do publish a political ads transparency report. We require that ads are disclosed, who paid for them, they show up in a library, they need to be verified. </p><p>MATSUI: So, you feel that you are effective in-- </p><p>OYAMA: --We can always do more, but on this issue, we are extremely focused on it and working with campaigns to protect-- </p><p>MATSUI: Mr. Huffman.  </p><p>HUFFMAN: Yes, Congresswoman. So, in 2016, we found that the--we saw the same fake news and misinformation submitted to our platform as we saw on the others. </p><p>The difference is on Reddit, it was largely rejected by the community by the users long before it even came to our attention. </p><p>If there's one thing Reddit's good at or a community is good at its being skeptical and rejecting falsehoods or questioning everything for better or for worse. </p><p>MATSUI: Okay. </p><p>HUFFMAN: Between then and now, we've become dramatically better at finding groups of accounts that are working in a coordinated or an authentic matter and we collaborate with law enforcement. </p><p>So, based on everything we've learned in the past and can see going forward, I think we're in a pretty good position coming into the 2020 election. </p><p>MATSUI: Okay. Dr. Farid, in your written testimony you mentioned the proliferation of mis- and disinformation campaigns designed to disrupt democratic elections. </p><p>This sort of election interference really troubles me and a lot of other people. You mentioned there's more the platforms could be doing about moderating content online. What more should they be doing about this issue now this time? </p><p>FARID: Yeah. So, let me just give you one example. A few months ago, we saw a fake video of Speaker Pelosi-- </p><p>MATSUI: --Yes-- </p><p>FARID: --make the rounds, okay. And the response was really interesting. So, Facebook said, we know it's fake, but we are leaving it up. We are not in the business of telling the truth. </p><p>So, that was not a technological problem. That was a policy problem. That was not satire. It was not comedy. It was meant to discredit the speaker. So, I think fundamentally, we have to relook at the rules. </p><p>And, in fact, if you look at Facebook's rules, it says you cannot post things that are misleading or fraudulent. So, that was a clear case where the technology worked, the policy is unambiguous, and they simply failed to implement the policy. </p><p>MATSUI: They failed, okay. </p><p>FARID: To YouTube's credit, they actually took it down. And to Twitters discredit, they didn't even respond to the issue. </p><p>So, in some cases, there is a technological issue. But more often than not, we are simply not enforcing the rules that are already in place. </p><p>MATSUI: So, that's a decision that they made not to enforce the rules. </p><p>FARID: Right. </p><p>MATSUI: Okay. Ms. Oyama and Mr. Huffman, what do you think about what Mr. Farid just said? </p><p>HUFFMAN: Sure, I'll respond. There are two aspects to this. First, specifically, towards Reddit's, we have a policy against impersonation. </p><p>MATSUI: Okay. </p><p>HUFFMAN: So, a video like that can, both, be used to manipulate people or service, you know, misinformation. It's also raises questions about the veracity of the things that we see and here and prompts important discussions. </p><p>So, the context about whether around whether a video like that stays up or down on Reddit is really important. And those are difficult decisions. I will observe that we are entering into a new era-- </p><p>MATSUI: --Right-- </p><p>HUFFMAN: --where we can manipulate videos. We've historically been able to manipulate text and images with Photoshop, and now, videos. </p><p>So, I do think, not only do the platforms have a responsibility, but we as a society have to understand that the source of materials, for example, which publication is critically important because there will come a time, no matter what any of my tech peers say, where we will not be able to detect that sort of fakery. </p><p>MATSUI: Exactly. And, Ms. Oyama, I only have 15 seconds. </p><p>OYAMA: Thank you. I mean, on the specific piece of content that you mentioned, YouTube, we do have a policy against deceptive practices-- </p><p>MATSUI: --Exactly-- </p><p>OYAMA: --and removed it. But there is ongoing work that needs to be done to be able to better identify deep fakes. I mean, of course, even comedians sometimes use them. </p><p>But in political context or other places that could severely undermine democracy and we have opened up data sets. We're working with researchers to build technology that can better detect when media is manipulated in order for those policies to-- </p><p>MATSUI: --Well, I appreciate the comment. I have a lot more to say but you know how this is. But anyway, I'm going to yield back the balance of my time. Thank you. </p><p>DOYLE: Gentlelady yields back. Chair recognizes Mr. Kinzinger for five minutes. </p><p>KINZINGER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you all for being here today. We very much appreciate it. It's interesting on the last line of questions, I was--you know, one of the best things about democracy is our ability to have free speech and share opinions, but this can also be something that, you know, is a real threat. </p><p>So, I think the Chairman for yielding. And I think it's safe to say that not every member of Congress has a plan for what to do about Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. </p><p>But I think we all agree that the hearing is warranted. We need to have a discussion about the origins and intent of that section and whether the companies that enjoy these liability protections are operating in the manner intended. </p><p>And I'll state up front, that I generally appreciate the efforts certain platforms have made over the years to remove and block unlawful content. But I would also say that it's clearly not enough. And that--that status quo is unacceptable. </p><p>It's been frustrating for me in recent years that my image and variations of my name have been used by criminals to defraud people on social media. And this goes back 10 years, and literally, I think, could approach in the 50s to 100s, given on the ones that we just know about. </p><p>These scams are increasingly pervasive. And I not only brought it up in the hearing with Mark Zuckerberg last year, I also read them again this summer to continue to press them to act more boldly to protect his users. </p><p>So, I have a question. Sources indicate that in 2018, people reported hundreds of millions of dollars lost to online scammers, including $143 million through romance scams. </p><p>Given what so many people have gone through, it's become more and more important for platforms to verify user authenticity. </p><p>So, both, to Mr. Huffman and Ms. Oyama, what do your platforms do to verify the authenticity of user accounts? </p><p>HUFFMAN: Sure. Thank you for the question. So, there again, two parts to my answer. The first is on the scams themselves. My understanding is you're probably referring to scams that target veterans, in particular. </p><p>We have a number of veteran's communities on Reddit, around support and share experiences. They all, like all of our communities create their own rules, and these communities have actually all created rules that prohibit fundraising, generally, because the community and the members of those communities know that they can be targeted by this sort of scam, in particular. </p><p>And so, that's the sort of nuance that we think is really important and highlights the power of our community model because I, as a nonveteran, might not have that--had had that same sort of intuition. </p><p>Now, in terms of what we know about our users, Reddit is not very different from our peers in that we don't require people to share their real-world identity with us. </p><p>We do know where they register from, what IP's they use, maybe their email address, but we don't force them to reveal their full name or their gender. </p><p>And this is important because on Reddit there are communities that discuss sensitive topics. In those very same veteran communities, or our, for example, drug addiction communities or communities for parents who are struggling being new parents. </p><p>These are not things that somebody would go on to a platform like Facebook, for example, and say, hey, I don't like my kid. I don't know what to do. </p><p>KINZINGER: Yeah, I understand. I don't mean to cut you off. But I got--I want to go to Ms. Oyama. </p><p>OYAMA: Sure. And I'm very sorry to hear that that happened to you, Congressman. On YouTube, we have a policy against impersonation. So, if you were to ever see a channel that was impersonating you or a user saw that, there's a form where they can go in and submit, I think they upload their government ID, but that would result in the channel being struck. </p><p>On Search, spams, you know, can show up across the web. Search is an index of the web. We're trying to give relevant information to our users every single day on Search. </p><p>We suppressed 19 billion links that are spam that could be scammed to defend the users. And then, on ads, we have something called a risk engine that can actually kick out fraudulent accounts before they enter the system. </p><p>KINZINGER: Thank you. And, you know, look, I--it's not--I'm not upset about, you know, the sites that are like Kinzinger is the worst Congressman ever, right, that's understandable I guess, for some people. </p><p>But when you have, again, in my case, somebody that flew, as an example, and there are multiple cases, flew from India using their entire life savings because she thought we were dating for a year. </p><p>Not to mention, all the money that she gave to this perpetrator and all these other stories. I think one of the biggest most important things is people need to be aware of that. </p><p>If you have somebody over a period of a year dating you and never authenticating that, it's probably not real. </p><p>Ms. Peters, what are the risks associated with people not being able to trust other users' identities online? </p><p>PETERS: I think there are multiple risks of that. But I want to come back to the key issue for us, which is, if it's illicit, the site should be required to hand over data to law enforcement to work proactively with law enforcement. </p><p>We've heard a lot today from the gentleman from Reddit about their efforts to better moderate. Some of our members were able to go online just the other day, type in a search for buy fentanyl online and came up with many, many results. Same for buy Adderall online, buy Adderall for cheap without prescription. </p><p>Those are fairly simple search terms. I'm not talking about a super high bar to get rid of that on your platform doesn't seem too hard. Or to have that automatically direct to a site that would advise you to get counseling for drug abuse. </p><p>We are not trying to be the thought police. We're trying to protect people from organized crime and terror activity. </p><p>KINZINGER: Thank you. And I'll yield back. But I have a bunch more questions I'll submit. Thank you. </p><p>DOYLE: Gentleman yields back. And for the record, I want to say the gentleman is the worst member of Congress. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>I don't even think you're at the very bottom Adam. You're--you're not a bad guy. Chair recognizes Ms. Castor for five minutes. </p><p>CASTOR: Well, thank you, Chairman Doyle, for organizing this hearing. And thanks to all of our witnesses for being here today. </p><p>I would like to talk about the issue of 230 in the context of this horrendous tragedy--tragedy in Wisconsin a few years ago on armslist.com where a man walked into a salon where his wife was working and shot her dead in front of their daughter and killed two others in that salon, and then, killed himself. </p><p>And this is a--the type of horrific tragedy that's all too common in America today. But Dr. McSherry, you mentioned, I think you misspoke a little bit because you said that was--that was all legal. </p><p>But it wasn't because two days before the shooting, there was a temporary restraining order issued against that--that man. </p><p>He went online shopping on armslist.com. Two days after that TRO was issued. And the next day, he commenced his murder spree. </p><p>And what happened is, you know, armslist knows that they have domestic abusers shopping, they've got felons, they've got terrorist shopping for firearms and, yet, they are allowed to proceed with this. </p><p>Earlier this year, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that armslist is immune even though they know that they are perpetuating illegal content and these kind of tragedies. </p><p>They said, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that armslist is immune because of Section 230. They basically said it did not matter that armslist actually knew or even intended that its website would facilitate illegal firearms sales to dangerous persons. </p><p>Section 230 still granted immunity. And then, Ms. Peters, you've highlighted that this is not an isolated incident. We're talking about child sexual abuse content, illegal drug sale. I mean, it's just--it's gone way too far. </p><p>So, I appreciate that you all have proposed some solutions for this. Dr. Citron, you said-- highlighted a safe harbor that if--if companies use their best effort to moderate content, they--they would have some protection. </p><p>But how would this work in reality? Would this be then it's left up to the courts and those type of liability lawsuits, which kind of speaks to the need for very clear standards coming out of the Congress, I think? </p><p>CITRON: So, yes, it would. And thank you so much for the question. And how would we do this. It would be in the courts. </p><p>So, it would be an initial motion to dismiss. The company would then, whoever is being sued, the question would be, are you being reasonable in your content moderation practices writ large, not with regard to any one piece of content or activity.  </p><p>And it's true that it would then be a forcing mechanism 12 B6 motion in federal court to have companies then explain what constitutes reasonableness. </p><p>Now, I think we can come up right now with all of us, we've come up with some basic sort of threshold what we think is reasonable content moderation practices, what we might describe as technological due process, transparency, accountability, right, clarity of what it is having a process, having clarity about what it is you prohibit. </p><p>But it's going to have to be case-by-case, context by context because what--what's reasonable response to a deepfake, and I've done a considerable amount of work on deepfakes, is going to be different from the kind of advice I would give to Facebook, Twitter and others about what constitutes a threat and how one figures that out, how we can use--and I'm going to--I'm thinking about Dr. Farid's testimony about what we do about there are certain issues--yeah-- </p><p>CASTOR: --And then, let me--and it would be in the public interest, I believe, that if it is explicit illegal content that they--they don't--it wouldn't wind up as an issue of a fact in a lawsuit. What do you think, Dr. Farid? If it is illegal content online, there--there really shouldn't be a debatable question, right? </p><p>FARID: I'm not a lawyer, to be clear. I'm a mathematician by training. So, I don't think you would really want to be asking me that question. But I completely agree with you. </p><p>In some cases, you know, we have seen over the years and we saw this when we were deploying photo DNA is the technology companies want to get you muddled up in the gray area. </p><p>So, we had conversations when we were trying to remove child abuse materials saying, well, what happens when it's an 18-year-old? You know, what happens when it's not sexually explicit? </p><p>And my answer is, yes, those are complicated questions. But there's really clear-cut bad behavior. We are doing awful things to kids as young as two months old. There is no issue. </p><p>CASTOR: I'm going to interrupt you because my time is short, and just highlight to the witnesses, there is also an issue with the number of moderators who are being hired to go through this content. </p><p>The--a publication called the Verge had a--had a horrendous story of Facebook moderators. And it caught my attention because one of the places is in Tampa Florida, my district. </p><p>I'm going to submit follow-up questions about moderators and some standards for that practice as a follow-up. And I encourage you to answer and send it back. Thank you. </p><p>DOYLE: The gentle lady yields. And now, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Shimkus for five minutes. </p><p>SHIMKUS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's great to be with you. I'm sorry I missed a lot of this because I'm upstairs. But in my 23 years being a member, I've never had the chance to really address the same question to two different panels on the same day. </p><p>So, it was kind of in interesting convergence upstairs, we're talking about e-vaping and underage use and what's in the product. </p><p>So, I was curious, when we were in the opening statements here, someone and I apologize I'm not sure-- mentioned two cases, one was dismissed because they really did nothing and one, the one who tried to be the good actor got slammed. I don't know about slammed. But--so--I see a couple of hands--can you first--Ms. Citron, can you address that first? You're shaking it the most. </p><p>CITRON: We are enthusiastically because those are the two cases that effectively give rise to Section 230. So, what animates Chris Cox to go to Ron Wyden and say, you know, we've got to do something about this. </p><p>It's two-- a pair of decisions in which, one basically says if you do nothing, you are not going to be punished for it. But if you try and you moderate, actually, that heightens your responsibility and likability. </p><p>SHIMKUS: So, no good deed goes unpunished. </p><p>CITRON: Exactly, right. So, that's why we are all in heated agreement about those two cases. That's why we're here today in many respects. </p><p>SHIMKUS: So, if I tie this into what's going on upstairs, and someone uses a platform to encourage underage vaping with unknown nicotine content, and the site then decides to clean it up because of the way the law is written right now, they--this good deed, which we--most would agree that probably is a good deed, would go punished. </p><p>CITRON: No, no. Now, we have Section 230. That's why we have Section 230. They are encouraged just so long as they are doing it in good faith, under Section 230 C2, they can remove it and they are good Samaritans. </p><p>SHIMKUS: Right, but so, okay, so that--so that is the benefit of it. Is there fear--okay, so and this debate that we heard earlier and opening comments from some of my colleagues in the USMCA debate that part of that would remove the protections of 230 and then, we would fall back to a regime by which the good deed person could get punished. Is that correct? Everybody's kind of shaking their head mostly. Ms. Peters, you're not. Go ahead. </p><p>PETERS: (Off-MIC) </p><p>SHIMKUS: Just turn your mic on. </p><p>PETERS: We need to keep the 230 language out of the--out of the trade agreements. It's--it's currently an issue of great debate here in the United States. It's not fair to put that in a trade agreements that will make it impossible, or make it harder for-- </p><p>SHIMKUS: --Don't get me wrong, I want USMCA passed with a, you know, as soon as possible without any incumbent work that doesn't happen. So, I'm not a proponent of trying to delay this process, but I'm just trying to work through the--this debate also. </p><p>I may have the concern upstairs, to those of us, we believe in legal products that have been, me, approved by the FDA. And we are concerned about a black market operation that would then use platforms illicitly to sell to underage kids. That--that would be how I would tie these two hearings together, which again, I still think is pretty interesting. </p><p>When I--when we had the Facebook hearing a couple years ago, I--I referred to a book called The Future Computed which talks about the ability of industry to set those standards. </p><p>I do think that industry--we do this across the board and a lot of--whether it's engineering of heating and air, cooling equipment or that, we do have industry that comes together for the good of the whole, for the good actors, and say, here are our standards. </p><p>And the fear is that if this sector doesn't do that, then the heavy hand of government will do it, which I think would--would really cause a little more problems. Dr. Farid, you're shaking your head. </p><p>FARID: We have been saying to the industry, you have to do better because if you don't, somebody is going to do it for you. So, you do it on your terms, or somebody else is going to do it on your terms. I agree. </p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes, we're not the experts. So, part of that book talks about fairness, reliability, privacy, inclusion, transparency and accountability. I would encourage the industry and those who are listening to--to help us move in that direction on their own before we do it for them. And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time. </p><p>DOYLE: Gentleman yields. And the Chair recognizes the Chair for five minutes. I would like to--I mean, that's very interesting testimony, and jarring, in some ways. </p><p>Ms. Peters, your testimony is particularly jarring. Have you seen any authentic offers of weapons of mass destruction being offered for sale online? </p><p>PETERS: I have not, personally, but--but we certainly have members of our alliance that are tracking weapons activity. </p><p>And I think what's more concerning to me, in a way, is the number of illegal groups from Hezbollah, designated Hezbollah groups to Al Qaeda that, you know, that maintain webpages and link to their Twitter and Facebook pages from those and then run fundraising campaigns off of them. </p><p>There are many, many-- </p><p>DOYLE: --I'm just interested in the weapons of mass destruction issue. </p><p>PETERS: There are many platforms that allow for secret and private groups. It's inside those groups, are the epicenter of illicit activity. So, it's hard for us to get inside those. We've actually run undercover operations to get inside some of them, but we haven't gotten-- </p><p>DOYLE: --Alright, thank you, Ms. Peters. Mr. Farid, in your testimony, you talk about the tension at tech companies between the motivation and maximize amount of time online on their platforms on the one hand, on the other hand, content moderation. Could you talk about that briefly, please? </p><p>FARID: Yeah. So, we've been talking a lot about 230. And that's an important conversation. But there is another tension point here, and there is another thing, which is, the underlying business model of Silicon Valley today is not to sell a product. </p><p>You are the product. And in some ways, that's where a lot of the tension is coming from because the metrics, we use at these companies for success is how many users and how long do they stay on the platforms. </p><p>You can see why that is fundamentally intention with removing users, removing content. And so, the business model is also an issue. And the way we deal with privacy of user data is also an issue here because if we--if the business model is monetizing your data, well then, I need to feed you information. </p><p>There is a reason why we call it the rabbit hole effect on YouTube. There is a reason why if you start watching certain types of videos of children or conspiracies or extremism, you are fed more and more and more of that content down the rabbit hole. </p><p>So, there is real tension there. And it's the bottom line. It's not just ideological. We are at--we are talking about the underlying profits. </p><p>DOYLE: Okay. Ms. Oyama, would you like to add to that? </p><p>OYAMA: Thank you. I think many of these issues that we are discussing today, whether it's, you know, harassment, extremism, it is important to remember the positive and productive potential for the internet. </p><p>You know, on YouTube we've seen it gets better. We've seen counter messaging. We have a program called creators for change who are able to create really compelling content for youth to counter extremist messages. </p><p>And I think it's just good to remember, you know, the CDA 230 was born out of this committee. It's been a long-standing policy. It is relevant to foreign policy, as well. We would support its inclusion in the USMCA or in the other modern digital trade framework. </p><p>It's responsible for the $172 billion surplus the United States has in digital services. It's critically important for small businesses to be able to moderate content and to prevent censorship from other more repressive regimes abroad. </p><p>DOYLE: So, it's a great issue and it's kind of hard to restrain yourself to brief answers. I understand that. </p><p>But clearly, companies could be doing more today within the current legal framework to address problematic content. I'd like to ask each of you very briefly what you think could be done today with today's tools to moderate content? Starting with Mr. Huffman, very briefly please. </p><p>HUFFMAN: Sure. So, for us the biggest challenge is evolving our policies to meet new challenges. But as such, we've evolved our policies a dozen times over the last couple of years and we continue to do so into the future. </p><p>For example, two recent ones for us were expanding our harassment policy and abandoning deepfake pornography. So, undoubtedly, there will be--deepfake wasn't even a word, you know, two years ago. </p><p>So, undoubtedly, there will be new challenges in the future and just being able to stay nimble and address them is really important. 230 actually gives us the space to adapt to the source of new challenges. </p><p>DOYLE: Okay. Ms. Citron. </p><p>CITRON: I have to say, so would a reasonableness standard that the nimbleness-- </p><p>DOYLE: --Reasonableness-- </p><p>CITRON: --Reasonableness, so-- </p><p>DOYLE: --I thought you were going to say that-- </p><p>CITRON: --enables, is ensuring that we do respond to changing threats. The threat landscape is going to change. We can't have a checklist right now. But I would encourage companies to, not only have policies, but be clear about them and to be accountable. </p><p>DOYLE: Okay. Ms. McSherry or Dr. McSherry. </p><p>MCSHERRY: Just quickly, the issue for me was the reasonableness standard is as a litigator, that's terrifying. That means the practical matter, especially, for a small business, a lot of litigation risk as courts try to figure out what counts is reasonable. </p><p>To your question, one of the crucial things I think we need if we want better moderation practices and we want users not to be treated just as products, is to incentivize alternative business models. </p><p>We need to make sure that we clear a space so there is competition so then when a given side is behaving badly, such as grinder, people have other places to go with other practices. </p><p>And they are encouraged to--to, you know, there's other sites are encouraged to develop and evolve. That will, you know, make--market forces sometimes can work. We need to let them work. </p><p>DOYLE: Thank you. When I'm going to have to cut off my time now. And I'm going to yield to the gentle lady from Indiana, Ms. Brooks for five minutes. </p><p>BROOKS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you so much for this very important hearing. Dr. Farid, actually, for--to set the record, and the reason I'm asking these questions, I'm a former U.S. attorney and was very involved in the Internet Crimes Against Children task force. </p><p>We did a lot of work from 2001 two 2007. And you are right, Mr. Huffman, deepfake pornography was not a term at that time. And so, we certainly know that, you know, law enforcement has been challenged for now, decades, in dealing with pornography over the internet. </p><p>And--and yet, I believe that we have to continue to do more to protect children and protect kids all around the globe. A concept or a tool, photo DNA, was developed a long time ago to detect criminal online child pornography, yet, it means nothing to detect that illegal activity if the platforms don't do anything about it. </p><p>And so, now, we've been dealing with this now, for decades. This is not new. And yet, we now have new tools, right. So, photo DNA, is it a matter of tools or effort or how is it that it's still happening? Dr. Farid. </p><p>FARID: I've got to say this is a source of incredible frustration. So, first of all, I was part of the team that developed photo DNA--photo DNA back in 2008 with Microsoft. </p><p>And I will tell you, for an industry that prides itself on rapid and aggressive development, there has been no tools in the last decade that have gone beyond photo DNA. That is pathetic. That is truly pathetic when we are talking about this kind of material. </p><p>How does an industry that prides itself on innovation say, we are going to use 10-year-old technology to combat some of the most gut-wrenching, heartbreaking content online? </p><p>It is completely inexcusable. This is not a technological limitation. This is, we are simply not putting the effort into developing and deploying the tools. </p><p>BROOKS: And let me just share that having watched some of these videos, it is something you never want to see. And you cannot get out of your mind. </p><p>FARID: I agree. </p><p>BROOKS: And so, I'm curious, Ms. Oyama, you wanted to respond. And how is it that we are still at this place? </p><p>OYAMA: Yeah, thank you for the question. I mean, I will say at Google, that is not true at all. We have never stopped working on prioritizing this. We can always do better. </p><p>But we are constantly adopting new technologies. We initiated one of the first ones, which was called CSIA match, which enabled us to create digital fingerprints of this imagery, prevented from ever being uploaded on YouTube. And we also share it with NCMEC. </p><p>And there is a new tool that we have called the content safety API. It's very new. And we're sharing it with others in the industry with NGOs. </p><p>It's resulted in a 7X increase in the speed at which this type of content is able to identify it. So, it's going to continue to be a priority. But I just wanted to be clear that from the very top of our company, we need to be a safe, secure place for parents and children. And we will not stop working on this issue. </p><p>BROOKS: Well, and I'm very pleased to hear that there have been advances than and that you are sharing them. And that is critically important. </p><p>However, I will say that an Indiana state police captain, Chuck Cohen, who has actually testified before Energy and Commerce recently told me that one of the issues that law enforcement runs into when working with internet companies is an attitude that he calls minimally compliant. </p><p>And he said that internet companies will frequently not preserve content that can be used for investigation. If law enforcement makes the companies aware of the concerning materials or automatically flags that content to law enforcement for review without actually checking if it's truly objectionable or not. </p><p>Do any of you have thoughts, specifically, on his comment? He has been an expert. Do any of you have thoughts on how we balance this law enforcement's critical need because they are saving children all around the globe, Ms. Peters, without restricting companies' immunity from hosting concerning content. </p><p>PETERS: I just feel like if companies start getting find or some sort of punitive damage every time there's illicit content, we're going to see a lot less illicit content very, very quickly. If it's illegal in real life it should be illegal to host it online. And that's a very simple approach that I think we could apply industrywide. </p><p>BROOKS: And so, I have a question, particularly, because I asked Mark Zuckerberg this relative to terrorism and to recruitment and ISIS and now, we need to be even more concerned about ISIS. </p><p>And I understand that you have teams of people that take it down. How many people are on your team Mr. Huffman? </p><p>HUFFMAN: Dedicated to-- </p><p>BROOKS: --Removing content. </p><p>HUFFMAN: That removing contents at scale and writing our policies, it's about 20 percent of our company, about 100 people. </p><p>BROOKS: Twenty percent of your company, about 100 people. Ms. Oyama, how many people? </p><p>OYAMA: More than 10,000 people working on content moderation. </p><p>BROOKS: That actually remove content? </p><p>OYAMA: That are involved in the content moderation development of the policies or the human reports. </p><p>BROOKS: But how many people are on the team that actually do that work? </p><p>OYAMA: I can--I'm happy to get back to you. </p><p>BROOKS: Okay, thank you. With that, I yield back. Thank you. </p><p>DOYLE: The gentlelady yields. At this point, I'd like to introduce a letter for the record without objection. So, ordered. Next, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York, Ms. Clarke for five minutes. </p><p>CLARKE: I thank our Chairman and our Chairwoman and our Ranking Members for convening this joint subcommittee hearing today, while fostering a healthier internet to protect consumers. </p><p>I introduced the first House bill on deepfake technology called the DEEPFAKES Accountability Act, which would regulate fake videos. </p><p>Deepfakes can be used to impersonate political candidates, create fake revenge porn and theater the very notion of what's real. </p><p>Ms. Oyama, Mr. Huffman, your platforms are exactly where deepfakes are shared. What are the implications of Section 230 on your deepfakes policies? </p><p>HUFFMAN: Sure, I'll go. Thank you for the question. So, we released actually, I think with most of our peers around the same time prohibitation--prohibatition of deepfake pornography on red it's because we saw that as a new emerging threat that we wanted to get ahead of his quickly as possible. </p><p>The challenge we face, of course, is the challenge you raise, which is the increasing challenge of being able to detect what is real or not. </p><p>This is where we believe that Reddit's model actually shines. By empowering our users and communities to adjudicate on every piece of content, they often highlight things that are suspicious, not just videos and images, but also, text and new sources. </p><p>And through--I do believe very strongly that we, as a society, not just us as platforms, but in addition to have to develop defenses against this sort of manipulation because it's only going to increase. </p><p>CLARKE: Ms. Oyama. </p><p>OYAMA: Thank you. Yes, on YouTube, our overall policy is a policy against deceptive practices. So, there has been instances where we have seen these deepfakes.  </p><p>I think the Speaker Pelosi video is one example where we identified that. It was a deepfake and it was removed from the platform. </p><p>For, both, you know, Search and for YouTube, surfacing authoritative accurate information is core to our business, core to our long-term business incentives. </p><p>I would agree with what Mr. Huffman said is that one of the things that we're doing is investing deeply in the academic side, the research side, the machine learning side to open up data sets where we know these are deepfakes and get better at being able to identify when content is manipulated. </p><p>We also do have a revenge porn policy for Search for users who are victimized by that. And we did also expand that to include synthetic images or deepfakes in that area too. </p><p>CLARKE: Very well. Ms. Citron, could you discuss the implications of Section 230 on deepfakes monitoring and removal? </p><p>CITRON: Section 230 sort of the activities that we've seen YouTube and Reddit engage in are precisely the kinds of activities that are proactive at the face of clear illegality. </p><p>Moving quickly, but the real problem isn't these folks at the table. There are now--so, Deep Trace Labs just issued a report two weeks ago showing that eight out of the ten biggest porn sites have deepfake sex videos. </p><p>And there are four sites now that basically, their business model is deepfake sex videos and that 99 percent of those videos involve women. </p><p>CLARKE: So, let me ask you, does the-- </p><p>CITRON: --Section 230 provides them immunity because its users posted that. </p><p>CLARKE: But does the current immunity structure reflect the unique nature of this threat? </p><p>CITRON: I don't think that. So, Section 230 as it's devised, it's at its best, it's supposed to incentivize the kind of nimbleness that we are seeing for some dominant platforms. But it's not the way the plain language is written under 230 C1. </p><p>It doesn't condition the immunity on being responsible and reasonable. And so, you have these outliners that caused enormous harm because it can be that in a search of their name that there's a deepfake sex video until it's, you know, deindexed. </p><p>And it is findable, and people then contact you and it's terrifying for victims. So, it's really these outliner companies that their business model is this kind of abuse. And Section 230 is what they point to when they gleefully say, sue me, too bad so sad. And that's the problem. </p><p>CLARKE: Very well. One of the many issues that has become an existential threat to civil society is the rise of hate speech and propaganda on social media platforms. </p><p>Ms. Oyama, if 230 were removed, would platforms be liable for hosting distasteful speech and would it change their incentives around moderating such speech? </p><p>OYAMA: Thank you for the question. I think this is a really important area to show the power and the importance of CDA 230. </p><p>I mean, as you know, there are First Amendment restrictions on government regulation of speech. So, there is additional responsibility for service providers like us in the private sector to step up. </p><p>We have a policy against hate speech. Incitement to violence is prohibited. Hate speech is prohibited. Speech targeting hate at specific groups for attributes based on race, religion, veteran status, age. </p><p>And the takedowns that we do every single quarter through automated flagging, through machine learning or through human reviewers are lawful and possible because of 230. </p><p>When we take down content, someone's content is being taken down. And so, they can regularly come back to any service provider, big or small, they may sue them for defamation are other things. </p><p>I think looking at the equities of the small business interest in this space would be really important, as well, because I think they would say that they are even more deeply reliant on this flexibility and this space to innovate new ways to identify that content and take it down without fear of unmitigated, you know, litigation or legal risk or legal uncertainty. </p><p>CLARKE: Very well. Thank you very much. I yield back, Mr. Chairman--Madam Chairwoman. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentlelady yields back. And now, Mr. Walberg, you are recognized for five minutes. </p><p>WALBERG: I thank the Chairwoman. And appreciate the panel for being here. Today's hearing and the issues had hit home for a lot of us are as we've discussed here. </p><p>The internet is such an amazing--amazing tool. It's brought about great innovation connecting millions of people in ways that we never even thought of before. </p><p>And I think, truthfully, we look forward to what we will see in the future. But these are issues we have to wrestle with.  </p><p>Earlier this year I was pleased to invite Haley Petrowski from my district to the State of the Union as my guest to highlight her good work that she is doing in my district and surrounding areas to help combat cyber bullying. </p><p>It's a very much comprehensive individual who understands so much as a young person of what's going on and is having a real impact in high schools and colleges now as a result of her experience and trying to attempt to make some positive things out of it after she almost committed suicide. Thankfully, it wasn't successful, as a result of cyber bullying. </p><p>She shined a light on that. And so, Mr. Huffman and Ms. Oyama, what are your companies doing to address cyber bullying on your platforms? </p><p>HUFFMAN: Sure. Thank you for the question, Congressman. Just two weeks ago we updated our policies around harassments. It's one of the, I think, most complex or nuance challenges we face because it appears in many ways. </p><p>One of the big changes we made is to allow harassment when it purports, not just from the victim, but from third parties. Basically, if somebody else sees instances of harassment, they'll report it to us and our team so that we can investigate. </p><p>This is a nationwide issue, but particularly, on our platform when people come to us in times of need. For example, a teenager struggling--struggling with their own sexuality has no place to turn, maybe not their friends, not their family. So, they come to a platform like ours to talk to others in difficult situations. </p><p>Or people who are having suicidal thoughts come to our platform. And it is our first priority, regardless of the law, though we fully support lawmakers in this initiative, to make sure that those people have safe experiences on Reddit. So, we've made a number of changes and we'll continue to do so in the future. </p><p>WALBERG: Okay. Ms. Oyama. </p><p>OYAMA: Thank you for the question. On YouTube, harassment and cyber bullying is prohibited. And so, we would use our policies to help us enforce and either through automated detection, human flagging, community flagging, we would be able to identify that content and take it down. </p><p>Last quarter, we removed 35,000 videos under that policy against harassment and bullying. And I did just want to echo Mr. Huffman's perspective that the internet and content sharing is also a really valuable place. </p><p>It can serve as a lifeline to a victim of harassment or bullying. And we see that all the time. When someone may be isolated in their school or somewhere else, being able to reach out across borders to another state or to find another community has really created a lot of hope. </p><p>And we also want to continue to invest in that important educational mental health resources, content like that. </p><p>WALBERG: Well, I'm glad to hear that you both are willing to continue investing in helping us as we move forward in this area. </p><p>Ms. Oyama, Google's Ad network has come a long way in the last few years and won't serve as next to potentially illegal activity. </p><p>This is laudable and demonstrates Google has come a long way in identifying illegal activity. Given that Google is able to identify such activity, why would it not just take down the content question? That was for Ms. Oyama, for you. </p><p>OYAMA: It is true that on--on our ad system we do have a risk engine. And so, we prohibit illegal content. There's many different policies and there are stricken, more than 2 billion ads every year are stricken out of the ad network for violating those policies illegal and beyond. </p><p>WALBERG: So, you're taking them down. </p><p>OYAMA: Yes, absolutely, before--before they are ever able to hit any page. I think it's very squarely in line with our business interest. We want advertisers to feel that our network, that our platforms are safe. They want to, you know, our advertisers only want to be surveying good ads to good content. </p><p>WALBERG: My final question, I understand that Google offers a feature to put a tag on copyrighted work that would automatically take it down if pirated and uploaded, but that Google charges a fee for this. Can this technology be applied to other legal content? And why doesn't Google offer this tool for free? </p><p>OYAMA: Thank you for the question. I think that may be a misperception because we do have content ID, which is our copyright management system. It is automated. </p><p>We have partners across the music industry, film, I think every leading publisher is part of it. It is part of our partner program. So, it is offered for free. </p><p>And it actually, it doesn't cost the partners anything. It's a revenue generator. So, last year, we sent $3 billion based on content ID claims of copyrighted material that right holders claimed. </p><p>They were able to take the majority of the ad revenue associated with that content. And it was sent back out to them. And that system of being able to identify and detect algorithmically content to then set controls, whether it should be in the entertainment space, perhaps, monetized and served or in the case of violent extremism, absolutely blocked, is something that powers much of YouTube. </p><p>WALBERG: Thank you. I yield back. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentleman yields back. And Mr. Loebsack, you are recognized for five minutes. </p><p>LOEBSACK: Thank you, Madam Chair. I do want to thank Chairman Doyle and Chair Schakowsky and the two Ranking Member of the subcommittee's for holding this hearing today. </p><p>And I want to thank the witnesses for your attendance, as well. This has been very informative even if we're not able to answer all the questions we would like to be able to answer. </p><p>In a sense, the first time our committee has examined how social media and the internet can be, both, a forced friend of innovation and human connection, which we all enjoy when we're making those connections, as long as they are positive, obviously, but also, a vector of harm and criminality. </p><p>I think everyone assembled here today is clearly very expert in your field. And I appreciate hearing from you all today as we consider how Section 230 has been interpreted by the courts since its initial passage, and what, if any changes should be--we should be considering. </p><p>I think there's a lot to consider as we discussed the full scope of what Section 230 covers, from cyber bullying and hate speech, whether on Facebook, YouTube or elsewhere to the illicit transaction of harmful substances or weapons. </p><p>I think the question today is twofold, first, we must ask if content moderators are doing enough. And second, we must ask whether congressional action is required to fix these challenges. But second one has kind of been referred to obliquely throughout by some of you and by some of us. </p><p>But I think that's essentially, the second question that we're--we're really facing today. And after reviewing the testimony you have submitted, we clearly have some differences of opinion on whether Section 230 is where Congress should be focusing its resources. </p><p>So, to begin, I'd like to ask everyone the same question. And this is probably, at once, the easiest question to answer and the most difficult because it's exceedingly vague. </p><p>What does the difference between good and bad content moderation look like? Start with you Mr. Huffman. </p><p>HUFFMAN: Thank you, Congressman, for that philosophically impossible question. But I think there's a couple of easy answers that I hope everybody on this panel would agree with. </p><p>Bad content moderation is ignoring the problem. And that was the situation we were in pre-230 and that was the sort of perverse incentives we were facing. </p><p>There--I think there are many forms of good content moderation. What is important to us at Reddit's is twofold. One, empowering our users and communities to set standards of discourse in their communities and amongst themselves. We think this is the only truly scalable solution. </p><p>And the second, is the what 230 provides us, which is the ability to look deeply in our platform to investigate, to use some finesse and nuance when we're addressing new challenges. </p><p>LOEBSACK: Thank you. Ms.-- </p><p>CITRON: To answer your question I would say to be about what makes bad--what makes content bad or was that what makes content moderation? </p><p>LOEBSACK: Moderation. </p><p>CITRON: Oh, okay. </p><p>LOEBSACK: So, about--between, what's the difference between good and bad content moderation? </p><p>CITRON: Moderation, okay. </p><p>LOEBSACK: Because that's what we're talking about. </p><p>CITRON: You know, of course, but it precedes the question of why we're here, that is, what kinds of harms get us to the table to say why we should even try to talk about changing Section 230. </p><p>And I would say what's bad or incredibly troubling is when sites are permitted to have entire business model, which is abuse and harm. </p><p>So, by my lights, that is the worst of the worst. And sites that induce and solicit illegality and harm, and that, to me, is the most troubling. </p><p>LOEBSACK: That's the problem. But then, the question is how to deal with the problem in terms of moderation. </p><p>CITRON: And I've got some answers for you, but, you know, if we want to wait to do that. </p><p>LOEBSACK: You can submit them to us in writing if you would like. </p><p>CITRON: I did in my testimony. </p><p>LOEBSACK: I understand that. </p><p>CITRON: We've got to deal with the bad Samaritans and then a broader approach. </p><p>LOEBSACK: Thank you. Ms. McSherry. </p><p>MCSHERRY: Thank you. Thank you for the question. I--actually, I think it's a great question. And I think as someone who supports civil liberties online as sort of a primary goal for us, I think good content moderation is precise, transparent and careful. </p><p>What we see far too often is that in the name of--of content moderation and making sure the internet is safe for everybody, actually, all kinds of valuable and lawful content is taken off-line. </p><p>There's details about this submitted in our testimony. But I just point to one example where we have an archive of--there's an archive of videos attempting to document war atrocities, but those videos are often flagged as violating terms of service because, of course, they contain horrible material. </p><p>But the point is to actually support political conversations and--and it's very difficult for the service providers to apparently tell the difference. </p><p>LOEBSACK: Thank you. Ms. Peters. </p><p>PETERS: If is illegal in real life, it ought to be illegal online. Content moderation ought to focus on illegal activity. </p><p>And I think there has been little investment in technology that would improve this for the platforms because--precisely because of Section 230 immunities. </p><p>LOEBSACK: Thank you. I do realize I'm out of time. I'm sorry. I asked such a broad question of all of you. But I would like to get your response if I could, the final two witnesses here in writing if I could please. Thank you so much. And I yield back. Thank you. </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentleman yields back. And now, I recognize Mr. Carter for five minutes. </p><p>CARTER: Thank you, Madam Chair. And thank all of you for being here. I know that you all understand how important this is. </p><p>And I hope that you--and I believe you all take it seriously. So, thank you for being here and thank you for participating in this. </p><p>Ms. Peters, I'm going to start with you. I'd like to ask you in your testimony, you pointed out that there is clearly quite a bit of illegal conduct that the online platforms still our hosting. </p><p>For instance, illegal pharmacies where you can buy pills without--without a prescription, terrorist that are profiteering off of looted artifacts, and also, products from--from endangered species. </p><p>And then, it even gets worse. You mentioned the sale of human remains and child exploitation. I mean, just gross things, if you will. How--how much effort do you feel like the platforms are putting into containing this and to stopping this? </p><p>PETERS: Well, it depends on the platform. But that's a very good question. And I'd like to respond with a question to you and to the committee. When was the last time anybody here saw a dic-pic on Facebook? </p><p>Simple question. If you--they can keep genitalia off these platforms, they can keep drugs off of these platforms. They can keep child sexual abuse off these platforms. The technology exists. </p><p>It's--these are policy issues whether it's the policy to allow the video of Nancy Pelosi on or the policy to allow pictures of human genitalia. </p><p>CARTER: I get it. I understand. Let me ask you this. Do you ever go to them and meet with them and express this to them? </p><p>PETERS: Absolutely. </p><p>CARTER: And how are you received? </p><p>PETERS: We are typically told that the firm has quite intelligent people working on it, that they are creating AI and that in a few years, that AI is going to work. </p><p>And when we've presented evidence of specific identifiable crime networks and terror networks, we've been told that they'll get back to us. And then, they don't. That's happened multiple times. </p><p>CARTER: Are you ever told that they don't want to meet with you? I mean-- </p><p>PETERS: No. We've usually got meetings are called. </p><p>CARTER: So, you feel like it's--I mean, you feel like you got a good relationship. And do you feel like the effort is being put forth? </p><p>PETERS: I don't feel like effort is being put forth. I feel like (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>CARTER: You see, that's where I struggle because I don't want the, you know, I'm doing my best to keep the federal government out of this. I don't want to stifle innovation. </p><p>And I'm really concerned about that. But at the same time, look, we cannot allow this to go on. This is irresponsible. And if you don't do it, then you're going to force us to do it for you. And I don't want that to happen. </p><p>I mean, it's just as clear as that. Let me ask you, Ms. Peters, you also mentioned in your testimony that you were getting funding from the State Department to map wildlife supply chains, and that's when you discovered that there was a large retail market for endangered species that exist on some platforms like Facebook and WeChat. </p><p>Have--have any of the--any of these platforms made a commitment to--to stop this and if they have, is it working, is it getting any better?  </p><p>PETERS: I mean that's a--a terrific example to bring up sir, there--there--a number of tech firms have joined a coalition with World Wildlife Fund and IFA and have taken a pledge to remove endangered species content and wildlife markets from their platforms by 2020. I'm not aware that anything has--has changed. We've--we have researchers going online and logging wildlife markets all the time.  </p><p>CARTER: Alright, I'm gonna be fair, okay, I'm gonna be fair and I'm gonna let--I'm gonna let the Google--I'm sorry, I can't see that far. I'm gonna let you respond to that. Do you feel like you're doing everything you can?  </p><p>OYAMA Thank you. We can always do more, I think. We are committed to always doing more on--on wildlife-- </p><p>CARTER: --I--I appreciate that. I know that.-- </p><p>OYAMA --Then what-- </p><p>CARTER: --I don't need you to tell me that, I need you to tell me we--we got a plan in place and it's fixed, and then stop this.  </p><p>OYAMA Let me tell you what we are doing in the two categories that you mentioned. So, for wildlife, the sale of endangered species prohibited from Google Ads: we are part of the coalition that Ms. Peters mentioned. On the--the national epidemic that you mentioned for opioids, we are hugely committed to helping and playing our part in combatting this epidemic. So, there's a online component and an offline component. The online component, the research has showed that less than .05 percent of misuse of opioids originates on the Internet. And what we have done, especially with Google Search is work with the FDA. So, the FDA can send us a warning letter, if they see that there's a link in search for a rogue pharmacy, and we will delist that out of search. There--there's a really important offline component too. So, we work with the DEA on Prescription Take Back Day, we've featured these places in Google Maps on CBS. I'm happy to come in and--and-- </p><p>CARTER: Okay, and I invite you to do just that, okay? I'd--I'd like to see you and talk to you further about this. Mr. Huffman, I'm gonna give you the opportunity because we've gone--my staff has gone on Reddit, and they have--they have Googled, if you will, or searched for illegal drugs and it comes up.  </p><p>HUFFMAN: Yes, sir.  </p><p>CARTER: And I suspect you're gonna tell me the same thing \"We are working on it, we almost got it under control.\" But it's still coming up.  </p><p>HUFFMAN: I've got a slightly different answer, if you'll indulge me? First of all, it is against our rules to have controlled goods on our platform and it's also illegal, 230 doesn't give us protection against criminal liability. We do see content like that on our platform. And in fact, if you went to any technology service which was with a search bar, including your own emails and typed in \"Buy Adderall,\" I'm sure you would find a hit in your spam folder at least, and that's the case on Reddit as well. That sort of content that's come up today is spam first, gets removed by our filters.  </p><p>But there is a lag sometimes between something being submitted and something being removed, naturally that's how the system works. That said, we do take this issue very seriously. And so, our technologies have continued to improve along these lines. And that's exactly the sort of ability that 230 gives us, is the ability to look for this content and remove it. Now, to the extent that you or your staff have found this content specifically and to the extent that it's still on our platform, we'd be happy to follow-up later, because it shouldn't be.  </p><p>CARTER: You know, I--my sons are grown now, but I feel like a parent playing with their child again \"Please don't make me have to do this.\" Thank you, Madam Chair, I yield back.  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The--the gentlemen yields back, and now I recognize Congresswoman Kelly, for five minutes.  </p><p>KELLY: Thank you Madam Chair, thank you from holding this important hearing on Section 230 and fostering a healthy and more consumer-friendly Internet. The intended purpose of Section 230 was to allow companies to moderate content under the Good Samaritan Provision and yet, this law seems to be widely misapplied. The Good Samaritan Provision and Section 230 was intended in a good faith--in good faith to restrict access or availability of the material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, less civic, filthy, excessively violent, harassing or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.  </p><p>Last Congress, Section 230 was amended through SESTA and FOSTA to make platforms liable to any activity related to sex trafficking. Since passage, some have criticized the law for being too ambiguous. In addition to my work on this committee, I've chaired the House of Tech Accountability Caucus. In that capacity, I've started to work with stakeholders to protect family users, in an accountable manner while allowing innovators to innovate. Today, as we look to foster a healthy and more consumer-friendly Internet, it is my hope that our discussion will set the standard of doing so, in a responsible, effective and balanced way.  </p><p>Professor Citron, in your testimony, you discuss giving platforms in unity from liability if they could show that their content moderation practices right large--(INAUDIBLE) are reasonable. As the Chairman referenced, how should companies know where the line is, or if they're doing enough? Where's that line?  </p><p>CITRON: And the sort of genius of reasonableness is that we--it--it matters and depends on the context. There's certainly some baseline presumptions, I would say, defaults about what would constitute reasonable content moderation practices and that includes having them. There are some sites that don't engage it at all, in fact, they--they absolutely don't engage in moderation and they encourage abuse and illegality. But there are baseline I think, academic writing for the last 10 years and work I've done for companies in 10 years is, there is a baseline set of speech rules and policies that we've seen that are best practices, but naturally that's gonna change, depending on the challenge.  </p><p>So, we're gonna have different approaches to different new and evolving challenges. And that's why a reasonableness approach with preserves the liability shield, right? But it does it in exchange for those efforts.  </p><p>KELLY: And would you agree that any changes we make, we have to ensure that is doesn't further ambiguity?  </p><p>CITRON: Right and I think just, if I may about FOSTA and SESTA, what was--what was disappointing to someone who certainly helped some offices work on the language is when you included the language knowingly facilitate that encou--that's the moderator's dilemma. That is to either sit on your hands, or to be overly aggressive. And so, my biggest disappointment was unfortunately how it came out. Because we do see, we almost see ourselves back to Prodigy and (INAUDIBLE), those initial cases and either we are seeing way overly aggressive responses to sexual expression online with is a shame, and we see the doing nothing. So, I hope we don't do that.  </p><p>KELLY: Thank you. The way people communicate is changing rapidly as we all know. Information can start on one platform and jump to another and go viral very quickly. The 2016 elections showcase how false information can spread and how effective it can be to motivate or deter different populations. Often, offensive content is first shared in groups and then filtered out to a wider audience. Ms. Peters, what do you believe is the responsibility of tech companies to monitor and proactively remove content that is rapidly spreading, before being flagged by users?  </p><p>PETERS: I believe that companies need to moderate and remove content, when it is--concerns a clearly illegal activity. If it's illegal in real life, it ought to be illegal to host it online. Drug trafficking, human trafficking, wildlife trafficking, serious organized crime and designated terror groups should not be given space to operate on our platforms. I also think that CDA 230 needs to be revised to provide more opportunities for civil and state law enforcement--or sorry, state and local law enforcement, to have the legal tools to respond to elicit activity. That's one of the reasons FOSTA-SESTA was passed.  </p><p>KELLY: And Ms. Oyama, and Mr. Huffman, what steps are you taking beyond machine learning to stop the spread of extremist or misinformation content that is being shared widely? Are there flags that pop up if the same content does share 10,000 or 100,00 times?  </p><p>OYAMA: Yes. Thank you for the question. So, on YouTube, we are using machines and algorithms. Once a content is identified and removed, our technology prevents it from being reuploaded. But I think to your really important point about working across the platforms and across industry collaboration, a good example would be the GIFCT, the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism. We are one of the founding members. Many of the leading players in tech are part of that. One of the things that we saw during the--the Christ Church shooting was how quickly this type of content can spread. And we were--we were grateful to see that last week, some of the crisis protocols we've put into place kicked in. So, there was a shooting in Germany, there was a--a piece of content that appeared on Twitch, and the companies were able to engage in the crisis protocol. There was a hash made of the content, it was spread across the companies and that enabled all of us to block it.  </p><p>KELLY: I know I'm out of time. Thank you.  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentlelady yields back, and Mr. Bilirakis is recognized for five minutes.  </p><p>BILIRAKIS: Thank you, Madam Chair, I appreciate it very much. My first question is for Dr. McSherry, a yes or no. I understand the past EFF has argued for including language mirroring legislation and trade deals explicitly for the purpose of baking language into an agreement to protect statute--statute domestically, the statue domestically. Do you see the intent of including such 230-like language in trade agreements is to ensure that we may not revisit the statute?  </p><p>MCSHERRY: No.  </p><p>BILIRAKIS: Okay. Alright, thank you very much. And then, what I'd like to do Madam Chair, I'd like to ask the EFF. the blogpost from January 23rd, 2018, by Jeremy Malcom be entered into the record.  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: Without an objection, so ordered.  </p><p>BILIRAKIS: Thank you Madam Chair, I appreciate it. Next question is for M. Huffman and Ms. Oyama. I wanted to say it right, is that okay? Alright, very good. Thank you In April 2018, I questioned Mark Zuckerberg about how soon illegal opioids ads would be removed from their website. His answer was that the ads would be reviewed when they were flagged by users as being illegal or inappropriate. This of course, is the standard answer in the social media space.  </p><p>However, Mr. Zuckerberg also said at the time that industry needs to, and I quote \"Build tools that proactively go out and identify ads for opioids before people even have--have to flag them for us to review.\" And that ends the quote. This would significantly in my opinion, cut down the time an illegal ad would be on their website. Again, Ms.--Mr. Huffman and Ms. Oyama, it has been a year-and-a-half. This is an epidemic and people are dying, I'm sure you agree with this. Has the industry been actively working on artificial intelligence flagging standards that can automatically identify illegal ads, and then what is the status of this technology and when can we expect implementation, if they have been working on it? Whoever would like to go first is fine, Mr. Huffman?  </p><p>HUFFMAN: Sure, thank you, Congressman. So, Reddit's a  little different than our peers in that all of our ads go through a strict human review process, making sure that not only are they on the right side of our content policy, which prohibits the buying and selling of controlled substances, but also our much more strict ads policy, which has a--a much higher bar to cross. Because we do not want ads that cause any sort of controversy on our platform.  </p><p>BILIRAKIS: Okay. But I mean, you know, we have to be proactive, as far as it's concerned, and Mr. Zuckerberg indicated that that's the case. You know these kids are drying, people are dying and--and we just can't stand by and have this happen, and have access to these--well, in most cases, opioids and drugs, different types of drugs. But Ms. Oyama, would you like to comment please?  </p><p>OYAMA: Thank you. We certainly agree with you comment about the need for proactive efforts. So, on Google Ads, we have something called a Risk Engine, which helps us identify if an ad is bad when it's coming into the system, we can kick it out. Last year in 2018 we kicked out 2.3 billion ads out of our system for violating our policies. For any prescription that would show up in an ad that's also independently verified by a independent group called LegitScript, so that would need to also be verified by them. And then of course, in the specific case of opioids, those are a controlled substance under federal law, so there's a lot of important work that we've done with the DEA, with the FDA, even with pharmacies, like CVS offline, to help them promote things like Take Back Your Drugs Day (SIC), where people can take opioids in and drop them off so they're not misused later on.  </p><p>One of the things that we've seen is that the vast majority or the 99 percent of opioids misuse happens in the offline world. So, from a doctor that's prescribing it or a family member or friend. And so, using technology to also educate and inform people that might be potentially victimized from this is--is equally important to some of the work that we're doing in the ad space.  </p><p>BILIRAKIS: Okay, how about anyone else on the panel, do they--would they like to comment, is the industry doing enough?  </p><p>PETERS: I don't think the industry is doing enough, there's an enormous amount of drug sales taking place on Google groups, on Instagram, on Facebook groups, we--the--the groups on these platforms are the epicenter. And this is why industry has to be monitoring this. If--if you leave this up to users to flag it, it--and they're inside a private or secret group it's just not gonna happen. These firms know what users are getting up to, they're monitoring all of us all the time so they can sell us stuff. They can figure this out.  </p><p>FARID: Yeah, Congress--Congressman, can I also add that there are two issues here, there are the ads, but there's also the native content. So, you heard Ms. Peters say that she went this morning and searched on Reddit and that content is there even if it's not in the ads. And the same is true on Google Search, I can search for this. So, there's two place you have to worry about these places, not just the ads.  </p><p>BILIRAKIS: Yeah, very good. Thank you, Madam Chair, I yield back.  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentlemen yields back, and now I call on the Chairman of our full committee for five minutes, Mr. P.  </p><p>PALLONE: Thank you, Madam Chair. I wanted to start with Ms. Oyama, in your written testimony, you discuss YouTube's community guidelines for hate speech, and I'm concerned about news reports that hate speech and abuse is on the rise on social media platforms. How does Section 230 incentivize the platforms to moderate such speech and does Section 230 also incentivize platforms to take a hands-off approach to removing hate speech, if you will?  </p><p>OYAMA: Thank you so much for the question. So, on the category of hate speech, YouTube prohibits hate speech, we have a very clear policy against it. So would be speech that incites violence or speech that is hateful against groups with specific attributes. So that could be speech based on their--their race, their religion, their sex, their age, their disability status, their veteran status. And so, that is prohibited and can be either detected by our machines, which is the case in more than 87 percent, by community flaggers, by individual users. And all of those actions that we take, last quarter, we saw a 5X increase in the amount of content that our machines were able to find and remove.  </p><p>Those removals are vitally dependent on the protection in CDA 230 to give service providers the ability to moderate content, to fight that content and to take it down. We do have claims against us when we remove speech, people may sue us for defamation, they may have other legal claims. And 230 is what enables, you know, not only Google or not only YouTube but any site with user comments, with user generated content, any site on the Internet large or small to be able to moderate that content.  </p><p>So, I think we would  just encourage Congress to think about not harming the good actors, the innocent actors that are taking these steps, in an effort to go after a truly bad criminal actor, where criminal law is fully exempted from the scope of CDA 230. And--and they should be penalized, and law enforcement will play a really important role in bringing them down as they did with Backpage that was taken down, or in civil cases like Roomates.com, where there is platform liability for bad actors that break the law.  </p><p>PALLONE: Thank you. Dr. Farid, in your written testimony you state that the Internet has led to the proliferation of domestic and international terrorism. As you may know, there's both criminal and civil liability associated with providing material support for terrorism. But I wanna start with Dr. McSherry understanding that Section 230 doesn't apply to federal criminal law, have U.S. social media companies used Section 230 to shield themselves from civil liability for allowing their platforms to be used as propaganda and recruitment platforms for terrorists with regard to civil liability?  </p><p>MCSHERRY: So, there are--there are ongoing cases, and there have been several cases where platforms have been accused of violating civil laws for hosting certain kinds of content on their--on their platforms. And they've invoked Section 230 in--in those cases, quite successfully. And I think that's not--if you look at the facts of a lot of these cases, that's actually quite appropriate. It's--the reality is, it's very difficult for a platform to always be able to tell in advance--always draw the line in advance between content that's talking, that's simply protected political communications and content that--that steps over a line. And so, these cases are hard, and they're complicated, and they have to get resolved on their facts. Section 230 though also creates a space in which because of--because of the additional protections that it provides, it creates a space for service providers when they choose to, to moderate and enforce their own policies.  </p><p>PALLONE: Here let me ask you to get back to Dr. Farid, do you have any thoughts on how this should be addressed from a technological perspective?  </p><p>FARID: Yeah, I--I wanna start by saying you know when you hear about the moderation that is happening today, we've heard it from Google, we've heard it from Reddit, you should understand that that has only come after intense pressure. It has come from pressure from advertisers, it has come from pressure on Capitol Hill, it has come from pressure in the EU and it has come from pressure from the press. So, there is bad news, there is bad PR and then we start getting serious. For years, we have been struggling with the social media companies to do more about extremism and terrorism online.  </p><p>And we had hit a blank--a hard wall. And then the EU started putting pressure, Capitol Hill started putting pressure, advertisers started putting pressure and we started getting responses. Now I think this is exactly what this conversation is about is, what it's the underlying motivating factor? The self-regulation of \"Trust us, we will do everything,\" is--is not working.  </p><p>So, the pressure has to come from other avenues. And I think putting pressure by modest changes to CDA 230 is the right direction and I agree with Ms. Oyama, is that, if these are good actors, then they should encourage that change and help us clean up, and deal with the problems that we are dealing. But I do--you know, I've been in this fight for over a decade now, and it's a very consistent pattern. You deny the problem exists, you minimize the extent of it, you deny the technology exists and eventually you get enough pressure and then we start making changes. I think we should just skip to the end part of that and just recognize that we can do better, and let's just start doing better.  </p><p>PALLONE: Alright, thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair.  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentlemen yields back, and now I recognize for five minutes Congressman Gianforte.  </p><p>GIANFORTE: Thank you, Madam, Chair, and thank you for being here today. About 20 years ago, I harnessed the power of the Internet to launch a business to improve customer service, that company was called \"RightNow Technologies.\" And from a spare bedroom in our home, we eventually grew that business to be one of the largest employers in Montana. We had about 500 high-wage jobs there. The platform we created had about 8 million unique visitors per day. And I understand how important Section 230 can be for small business. This important liability shield has gotten mixed up however, with complaints about viewpoint discrimination. And I wanna cite one particular case: in March of this year, Missoula based Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation reached out to my office, because Google had denied one of their advertisements.  </p><p>The foundation did what it had done many times, they had tried to use paid advertising on the Google network to promote a short video about a father hunting with his daughter. This time, however, the foundation received an email from Google, and I quote, \"Any promotions about hunting practices, even when they are intended as a healthy method of population control, or conservation is considered animal cruelty and deemed inappropriate to be shown on our network.\" The day I heard about this, I sent a letter to Google and you were very responsive. But the initial position taken, was absurd.  </p><p>Hunting is a way of life in Montana, and many parts of the country. I'm very thankful you worked quickly to reverse that, but I remain very concerned about Google's effort to stifle the promotion of Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation's--and how they were treated. I worry that other similar groups have faced similar efforts to shut down their advocacy. We really don't know how many hunting ads Google has blocked in the last five years. In my March letter, I invited Google's CEO to meet with leaders of our outdoor recreation business in Montana, I haven't heard anything back.  </p><p>And Ms. Oyama, I would extend the invitation again. I think frankly it would help Google to get out of Silicon Valley, come to Montana, sit down with some of your customers and hear from them directly about the things that are important tot them. I'd be happy to host that visit, we'd love to meet with you there. If--I think it's important to understand the work that these groups do, to further conservation and to help species thrive. And as an avid hunter and outdoorsman myself, I know many businesses in Montana focus on hunting and fishing. And I worry they may be denied the opportunity to advertise on one of the largest online platforms that you've built, to your credit.  </p><p>I also worry that an overburdensome regulatory regime could hurt small businesses and stifle Montana's rapidly growing high-tech sector. So, the invitation's open. Dr. Farid, I would--one question for you, how can we walk this line between protection small business and innovation versus overburdensome regulations?  </p><p>FARID: It's absolutely the right question to ask Congressman, and I think you have to be very careful here, because right now, we have near monopolies in the technology sector. And if we start regulating now, the small companies coming up are not going to be able to compete. There are ways of creating carveouts. In the EU and the UK, as they are talking about regulations, they are crating carveouts for small platforms that have 8 million versus 3 billion users. So, I do think we wanna tread very lightly here. I think Ms. Peters also made the point that we want to inspire competition for better business models in a lot of these small companies, but I think there are mechanisms to do that, we just have to think carefully about it.  </p><p>GIANFORTE: Yeah, and we've had a lot of discussion today about the efforts you're taking to get criminal activity off the network, so I applaud that we should continue to do that. But as a follow-on Doctor, how do we ensure that content moderation doesn't become censorship and a violation of our first amendment?  </p><p>FARID: Good, so the way we have been thinking about content moderation is a collaboration between humans and computers. And what--what computers are very good at doing is the same thing over and over, and over again. But what they're not good at still, is nuance and subtly and complexity and inference and context. So, the way content moderation works today for example on a child sexual abuse base is human moderators say, \"This is a child, this is sexually explicit.\" We fingerprint that content and then we remove very specifically and very targeted that piece of content. False alarm raised for photo DNA that we've developed a decade ago are about 1 in 50 billion. That's the scale you need to be operating at. So, if you are going to deploy technology you have to be at a very--automatic technology you have to be operating at a very high scale.  </p><p>And so, the humans--the computers can't do that on their own, so we need more human moderators. You heard from Google, 10,000 moderators, there are 500 hours of video uploaded a minute. That is not enough moderators. You can do the arithmetic yourself. Those moderators would have to be looking at hours and ours of video per hour. So, we have to also beef up our human moderation.  </p><p>GIANFORTE: Okay, thank you. And Ms. Oyama, I look forward to seeing you in Montana, and I yield back.  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The--the gentlemen yields back. And now I recognize is it-- </p><p>BLUNT ROCHESTER: (OFF-MIC) </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: It is. Congresswoman Blunt Rochester is next for five minutes.  </p><p>BLUNT ROCHESTER: Thank you Madman Chairwoman, and to the Chairman and ranking members, thank you for holding this important hearing. I think many of us here today are seeking to more fully understand how Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act can work well, in an ever-changing virtual and technological world. This hearing is really significant and as Ms. Oyama said, I want us to not forget the important things that the Internet has provided to us, from movements, to applications to Tic-Toc (SP). But, also as Mr. Huffman said, we and I-you--you applied it to Reddit, but I think it applies to all of us, must constantly be evolving, our policies must be evolving to face the new challenges, while also balancing our civil liberties.  </p><p>I mean, so we have a really important balance here. So my--my questions really are surrounded around this--the bad--the question that Mr. Loebsack asked about bad content mod--moderation and I want to start off by saying the--the utilization of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence to filter through content posted on websites as large as YouTube, provides an important technological solution to increasing the amount of content to moderate. However, as we become more and more reliant on algorithms, we are increasingly finding blind spots and gaps that may be difficult to breach, with simply more and better code. I think there's a real concern that groups already facing prejudice and discrimination will be further marginalized and censored. So, and as I thought about this, I even thought about groups like the veterans or the African American community in the 2016 elections. Dr Farid, can you describe some of the challenges with moderation, by algorithm, including possible bias?  </p><p>FARID: Yeah, so I think you're absolutely right Congresswoman. When we automate at the scale of the Internet, we are going to have problems. And we've already seen that. We know for example that face recognition does much, much worse on women, on people of color than it does on white men. The--the problem with the automatic moderation is that it doesn't work at scale. When you are talking about billions of uploads and if your algorithm is 99 percent accurate which is very, very good, you are still making 1 in 100 mistakes. That is literally tens of millions of mistakes a day you're going to be making at the scale of the Internet.  </p><p>And so, the--the underlying idea that we can fully automate this not to take on the responsibility and the expense of hiring human moderators simply doesn't work. And so, I--I fear that we have moved too far to the \"Give us time to find AI algorithms and--because we don't wanna hire human moderators 'cause of the expense.\" And--and we know today that that is not going to work in the next year, two years, five years, 10 years and it's a little bit worse than that, because it also assumes an adversary that is not adapting and we know that the adversaries can adapt. So, we know for example that all machine learning and AI algorithms today that are meant to identify content are vulnerable to what are called adversarial attacks. You can add small amounts of content to the information and you can completely fool the systems.  </p><p>BLUNT ROCHESTER: I wanna ask a quick question of Mr. Huffman and Ms. Oyama. Both of you talked about the number of human moderators that you have available to you. And I know that we've had many hearings on challenges of diversity in the tech field. I'm--I'm assuming Mr. Huffman, yours are more from the user perspective in terms of moderators or are they people that you hire and--and the 10,000 or so that you mentioned, these are people that you hired, or are they users? Just a quick--so everybody knows? Users?  </p><p>HUFFMAN: So, for-- </p><p>BLUNT ROCHESTER: Combination?  </p><p>HUFFMAN: For us, it's about 100 employees-- </p><p>BLUNT ROCHESTER: --Of course.--  </p><p>HUFFMAN: And of course, millions of users participate as well.  </p><p>BLUNT ROCHESTER: Yeah, that's what I thought. Okay, same?  </p><p>OYAMA: Yeah, so the 10,000 stat that I mentioned is the mixture of the full-time employees, we also work with specialized vendors and the we also have community flagging which could be an NGO, it could be law enforcement it could be an average user.  </p><p>BLUNT ROCHESTER: Okay, I know in the interest of time, I don't have a lot of time, but it would be--could  you provide us with information on the diversity of your moderators? That's one of--of--one of my questions. And then also, I'm--I don't like to make assumptions, but I'm gonna assume that it might be a challenge to find diverse populations of individuals to do this role, what you're doing in that vein? So, if we could have a follow-up with that? And then my last question is just gonna be, for the panel, what should the federal government, what should we be doing to help in--in this space? Because I'm--I'm really concerned about the capacity to do this and do it well. It anybody has any suggestion, recommendation? Mr. Farid is already pushing his button.  </p><p>FARID: I--I think conversation is helping. I think you're gonna scare the bejesus out of technology sector and I think that's a really good thing to do.  </p><p>BLUNT ROCHESTER: Okay, I-my--I'm--I have to yield back, I'm out of time, but thank you so much to all of you for your work.  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentlemen--woman yields back and now last but not least, Representative Soto, you're recognized for five minutes.  </p><p>SOTO: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. First of all, thank you for being here, it's--I'm the last one so if you're--you're in the homestretch here. It's amazing that we're here today, when we think about how far the Internet has progressed, one of the greatest invention in human existence, connecting the world, giving billions a voice, while before their stories would never be told, providing knowledge at our fingertips, it's just incredible. And we know Section 230 has been a big part of it, finding that safe harbor against the dam--essentially the dam holding back a flood of lawsuits, it's created innovation but it's also created a breeding ground for defamation and harassment, for impersonation and election interference and also a breeding ground for white supremacists, disinformation, global terrorism and other extremisms.  </p><p>So, we have these wonderful gifts to humanity on one side and then all the terrible things with humanity on the other side. My biggest concern is that lies spread faster than the speed of light in--in the Internet, while--while truth seems to go at a snail's pace, so that's one thing I consensually hear from my constituents. So, I want start with some basics, just so I know everybody's opinion on it. Who do you all each think should be the cop on the beat, to be the primary enforcer? With the choices being FCC, FTC or the courts and it would be great to go down the line to hear what each of you think, on that.   </p><p>HUFFMAN: If those are my only three options, I would choose the courts.  </p><p>SOTO: You could give a fourth if you could give a (INAUDIBLE) few word answer.  </p><p>HUFFMAN: I think in the United States, society and on our platform, our users.  </p><p>SOTO: Okay. Who do you think should be the cop on the beat?  </p><p>CITRON: I'm gonna take your second best--best option which is the courts.  </p><p>SOTO: The courts.  </p><p>CITRON: Because it forces in some sense, the companies to actually be the norm producers.  </p><p>SOTO: Okay, Dr. McSherry?  </p><p>MCSHERRY: Yes, so I think the courts have a very important role to play, but also a cardinal principle for us at EFF, is at the end of the day users should be able to control their--their Internet experience.  </p><p>SOTO: Okay.  </p><p>MCSHERRY: You need to have many, many more tools for--to make that possible.  </p><p>SOTO: Ms. Peters?  </p><p>PETERS: I think that's a ridiculous argument. The vast majority of people--I study organized crime. </p><p>SOTO: Well let's get back to--do you think it should be the courts?  </p><p>PETERS: Hold on, I'm gonna answer the--I'm gonna answer the question.  </p><p>SOTO: FTC?  </p><p>PETERS: Courts and law enforcement.  </p><p>SOTO: Thank you.  </p><p>PETERS: Most people are good, a small percentage of people statistically in any community commit crime.  </p><p>SOTO: Okay, Ms. Oyama.  </p><p>PETERS: You have to control for it.  </p><p>SOTO: Thank you, Ms. Oyama?  </p><p>OYAMA: Content moderation has always been a multi-stake holder approach but I wanted to point out that the courts and the FTC do have jurisdiction and as you know the FTC does have broad jurisdiction over tech companies already and the courts are always looking at the outer contours of CDA 230's scope.  </p><p>SOTO: Thank you, Dr. Farid?  </p><p>FARID: (OFF-MIC) I agree there's a multi-stake holder, we all have a responsibility here.  </p><p>SOTO: And if we were to tighten up rules on the courts, it would be great to hear, first starting with you Dr. Farid, if we limit it to injunctive relief, do you think that would be enough and whether or not there should be attorney's fees at stake?  </p><p>FARID: Please understand, I'm not policy maker, I'm not a lawyer, I'm a technologist. So, you--I don't think you-you--I'm not the one should be answering that question, with--with due respect.  </p><p>SOTO: Okay, Ms. Oyama and Mr. Huffman, would injunctive relief in the courts be enough to change certain behaviors, do you think?  </p><p>OYAMA: I think I'd just say courts do have the power of injuctive relief. I would wanna echo the small businesses and startup voices, where they do say that the framework has created certainty that is essential for their content moderation, and their economic viability.  </p><p>SOTO: Thank you, Mr. Huffman?  </p><p>HUFFMAN: Similar answer, sir. I--I would shutter to think what would happen if we, when are small or even now we're on the receiving end of armies of  (INAUDIBLE) lawyers.  </p><p>SOTO: Ms. Citron, I see you nodding quite a bit. Injunctive relief, attorneys' fees, are these things that we should be looking?  </p><p>CITRON: So, I--I'd just--as you say injunctive relief, all I can see is the First Amendment and prior restraint. So, I think we--we need to be sort of careful in the kinds of remedies that we think about, but law operates--if we allow law operate, if people act with--unreasonably and recklessly then I think the array of possibility should be available.  </p><p>SOTO: Lastly, I wanna talk a little bit about 230, Section 230 as far as being incorporated in our trade deals. I am from Orlando, the land from where a fictional mouse and a fictional wizard are two of our greatest assets. Ms. Peters, I know you've talked a little bit about the issue of including 230 in trade deals, how would that be problematic for a region like ours, where intellectual property is so critical?  </p><p>PETERS: It's--it's problematic because it potentially is gonna tie Congress' hands from reforming the bill down the line and--and that's precisely why industry is pushing to have it inside the trade deal.  </p><p>OYAMA: There are 90 pages of copyrighted language in the existing-- </p><p>SOTO: --Okay.--  </p><p>OYAMA: --U.S. trade agreements. I think CDA 230 can just be treated the same, it's U.S. law, it doesn't bind Congress' hands at all.  </p><p>SOTO: So, if we adjusted laws here that would affect the trade deals, is your opinion then?   </p><p>OYAMA: There's no language in the trade deals that binds Congress' hands. Congress regularly has hearings on copyright, patent, pharmaceuticals, labor, climate, CDA 230, there's nothing in the trade agreement, the template language of U.S. law, to create a U.S. framework when countries like China and Russia are developing their own frameworks for the Internet. there's nothing in the current USMCA or the U.S. Japan FTA that would limit your ability to later look at 230 and decide that it needed tweaks later on.  </p><p>SOTO: Thanks, I yield back.  </p><p>SCHAKOWSKY: The gentlemen yields back and that concludes our period for questioning. And now, I seek unanimous consent to put into the record: a letter from CreativeFuture, with attachments, a letter from American Hotel and Lodging Association, a letter from Consumer Technology Association, a letter from Travel Technology Association, a whitepaper from Airbnb, a letter from Common Sense Media, a letter from Computer and Communications Industry Association, a letter from Representative Ed Grace (SP), a letter from--a letter in support of a Plan--Plan Act, a letter from the i2Coalition, a letter for---a letter to the FCC from Representative Gianforte, a letter from TechFreedom, a letter from the inter--Internet Association a letter from the-Wikimedia Foundation, a letter from the Motion Picture Association, an article from the Verge, titled \"Searching for Help,\" a statement from Our Street.  </p><p>Without objection, so ordered. And let me thank--where am I? Let me thank our witnesses. I think that was a really useful hearing, I think those of you who have suggestions, more concrete ones than sometimes came up today, our committee would appreciate it very, very much. I'm sure the joint committee would appreciate that as--as swell, this joint hearing. So, I wanna thank all of you so much for your thoughtful presentations and for the written testimony which also often went way beyond what we were able to--to hear today. And, so I want to remind members that pursuant to committee rules, they have 10 business days to submit additional questions for the record to be answered by witnesses who have appeared. And I want to ask witnesses to please respond promptly to any such questions that you may receive. And at this time, the committee, the committees are adjourned, thank you.  </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X9F-HX51-F15W-H3W4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.
