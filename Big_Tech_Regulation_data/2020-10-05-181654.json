Normally, but in Northern California, a growing tech sector in an area plagued with limited housing inventory has made what should be progress decidedly more tricky.<br/><br/>\"If you're going to be adding lots of jobs but not adding lots of housing it's inevitable that housing will get more expensive,\" says Gabriel Metcalf, the executive director of SPUR, a nonprofit public-policy research organization in the Bay Area. \u00c2\u00a0<br/>Across the nation, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.trulia.com/trends/2014/02/price-and-rent-monitors-jan-2014/\">rent climbed 3.3 percent</url> between the start of 2013 and 2014. In the top 10 technology hubs, that increase was about 5.7 percent, according to research from real estate website, Trulia. In the priciest of these cities, San Francisco, the cost of rental units       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.trulia.com/trends/2014/02/price-and-rent-monitors-jan-2014/\">jumped 12.3 percent</url> between 2013 and 2014. In August, the San Francisco Bay Guardian reported that       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sfbg.com/politics/2014/08/13/san-francisco-rent-explosion-median-rent-two-bedroom-apartment-tops-4k\">median rent</url> for a one-bedroom apartment in the city had topped $3,000.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0<br/><br/>Jess Silber, a 26-year-old who works for a travel adventure company knows all too well how hard it is to find an affordable home in the Bay Area. </p><p>Originally from Connecticut, Silber started plotting her move to the Bay while she was in Tanzania, working for an NGO and volunteering. When she arrived in 2012 she was, by her own admission, woefully naive about the realities of the market. \"The intention was to stay with my great aunt and uncle for like a week or so while I found an apartment. But then that became three months,\" Silber says, laughing at the memory. She quickly became acquainted with the demanding process of apartment-hunting, in which multiple application questionnaires and roommate interviews were commonplace in addition to the high cost.<br/>Silber says that apartments in some neighborhoods that would have rented for between about $800 and $1,000 when she first got to the Bay two years ago can now go for as much as $1,800. Her original hope of finding a spot for $500 a month? Laughable. Silber doubled her planned monthly rent-and even then she says she was still pretty limited when it came to finding available rooms.<br/>\"I didn't realize in addition to the expense, there's just so little space, there's such a density of people who want to live here and so little space available,\" Silber says.<br/>High-priced rent, picky landlords, and difficult roommates aren't a story that is unique to San Francisco and it's surrounding areas. But what makes the Bay Area's housing shortage so problematic is the confluence of a growing population and the historically slow pace of building, which exacerbates rental price growth. \"The problem isn't with the job creation, it's with our failed housing policy,\" says Metcalf.<br/>In San Francisco, the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.trulia.com/trends/2014/02/price-and-rent-monitors-jan-2014/\">speed of construction</url> in the area is one of the slowest in any of the 100 major metro areas. Since 1990, the city has allowed construction of only 117 units for every 1,000 units that existed in 1990. In nearby Oakland, the pace is similarly sluggish, 216 units for every 1,000. Seattle's pace is double that and Raleigh allows for 1,118 new units for every 1,000 that existed in 1990. Why is it so slow? Building regulations around the city and its surrounding areas can make it hard to get plans for large residential projects approved. Zoning restrictions prevent residential building in some areas near large tech campuses. And the city also has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Bold-vision-released-for-high-rise-complex-around-5873962.php\">height restrictions</url> in many locations, which limits the number of floors, and apartments, that can be created in any single building. To get around such rules, changes to regulations or approval by government entities are generally required.<br/><br/>San Francisco's mayor has set a goal to build 30,000 housing units within six years, which would represent slightly less than 10 percent of housing in the entire city, according to Ted Eagan, San Francisco's chief economist.<br/><br/>That, along with recent       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.spur.org/publications/article/2013-12-18/urban-field-notes-san-francisco-s-construction-boom\">uptick in apartment building</url> will help, but the relief won't be immediate.<br/>Does the mining industry have a solution that could work for Silicon Valley? In areas with growing fracking operations mining companies have erected so-called \"man camps\"-often made up of trailer parks, or blocks reserved in nearby motels.<br/>A couple of big tech companies have attempted Bay Area-style adaptations of this model: In 2013,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://nreionline.com/nreiwire/press-release-120-million-high-density-infill-apartment-community-moving-forward-near-faceb\">Facebook announced</url> that it will add a 394-unit apartment building near its headquarters in Menlo Park. But just a year earlier, Google's proposal to build almost three times as many apartments near its Mountain View campus fell apart. Why?<br/>\"We've created rules designed to protect neighborhood character in communities all across the Bay Area. The unintended consequences of those rules is that we have disallowed new housing in huge stretches of the Bay Area,\" Metcalf told me in an interview. Google's plan was nixed by city council members who compared the doomed plans for company-owned housing to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mv-voice.com/print/story/2012/07/13/google-housing-axed-in-citys-general-plan\">dorms and outdated mining towns</url>, according to local paper, the Mountain View Voice. <br/>As the price of housing continues to rise and companies continue to grow, one solution might be funneling more workers to campuses in other parts of the country says Jed Kolko, chief economist at Trulia. Another would involve simply paying incoming workers more to keep up with the rising cost of living. But that means more middle and lower-income dwellers getting the boot as prices for both rentals and homes grow.<br/>But some residents don't have many options and are forced to move farther away from city centers, or into more precarious housing units. Ellis Act Evictions in San Francisco, while still a small share of total evictions, have increased at a rapid rate. Under the Ellis Act, if landlords and building owners are going out of business they can evict all tenants from a building. From 2010 to 2013, all evictions increased by 38.2 percent. Evictions under the Ellis Act,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sfbos.org/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=47040\">increased 169.8 percent</url>, from 43 in 2010 to 116 in 2013.<br/>The battle over the evictions has been heated, with critics accusing owners of pushing out longtime, low-rent tenants in order to turn buildings into market-rate condos or other high-priced housing options, rather than closing up shop for financial hardship. For their part,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/city-attorney-to-appeal-federal-judges-ruling-against-tenant-relocation-law/Content?oid=2909951\">landlords have made headway</url> in their challenge to an ordinance that would have required them to pay the difference between evicted tenants' current rent and a market-price unit of the same size as a relocation expense.<br/>Some Bay Area residents have developed a dark humor when talking about the rental housing situation, where price hikes can be swift and prohibitive. During a recent walk, Silber and her roommates spotted an abandoned dog crate on the side of the road and jokingly wonder how much that space would cost to rent. They settled on $1,200 a month. After all, it was downtown.<br/>Read       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/11/plenty-of-work-but-nowhere-to-live/382482/\">Plenty of Work, but Nowhere to Live</url> on theatlantic.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-plentyofworkbutnowheretolive382482</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DJD-16R1-JCG7-V0V1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1127\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

And as the conversion to electric engines continues, local government policymakers and administrators will need to provide oversight on a considerable investment in charging stations and other wayside infrastructureall tied to the electrical grid and coordinated through government and regulatory agencies.</p><p>Will these changes to infrastructure be publicly or privately funded, and if through government revenues, where will the money come from? More importantly, how can local government agencies justify funding new infrastructure for a transformational technology that may compete with public transit and significantly reduce municipal revenues?</p><p>The Race Is On</p><p>The most obvious indication of something big brewing is the near-universal enthusiasm for electrification and self-driving technologies coming from the automobile manufacturers themselves.</p><p>There is Tesla, of course, but Ford says it will have a fully autonomous vehicle in commercial operation by 2021. GM's self-driving research and production armCruise Automationhas unveiled its latest version of a battery-powered Chevy Bolt, which has no manual controls and will be on the street without a driver next year.</p><p>All the world's major vehicle manufacturersHonda, Hyundai, Daimler, Renault-Nissan, Volkswagen, and Volvoare vying to gain the edge in self-driving technologies.</p><p>At the same time, it has become clear that the last century's gas-fueled combustion engine's days are numbered. In many countries, diesel engines are already being banned. By 2030, only electric and hybrid vehicles will be available for purchase in most Scandinavian and EU nations, India, and Korea.</p><p>Copenhagen already has an electric fleet of 400 (BMW) cars. China is now the world's biggest producer and market for electrified vehicles, producing 680,000 all-electric cars, buses, and trucks in 2017.</p><p>And although the United States has no federal policy mandating electrification, many states are already setting targets for electric car sales. General Motors has said that it will introduce at least 20 new electric vehicles by 2023.</p><p>Local governments are rightly concerned about the infrastructure implications of nearly every future vehicle needing access to recharging facilities.</p><p>Ride Hailing Is Here, Too</p><p>Bolstering this shift toward electrification and self-driving, of course, is the ride-hailing movement, which takes advantage of the growing expectation of on-demand transportation, and the increasing willingness of both the old and young to forgo vehicle ownership in favor of shared transportation services.</p><p>Uber has just agreed to buy 24,000 self-driving cars from Volvo in the next three years. Waymo (owned by Google's parent corporation, Alphabet) has agreed to buy thousands of minivans from FiatChrysler. And as an example of the cross-functional scramble for leadership in this area, even the car manufactures themselves are getting into the fray.</p><p>General Motors is rolling out plans for a fully autonomous ride-sharing service by 2019. Nissan is preparing to launch its own Easy Ride \"robot\" taxi service in Japan. Ford is planning a fully autonomous ride-hailing service by 2021.</p><p>And that's not to mention the logistics groupsAmazon, FedEx, UPS, and even the U.S. Post Officethat will soon flood the streets with (mostly electric) AV shuttles for curbside pickup and deliveries.</p><p>These companies know that as the \"sharing\" aspect of the AV economy kicks in, fleet ownership will quickly outpace private AV sales. That means that ride-hailing companies will soon dominate the autonomous vehicle market; and they will choose electric cars as they become increasingly cost effective and reliable.</p><p>This enormous investment in research and funding by private industry has led to early collaboration with cities, with pilots moving quickly out of the controlled testing campuses and onto real city streets where local governments have been eager to offer up their infrastructure as proving grounds: Austin, Boston, Phoenix/Chandler, Detroit, Las Vegas, Pittsburgh, Reno, San Antonio, San Francisco, San Jose, and Washington, D.C., are all actively piloting AV programs.</p><p>As the potential benefits of self-driving, electrification, and ride-hailing are becoming more obvious, and the potential threat to public transportation systems looms large, local administrators themselves are beginning to buy into electric AVs to augment their own public transit systems.</p><p>This can be in the form of the driverless bus fleets that are proliferating in the Bay Area, or a municipally owned fleet like that in Columbus, Ohio, where the city council has approved a lease-to-own option for 93 electric vehicles.</p><p>Planning Ahead</p><p>If you're in the administration of a large community, you've probably already started to plan for the AV economy. A November 2017 report from the National League of Cities found that nearly 40 percent of U.S. major cities are preparing for self-driving vehicles in their long-range transportation plans.</p><p>Unfortunately, self-driving cars and electrification are too often thought of only in the context of \"smart\" (and usually, large) cities. But what about people living in satellite counties, suburban municipalities, and small or rural towns? What role do they play in this AV transportation and economic restructuring?</p><p>It's important to appreciate that in many ways small towns are just as critical to the success of the AV transformation as large cities. That's not only because many of the services that these smaller communities need locallyshopping, seeing the doctor, or simply getting out of the house to visit friends and familycan be enhanced through AVs.</p><p>Equally important, because they often commute into larger cities, suburban and rural residents are the ones who are most likely to take advantage of shared, self-driving technologies, and to participate in first-mile/last-mile AV ride-sharing from public transit hubs.</p><p>Whatever the size of the community, though, without planning, administrators may face a serious asymmetry in terms of financial clout and contractual savvy when powerful transportation companies show up on the doorstep (or at the curb). That's why local governmentslarge or smallneed to be actively thinking through their policy goals now.</p><p>So what should administrators, managers, and planners be doing in order to prepare for this transformation to electrification and shared self-driving vehicles? Here are several areas to consider:</p><p>Addressing the built environment/infrastructure. One of the advantages, and necessary preconditions, of self-driving vehicles is that they can go anywhere on public roads that a normal car or truck can go. Equipped with a variety of sensors, cameras, and GPS, AVs are being developed as an all-purpose alternative to human drivers, operating safely on normal highways without the need for special equipment or dedicated lanes.</p><p>Of course, it isn't quite that straightforward. Self-driving vehicles still need well-maintained road construction and signage, and the better the infrastructure, the better they will work. More important, local governments still control the right-of-way access and are responsible for zoning and permitting.</p><p>Parking strategies may need to be revisited and parking garages repurposed. Providing safe and easy access for riders of hailed on demand vehicles may require changes to curb access and traffic flows.</p><p>A comprehensive but flexible pole policy will be necessary for mounting 5G sensors, while at the same time keeping telephone and lamp poles from becoming overburdened and ugly.</p><p>And because pedestrian traffic and bicycles will bring an autonomous vehicle to a standstill, it may be necessary to segregate AVs from pedestrian and bicycle zones to keep traffic flowing.</p><p>Policy considerations. Administrations also need to think about permitting, certifications, and speed limits, and will want to encourageor on the other hand, restrict and regulateAVs and ride-hailing, according to their community's best interest.</p><p>That means having a data-collection and data-sharing policy ready before ride-hailing AV groups arrive on your doorstep. Your community may want to develop pricing incentives that will discourage congestion, promote shared ridership, or develop special provisions for children, the elderly, the disabled, or lower-income groups.</p><p>With ride-hailing services already reducing public transit ridership by an average of 12 percent nationwide, transit agencies, cities, and ride-hailing groups will need early agreement on aspects of public and private coordination at transit hubs. Eventual synchronization of scheduling and payment systems will become necessary across multiple modes of transport.</p><p>Importantly, an evaluation framework for pilot projects and contracted services should be prepared well before the request for information process takes place so that administrators have time to decide how they will assess AV proposals.</p><p>Budgeting and manpower. Another important policy issue that looms large for local government professionals is how to compensate for lost revenues. Over time, the shift to the combination of AV and shared transportation will undoubtedly change the nature of the local budget.</p><p>After all, once fully realized, the sharing, AV economy may significantly reduceor even eliminatemany traditional revenue sources. Ride-sharing and roaming fleets of self-driving vehicles will not need to use parking meters or park in garages, and AVs will all but eliminate fees and fines for speeding, illegal parking, emissions-testing, and DUI and traffic violations. This will represent a significant loss of income for most jurisdictions.</p><p>And it's not just revenues that will be affected. The sharing, AV economy will also mean rethinking local staffing and resource priorities in a wide variety of areas. The police force, for example, will need to adapt to different duties and a smaller presence.</p><p>Today, 80 percent of the typical city police department is involved in some way with traffic control. On the other hand, communities may need to staff new inspector, engineering, IT, and data management roles.</p><p>Outreach and public discussion. Finally, the transformation to the AV economy will require an ongoing dialogue between elected officials and administrators, and possibly most important, administrators and the public.</p><p>After all, these changes can affect a lot of people in a lot of ways, including changes to local employment, as many traditional automotive-related jobs shrink in number or even disappear.</p><p>As more people turn to ride-hailing or shared-use vehicles, parking lots will gradually become available for apartments or retail space, affecting a community's social cohesion as well as local housing prices.</p><p>There may be public-safety concerns, and there will certainly be objections to changing methods of revenue collection.</p><p>Putting Your Community First</p><p>All of these infrastructure and policy decisions should be reflected in the city or county's comprehensive plan, which should be expanded to cover key aspects of transportation planning and infrastructure investment priorities around AV, sharing, and electrification.</p><p>Managers and policymakers should take advantage of the time still available to think through and agree on their community's principles and priorities. This should be done before the potentially disruptive effects of electrification, sharing, and self-driving vehicles begin to exercise control over all aspects of transportation and public policy in the future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122197687</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SPG-0R21-JCBF-S0KC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2113\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 27, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

He warned that without more 'difficult, painful decisions', Britain's confidence that it will always be able to pay its way as a major industrial economy could prove misplaced.</p><p>The world's old powers are 'on the slide', he said, with countries that are 'fat, sclerotic, over-regulated, spending money on unaffordable welfare systems' doomed to fail.</p><p>'I am not going to stand here and allow this country to join the slide,' Mr Cameron declared. He was most passionate about Education Secretary Michael Gove's mission to free schools from the dead hand of state control, attacking the left-wing education establishment for creating a 'toxic culture of low expectations'.</p><p>                     MY GRANDAD ABANDONED FAMILY FOR HIS LOVER, SAYS <person><nameText>DAVID CAMERON          </nameText></person></p><p><person><nameText>David Cameron </nameText></person>yesterday spoke openly for the first time about how his grandfather had abandoned his grandmother for a younger woman.</p><p>The Prime Minister revealed that his father Ian was forced to support grandmother Enid Levita when her husband, Donald Cameron, ran off with Austrian aristocrat Marielen von Meiss-Teuffen.</p><p>Mr Cameron's grandfather died in 1958, eight years before the Tory leader was born. </p><p>The Prime Minister said his late father had been a major influence on his life and spoke movingly about how much he had missed him since his death in September 2010. Ian Cameron, who died aged 77, was born with a disability that required several operations on his feet. </p><p>Despite going on to have both legs amputated and losing the sight in one eye, he forged a successful career as a stockbroker. </p><p>While he was preparing to attend Eton, a teenaged Ian Cameron was forced to pick up the pieces after his father left his wife and set up home with his lover in Kensington. </p><p>Recalling a conversation with his father, Mr Cameron told the conference: 'He told me what he was most proud of. It was simple - working hard from the moment he left school and providing a good start in life for his family. </p><p>'Not just for all of us, but helping his mum too, when his father ran off. Not a hard-luck story, but a hard-work story.'</p><p>In the teeth of opposition, Mr Cameron said the Government had opened 79 new free schools, which are able to run their own affairs without local authority interference, with more than 100 more to come, and helped create more than 2,000 academies.</p><p>On welfare, Mr Cameron said Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith's reforms were as 'profound' as those of the Liberal creator of the welfare state, William Beveridge, 60 years ago. He hailed the Government's cap on housing benefit to stop jobless families getting up to \u00a360,000 a year from the state. He\u00a0 confirmed further reforms are being planned. </p><p>On the economy, he acknowledged that the Government's deficit reduction plan was 'taking longer than we hoped'. But he hailed the 'grit and resolve' of Chancellor George Osborne for cutting 25 per cent from the vast budget deficit.</p><p>Ridiculing Ed Miliband's attempt to seize the Conservative 'one nation' mantra, he denounced Labour as 'the party of one notion - more borrowing'. </p><p>Taking a swipe at 'intellectuals of other parties' like Mr Miliband who 'sneer at people who want to get on in life', Mr Cameron said: 'We here salute you.' </p><p>'They call us the party of the better-off - no, we are the party of the \"want to be better-off\", those who strive to make a better life for themselves and their families.'</p><p>He predicted 'a lot more fights' with conservationists, Nimbys and bureaucrats, as he vowed to unlock the planning system. </p><p>He said reforms were necessary not just to kick-start the economy, but also to allow the house building needed to give young people the chance of owning a home.</p><p>                     FIGHTING POVERTY, HELPING THE YOUNG: PM'S SPEECH AT A GLANCE                   </p><p>HEALTH</p><p>Waiting lists - down. Mixed wards - down. The number of managers - down. Bureaucratic targets - down. Hospital infections - down. And what's up? The number of doctors, the number of dentists, the number of midwives, the number of operations carried out in our NHS.</p><p>ECONOMY</p><p>To help our people rise, then - number one - we need an economy that creates good jobs. Getting the deficit down is essential.</p><p>LABOUR</p><p>When they were in office, their answer was always: Borrow more money. Now they're out of office it's: Borrow more money.</p><p>HOUSING</p><p>Young people who work hard year after year ...are still living at home. They sit in their childhood bedroom, looking out of the window dreaming of a place of their own. I want us to say to them - you are our people, we are on your side, we will help you reach your dreams. </p><p>WELFARE</p><p>Work isn't slavery, it's poverty that is slavery and again it's us, the modern compassionate Conservative party, who are the real champions of fighting poverty in Britain today.</p><p>EDUCATION</p><p>I went to a great school and I want every child to have a great education. I want more free schools, more Academies, more rigorous exams in every school, more expected of every child.</p><p>TAX</p><p>Ed Miliband... Let me explain to you how it works. When people earn money, it's their money. Not the Government's money: their money. Then, the Government takes some of it away in tax. So, if we cut taxes, we're not giving them money - we're taking less of it away. OK?</p><p>In a deeply personal section of the speech, Mr Cameron spoke of the values he had learned from his father, Ian, who died in 2010.</p><p>'I don't have a hard luck story. My dad was a stockbroker from Berkshire,' he said as his voice cracked.</p><p>'It's only when your dad's gone that you realise - not just how much you really miss them - but how much you really owe them. My dad influenced me much more than I ever thought.'</p><p>Mr Cameron added: 'He was born with no heels on his feet and legs about a foot shorter than they're meant to be. But he never complained - even when he lost both those legs later in life.</p><p>'But Dad was the eternal optimist. To him the glass was always half full. Usually with something alcoholic in it.'</p><p>He said his father's life was 'not a hard luck story, but a hard work story'. He added: 'Work hard. Family comes first. But put back into the community too.</p><p>'And there is nothing complicated about what we need today. But it's tough. These are difficult times. We're being tested.</p><p>'How will we come through it? Again, it's not complicated. Hard work. Strong families. Taking responsibility. Serving others.'</p><p>He said the mission for the Government was 'to build an aspiration nation to unleash and unlock the promise in all our people'.</p><p>On the NHS he said the Government had cut waiting lists, mixed wards, the number of managers and hospital infections.</p><p>'And what's up? The number of doctors, the number of dentists, the number of midwives, the number of operations carried out in our NHS. </p><p>'So be in no doubt: this is the party of the NHS and that's the way it's going to stay.'</p><p>Mr Cameron, who celebrated his 46th birthday on Tuesday night with a curry, took on critics in his party unhappy at the decision to protect the foreign aid budget from cuts, telling delegates British money had vaccinated 130,000 children around the world.</p><p>'You, the Conservative party helped to do that, and you should be proud of what you've done.'</p><p>He urged the audience to give a standing ovation to the armed forces to 'show how profoundly grateful we are for everything they do'.</p><p>He claimed that the Government was doing 'big Conservative things' but warned against it giving a 'false sense of security'. </p><p>He said the deficit reduction plan was not an alternative to a growth plan, 'it is the very foundation of our growth plan'.</p><p>'Now I know you are asking whether the plan is working. And here's the truth: the damage was worse than we thought, and it's taking longer than we hoped.</p><p>'If we did what Labour want, and watered down our plans, the risk is that the people we borrow money from would start to question our ability and resolve to pay off our debts. Some may actually refuse to lend us that money. </p><p>'Others would only lend it to us at higher interest rates. That would hurt the economy and hit people hard.'</p><p>Mr Cameron defended his overseas trips with business leaders, saying he wanted the Foreign Office to use its embassies as showrooms for UK firms.</p><p>'Don't let anyone tell you Britain can't make it in this world - we're the most enterprising, buccaneering, creative, dynamic nation on earth.'</p><p>Michael Dugher, Labour's shadow cabinet office minister, attacked the speech, saying: 'This was a defensive speech, from an out of touch, clearly rattled leader, who cannot be the One Nation Prime Minister we need.</p><p>'Rather than tackling the banks, or explaining why borrowing is going up not down, he chose to defend his millionaires' tax cut.'</p><p>                     Britain on the rise: <person><nameText>David Cameron's </nameText></person>full speech to the Tory party conference                   </p><p>In May 2010, this party stood on the threshold of power for the first time in more than a decade.</p><p>We knew then that it was not just the ordinary duties of office that we were assuming.</p><p>We were entering into Government at a grave moment in the modern history of Britain.</p><p>At a time when people felt uncertainty, even fear.</p><p>Here was the challenge: To make an insolvent nation solvent again.</p><p>To set our country back on the path to prosperity that all can share in.</p><p>To bring home our troops from danger while keeping our citizens safe from terror.</p><p>To mend a broken society.</p><p>Two and a half years later of course I can't tell you that all is well, but I can say this:</p><p>Britain is on the right track.</p><p>As Prime Minister it has fallen to me to say some hard things and to help our country face some hard truths.</p><p>All of my adult life, whatever the difficulties, the British people have at least been confident about one thing. </p><p>We have thought we can pay our way.\u00a0 That we can earn our living as a major industrial country...</p><p>...and we will always remain one.</p><p>It has fallen to us to say - we cannot assume that any longer. </p><p>Unless we act, unless we take difficult, painful decisions, unless we show determination and imagination, Britain may not be in the future what it has been in the past.</p><p>Because the truth is this.\u00a0 We are in a global race today. And that means an hour of reckoning for countries like ours. Sink or swim. Do or decline. </p><p>To take office at such a moment is a duty and an honour...</p><p>...and we will rise to the challenge.</p><p>Today I'm going to set out a serious argument to this country about how we do that.</p><p>How we compete and thrive in this world...</p><p>...how we can make sure in this century, like the ones before, Britain is on the rise.</p><p>Nothing matters more. </p><p>Every battle we fight, every plan we make, every decision we take is to achieve that end...</p><p>...Britain on the rise.</p><p>                     BRITAIN CAN DELIVER                   </p><p>Though the challenge before us is daunting, I have confidence in our country. </p><p>Why? Because Britain can deliver. We can do big things.\u00a0 We saw it this summer. </p><p>The Jubilee, the Olympics, the Paralympics...</p><p>...the best country in the world...</p><p>...and let's say it: with our Queen, the finest Head of State on earth.</p><p>I was trying to think of my favourite moment. </p><p>Was it telling President Hollande that no, we hadn't cheated at the cycling, we didn't have rounder wheels, it was just that we peddled faster than the French?</p><p>No... for me it was seeing that young woman who swam her heart out for years... </p><p>...nine training sessions a week, two hours a time.</p><p>My best moment was putting that gold medal around the neck of Ellie Simmonds.\u00a0 </p><p>And I am so grateful for what all those Paralympians did. </p><p>When I used to push my son Ivan around in his wheelchair, I always thought that some people saw the wheelchair, not the boy.</p><p>Today more people would see the boy and not the wheelchair - and that's because of what happened here this summer.</p><p>And the Olympics showed us something else. </p><p>Whether our athletes were English, Scottish, Welsh or from Northern Ireland, they draped themselves in one flag. </p><p>Now, there's one person who didn't like that and he's called Alex Salmond. </p><p>I'm going to see him on Monday to sort that referendum on independence by the end of 2014. </p><p>There are many things I want this coalition to achieve but what could matter more than saving our United Kingdom let's say it: we're better together and we'll rise together - so let's fight that referendum with everything we've got. </p><p>There are so many people to thank for this summer.</p><p>Those that won the bid, those that built the stadia, that ran the Games and of course: the man who put a smile on our faces, the zinger on the zip-wire, the Conservative Mayor of London: our Boris Johnson. </p><p>And those Games-Makers. You know, I've spent three years trying to explain the Big Society they did it beautifully in just three weeks.</p><p>There is another group of people who stepped into the breach this summer - and we in this party never forget them.</p><p>Our armed forces have been on the ground in Afghanistan for over ten years now.</p><p>433 men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice.</p><p>Just last weekend there was a memorial service for one of the fallen, and the eulogy said this:</p><p>\"All that they had they gave. All that they might have had. All that they had ever been. All that they might ever have become.\"</p><p>For all those who serve, and their families, I repeat the commitment I made when this Government came to office. </p><p>By the end of 2014, all UK combat operations in Afghanistan will have come to an end. </p><p>Nearly all our troops will be home - their country proud, their duty done and let everyone in this hall stand and show how profoundly grateful we are for everything they do. </p><p>                     CONSERVATIVES CAN DELIVER                   </p><p>To meet the challenges our country faces, we must have confidence in ourselves... confidence as a party.</p><p>We've been in office two and a half years now - and we've done some big, life-changing things.</p><p>Just ask Clive Stone, who you saw in a film earlier. </p><p>I met him years ago, when we were in Opposition. </p><p>He had cancer and he said to me: the drug I need - it's out there but they won't give it to me because it's too expensive please, if you get in, do something about it. </p><p>And we have. A new cancer drugs fund that has got the latest drugs to more than 21,000 people and counting. There was a reason we could do that. </p><p>It's because we made a big decision to protect the NHS from spending cuts. No other party made that commitment. </p><p>Not Labour. Not the Liberal Democrats. Just us - the Conservatives. To all those people who said we'd bring the NHS down...I say......well, yes, you've got a point.</p><p>I'll tell you what is down.</p><p>Waiting lists - down. Mixed wards - down. The number of managers - down. Bureaucratic targets - down. Hospital infections - down.</p><p>And what's up? The number of doctors, the number of dentists, the number of midwives, the number of operations carried out in our NHS.</p><p>So be in no doubt: this is the party of the NHS and that's the way it's going to stay. </p><p>We made a big decision to go on saving lives abroad too. </p><p>I know some are sceptical about our aid budget. </p><p>But picture the scene - you're in a health centre in Kinshasa. </p><p>See the child with a needle in her arm, being injected with a Yellow Fever vaccine the difference between living and dying how can anyone tell me that's a waste of money. </p><p>Since we gathered here in Birmingham on Sunday, British aid money has vaccinated 130 thousand children around the world. One hundred and thirty thousand children.</p><p>You, the Conservative party helped do that, and you should be proud of what you've done.\u00a0 </p><p>Here's something else this party's done in government. </p><p>Last December I was at a European Council in Brussels. </p><p>It was three in the morning, there was a treaty on the table that was not in Britain's interests and twenty five people around that table were telling me to sign it.</p><p>But I did something that no other British leader has ever done before. </p><p>I said no - Britain comes first - and I vetoed that EU treaty.</p><p>We're doing big, Conservative things. </p><p>For years people said you'll never reform public sector pensions, the trade unions won't stand for it.</p><p>Well, we've done it, and it's going to cut the cost to the taxpayer almost in half. </p><p>For years people said benefits are out of control and there's nothing you can do about it.</p><p>Well, because of our welfare cap, no family will be getting more in benefits than the average family earns. </p><p>For years people asked why we couldn't get rid of those radical preachers who spout hatred about Britain while living off the taxpayer...</p><p>...well, Theresa May - a great Home Secretary - has done it - and she's got Abu Hamza on that plane and out of our country to face justice. </p><p>Be proud of what we've done already.</p><p>Two million of the lowest-paid workers being taken out of income tax altogether.</p><p>Over eighteen million households helped with a freeze in their council tax - and we're freezing it all over again next year too.</p><p>                     BRITAIN ON THE RISE                   </p><p>Big, Conservative things - delivered by this government; made possible by this party.</p><p>We can deliver. We can do big things. </p><p>The Olympics reminded us how great it feels to be successful.</p><p>But we mustn't let that warm glow give us a false sense of security.</p><p>All around the world, countries are on the rise.</p><p>Yes, we've been hearing about China and India for years but it's hard to believe what's happening in Brazil, in Indonesia, in Nigeria too.</p><p>Meanwhile, the old powers are on the slide.</p><p>What do the countries on the rise have in common?</p><p>They are lean, fit, obsessed with enterprise, spending money on the future - on education, incredible infrastructure and technology.</p><p>And what do the countries on the slide have in common?</p><p>They're fat, sclerotic, over-regulated, spending money on unaffordable welfare systems, huge pension bills, unreformed public services.</p><p>I sit in those European Council meetings where we talk endlessly about Greece while on the other side of the world, China is moving so fast it's creating a new economy the size of Greece every three months.\u00a0 </p><p>I am not going to stand here as Prime Minister and allow this country to join the slide.</p><p>My job - our job - is to make sure that in this twenty first century, as in the centuries that came before, our country, Britain, is on the rise.</p><p>And we here know how that is done.</p><p>It is the collective result of individual effort and aspiration, the ideas you have, the businesses you start, the hours you put in.</p><p>Aspiration is the engine of progress.</p><p>Countries rise when they allow their people to rise.</p><p>In this world where brains matter more, where technologies shape our lives, where no-one is owed a living...</p><p>...the most powerful natural resource we have is our people. </p><p>Not just the scientists, the entrepreneurs, the engineers...</p><p>...not just the teachers, the parents, the nurses...</p><p>...but all our people: including the poorest, those who've never had a job, never had a chance, never had hope. </p><p>That's why the mission for this government is to build an aspiration nation...</p><p>...to unleash and unlock the promise in all our people. </p><p>And for us Conservatives, this is not just an economic mission - it's also a moral one.</p><p>It's not just about growth and GDP...</p><p>...it's what's always made our hearts beat faster - aspiration; people rising from the bottom to the top.</p><p>Line one, rule one of being a Conservative is that it's not where you've come from that counts, it's where you're going. </p><p>We've been led by the daughter of a grocer, the son of a music hall performer...</p><p>...by a Jew when Jews were marginalised, by a woman when women were sidelined. </p><p>We don't look at the label on the tin; we look at what's in it. </p><p>Let me put that another way.</p><p>We don't preach about one nation but practise class war...</p><p>...we just get behind people who want to get on in life. </p><p>The doers. The risk takers. The young people who dream of their first pay-cheque, their first car, their first home - and are ready and willing to work hard to get those things.</p><p>While the intellectuals of other parties sneer at people who want to get on in life, we here salute you.</p><p>They call us the party of the better-off...</p><p>...no: we are the party of the want to be better-off, those who strive to make a better life for themselves and their families - and we should never, ever be ashamed of saying so.</p><p>                     THE RIGHT IDEAS                   </p><p>This party has a heart but we don't like wearing it on our sleeve.</p><p>Conservatives think: let's just get on with the job and help people and not bang on about it. It's not our style. </p><p>But there's a problem with that. </p><p>It leaves a space for others to twist our ideas and distort who we are: the cartoon Conservatives who don't care. </p><p>My mission from the day I became leader was to change that.</p><p>Yes, to show the Conservative party is for everyone: North or South, black or white, straight or gay.</p><p>But above all - to show that Conservative methods are not just the way we grow a strong economy, but the way we build a big society.</p><p>That Conservative methods are not just good for the strong and the successful but the best way to help the poor, and the weak, and the vulnerable.</p><p>Because it's not enough to know our ideas are right - we've got to explain why they are compassionate too.</p><p>Because we know what we're up against. </p><p>We say we've got to get the private sector bigger and the public sector smaller...our opponents call it 'Tory cuts, slashing the state'.</p><p>No: it's the best way to create the sustainable jobs people need.</p><p>We say help people become independent from welfare...our opponents call it: 'cruel Tories, leaving people to fend for themselves.'</p><p>No: there is only one real route out of poverty and it is work.</p><p>We say we've got to insist on a disciplined, rigorous education for our children...our opponents call it: 'elitist Tories, old-fashioned and out of touch.' </p><p>No: a decent education is the only way to give all our children a proper start in this world.</p><p>The reason we want to reform schools, to cut welfare dependency, to reduce government spending is not because we're the same old Tories who want to help the rich...</p><p>...it's because we're the Tories whose ideas help everyone - the poorest the most.</p><p>A strong private sector. Welfare that works. Schools that teach. </p><p>These three things are essential to helping our people rise.</p><p>They are essential to our success in this world. </p><p>And you know what - Labour will fight them all the way. </p><p>So these things are not just the battle-ground for Britain's future...</p><p>...they are also the battle-lines for the next election - and it is a fight we've got to win, for our party and our country.</p><p>                     ECONOMY                   </p><p>To help our people rise, then - number one - we need an economy that creates good jobs.</p><p>We need businesses, of every size, in every type of industry, in every part of the country - investing and taking people on.</p><p>There are some basic things they need to do that.</p><p>Low interest rates so they can afford to take out a loan.And confidence that it's worth investing - because the customers will be there, whether at home or abroad.</p><p>Getting the deficit down is essential for both.</p><p>That's why our deficit reduction plan is not an alternative to a growth plan: it's the very foundation of our growth plan.</p><p>It's the only way we'll get Britain on the rise. </p><p>Now I know you are asking whether the plan is working.</p><p>And here's the truth: the damage was worse than we thought, and it's taking longer than we hoped.</p><p>The world economy - especially in the Eurozone - has been much weaker than expected in the past two years.</p><p>When some of our big trading partners like Ireland, Spain and Italy are suffering, they buy less from us. </p><p>That hurts our growth and makes it harder to pay off our debts. </p><p>But here is the crucial thing you need to know. </p><p>Yes it's worse than we thought, yes it's taking longer, but we are making progress.</p><p>Thanks to the grit and resolve of George Osborne, we have cut a quarter off the deficit in the past two years. 25 per cent.\u00a0 </p><p>That's helped to keep interest rates at record low levels, keeping mortgages low.\u00a0 </p><p>Leaving more money in your pockets.\u00a0 </p><p>Giving businesses more confidence to invest.</p><p>Creating more jobs.</p><p>And if you don't believe me, just look at the job creation figures.</p><p>Since this government took office, over one million new jobs have been created in the private sector.</p><p>That is more - net - in the last two years than Labour managed in ten years. </p><p>                     LABOUR                    </p><p>Now, the Labour politicians who got us into the mess say they have a different way out of it.</p><p>They call it Plan B and it goes like this: </p><p>We should stop worrying about deficit reduction, borrow more money and spend it to boost the economy. </p><p>It sounds so reasonable when you put it like that. </p><p>Let me tell you why it's not.</p><p>Right now, while we've got a deficit, the people we're borrowing money from believe that we'll pay it back - because we've set out a tough plan to cut spending and live within our means.</p><p>That's why our interest rates are among the lowest in the world, even though the deficit left to us by Labour was one of the highest in the world.</p><p>If we did what Labour want, and watered down our plans, the risk is that the people we borrow money from would start to question our ability and resolve to pay off our debts. </p><p>Some may actually refuse to lend us that money. </p><p>Others would only lend it to us at higher interest rates. </p><p>That would hurt the economy and hit people hard.</p><p>If you have a mortgage of \u00a3100,000, just a 1 per cent interest rate rise would mean an extra thousand pounds to pay each year.</p><p>Labour's plan to borrow more is actually a massive gamble with our economy and our future.</p><p>And it would squander the sacrifices we've already made.</p><p>We're here because they spent too much and borrowed too much.</p><p>How can the answer be more spending and more borrowing?</p><p>I honestly think Labour haven't learned a single thing.</p><p>When they were in office, their answer was always:</p><p>Borrow more money.</p><p>Now they're out of office it's:</p><p>Borrow more money.</p><p>Whatever the day, whatever the question, whatever the weather it's: borrow more money.</p><p>Borrow, borrow, borrow. </p><p>Labour: the party of one notion: more borrowing.</p><p>I sometimes wonder if they know anything about the real economy at all.</p><p>Did you hear what Ed Miliband said last week about taxes?</p><p>He described a tax cut as the government writing people a cheque.</p><p>Ed... Let me explain to you how it works.</p><p>When people earn money, it's their money.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>Not the government's money: their money.</p><p>Then, the government takes some of it away in tax.</p><p>So, if we cut taxes, we're not giving them money - we're taking less of it away.\u00a0 OK?</p><p>And while we're on that - who suffers when the wealthy businessman goes off to live in Geneva? </p><p>Not him - he's paying about half the tax he would do here...</p><p>...it's those who want to work who suffer because the jobs aren't being created here.</p><p>We promised that those with the broadest shoulders would bear the biggest burden...</p><p>...and with us, the rich will pay a greater share of tax in every year of this Parliament than in any one of the thirteen years under Labour.</p><p>Under Labour.</p><p>We haven't forgotten, you know. </p><p>We remember who spent our golden legacy, who sold our gold...</p><p>...who busted our banks, who smothered our businesses...</p><p>... who wracked up our debts, who wrecked our economy...</p><p>...who ruined our reputation, who risked our future...</p><p>...who did this? - Labour did this - and this country should never forget it. </p><p>                     ASPIRATION ECONOMY                   </p><p>To get Britain on the rise we need a whole new economy...</p><p>...more enterprising, more aspirational...</p><p>...and it's taking shape already.</p><p>We're getting our entrepreneurial streak back: last year the rate of new business creation was faster than any other year in our history. </p><p>Let me repeat that. </p><p>The rate at which new businesses started - faster than any year on record. </p><p>We're making things again.</p><p>We had a trade surplus in cars last year for the first time in almost 40 years.</p><p>And it's not just the old industries growing, it's the new. </p><p>We're number one in the world for offshore wind.</p><p>Number one in the world for tidal power.</p><p>The world's first green investment bank. </p><p>Britain leading; Britain on the rise.\u00a0 We're showing we can do it.</p><p>Look at the new investment coming in. </p><p>In the last two years, Google, Intel, Cisco - the big tech firms - they've all set up new bases here. </p><p>And we are selling to the world again. </p><p>When I became Prime Minister I said to the Foreign Office: those embassies you've got...</p><p>...turn them into showrooms for our cars, department stores for our fashion, technology hubs for British start-ups.</p><p>Yes, you're diplomats but you need to be our country's salesforce too.</p><p>And look what's happening.</p><p>In just two years, our exports to Brazil are up 25 per cent...</p><p>...to China - 40 per cent...</p><p>...to Russia - 80 per cent. </p><p>There are so many opportunities in this world. </p><p>I want to tell you about one business that's seizing them. </p><p>It's run by a guy called Alastair Lukies. </p><p>He and his business partner saw a world with almost 6 billion mobile phones and just 2 billion bank accounts. </p><p>They saw the huge gap in the market- and they started a mobile banking firm...</p><p>...helping people in the poorest parts of the world manage their money and start new companies.</p><p>He's been with me on trade missions all over the world - and his business is booming. </p><p>Back in 2010, when we came to office, they employed about 100 people - now it's more than 700. </p><p>Then they were nowhere in Africa, nowhere in Asia, now they are the global player, with one million new users every month. </p><p>So don't let anyone tell you Britain can't make it in this world - we're the most enterprising, buccaneering, creative, dynamic nation on earth. </p><p>And to those who question whether it's right to load up a plane with businesspeople - whether we're flying to Africa, Indonesia, to the Gulf or China...</p><p>...whether we're taking people from energy, finance, technology or yes - defence ...</p><p>...I say - there is a global battle out there to win jobs, orders, contracts...</p><p>...and in that battle I believe in leading from the front. </p><p>To get our economy on the rise there's a lot more to do - and frankly a lot more fights to be had. </p><p>Because there are too many of what I'd call the \"yes-but-no\" people. </p><p>The ones who say \"yes, our businesses need to expand...</p><p>...but no we can't reform planning.\"</p><p>It's simple.</p><p>For a business to expand, it needs places to build.</p><p>If it takes too long, they'll just build elsewhere.</p><p>I visited a business the other day that wanted to open a big factory just outside Liverpool. </p><p>But the council was going to take so long to approve the decision that they're now building that factory on the continent - and taking hundreds of jobs with them. </p><p>If we're going to be a winner in this global race we've got to beat off this suffocating bureaucracy once and for all. </p><p>And then there are those who say \"yes of course we need more housing\"...</p><p>...but \"no\" to every development - and not in my backyard.</p><p>Look - it's OK for my generation. Many of us have got on the ladder.</p><p>But you know the average age that someone buys their first home today, without any help for their parents? </p><p>33 years old. </p><p>We are the party of home ownership - we cannot let this carry on.</p><p>So yes - we're doubling the discount for buying your council house...</p><p>...we're helping first-time buyers get a 95 per cent mortgage...</p><p>...but there's something else we need to do - and that's accept we need to build more houses in Britain.</p><p>There are young people who work hard year after year but are still living at home.</p><p>They sit in their childhood bedroom, looking out of the window dreaming of a place of their own.</p><p>I want us to say to them - you are our people, we are on your side, we will help you reach your dreams. </p><p>                     WELFARE                   </p><p>If we want our people to rise so Britain can rise, we must tackle welfare.</p><p>Here's two facts for you. </p><p>Fact one.\u00a0 We spend \u00a390 billion a year on welfare for working-age people.</p><p>Not pensions. Just welfare for working age people - and that's one pound in every eight the government spends. </p><p>Fact two.\u00a0 More of our children live in households where nobody works than almost any other nation in Europe.</p><p>Let me put it simply.\u00a0 Welfare isn't working. And this is a tragedy. </p><p>Our reforms are just as profound as those of Beveridge 60 years ago.</p><p>He had his great evils to slay. Squalor. Ignorance. Want. Idleness.\u00a0 And Disease.</p><p>Here are mine.</p><p>First, unfairness.\u00a0 </p><p>What are hard-working people who travel long distances to get into work and pay their taxes meant to think when they see families - individual families - getting 40, 50, 60 thousand pounds of housing benefit to live in homes that these hard working people could never afford themselves?</p><p>It is an outrage. And we are ending it by capping housing benefit. </p><p>The second evil: injustice.</p><p>Here's the choice we give our young people today. </p><p>Choice one: Work hard. Go to college. Get a job. Live at home. Save up for a flat. And as I've just said, that can feel like forever.</p><p>Or: Don't get a job. Sign on. Don't even need to produce a CV when you do sign on. Get housing benefit. Get a flat. And then don't ever get a job or you'll lose a load of housing benefit.</p><p>We must be crazy.</p><p>So this is what we've done.</p><p>Now you have to have to sign a contract that says: you do your bit and we'll do ours.</p><p>It requires you to have a real CV and it makes clear: you have to seek work and take work - or you will lose your benefit.</p><p>And we're going to look at ending automatic access to housing benefit for people under 25 too. </p><p>If hard-working young people have to live at home while they work and save, why should it be any different for those who don't?</p><p>The next evil: bureaucracy. </p><p>Sign on. Sign here. Come back in a fortnight. Repeat as required.</p><p>What does this do for the guy who's been out of work for years, playing computer games all day, living out a fantasy because he hates real life? </p><p>For people like him we're doing something new. </p><p>The Work Programme takes the money we're going to save from getting people off the dole...</p><p>...and uses it today to get them into work, with proper training.</p><p>We're spending up to \u00a314,000 on one individual to get them into work - and already almost 700,000 people have got onto the Work Programme.</p><p>So let's be clear: in British politics today it is this party saying no-one is a write-off, no-one is hopeless...</p><p>...and with Iain Duncan Smith leading this revolution let this be the party that shows there is ability and promise in everyone. </p><p>And just one more thing on welfare.</p><p>You know our work experience programme, where we give young people the chance to work in a supermarket, a shop, an office?</p><p>Here's what one union official said about it. </p><p>I quote: \"The scheme belongs back in the nineteenth century, along with Oliver Twist and the workhouse. It is nothing short of state sponsored slavery...\"</p><p>Honestly. What an appalling, snobbish attitude to the idea of work. </p><p>We're not sending children up chimneys, we're giving them a chance. </p><p>What's cruel isn't asking something of people - it's when we ask nothing of them.</p><p>Work isn't slavery, it's poverty that is slavery...</p><p>...and again it's us, the modern compassionate Conservative party, who are the real champions of fighting poverty in Britain today.</p><p>                     EDUCATION                    </p><p>To help people to rise, to help Britain rise, there's a third - crucial - thing we must do. </p><p>Educate all our children.</p><p>And I mean really educate them, not just pump up the grades each year. </p><p>In maths, in science, in reading, we've fallen behind...</p><p>...not just behind Germany and Canada but Estonia and Australia too. </p><p>This is Britain's real school report and the verdict is clear: must try harder. </p><p>You've heard of pushy parents, sharp-elbowing their way to a better education for their kids? </p><p>Well - this is a pushy government. </p><p>My approach is very simple. </p><p>I've got two children in primary school, and I want for your children what I want for mine. </p><p>To go to schools where discipline is strict, expectations are high and no excuses are accepted for failure.</p><p>I don't want great schools to just be the preserve of those that can pay the fees, or buy the nice house in the right catchment area...</p><p>...I want those schools to be open to every child - in every neighbourhood.</p><p>And the reason I know that every child can go to a school like that is because with this Government, more and more new ones are opening.</p><p>We've heard from some of them this week...</p><p>...not just the 79 new free schools - with over a hundred more to come...</p><p>...but from some of the more than 2000 academies we've helped create - state schools given all the freedoms, and carrying all the high expectations, of private schools.</p><p>Yes - that's my plan - millions of children sent to independent schools...</p><p>...independent schools, in the state sector.</p><p>That's the genuine revolution that's now underway.</p><p>The Harris Academy in Peckham has increased the number of students getting five good GCSEs - from 12 percent when it was under local authority control to almost 90 percent now. </p><p>The transformation has been astonishing - and the methods have been Conservative.</p><p>Smart uniforms, teachers in suits.</p><p>Children taught physics, chemistry and biology not soft options.</p><p>Children set by ability - with excellence applauded, extra resources for those most in need but no excuses for slacking.</p><p>When you see a school like that succeed it prompts the question:</p><p>Why can't every school be that way? Why can't every child have those chances?</p><p>It's not because parents aren't ambitious enough - most of these schools are massively over-subscribed. </p><p>It's because the old educational establishment - the left-wing local authorities, the leaders of the teachers unions, the Labour party theorists - stood in the way.</p><p>When we saw a badly failing school in Haringey and wanted to turn it into an Academy, the Labour authority, the Labour MP and the teaching unions said no. </p><p>When inspirational teachers and parents - in Hammersmith, in Norwich, in Bristol and in Wigan - wanted to open free schools, the left-wing establishment said no.</p><p>When we proposed: More pay for good teachers...

Because millions of Australians each day use the Internet, they use social media platforms, they use digital platforms, and I want them to be safe. I know for many that it might seem that when these summits are held, people wonder why people come from so far and they gather together to talk about these issues but I can tell you that when one in five of your jobs are dependent on trade when there are complex issues that are going on with our global economy, whether there are the threats that can reach out and touch the lives of Australians through digital platforms, well, you've got to be. And I appreciate the invitation from President Macron to be here, to be able to participate and put Australia's perspective and contribution on these issues. And we have been making a contribution. </p><p>I've just come from the session that was dealing with the digital technology issues and I was so encouraged by the tremendous support that we've had, not just for when we went to Osaka with the G20 declaration, but now following that up here and also following it up with the OECD so we are actually putting some tools in place which can assist all countries and we are taking the measures, as Australian journalists will know that we're taking home, to deal with these issues.</p><p>So it has been a good opportunity over the last two days to focus on Australia's national interest and how that fits in with what is happening elsewhere in the world. These are quite unique opportunities. As an Australian Prime Minister, I always prefer to be in Australia dealing with issues on the ground domestically. But these events are necessary and have provided Australia, I think, a good opportunity. Whether it's my first formal meeting with Boris Johnson today, which was both an enjoyable and very lively affair and very useful too. Including also meeting with Prime Minister Modi on the margins of the discussions, as well as Prime Minister Trudeau where we particularly discussed the issues around both of our interests in Hong Kong. And the Prime Minister of Italy, they're going through many changes there. But there was a continuity in the relationships between our economies. I was particularly pleased with Australia's actions on establishing the National Space Agency. The Australian Space Agency in Adelaide has actually been noticed and I'm thrilled about that. And there was a keenness, both in the United Kingdom and from Italy, to engage with us so I have no doubt Premier Marshall, pardon the pun, will be over the moon when it comes to the Space Agency initiatives. And so there has been a lot of opportunity to push some business forward here for Australia and so I'm very appreciative of the opportunity we've had and happy to take any questions.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you encouraged by the apparent detente between the U.S. and China over trade?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Well I am. I am encouraged. I am pleased. But I am also mindful that we've been here before. But I'd much rather be in this situation and I'm pleased that China has responded and it's coming back and will then work with the United States. As I said yesterday, the issue is having an obvious impact on the global economy and I'm pleased to see that they're going to try and move things forward. Yesterday we saw Japan and the United States come to an agreement. I'm pleased, having spoken to Prime Minister Abe today, that that arrangement also protects Australia's interests and the arrangements we have with Japan and that's welcome news. We've been having a tremendous relationship with Japan and so I appreciate the fact that as a result of that relationship that we ensure both of their undertakings to Australia can be met at the same time, we have been able the make the undertaking to the United States.</p><p>JOURNALIST: As you say, we've been in this place before. We were in this place just 8 weeks ago. Do you think there is going to be any genuine progress this time?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Well, you can only hope so. But as President Trump often says, let's just see what happens. And I think that's the situation we are in. But I'm always hopeful that they can come to an [inaudible]. And as I said yesterday, it's the product of our economy going into a new phase globally. China has grown, and that means that the arrangements that we have in trade or whether it's emissions reduction or the global responsibility and the relationships people have, this all changes too. So this is a moment for that to re-gear and let's hope that something can be concluded in the bilateral trading relationship between the US and China.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Next year's the Summit is set to be hosted by the United States, potentially even at Donald Trump's own property. Would you be hoping to score an invite along to the G7 in 2020?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Well look, I'm not one who rushes for the plane to attend summits. That's not my style. I'd much prefer to be back working on issues domestically because we've got a lot of issues we've got to focus on domestically. While these events are necessary, my focus is always on Australia's national interest at home. We'll be in Washington next month and this has been another opportunity, I think, to reinforce the wonderful relationship we have with the United States. We have a common view on so many issues and that's because our interests are just so aligned. We are for a free world where people could get on about their lives and America have always championed that and that's why we have such a strong values connection.</p><p>JOURNALIST: From the digital transformation stuff today and encouraging tech companies to voluntarily report extremist content being taken down. Are you happy with the support you're receiving from the United States? Because it looked on post-feed like Donald Trump didn't even turn up to that session?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: No he was... I just came from that session, he was very supportive. And I appreciate all of the country's support here at the G7 for that initiative. Both Prime Minister Modi and I spoke to that matter, it's one of the reasons we were both here. And there is very strong support because look, it's a simple proposition. It actually is really simple. The rules in the digital world have to be the same as the rules in the physical world. What we expect of companies in the physical world you should expect from companies in the digital world. I mean, you don't go and let a company put a dodgy product, a kid's toy, on a shelf and let them buy it and then swallow it and choke to death do you? You don't. You have proper laws that protect people from those sorts of things. Digital companies are no different. They have to take responsibility for what they produce and the services they provide and making sure they don't harm people. And this is just a simple process of ensuring that the digital world's rules reflect the physical world's rules. Not more, not less, just the same. And it's just a product of the world responding to this changing and amazing technology. We also recognize that this technology... take in Australia's case, is enabling us to provide remote health services to some of the most disadvantaged Australians in our country. I mean, that is amazing. It's tremendous. We want all that, but at the same time companies have a responsibility, like any company does, whether you're online or you're on the high street.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Were you expecting that the US President would also be involved in this?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: I don't manage his diary.</p><p>JOURNALIST: It was on, on his diary...</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Which sessions he's able to attend and he attends, I don't provide a running commentary.</p><p>JOURNALIST: On the bilat with Boris Johnson, and Hong Kong specifically, what did you discuss? What can the world be doing? What needs to be done before this escalates further?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Well, I think the key is all of us working together to seek to de-escalate the situation and where we have opportunities just to do that we will take those opportunities. We urge protestors to be conducting themselves in a peaceful way. And we encourage those who are raising issues to be able to be heard by the Chief Executive of Hong Kong to seek to resolve those issues internally. These are internal matters and we would hope that they would be resolved that way. And so many of us who sit around the table were just sitting around have citizens, often dual citizens. That are residents in Hong Kong, I met with Prime Minister Trudeau today and we had a very good discussion. Canada has some 300,000 or thereabouts, of people who hold passports with Canada, we have around 100,000 so we have a shared interest in this, as does the United Kingdom and we have a similar number, with, even more so in Australia. So we're watching this very closely and we're swapping notes. We would like to see this issue de-escalate. But ultimately that's in the hands of those who are coordinating the protests and those who are responding.</p><p>JOURNALIST: You're never going to have 100 per cent of protesters perfectly behave obviously, would you say overall their actions have been fair enough and valid?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: I would just continue to encourage them to express their views peacefully. I would encourage those responsible at a domestic level to be responding to those in an appropriate way.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Just further on the talks with Boris Johnson on trade. Is there a recognition there's maybe some sensitivity now that the US is also saying they want to do a trade deal as soon as possible, they've got a [inaudible] first likes to be the winner, are we worried about upsetting our other most important relationship?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: I don't think these issues cross over. There's a lot to go around, and Australia I think for one will be pretty [inaudible]. What Prime Minister Johnson and I discussed today is there's the 80-20 rule pretty much applies to this. The first 80 per cent of what we'd seek to do is pretty straightforward and I think we can move forward rapidly, I mean we've been setting our own records in being able to strike agreements around the world and so we're pretty match-fit when it comes to these issues. We've been striking a lot of agreements and they're great agreements, some of the best agreements we've seen anywhere in the world. We're very pleased with them. And so we encourage them to do a deal with the United States we encourage them to do a deal with many others. Today and over the course of the last two days. I've continued to prosecute our case for the EU free trade agreement. There are some difficult issues there, the geographic indicators issue is a tough one. But we'll work through that patiently. The EU and the UK are the next two very big agreements that are there on a bilateral basis. But we've also been talking a lot about the RCEP agreement here. This is the agreement that is bringing together a lot of the Indo-Pacific nations. And which brings in some of the big economies of the region. So we think that's exciting. But if anyone is in a room talking about a better trade and freer trade. You'll find Australia in that room. And we're good at that.</p><p>JOURNALIST: On the election campaign you spoke about how well Jenny Morrison was received. How did she enjoy yesterday and how has she found this G7 experience?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Well look, it's quite a difference for us. I mean. I come from the suburbs in Sydney. And this is a long way from the Shire and, but, you know the reason why people I think respond so well to Jen, and I am you know, ridiculously and passionately biased on this topic. Is she's just a natural wonderful and friendly person and she doesn't care whether you're the first lady of the United States or you know, the lady she'd meet in the street like she did actually on election night when she went up to a lady who was sleeping rough on the streets that night on her way home. That's Jen she's amazing.</p><p>JOURNALIST: On the FTA with Britain. How quickly after Brexit do you hope to have that done? Boris Johnson said it's impossible to do it any sooner than a year with the US what's the timeframe for you for successfully-</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Well I'd like to think we could move quicker than that. But look you just got to get around the table and work it through. So I'm not going to create any arbitrary deadlines on this. I mean I would hope that we could include as I say the 80-20 rule could apply. Let's lock in what we can lock in and get that moving and I think that creates momentum for the UK now for arrangements with Australia and others to be concluded quickly. But you know at the end of the day it's going to be in our interests. We're going to sign up to something that we don't think helps us. And neither will they and that's how this should work. I mean countries come together. Whether it's at a forum like this or to sit around the trade table because they're pursuing their national interests. That's why we're here. There should be no surprise about that. And sometimes those interests don't align.</p><p>JOURNALIST: But in less than a year you're saying?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Oh I hope so.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Just quickly, on the online extremism, the plan being discussed talks about big tech companies voluntarily reporting information, did Donald Trump give you any indication that he would urge American big tech companies to take part in this scheme?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: The President did a lot of listening today. And the work we have to do is build that system. And that's what we're doing with the OECD. So you know we're not getting ahead of ourselves here. I mean Australia will take its own decisions about this. And where we want to mandate these things. We will. But these rules work best when you can try and engage as many countries as you can. I mean take what we've been able to achieve on multi-national tax avoidance. I mean we've raised billions and billions and billions of dollars. Through a process that began at the G20, worked with the OECD, countries are now sharing information on where these companies pay tax. Which means there's more tax revenue coming into Australia's coffers from big multinationals who frankly should pay their fair share of tax. And we've been able to work with the international system to get a really good result for Australia so that's why I'm optimistic about that. I've seen it work before. But what you do is you're patient about it, you work with people you get the rules right, build the relationships. But I can tell you sitting around that table, we all understand that digital platforms are amazing, but we all understand whether it's your child who gets bullied online or whether it's the most extreme and violent content. These are dangerous things that can happen in that space. And there needs to be better control and more responsibility taken. But my preference is they just do it. That actually take the initiative themselves. Should it really be necessary for the world's biggest economies to come together and actually talk about regulation... wouldn't they want their platforms and their systems to be safe? You know you talk to small business people and they make their products they're very proud of them. They put them on the shelves, they want them to improve people's lives. Now. That's what I want from the digital platforms. I want them to have that attitude and if that means they're going to spend a bit more money to make their product safe well spend it. You can spend enough money making sure that the second you look up a book on the internet and they send you an ad for about seven more. They can crack that technology really fast, so if they can crack that, I'm sure they can work this stuff out too.</p><p>JOURNALIST: One of President Macron's focuses here has been those fires in the Amazon, has Australia been asked to contribute any money and if not, are you making contingent [inaudible] in case we are?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: It's very early days on this. There are two calls totalling around 50 million globally to address that and that should be well within the means of those countries for which is their- this is their primary sphere. I mean Australia has always responded first to issues that have happened specifically in our region. Of course the Boxing Day tsunami. Things like this Australia has been quick out of the blocks. And when we're seeing these issues happening in Indonesia or elsewhere in the Pacific, we are the first responders and Australia takes our responsibility in our sphere very seriously. This is not directly in our sphere but it is the lungs of the world and we understand it's important. So we'll be looking to see as those arrangements come together and the commitments that are made, the UK have already committed $10 million to this process. And I have no doubt that once that call is worked through the G7 sitting around the table here and those who are closer to that scene. Then they will be able to more than accomplish that. In terms of the resource expertise, Australia is a very well positioned to advise on those things but our assets we will obviously need in Australia. We will be coming into an Australian summer. And our assets will need to be here domestically to deal with that. So if it's a question of resources and funds then I have no doubt that they'll, through the cooperation of international partners they'll be able to meet that.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister just call on Iran. Are you aware of any fallout following the visit by the Foreign Minister yesterday?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: I'm not, I think people are a bit over-excited on that.</p><p>JOURNALIST: What's your prediction on Brexit. Do you think Boris Johnson can actually deliver Brexit when he says he's going to go?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Well I tell you, if you sat in that room with him this morning you'd be absolutely convinced of it. You'd be pretty certain of it. I mean. I very much enjoyed our meeting let me just say that. We are going to have a great relationship. Despite his cricket sledging! Which was very modest I should say, it was modest sledging.</p><p>JOURNALIST: How far away are we from the EU FTA? Is that one a little bit further down the track?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: That one's more complex. I think but the process is started and we'll just keep [inaudible] this is how you get these things done. And it just it's a step by step by step by step. But, I detected, well not just detected, because they stated to me quite plainly, whether it was my meeting with Chancellor Merkel or the Prime Minister of Italy today. I know he's acting Prime Minister at the moment, but there is a real keenness to engage with Australia. See Australia's economy is well respected around the world our expertise is well respected. It's why we were so excited to hear that our actions on the space agency have been picked up and there was a keenness to engage. They also know about the significant procurements we're doing in defence industry and technology. They are very well aware of our expertise in cyber. And it was a good opportunity today to talk about what was happening down in South Australia as part of that centre of excellence of technology hub that they're creating down there. So I'm looking forward to getting on the phone to Steve Marshall. And I've got a few leads for him.</p><p>JOURNALIST: Have you had fun Prime Minister? I mean, you were invited here as an observer and you've really been very involved actually?</p><p>PRIME MINISTER: Well these are good opportunities for Australia, it is the first time Australia has been invited to come and participate in the G7. That's a reflection positively on Australians. And so as a result, of course, I'm going to come. It would be I think disrespectful to our, perhaps our hosts. But also Australians who I think through their own efforts have been able to put Australia's head up. And people are noticing what Australia is doing and they want us to be part of what's happening at this level. It's been a busy few days particularly after a very busy time we had in Viet Nam, so I am looking forward to getting home and focussing on issues there. Josh has given a great speech earlier today our time and he has really set out some of the big productivity challenges that are there which reflect what I set out in Perth a few weeks back. Not long after the election. Productivity I know scares a lot [inaudible] but it's just simply this. It's our plan to ensure that you earn more from what you do. That's what it's about. I think sometimes when people talk about these issues, Australians get a bit worried from past experience. That just means they want to pay me less for what I do, nope it's actually the absolute opposite. When we are addressing Australia's economic challenges it's about meaning that you can earn more from what you do, it has greater value it's able to contribute more. And you know, that is that's going to make our economy even stronger. And it means that Australia, 28 years of consecutive economic growth will continue to be a key interest for those all around the world.

In the banking sector and beyond, organizations are under increasing pressure to ensure tech-sawy customers everywhere can pay the way they want. That's spurring a rise in mobile payment projects that require rapid innovation and strong collaboration between tech firms and financial organizations. Throughout planning and execution, security risks need to be recognized.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The payment landscape has reached a global tipping point. The total value of noncash transactions overtook that of cash payments for the first time ever in 2016. The volume of digital payments is projected to grow an average of 10.9 percent annually through 2020, according to a 2017 Capgemini report-and this growth rate will be nearly twice that in emerging economies. In countries like China and India, tens of millions of people are leapfrogging traditional banks and credit cards in favor of mobile payment platforms such as Paytm, PhonePe, Alipay and WeChat Pay.</p><p>The mainstreaming of mobile payments is spurring new generations of projects. The shift goes beyond brick-and-mortar retail stores seeking compatibility with new payment platforms. Tech companies, including game developers, want to support transactions within their own user environments. As the mobile banking field grows more crowded, project teams face pressure to deliver new innovations in less time and often with more stakeholders setting demands, according to Braden More, head of partnerships and industry relations, Wells Fargo, San Francisco, California, USA.</p><p>\"As complexity increases, you see more moving parts, a greater number of integration points and more players on the field,\" he says.</p><p>The number of stakeholders is expanding because these projects often involve collaborations among app developers, tech firms and financial institutions. \"The velocity of change in this industry is enormous. Having a talented project team, a common framework, good communication and clear goals are even more important.\"</p><p>PAY TO PLAY</p><p>The pressure to make mobile payments part of virtually every consumer experience is driving new collaborations among finance, retail and tech firms. And it's pushing developers to design new ways to connect disparate systems while still protecting customer data at every touchpoint, says Mr. More. His teams have in recent years partnered with companies including Apple, Google, Samsung, Garmin and Fitbit on projects to link Wells Fargo's payment system to their respective mobile environments. \"It's about allowing customers to make payments where they want and when they want,\" Mr. More says.</p><p>Customer convenience is driving competition-and sparking new kinds of partnerships. For example, after a regulatory shift last year allowed Samsung Pay and Apple Pay to move into Europe, banks in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland rolled out plans for a joint project to build a regionalized payment system that would allow them to compete at a larger scale. In India, where digital payments are expected to balloon from US$50 billion in 2016 to US$500 billion in 2020, startups such as Paytm, PhonePe and MobiKwik are now competing with global players like Facebook-owned WhatsApp, Google Tez and Amazon Pay.</p><p>\"In this environment, being small can be a real challenge,\" says Prantik Ray, professor of finance, Xavier School of Management, Jharkhand, India. He notes that the regulatory environment in India takes a one-size-fits-all approach to banks and mobile lending services. The regulations can be costly and time-consuming, which-coupled with the cost of securing talent and technology to execute projects-can price small startups out of the market, he says. At the same time, smaller banks might be less inclined to back mobile payment projects in the increasingly commoditized environment, where little differentiates product offerings beyond cost, he says.</p><p>Some banks in India have solved this by partnering with telecommunication companies that aren't authorized to collect money but have the resources and interest to build mobile payment systems. \"It's a promising development that could help overcome some of the barriers to these projects,\" Mr. Ray says.</p><p>BREAKING BOTTLENECKS</p><p>Such partnerships can deliver real benefits-but they also create risks for project delivery, says Leonid Goriev, CEO of software development company Alty, Kiev, Ukraine. Mr. Goriev's team has worked with several global banks on mobile payment projects. Each organization has its own delivery expectations, timelines, regulatory issues and project collaboration styles.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges his team faces is getting fast feedback to keep projects moving, he says. For example, when his team was building a mobile payment solution for the National Bank of the Ukraine, the original user interface they designed showed the customer's full credit card number, but regulations required only the last four digits be displayed unless a user requests all digits appear. The design had to be changed, but the team had to wait until multiple executives on the client side had provided their input. \"They talked about it for a week before we had an answer,\" Mr. Goriev says.</p><p>Such delays can put app development projects behind schedule because clients rarely factor their own feedback cycles into the delivery timeline, he says. Mr. Goriev mitigates this risk by starting every project with a meeting between his design and development team and the client team. This early connection helps his developers build relationships with the client that can be valuable for resolving problems later on, he says. Once the project starts, his team hosts daily meetings with the client project leader to transmit knowledge and weekly meetings to discuss progress and establish next steps. \"This is the best way to resolve issues quickly. It makes my team more productive,\" Mr. Goriev says.</p><p>Even the best communication strategies can create bottlenecks, however-especially when multiple stakeholders need to weigh in on big decisions. To avoid delays, Alty teams take an agile approach, breaking scopes into sprints, each with its own plan. They then define how each sprint is linked to progress on other pieces of the project, which helps to clarify when various pieces can be completed.</p><p>For example, on the National Bank of Ukraine mobile app project, the user interface involved different \"tabs\" for deposits and financial management. The Alty team decided to treat the tabs as two separate projects so that when delays occurred on one, developers could switch to working on the other while waiting for feedback. \"It means that no one blocks anyone else's progress,\" Mr. Goriev says.</p><p>SECURITY IN THE SCRUM</p><p>Whether at a startup or a banking giant, the top-ofmind risk for mobile payment project teams is data breaches. Ensuring data security isn't just a matter of designing interfaces that protect customer data at every touchpoint. Team members also must follow strict protocols for capturing and sharing data during the project execution.</p><p>Some security practices required in these projects have become standard. These include tokenization, which uses a code to obscure credit card numbers, and encryption of personal information. \"We've been doing this for a long time,\" Mr. More says.</p><p>Creating a secure project management process can be more challenging-particularly when project teams are working across borders and companies. On Mr. Goriev's team, for example, developers are not allowed to share any screenshots of any element of a design internally or with a client via publicly accessible platforms such as Dropbox. Instead, all of the project data they capture on any device also must be encrypted and stored behind a separate firewall that can be wiped remotely if the device is stolen. \"You need to be sure you set clear rules for security on these projects,\" he says.</p><p>Such steps can minimize security risks, but developers and project leaders must remain vigilant, Mr. More says. Risks constantly change, and every new project might have new vulnerabilities. To ensure his projects meet leading-edge security requirements, he regularly meets with regulators to discuss what his teams are working on. \"We may be excited about a new solution, but we want their perspective on the safety and security behind it,\" Mr. More says.</p><p>When projects involve global payment systems or international clients, Wells Fargo often brings in a subject matter expert who understands global financial regulations, regional payment systems and local languages. Having this specialist on board helps avoid unknown risks and reduce uncertainty, he says. \"The hardest thing to factor into a welloiled team and timeline is uncertainty.\"</p><p>Following strict data safety protocols, working collaboratively with stakeholders and gathering feedback throughout execution can ensure mobile payment projects meet ease-of-use and security requirements while staying on schedule, Mr. Goriev says. If problems arise, a proactive project leader is crucial for getting the team back on track and showing the client proof of progress, he says.</p><p>\"For these kinds of projects, it is important to have a very involved project manager who both lives the project day to day and can interface with the client at a high level.\" pm</p><p>\"For these kinds of projects, it is important to have a very involved project manager who both lives the project day to day and can interface with the client at a high level.\"</p><p>-Leonid Coriev, Alty, Kiev, Ukraine</p><p>10.9% The average annual growth rate for volume of digital payments projected through 2020.</p><p>Source: Capgemini</p><p>\"As complexity increases, you see more moving parts, a greater number of integration points and more players on the field.\"</p><p>-Braden More, Wells Fargo, San Francisco, California, USA</p><p>It Pays to Innovate</p><p>From the beginning of his career at Wells Fargo 18 years ago, Braden More has carved out time and resources for his developers to follow trends, brainstorm new project ideas and teach themselves the latest payment-related technologies.</p><p>When big tech firms came to the bank to deliver payment solutions for Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay, his team was ready. For example, \"they already understood howto leverage near-field communication (NFC) technologies in a financial environment,\" says Mr. More, head of partnerships and industry relations, Wells Fargo, San Francisco, California, USA. (NFC enables devices to read and send information via radio waves.) \"They had the skills and knowledge base to execute the project quickly so we could meet customers' needs.\"</p><p>He offers these tips for how project managers can drive innovative thinking on payment projects.</p><p>1. Stay focused on customers. \"Customers rely on us to translate the intricacies and rules of our payment systems into simple, convenient solutions,\" he says. \"That's what they want from us.\"</p><p>2. Link company and customer goals. \"The team needs to understand what matters to customers, and they need a set of guiding principles from management that allow team members to quickly make decisions within a common framework.\"</p><p>3. Def\u00edne a path for problem-solving. \"With clear strategies for problem-solving, fewer items will be escalated overtime,\" Mr. More says.</p><p>4. Value quality over speed. Project leaders should build with components that are reusable to gain long-term efficiencies, rather than just pushing something into the market as fast as possible, he says. \"Building quick but brittle systems that are not durable in the long run creates a higher long-term cost of ownership.\"</p><p>\"You need to be sure you set clear rules for security on these projects.\"</p><p>-Leonid Goriev</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PMNETW-2077526384</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PMNETW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SXC-RBY1-DY0W-410K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1986\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Project Management Institute Jul 2018</copyright><publicationName>PM Network</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 10408754</issn><volume>Vol 32</volume><issueNumber>No. 7</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 1, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Peter Renton: Today on the show, I'm delighted to welcome Anju Patwardhan, she is a Managing Director at the CreditEase Fintech Fund. She has also been a Fulbright Fellow and Visiting Scholar at Stanford; she's had a very distinguished career in banking, she's worked with the World Economic Forum and much more. So I wanted to get Anju on the show, she's got a very unique perspective and the reality is that the CreditEase Fintech Fund has become one of the most prolific VC investors in the fintech space, particularly when it comes to the US and China, and they've got a unique perspective. As I said, they haven't been around that long and they've already made dozens of investments. I wanted to get Anju to talk about their investment philosophy, what they look for in fintech companies when it comes to investing. We talk about CreditEase, the company a little bit and how the money is raised for this fund, we talk about the state of fintech today and where the biggest opportunities lie. It was a fascinating interview, I hope you enjoy the show. Welcome to the podcast, Anju! Anju Patwardhan: Thank you, Peter, glad to be here. Peter: So you've had a very interesting career to date so why don't we get started by giving the listeners a little bit of background about yourself and what you've done in your career. Anju: Sure, I currently work with CreditEase, which is a fintech company from China and I'm based in the Bay Area. Prior to that, I spent most of my working life in banking; I worked with Citibank and with Standard Chartered Bank. I lived in Singapore for about 20 years and then moved to the Bay Area two and a half years ago, did a variety of roles when I was at these two banks, some years in India and then several years in roles covering Asia Pacific and also global roles. I grew up in India and studied in India as well. I did my engineering degree from Indian Institute of Technology and then I did my MBA from Indian Institute of Management. I actually joined Citibank right after my MBA as a management associate and was there for several years after that. Peter, I also want to add that I do listen to your podcast regularly and I enjoy it. Peter: Oh, thank you. Anju: I do learn about companies that were not on my radar then I find out about them through your podcast. Peter: Oh, that's good to hear. Anju: Thank you for doing this. Peter: Of course, of course, I enjoy it immensely. Okay, so then how did you get connected to CreditEase, I mean, we know CreditEase. They've been at our LendIt events for many years, but I'm curious to know how you got connected. Anju: Yeah, it was a little unusual and great in some ways. In my last job at Standard Chartered Bank, I was the Global Chief Innovation Officer, and one time I was speaking at a panel at the World Economic Forum, at the summit I was. The panel was on crowdfunding, and I was the banker on the panel and Ning who has built this great company in China, he was there as a founder and then there were two other people. It was one of those CCTV panels which was later going to be broadcast on national television in China and that was the first time that I met Ning Tang, who's the CEO, Founder and Chairman of CreditEase. We kept in touch after that and I think met again at the World Economic Forum and a couple of years later when I was in the process of leaving Standard Chartered Bank, I was about to come to Stanford and move to the Bay Area, I was on my notice period and Ning was in Singapore for some business meetings. We ended up meeting for breakfast and I realized that the company had grown significantly from when I first knew of CreditEase. It had started as a marketplace lender, but in the previous years it had also expanded into wealth management, asset management and insurance. It had started several funds and Ning asked me if I would like to join CreditEase. You know, during that one week that he was in Singapore, I think we met for breakfast three times, three really long breakfast meetings, about two to three hours each time, and by the end of the week, I had decided to join CreditEase and it's been a wonderful journey since then. Peter: Right, so you joined with the intention of setting up this VC fund? Was that how it kind of played out? Anju: Not exactly, I joined because I think the real need Ning had was all of the different things that I had done in banking. He wanted people who could help with the CreditEase business in China in different aspects. So there were no clear mandates, but it was more like join us and see how you can help the company, but he also mentioned to me that they had just started a fintech fund, they had started a VC, PE fund of funds a couple of years before that. There was a real estate fund of funds so I started getting involved in some of these things and I joined the investment committee for the fintech fund. And then over time, it became more of like where could I add value living in the US because the company's core business, as you very well know, is in China. There are over 40,000 employees in China focused on core lending, wealth and asset management business so I was the first person to be in the US and then I started spending more and more time on the investment and on the VC fund. I think the fund had been set up in March of 2016 and by the time I joined, I think two investments had already been made. Peter: Okay, so then what is the fund's mandate, who are you trying to focus on when you're investing money? Also, maybe tell us the size of the fund, because I know it's one of the largest funds in the world when it comes to fintech so can you tell us a little bit about the fund. Anju: Yeah, in terms of size, it's a billion dollar fund, half of it is in US dollars and half in RMB. The mandate of the fund is basically to invest in and partner with entrepreneurs who have a unique approach to core challenges in the financial services space. It's a fintech fund, but it's a broad definition of fintech so we invest in companies that are in lending and the related ecosystem; we also invest in wealth and financial planning companies, insurtech, payments, enterprise software solutions. We invest in companies that are in B2B, B2C, B2B2C so, you know, also Regtech so yeah, it's a broad definition of fintech. Peter: Right, okay. So then what do you look foris there something specific that will cause a startup to get on your radar, is it growth, is it a big market opportunity? What are you looking for when you're considering a company for investment? Anju: We primarily invest in growth stage companies so that's companies which are raisinggenerally raising Series B onwards. Now we have all kinds of exceptions to various things, but I would say the broad mandate is Series B onwards. Again, the broad mandate, in terms of geographic focus, is investing in the US and China and also in the UK and EU. We look for strong founding teams, we look for management teams which have an exceptional execution capability and given that it's a fintech fund, we definitely look for the management team which has deep domain expertise in both finance and technology. So that's our main focus. Peter: Okay, and so I noticed recentlyI mean, pretty much all the listeners will know Renaud Laplanche, the former CEO of Lending Club, now the CEO of Upgrade, and this was actually a company that I believe you led the recent funding round in Upgrade. So tell us what attracted you to that business. Anju: Yeah, so you know, as I mentioned, we look for exceptional founders with very strong execution capability and a strong management team and Upgrade ticks all of the boxes. Renaud is an amazing founder, he has an amazing management team, strong expertise in finance and he attracts very good people and we like the company because of the business that it focuses on and also the additional focus that they have on credit health and financial literacy in Upgrade. The company started with personal loans, it's already launched a personal line of credit and intends to go into other products as well. CreditEase, as you know, is also in marketplace lending. We started in China 12 years ago as a peer-to-peer lender and we are probably the largest marketplace lender in the world, but we operate only in China. CreditEase started at almost the same time that Lending Club and Prosper started in the US and therefore, the founders have also known each other for a very long time, have tracked their respective companies and we have a huge amount of respect for what Renaud has built. In the past, we have not been leading rounds, we generally do follow on investments partly because our fund was new. We didn't have the resources or the bandwidth to do these things and as we got more settled and well resourced in the US, we may be doing more of this. Peter: Right. Anju: So far from our fund we've made about 45 investments, we are now the second most active fintech fund globally, according to a report from CB Insights and out of those 45 investments, I would say about 25 are in the US, maybe 12 or 14 are in China, five are in the UK and then I think two in Africa and one in Singapore. So we've now realigned our resources, we have team members now in China and in the Bay Area so that we can continue to do more in these two markets and we also have a couple of people in London. So now our team distribution and composition is more aligned towards the strategy that we want to follow. Peter: Right, got it. So I'm curious, you said you spent 20 years in banking and now you're evaluating fintech investments, how has your experience in banking helped you in making good decisions for investing in fintech? Anju: Peter, that's a good question. When I first started doing this and when Ning asked me to start getting involved in this, to be very honest, I did not think that I would know how to do this. I think I kind of underestimated my own experience and knowledge, but in the last two and a half years that I've been doing it, I realized how helpful that experience has been. So when I joined Citibank in India, I was part of the initial team that launched most of the consumer lending products in India. I was there when the bank launched mortgage loans, auto loans, share financing, credit cards; we were the first credit card in the country, and also SME lending. It was like being in a very fast growing startup, right, the businesses were growing so fast that we were constantly trying to figure out, okay, now I need to set up a collections team or now I need to add more underwriters or now I need to upgrade the system or I need to outsource to external partners to be able to deliver the growth. So it's a great experience being part of that journey and then I moved to Singapore where I was then in various regional roles. I was the first Digital Banking Business Head for Asia. In those days it wasn't called digital banking, we just called it internet banking and mobile banking, right, so it was the first time that Citi was launching internet banking and mobile banking and e-statements and sms alerts in different Asian countries. It was great to be part of the team which was working on the strategyI worked on the strategy, we did the rollout and then we were involved in selecting partners and also trying out different marketing tactics in different countries to increase consumer awareness and engagement and thatyou know, while I was doing that job, I covered all of Asia, all the way from Japan to Australia and different countries in between and that was a wonderful experience in terms of looking at how financial institutions select partners, you know, so when you're working with B2B fintech companies. It was also a very good experience because we made some mistakes. In some cases, we worked with companies which were at a very early stage and then didn't exist two or three years down the line. Again, you know, that whole notion of looking for stable funding, certain level of growth, who their backers are, who are the investors; all of those became quite important. Peter: Got it. Anju: And then after that I became the Consumer Finance Credit Head for Asia and we were involved in launching these products that I mentioned earlier in different countries. Some countries we already had the products, in some countries we were rapidly growing them, and in some other countries, during the time I was there, both at Citibank and at Standard Chartered Bankyou know, I've also been in various roles during the Asian financial crisis, during the global financial crisis, during the [inaudible] crisis and saw periods of amazing growth in many countries, in some countries we also had to shut the products down. Peter: Right. Anju: And that also was an important lesson on what are the things to look out for, or what prevents you from getting to scale or how to be very mindful of the regulatory environment. So I think all of these experiences have significantly shaped our fund in the way we look at fintech companies. So when we look at B2B companies, my own experience of having been in a management team, at Standard Chartered I was part of the Global Operations and Technology Management Group and we used to partner with a lot of companies so that helps us a lot when we're looking at B2B fintech companies. When it comes to B2C companies, we are then looking for how they operate and what could potentially be their strategic advantage when they are trying to compete with large banks and financial institutions, or maybe the other way around is what are the barriers within large banks and therefore they provide opportunities for these companies to be able to compete and grow. And then our fintech funds teamthe other team members also have very rich backgrounds. Most of the team members have previously worked in private equity firms or in the M...eams in investment banking, most of them have either lived or studied in the US and then gone back to China so they're very familiar with the environment, both in the US and in China and that helps us move very fast. You know, a lot of people say, how did you guys make so many investments in two and a half years? Peter: Right. Anju: And I just say, partly because we have an amazing team with really big domain expertise. So when we meet the companies, most of the time after the first meeting, we have a good sense of whether we want to move forward or not, right, because we've all been in this for a very long period of time. And I think, being a distributed team in the US and China allows us to work at double the speed, like the team here does external meetings, we do calls, you know, we have a lot of contacts in the industry and usually after 4 p.m. we start having calls with our team in China, like 4 to 7 is typically our China/US call time. Peter: Right. Anju: And then the people here go to sleep and the team there gets to work and by the time you wake up, a lot more has already been accomplished so I think it allows us to move much, much faster. Peter: Right, right. I have met several members of your team and I've always been very impressed with the quality of people that you've attracted. So then do you feel like given thatI mean, you are unique insofar as you are a very international team. I don't think anyone was born in America in your team so do you feel like you're very different, that gives you a different perspective from other VCs who are entrenched Silicon Valley VCs that a lot of people know, but they've got a different sort of team to you guys. Do you feel like you're different because of that? Anju: I think we're different in several ways. First of all, you know, we are very unique in terms of the way we're structured. We are not a typical VC fund, we are also not a corporate VC, we are not investing balance sheet money where we have to have a strategic angle, we are not that. If I go back to the CreditEase lines of businesses, I mentioned that we have wealth management, asset management and marketplace lending. So as part of our wealth business in China, we offer robo advisory for mass affluent clients and then we have a private banking business for our high net worth and ultra high net worth clients. We have over 3,000 relationship managers, we have very high end branches for such clients and we offer several proprietary funds to our private banking clients, right, and that includes our VC/PE fund of funds, real estate fund of funds, we have a credit fund that buys whole loan portfolios, we have an [inaudible] fund, we have a fintech fund so these funds are not balance sheet money. These are the funds that we are offering to our high net worth clients and they are offered with the primary objective of generating financial returns so there is no strategic angle. I think that's one area where we are very different. The second angle there I would say we are very different is because of the entire ecosystem, right. So we have a fintech fund which makes direct equity investments because we feel like that's the only thing we know really well. We don't know biotech or pharma or other things, but we do know fintech, but then through our VC/PE fund of funds, we are limited partners in over 20 funds and very large private equity firms in the US, China and elsewhere in the world. Through that, we have access to a lot of knowledge that they share with us, or sometimes the deal flow which comes through the funds that we are LPs in. That makes a difference. Peter: Right. Anju: And then we have a credit fund, right, which can offer debt. Most VCs can't offer debt and equity, but we can offer debt through our debt fund as well. And then we have a real estate fund, fund of funds, which invests in REITs and real estate projects. So through the ecosystem, we've built a very, very strong network, both in China and in the US which helps our funds.I think the third angle where I would say we are unique, is that our US dollar fund invests in both US and China, right. We meet a lot of people, even in the US, who are looking for exposure to China, but China is one of those markets where you have to be on the ground to be able to assess opportunities and make good decisions. Peter: For sure. Anju: Yeah, so our USD fund allows our investors to get some exposure to China and also to other countries. And then the last thing I would say is that while the reason for our investment is not a strategic investment we can be very helpful to our portfolio companies if they have plans to be in China, or quite often they go to China for fundraising and we can help them in terms of introductions to other funds or to other potential LPs. If they want to do business in China, we can introduce them to partners, help them understand the regulatory or legal environment, or introduce them to people who can explain all of that. In some cases, if there is a possibility for CreditEase to be their client in China then that's great, but that's not a necessary condition. Peter: Right, right. Okay, so then if there is an entrepreneur listening to this show who's looking for funding, how easy is it and what do they have to do to get on your radar? Anju: A lot of people reach out to us directly. You know, initially like two years ago, most people did not know of CreditEase in the US, but I think now a lot of them, especially the fintech companies, know us. There's a very high chance that we may have already met them, but if not, they reach out to us either through LinkedIn or you know, we are very active at various conferences and they can find us there or they can just get an introduction to us through other VCs, other founders. Yeah, there are so many ways and then people can find out more about us on our website which is cefintechfund.com. There is also a CreditEase.com[6] website, but that's the parent company, that site, and a lot of it is in Chinese and English, but for the fund it's cefintechfund.com. Peter: I will link to that, I will link to that in the show notes so everyone can go there. It's an English language site and it's great. So, we're getting close to time here and there are a couple of things I really want to get your take on here. You've invested across fintech, obviously you know the marketplace lending space intimately well, but I'm curious to get your take onwhen you look at fintech today, where do you see the biggest opportunities? Anju: I would say that we are just about getting started in fintech, right, the whole fintech landscape. Initially, until about three years ago, 75/80% of the investments were just going into payments and lending and now we're starting to see a whole range of opportunities coming up in the B2B space, whether it's B2B payments or it's capital markets or it's trade finance, the SME ecosystem, on the wealth management side, micro savings, micro earnings. So I'm very excited about this space. I think we've just barely scratched the surface and we're going to see a lot more. In fact, last year in the US, 65% of all VC investments were in B2B fintech companies so we are going to start seeing more and more collaboration and partnership with banks. And then, I'm also very excited about what the big tech companies like Amazon and Google and Facebook are doing. That's also something that they're very mindful of. Both Google and Facebook are experimenting with P2P payments in India which I'm sure they intend to take to other countries. And as I talked about getting into insurance and other areas, I think it's very exciting, it's going to be great to see how it pans out over the next five, ten, fifteen years and I'm really looking forward to it. Peter: Right, yeah, that makes sense. We were chatting before we hit record and you were talking aboutyou were a Fulbright Fellow at Stanford focusing on fintech and financial inclusion, can you just explain some of the work you were doing there at Stanford and maybe what you're doing today at Stanford? Anju: Yeah, sure. So you know, when I was with Citi, I mentioned earlier that I was the Consumer Finance Risk Head for Asia, the Chief Credit Officer. We often had this problem that the customer segment, the near prime customer segment that we were trying to reach out tothe underwriting cost was too high and a lot of these countries did not have a bureau or those consumers didn't have a bureau score, distribution was always a challenge, CAC was high and therefore, the economics didn't make sense in several of these countries. In some cases, the bank had to scale back or exit the market because of these challenges and then when I moved to a different role, when I became the Global Chief Innovation Officer at Standard Chartered and I started meeting a lot of these companies which were doing marketplace lending or which were using technology to make better credit decisions, whether it was using data science or AI or machine learning, I got really excited about it. To me it was like, okay, here is a solution to all of those things that we could not solve for in those days, right, and especially with increasing use of smartphones, it also solves the distribution problem. With online access, you don't need physical branches to be able to reach people so my research at the time when I came.so when you apply for the Fulbright Visiting Scholar Program, you have to pick a topic and write a short paper on why that topic. So the topic I picked was the use of technology to support financial inclusion for lending and in a for profit way, right. The reason I chose that was because even in my own organizations I felt that either people were not aware of financial inclusion, or even if they were aware of it, they often thought of financial inclusion that was either done at CSR or it was done as philanthropy by foundations. Basically, the notion was you could not make money in this, right, and that's why many large financial institutions stay away from it and what I wanted to do was to somehow learn more about it and then be able to showcase to large institutions that you can do it in a scalable way using technology and you can make money. As I got more and more into my research, this program was for five months, I realized that it was indeed true. In fact, earlier this year, we published a paper, more like a report, jointly with Stanford Business School and with IFC, it's called 'Financial Inclusion in the Digital Age.' Again, in that paper we talked about the various frictions, the biggest problems that consumers face and how fintech companies can help solve for those problems and make money at the same time. We featured 100 companies that are doing this all over the world. In fact, we picked companies which are already Series B funded or more, right, VC funded because that kind of makes the point that they've got VC funding, they've gone beyond Series B, they are mission-focused, but at the same time also focused on the bottom line. We've covered companies in lending, in payments, in financial planning and also in insurance because the other misconception people often have is when it comes to financial inclusion the only thing offered is access to credit, but you know, it's just not access to credit. The problem is also inability to save or lack of access to insurance or lack of access to low cost payment options so we've tried to talk about all of those things. Also, last year, Stanford Business School, I think it was the first business school in all of the USit launched a program on fintech and I worked closely with Professor Ken Singleton as the program was being finalized in terms of what should be covered and eventually the title of the course became 'Innovating for Financial Inclusion' and Ken was wonderful in the way he structured the course. I helped a little bit in terms of getting a few guest speakers and I also taught some of the classes jointly with him and we found a huge amount of interest and passion amongst the students to take this forward so that's how I did that. I am still affiliated with Stanford, but now it's more as a Fellow at the Distinguished Careers Institute and I occasionally teach some guest classes, or you know, I'm looking for like what paper should we write next, but it's a very limited engagement but it's just great to be part of the Stanford community. Peter: Right, right. I will also link to that paper that you did with the IFC. I feel like that'sthis is something that I feel personally strongly about, you know, we really should be attacking financial inclusion in a bigger way in fintech. It's great that you are sort of leading the way here when it comes to putting that message out there. So we're out of time, but last question. Given your perspective, you do have a very unique perspective here givenyou've worked in the developing world for large banks, you're looking at a lot of startups now and you mentioned Amazon, Facebook, Google are big tech companies, but where do you think the future of fintech is going to kind ofor who's going to dominate the future of fintech? Is it going to be the banks, is it going to be the technology companies, or do you think that entrepreneurs are going to continue to create great new ideas, or is it going to be like a combination of all three? Anju: I would say that it is going to be a combination. I think it's going to be more of a symbiotic relationship between banks and fintech companies and the ultimate winner is going to be the consumer. In some areas, in some B2C areas, I think no one should underestimate the role that the big tech companies are going to play, especially when it comes to B2C payments, but you know, in a lot of other areas the banks and fintech companies will continue to have a very significant role to play. I'm a member of the steering committee on Disruptive Innovation in Financial Services with the World Economic Forum and I've been involved with the forum in some of the reports that got published. There was one on fintech, in general, there was one of digital identity, AI, blockchain. You know, when it comes to a lot of emerging technologies like using artificial intelligence and machine learning, banks are usually much slower to move forward, whereas the fintech companies are much more nimble, more agile; they're able to innovate faster. And then, sooner or later comes the time where they can either collaborate or the banks can adopt new technology so I see a strong role for both; banks with their access to low cost of funding, with regulatory knowledge, with licenses, with the capital markets infrastructure and then the fintech companies which are nimble, faster, innovative, very digitally savvy and I think the combination is what is going to help us move forward much faster. Peter: Yeah, I agree. We'll have to leave it there, Anju, I really appreciate you coming on the show today. Anju: Thank you, Peter, really enjoyed it. Thanks. Peter: See you. First, let me apologize for the sound quality of my voice during that episode. I made a mistake in inadvertently had the wrong audio source dialed into the computer here so apologize for that. I will be sure it doesn't happen again. Anyway, just wanted to follow up on some of the things that Anju was talking about there, the future of fintech. You know, I think entrepreneurs have a history of looking for gaps in the market and filling them with new and better and quicker ways of doing things and I thinkI really feel that while banks are going to be a huge part of fintech going forward for decades to come, there will always be entrepreneurs coming in and working with the banks potentially, maybe even working with the Amazons' and Googles' of the world. But there will always be entrepreneurs coming in and making the experience better for the customer, making it cheaper and making it faster. I feel like that is going to continue forever because I think humans have a tremendous ability to think outside the box and innovate. Anyway on that note, I will sign off. I very much appreciate your listening and I'll catch you next time. Bye. Today's show was sponsored by LendIt Fintech USA 2019, the world's leading event in financial services innovation.

Zor Gorelov is the CEO and Co-Founder of Kasisto[1], the leading conversational AI platform for banking. </p><p>They have implemented their software into a number of banks today where they are making a real difference, dramatically reducing the need for human customer service interactions. In this episode we cut through the hype to provide a window into what is actually working today. In this podcast you will learn: How Kasisto was born out of the work done at the Stanford Research Institute. The idea that led to the founding of Kasisto. How Kasisto is related to Apple's Siri intelligent assistant. How their digital assistant, KAI, is different to Siri or Alexa. What conversational AI is. The different tasks that KAI can do. How the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) implemented Kastisto's technology. The percentage of customer inquiries handled by KAI for Digibank, the digital arm of DBS. Why most implementations of KAI today are text based chatbots. How KAI improves itself through supervised and unsupervised learning. What kind of voice implementations are happening in banking today. The types of financial services firms Kasisto is focused on. How AI systems will democratize and personal financial services in the next five years. What they are working on today at Kasisto that is most exciting.

(music)) Today's episode is sponsored by LendIt Fintech USA 2019, the world's leading event in financial services innovation. It's going to be happening April 8th thru 9th, at Moscone West in San Francisco. We're going to be covering digital banking, blockchain, financial health and, of course, online lending, as well as other areas of fintech. There will be over 5,000 attendees, over 250 sponsors and registration is now open. Just go to lendit.com[4] to register. Peter Renton: Today on the show, I am delighted to welcome Zor Gorelov, he is the CEO and Co-Founder of Kasisto. Now Kasisto is a fascinating company, they've been around not that long, but they have developed a conversational AI platform for banking. So we talk about exactly what that is, I didn't know, and I learned a lot in this conversation actually. We talk about how it actually works in practice, we actually go through an example of a bank that has implemented Kasisto's technology into their bank and the difference it has made for them. We talk about how these products learn, what makes them just really dedicated to banking, how they're able to focus on that particular sector, we talk about the future of interaction. We obviously have voice and text and how that's playing out and what is also coming down the track shortly at Kasisto. It was a fascinating interview, hope you enjoy the show. Welcome to the podcast, Zor! Zor Gorelov: Thank you, Peter, happy to be here and thank you for having me. Peter: Okay, no problem. So I'd like to get these things started by giving the listeners a little bit of background so maybe you could tell us some of the things you've done in your career. You've had a pretty interesting career to date so why don't you share with the listeners some of the highlights. Zor: Yeah, I'm a software engineer by training and I worked in software companies, In the mid-90's or so, I decided to fulfill my life's dream and start my first software company which I did. The company was called BuzzCompany.com and at BuzzCompany we built enterprise messaging software, some Fortune 500 companies using that software and then from there, I moved on and I started a company called SpeechCycle and at SpeedCycle built a speech recognition activated virtual assistants for telcos. I started doing this way, way back, you know, Telstra, Time Warner, Cable Vision, Cash Communications were all customers. Both of these businesses were venture-funded, were successful at this and then in 2013, I started Kasisto, I was Co-Founding CEO of all these ventures. Before that, my interest was speech recognition natural language technology goes back many, many years when I worked at Bell Labs, one of the early speech recognition and natural language projects that were sponsored by Darpa and we were running the systems on super mini computers that were larger than the size of the conference room that I'm sitting in now (Peter laughs) and this technology in the past 20 to 25 years made tremendous progress and enabled us to get to where we are here and enabled companies like Kasisto creating really amazing humanlike conversations between AI systems and computers. Peter: Right, right, yeah, that's interesting. So what was the idea that led to the founding of Kasisto? Zor: So first of all, Kasisto is a spin-off from Stanford Research Institute or SRI. That's a very famous research lab that has decades of Artificial Intelligence experience. I think they started working with some of the systems in the 70's so one of the largest independent R...abs in the world. SRI also has a very efficient and well known venture licensing program and was the IT that just created SRI, gets commercialized and licensed to other companies and sometimes they create ventures. Many of your listeners probably heard of Siri, Apple Siri. Siri was created at SRI before it was sold off to Apple, and actually, the history of Kasisto goes back to Siri. There was a team of scientists at SRI that stayed on and continued to work on next generation virtual assistant system which ultimately became KAI and then, of course, we're using KAI in banking. So in a way, in the Artificial Intelligence way, Siri and KAI are related, well I can say that, Siri is KAI's older cousin, not as smart in banking, but, you know, part of the family nonetheless. To answer your question on what led me to this, well KAI has been fascinating with speech recognition and natural language at AI systems for most of my career. Like I said, I worked early on at Bell Labs and I believe that conversational user interface will continue to become more and more sort of main way users interact with computers, same way we interact with each other, same way you and I are communicating now. What led to Kasisto idea is this basic premise that as banks go through a digital transformation, the relationship between consumers and banks become very transactional, you know, people check balances, transfer for money, they look things up and they move on, and I think oftentimes there's an emotional connection that gets established between brands or banks in this case and customers, consumers is getting close. Our belief early on was that humanlike conversations was a way for banks to continue to engage with customers on digital channels and help them better understand their money, help them make better decisions about their money, all using humanlike exchanges. Peter: Okay so then what is the difference between, you know, Siri orobviously, there's Alexa and Google's got a product, I mean, there's lots of these voice assistants now so what's the difference between KAI.I mean, you said KAI is really for banking and finance so how is it similar and how is it different to these other main stream voice recognition systems? Zor: Well first of all, KAI is the conversational AI platform, banks use KAI to build virtual assistants and chatbots that interact with their customers. So think of KAI as a banking brain that banks has made their own where they can create their own conversation, they can present those conversations that are on Waze, on mobile devices, on their websites, on Alexa, on Facebook Messenger and KAI knows how to have these conversations. What makes KAI unique and different is that it is trained on banking and it knows and understands, banking, it knows, you know, debits and credits and withdrawals and deposits, it knows the current accounts, the same thing as checking accounts, it knows about FDs and CDs, it knows about account opening. You know, that's what makes KAI unique plus it comes with the infrastructure that allows banks to rapidly deploy these systems and customize and brand those systems. Peter: Right. Zor: The other thing that makes KAI unique, KAI is not a search-like experience where you go on the website, you search and you get ten responses. KAI is not a search engine, KAI is a do engine, it actually can ask a question and not only does KAI answer the question, it will help you get things done. Like for example, you can go to KAI and sayhey, I'd like to make a payment on my credit card and KAI will come back and say.okay, I see that your balance is $1,000, do you like to make a minimum payment or you'd like to pay off. You may saywell, I'd like to pay it off, but do I have enough money in my checking account, and KAI will come back and saywell, you know, you don't have enough money in your checking account, but I see that you have enough money in savings, would you like to transfer? So it enables this humanlike conversation and helps consumers get things done and ultimately it helps consumers make better financial decisions about their money. Peter: Right, right. So, you know, I can ask my bank through Alexa what my account balance is and what my credit card balance is, but, I guess, it's pretty rudimentary, What you're saying is if you've got an engine that can really do a whole bunch of different things so maybe we could start with an example. I know you've got some high profile banks that you have signed-up, why don't you just take one of those, something that's publicly available information and just tell us how they're actually implementing your technology in their bank. Zor: Of course. Before I do that, let me explain a little bit about what conversational AI is. Peter: Okay, that's probably a good idea. Zor: Yes, conversational AI is really about enabling human and humanlike conversations between humans and machines. Conversational AI is not about having voice recognition or natural language to enable some of the features that users already do in their mobile banking apps on their websites. Peter: Right. Zor: That is not that interesting, right, you know, you know how to transfer money in your mobile banking app, you don't need to go and voice-activate this feature. Some banks may choose to do that, but that's not in our stuff. Where conversational AI becomes interesting where users can start interacting with banks using their own language like for the first time, KAI allows banks to go to a microphone or give a text back for their users when their users go in and tell banks what they want. Think about the power, but, you know, what people say are thousands and thousands of different things that they want from their banks. So conversational AI is really creating that new experiences, in other words, conversational AI is about enabling users to do things that they are not able to do on their mobile apps or on banking websites which tend to be very transactional. What did I spend on Uber last week, right, can we go quickly get an answer to that question in your mobile app, right, probably you can. Not only can you really do that in your mobile app, you probably want to call your bank to ask this question so think about calling your bank and sayhey, I want to know what I spent on Uber last week, they'll probably hang up on you, right. Peter: Right. Zor: So conversational AI is really about creating that new experiences for users that they can get from their banking services. Some of these experiencesthey didn't exist before, you know, can I afford to go on vacation or should I buy a car? There are so many things that people express that are just simply not doable through any other means. Peter: Okay. Zor: So I'll give you a story from one of our customers to answer your question. DBS, Development Bank of Singapore, is one of the largest banks in Southeast Asia. The CEO of the bank decided to build their international expansion strategy around this new mobile only bank that they call Digibank and they decided to launch this bank in India first. So this is mobile only bank, no branches, no call centers. When they launched their mobile app, it had two unique features; one was a 90-second paperless account opening that was enabled through India's Aadhar Biometrics Identification System and a virtual assistant called Digiba (?) that was powered by KAI. We trained KAI to answer thousands of different questions about banking. Today, the bank has 2.5 million customers, KAI is handling 80% of all interactions between consumers and banks through Artificial Intelligence, only 20% of these sessions go to the live chat agents. That enabled the bank to run Digibank in India at 1/5 of the cost of a traditional bank. KAI, today, supports everything from customer on-boarding, how do I open an account, what documents do I need to open an account, where is the nearest biometrics identification center to customer education, which products I have, what interest rates do you charge, how do I upgrade my account to customer service, you know, I'm traveling to England, do I have to pay ATM fees when I get cash. So this is the power of KAI that allowed a major bank in Southeast Asia to launch completely new digital mobile only offering and run it at a very cost effective manner. We believe that virtual assistants for both traditional banks as well as challenger banks is becoming a must have to enable any kind of true digital transformation. Peter: Okay, so then how's it actually being implemented? You're answering 80% queries from customers, is this through virtual chat like a chatbot type thing or are there other delivery mechanisms for it? Zor: That's an excellent question that you asked. So KAI is built into a Digibank's mobile app and users go in and they all kind of interact with it. All interactions, or 99.9% of all interactions that are handled by KAI today, are handled by DBS Digibank are handled through text. Peter: Okay. Zor: Now generally speaking, voice adoption in banking is interesting. We have customers running Alexa and then the demand continues to grow, but we are not really seeing massive adoption from the consumers on our own systems of voice as a preferred modality for interactions. Majority of our interactions across all of our systems are KAI-based. Peter: Are you sort of agnostic on whether it's voice or text as far as.is it the same behind-the-scenes engine that drives this or are you really geared up for text? Zor: No, we're actually agnostic. We view voice as another modality and consumers can choose to interact this voice, text or touch from that perspective. The industry lingos calls this multi-model system. KAI is also an omni-channel system, you know, you can start interacting with KAI on Alexa and then log-in to your mobile app and continue those interactions so it supports and it knowswe channel you on and it knows how to optimize interactions for your channel. So, you know, you mentioned your bank in Alexa, I don't know who your bank is and I know how Alexa's permutation is done, but, you know, some banks continue to build syslog channels. They build something from Alexa and they go and build conversational experience for perhaps their mobile app or Facebook Messenger.you know, our vision for KAI is a brain that can interact with users and optimize those interactions independent on the channel they're on. For example, if you ask Alexa, show me my last ten transactions, you probably don't want to sit in the kitchen and, you know, hear ten cryptic names for your transactions. Peter: Right. Zor: You know, when you ask that question of KAI, KAI is smart enough to know that this question is coming from Alexa and you'll get a response that says, okay, well over the past ten transactions, you spent $582, would you like me to send the list to your mobile app and then it can initiate the transaction and you get a list of transactions on your mobile device which is much more meaningful customer experience. In addition to that, we set up the ability to handle multiple channels and optimize your experiences in wherever channel. You know, you kind of start with voice in Alexa, you can continue with text or touch on mobile device; KAI can also personalize your interactions with any of the user type or user segment. In other words, if you say, you know, I'd like to get a credit card or a life supply fuel gold card, depending on the use of KAI, if you are a high net worth individual versus millennial, you may get different behaviors from KAI. Peter: Okay, okay, that's really interesting. So I guess one of the things I'm interested in is how is KAI learning like obviously, it's conversational AI and it's extremely complex to be able to have a detailed conversation. How is it getting better? What are the things.just because it's learning from all the interactionsmaybe you can just tease out a little bit about how it is able to improve itself. Zor: So that's another good question that we often get asked. To be frank with you, there are a lot of hype around AI. You know, we hear some people talk about self-learning and it's a very popular topic, KAI uses a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning is when KAI training is done by people and unsupervised learning is where we use machine learning technologies to improve KAI over time. The process of training, actually, is shared by Kasisto, but also our customers. You know, these systems when they get deployed, it's just like hiring people in a call center, they require some monitoring, some training, some performance improvements and we give our customers tools where in real-time they can monitor behavior of KAI-powered virtual assistants and they can actually effect that behavior and train KAI. Of course, we have our own teams looking at KAI and KAI interactions in improving KAI perform this as well. I often get asked by banking executives about KAI and self-learning and I always go back to an example of a Microsoft bot called Tay. I don't know if you've heard the story, 2016, I think Microsoft launched tutor bot and it allowed the users to train Tay and then the users trained Tay and they created a bot that was sexist and racist and Microsoft was not pleased with the results and the outcome of this experiment. The banking world is very, very different, it's a highly regulated industry and banks are very, very careful about what their virtual assistants are trained on and how they interact with their users, what they say, what they shouldn't say so it's a very tightly controlled and optimized process that relies on combinations of both supervised and unsupervised learning as well. Peter: Right, right, okay, I got it. So it's interesting to me that with this explosion of this voice interaction at home and then..I was actually a bit surprised to hear you say you've got 99.9% of interactions with the one client, DBS, that's doing.it's a chatbot type text messages. Are there other examples of banks that are really moving more towards voice because it feels like voice is really becoming this sort of way we interact, but where are you at like with this journey from text or voice? Are there some banks that are doing a lot more voice than text? Zor: I think banks that are doing voice are mostly doing Alexa-based implementations with us. Peter: Okay. Zor; With that, now the issues of data privacy are obviously of consideration like when you're talking to your Alexa, your banking data is going to the Amazon cloud and banks have different perspectives on that. Some banks are more open to this, others are not as open, but I think the voice implementations are mostlybut, of course, Bank of America's virtual assistant, Erica, you've heard Bank of America launching itI think they are on the record saying that text and touch are by far two popular modalities for their interactions as well. The question is why, right, and most people on their mobile.it's one thing when you're sitting in your kitchen and you're asking Alexa about your balance, however, when you are on public transportation, subway or bus, you probably don't want to get your phone out and start talking about your finances. I think there is a social factor that needs to be considered, and of course, most consumers in public settings like that are also worried about privacy. Of course, privacy is not what you say to a banking app, the privacy is really what you hear back Peter: Right. Zor: .because you can ask your banking app what's my balance, what you don't want to happen is people in New York City on the subway to hear that you have $10,000 in your checking account. Peter: Right, that is true, Zor: But there are ways to manage that as well because the smart assistants will actually detect that users have headphones and they can play it back. However, if you are on your speaker phone, you probably just want to display it on your device and not sound it out for the users. Peter: Right, yeah. Okay, so then there's other companies pursuing AI-powered products in financial services, I mean, there's IBM Watson doing some things, Google's doing some things, do you see these companies as competitors to you or are you kind of working together with them. How do you interact with the big tech companies? Zor: Well we focus on banking and we do have competitors, obviously we see them in our accounts. Our focus is also on what our customers are asking us to do and our customers are asking us to build virtual assistants that are knowledgeable about banking, that can help users get things done in banking that are secure and are easy to manage. So that's been our focus and we're doing it in banking, KAI is trained on millions and millions of banking specific variances. You know, if you start as Google or IBM, you probably need to have enough data to make a virtual assistant smart from day one and that requires time. Peter: Right, right, for sure. So then are you working with any of the online banks and the online financial services firms that .there's lots of online lenders out there that would really benefit from a service like this. So are you focused purely on the banking sector? Zor: We are primarily focused on working with large banks, however, we are also engaged with challenger banks and some fintechs as well, you know, depending on their maturity cycle and how many customers they have and the kind of customer acquisition goals. We are definitely looking at their market and is of great interest for us. Peter: Right, right. Zor: And then when you think about our customers, right, I mentioned Digibank. Digibank effectively a part of DBS, that is it's version of online bank so we are working with both, with traditional banks and also we're engaged with online banking. In fact, I think two weeks from now, we'll be making a major announcement about KAI being implemented at one of the largest online banks in the world. Peter: Okay, okay. We are recording this in early February and it will actually be published more than two weeks from right at this moment so I will make sure to link to that in the show notes when we actually publish that so people can know what you're referring to. Zor: Yeah. Peter: Okay, so we're running out of time, but just a couple more questions I'm really interested in. Let's look out five years, how are we going to interact with our financial institutions, do you think it will still be this sort of mainly text with a little bit of voice or is there going to be a shift? Zor: Well I think consumers will choose whether they want the voice or text and I think there will be natural progression. Voice as it matures will become more secure, I think there will be more voice usage naturally, it's a major convenience of our feature, but I think it will be more interesting in five years. AI systems will help democratize and personalize financial advice. I think there is a unique opportunity for conversational assistants to capture best knowledge, best practices that exist today, the best minds in finance and deliver that advice, deliver that guidance and help consumers, help investors make better financial decisions, help them improve their financial well being. I think over the next five years, that's where the value in the conversational systems will start out. Peter: Right. Zor: And the voice and text, I think consumers will choose whatever channel is more appropriate for them. I do expect to see more voice. For me, most interesting part is really enabling these conversations to democratize and personalize financial advice and guidance. Peter: Right, right, now that makes sense. It's going to be super interesting and I feel like there's a wide open space there that is yet to be occupied by anybody for what exactly you're describing. Okay, so then last question, what are working on today? Let's sort of bring it back a little bit into the near future, what are you working on today that is most exciting at Kasisto? Zor: Well, we're doing a number of very interesting things. First of all, our rules were in the retail banking and now we have customers applying KAI, deploying KAI for business banking and corporate banking use cases. In other words, we're taking KAI and expanding its capabilities in finance in new areas, whether you're a small business or you're a CFO of a Fortune 500 company, now you can interact with KAI, not just about your personal bank account, but about the wires and tails or some other things so that's the expansion to a new area of finance is of interest for us. The other areas that we're looking at we are developing more tools and more infrastructure and more API's to make it even easier for banks to deploy, manage and improve KAI. So these are the two initiatives that we are focused on; creating the systems that are broader in their knowledge about finance, but also create systems that are enabling banks to deploy KAI more wisely and make it easier, more efficient to manage and expand KAI. Ultimately, we see KAI as the fabric, conversational fabric, that is used across all financial institutions to communicate with their various constituency using humanlike conversations powered by AI, of course. Peter: That's fascinating. You've got a really interesting company, Zor, and I appreciate your coming on the show today. Zor: Great to be here, thank you so much for having me. Peter: Okay, see you. Zor: Bye. Peter: You know, I think Zor is the third guest in the last six months that has talked about the same thing, about this intelligent assistant that has a wealth of financial knowledge that can help us navigate our financial lives. We're not there yet, but, you know, with all of the technology that Kasisto is building, all the voice-powered devices that are out there, it doesn't take much for us to see, whether it's five years or ten years, but, certainly, in the near future, we are going to have an assistant that will be virtual and it will be personalized to us and it will gather the world's knowledge of finances, specifically pertaining to your situation and allow you to make better financial decisions. I actually think this is super exciting, it's a way to really help you make better decisions and do things that are beneficial for their lives and not necessarily honing themselves because one thing that I've learned in the last few years is that it's difficult for people to really embrace what is best for them and they really need a personalized guide, I think, to help them along the way. Anyway on that note, I will sign off. I very much appreciate you listening and I'll catch you next time. Bye.

Peter Renton: Today on the show, I'm delighted to welcome back Noah Breslow, he is the CEO of OnDeck. This is actually his third appearance on the Lend Academy Podcast, he was on in 2014 and 2016. I wanted to get him back on because there's a lot that's happened in OnDeck's world. They've become profitable, they've announced they're going to apply for a bank charter, which we talk about in some depth. We also talk about their lending business and how they're growing that, how they're competing against the likes of PayPal, Square, and Amazon and we talk about transparency and the Smart Box Initiative and we talk about ODX and the bank partnerships that they have. It was a fascinating interview, I hope you enjoy the show. Welcome back to the podcast, Noah! Noah Breslow: Hey, thanks so much, Peter, great to be here today. Peter: Okay, so you have a distinct honor today. You are the very first person to appear on the Lend Academy podcast three times which, obviously, speaks to your longevity, for one thing. Before we get started, what do you think is the secret to your longevity in your job, given the fact that, obviously, many of your compatriots fintech CEOs have come and gone during your tenure. So, why do you think you've had such good longevity here? Noah: Well, first of all, that's really cool to know that, you know, I'm the first person to appear three times on the podcast. That's a great honor, thank you for having us back. The longevity thing is interesting. One of my board members, I think, summed it up recently well, she said that I guess I'm adaptable (Peter laughs) and I think when you look back over the 12 years of OnDeck, you know, we've had to adapt. When the company started back in 2006/2007, we immediately had kind of a huge economic recession, we had to adapt to that environment. Then kind of our hyper growth years, we sort of adapted into that model, raised a lot of capital, we were able to scale the business, as I'm sure we'll get into, we went public and had to sort of adapt once again to becoming a profitable financial services companies as opposed to sort of a hyper growth privately held company. Now, I think, we're starting to reap some of the benefits to that decision to get profitable. Yes, I guess, on one level I'm adaptable. Two, it's no secret, I love what I do. I mean, I love, love the folks at OnDeck and the team that we've built here loved the mission that we're on. I love working on small business lending, I think it's a really important thing to solve in the economy, and, yeah, I feel honored to have been able to serve this long and hopefully, we'll get to continue to do so in the future. Peter: Yes, yes, indeed. So, you just touched on it. For one thing, I want to get right off the butt here is next month, it's five years since you went public. It hasn't been all smooth sailing, but I just would like to get your perspective on, you knowtaking back five years, knowing what you know now, would you have done anything differently back in 2014? Noah: It's a great question. I mean, internally when I ask myself periodically.and so, you know, hindsight is always 20/20, but I go back to a couple of things. One is, you know, some advice we got from someone in the industry before we went public which is that the category leaders, doesn't matter what industry you're in, generally go public eventually. And so, we always felt that OnDeck was being built to last versus being built to sell and we had several opportunities to sell the company when we were a private company and we passed on that because we really felt and believed in the long term vision of what we were doing. So, I think if you believe you're building a company for the long term and you believe you're one of the leaders in your category, your going public is probably something that you eventually do. Of course, we've learned things in the last five years and I think chief among them are the way we position the company as we went public, so we went public with more of a technology positioning, but the at the end of the day, we're a technology-driven business that has a financial services business model. So, almost all of our income comes from lending and not just lending, but, you know, really spread lending, right, we retain the risk on our loans, we maintain a balance sheet, and so, I think, our positioning there and our valuation probably should have reflected the financial services nature of the business a bit more than it did. That was sort of really lesson one. Lesson two, I think, is just sort of the stage of where the company was when we went public. We were still loss making when we went public and as we've learned, you know, once you get the company profitable, a lot more of your value as a company can be in your current year financial metrics as opposed to some long term point in the future where an analyst model is that you'll turn profitable. And so, when you have that, it can lead to a lot of volatility in your projections and your stock price. And so, that being said, we were able to raise over $200 Million for our balance sheet, you know, at an attractive price and we haven't had to raise equity in five years, nor do we expect to in the future. In fact, we're actually buying back our stock now, given our level of profitability. So, I think, ultimately, it made the company stronger, a better-run company, more disciplined, but, certainly, I don't want to claim the last five years had been smooth sailing, they obviously haven't and there's something we can learn from that. Peter: Right, right. Speaking of profitability, one of the knocks on the fintech/lending sector is there's a lot of loss making companies out there. I know that you guys really switched focus on profitability, I know it might have been two years ago now, you're certainly ahead of the game. So, what was the driving forces that kind of put you over the edge towards profitability? Noah: Yeah, I think a couple of things. We didn't change our capital market strategy in 2016 so let's call it three years ago now. You know, we had gone from a hybrid model of selling some of our loans off balance sheet and holding a good amount of the loans as well to a model that we held all the loans and that was the first step, I think, in stabilizing the business model. We had been selling loans off balance sheet, they were gain on sale, you know, amounts that would change quarter to quarter, there was credit demand, there was a lot more volume quarter to quarter. That was sort of step one towards getting the company, I think, more stable. Step two was in 2017, which, by far, has been the hardest year we've been through in 12 years of OnDeck which was we made a decision to restructure, we laid off a percentage of our staff and really reduced our expense base and we sort of set a goal in the beginning of 2017 to get profitable by the end of the year on a true gap profitability as well, not an adjusted EBITDA or non-gap metric and we achieved that. But, it wasn't without cost, it was a painful process to go through, we learned a lot of lessons about the company, about leadership through that, but, I think, it was the right thing to do. As a lending business, ultimately, you have to be profitable, you have to be growing book value, and your equity base, you know, quarter over quarter, and I will say, it's really paying dividends now. Our cost of capital as a borrower in the capital market has come down partially because of that profitability. We made our first acquisition last year partially because that profitability allowed us to do that and I think you'll see us make more moves over the coming year when we leverage the profitability we have in the business to expanding growth. Peter: Right, right. So, I want to dig into your lending business for a little bit here. Maybe we just get started, I mean, you know, you have your term loans, you have your lines of credit, maybe you could just tell us what is the rough mix today between those two products? Noah: Yeah, so the rough mix is, I think, 78% of our books is the term loan products there, about 22% of our book is the line of credit product. Peter: And the term loan, what's the sort of average of the term loan, how long do you go out on average? Noah: On average, our term loans are, right now, hovering around 13-month of kind of a dollar weighted average, not a loan weighted average. Peter: Right. Noah: We go from three to 36 months in terms of range, but really, the majority of the OnDeck offers and what customers are looking for from us today are really between six and 24 months. That's kind of the vast majority of the portfolio. Peter: Right, right, Let's talk about underwriting, how has your underwriting changed, or has it changed much this year. You're tightening things up in preparation for maybe turning the credit cycle, where are you at with that? Noah: Yeah, you know, this is all in our earnings called recourse, but we did make some changes earlier this year. So, we pulled back a bit, bit on some kind of signals we saw in our data early in the year. I would say that we were a little bit ahead of the curb on that in the sense that the Fed at that timepeople thought the Fed was going be raising rates all year and it turns out now we've lowered rates several times this year. So, I think, we did see some signals in the economy that eventually were picked up in other places, and what we've now been doing for the last sort of four/five months is really focusing on what we call our 'offer quality initiative.' So, kind of focusing in on the top third of borrowers that we approve and basically offering them slightly better loan amounts, slightly longer terms, completely better pricing and I think on the margin, trying to increase our dollars in the portfolio from the top third of borrowers. As a result of that, you know, the average FICO score in our portfolio has never been higher. We just had a securitization price last Friday and that securitization is the first actually Triple A-rated securitization in the online small business loan market. So, you know, the rating agency picked up both from the company's profitability and we improved our quality in the portfolio and so, I think, it's a great position for us to being kind of late in the cycle. We, obviously, are cognizant of where we are, we don't know when the downturn will happen, but it definitely will and so, we think really focusing on our best borrowers is the right move right now. Peter: Of course, you could be like Australia though. We could go 20, what is it 26 years, I think, since Australia's had a recession, so you never can tell. (laughs) Noah: That is true, that is true, and I won't say.there's a lot of political pressure on the Feds to keep rates low, to keep the economy growing. So, I think the critique of what we are doing is that if, in turn, the recession doesn't happen for three more years, we'll probably a little bit under investing in growth right now, but, obviously, you know, in a lending business we are planning for the long term here and we want to make sure if a recession does happen, we're set up right. Peter: Yeah, fair enough. In the last year, or two, we've seen a real surge in some interesting competitors in the space. We've got PayPal who are doing huge volumes now in small business lending, we've got Square that are also doing a lot, Amazon's doing some. These are, obviously, big tech companies, deep pockets, and with all having some sort of proprietary access to proprietary data on the businesses that they underwrite. First, do you see these companies when you go head-to-head in the market and if so, how do you compete with those kinds of companies? Noah: I think the answer to the second part of your question, in terms of do we see them, we absolutely do. I think, you know, not just PayPal, Square, Amazon, but we have some online lenders too that are getting bigger themselves, and so I think you see a classic kind of scenario where a market is maturing. So, going from call it 40, or 50, smaller players over time will consolidate down to six to ten kind of players that have scale and all of us will have different competitive advantages. I do think the arrival of the close mood players in our marketwe call them close mood because they do have an existing merchant base and a data feed as you noted, is one of the most important development in the industry in the last couple of years. And, you know, I think a couple of things that will play out here and we still think we're well positioned to grow and win in this market, but we, obviously, have to be careful where and how we compete. So, I think, those players are generally much stronger, underwriting their own merchants and some of them don't have the capability to underwrite merchants that are not on their platform. One of the advantages of the OnDeck approach, is we can underwrite any small business, regardless of who they process their payments with. The other thing is we have a more holistic view of the business, so certainly, payment processing data is one, data source and having access to that helps. There are other ways to get access to that particular data sets, it's not that impossible to get to one. Two, what we learned over the years is that no single data source carries the day, and so, when you see a business that has a diversity of revenue streams and maybe has a more complex balance sheet, maybe needs to borrow a little bit more capital, you know, that's where OnDeck has a real edge. We can often out-lend those companies that you mentioned on sort of from a time basis, from an amount basis, from a speed basis as well clearly in the smaller end of the spectrum. So, if someone is looking to borrow $10,000 for their business.you know, I think that sector is now quite competitive so the players you mentioned, from all the online lenders, the pure play online lenders go after and to some degree, consumer lenders are going after that space as well because the small business owners are consumers as well and can maybe borrow from a player like a Lending Club, or a SoFi, so forth. So, I think, that's really it, the smaller end of the market is very competitive right now, but we still feel differentiated as the loan sizes get a bit bigger and the terms get a bit longer. Peter: Right, right, okay. So, I want to just talk about transparency. I know you're one of the founders of the Smart Box Initiative which gives comparison tools so lenders can see the different ways .how much a loan is going to cost them. So, California has passed a law to mandate more disclosure and focusing a lot on APR, so what's the impact of the California law on you guys and then are you seeing sort of traction with the Smart Box Initiative, what's going on with transparency? Noah: Yeah. So, transparency is incredibly important. You know, as online lending continues to grow, 32% of the small business owners tried an online loan in 2018, that's up from like 15% or something in 2016. So, as the industry grows and goes from kind of alternative to mainstream, the focus on consumer protection and transparency is going to be front and center. I do think we're reasonably ahead of the curb when us and the other members of the ILPA, the Innovative Lending Platform Association, rolled out the Smart Box. I think that was like two, or three years ago now, so it's been out there for a while and we were actually fairly involved in the drafting of the California bill so we worked with legislators to educate them on online lending, we showed them the Smart Box. The Smart Box is always disclosed APR and so we widely feel the Smart Box satisfied the requirements of the California bill, maybe made a couple of small adjustments, so I think that's really our strategy. I think you'll see small business loan disclosure bills cropping up in a few other states. We have our eye on a few other states, they're kind of in discussions, and our goal really is to come in to the state to educate on the economic impact, the positive economic impact of small online business lending and then offer up the Smart Box as a tool that could potentially be a.rather than inventing something from scratch, gives you a template to work off of. So, I'd say we've been pretty successful on that, so far, and you, know, in terms of Smart Box adaption, we continue to expand membership in the ILPA. We've also got the Smart Box now in slightly localized forms, adapted in Australia..speaking of Australia, so the top seven online small business lenders in Australia have now agreed to adapt the Smart Box and we're working on a similar measure up in Canada where we have a business as well. So, the hope is to make it a de facto loan disclosure for the industry and I think regulators appreciate that and no doubt, it's going to be a critical issue for the industry over the next couple of years as adaption continues to grow. Peter: Right, right, okay. So, I want to switch gears a little bit and talk about bank charters. So, you know, you announced early this year that you were going to pursue a bank charter. So, why do that and why do it now? Noah: The decision to pursue a bank charter was not one we take lightly and it was really done after several years of careful study because I think we had said even prior to the last couple of earnings call that we've been exploring different bank charter options. So, why now? I think, you know, one is reaching a level of scale where we're really a national business and sort of to give a long term regulatory structures for our industry. We think there are some advantages to being a nationally chartered bank, in terms of rate exportation would be one; in terms of consistency of laws, the application of laws across all 50 states kind of more generally than just rate too is another. And then, you know, as you mentioned earlier, we're probably late cycle, we don't know when the next cycle will turn, but the stability of bank deposits as a funding source is not lost on us. There's a long history of monoline, or you, know, very limited number of product lenders turning into banks and rather than wait for an economic cycle to happen and turning into a bank on our back foot, we thought that the company was mature enough to go on our front foot. The other part of the now, I guess, readiness of OnDeck to take on a bank charter.so, over the last couple of years, turning profitable obviously really improved the stability positioning of the company. All the compliance we've had to build out being a publicly traded company and also running our ODX business, I think, positions us well to interact with regulators, you know, in that new way. And we've also updated our management team and board of directors with a number of folks who have substantial banking experience, so Ken Brause, our CFO who joined us from CIT who joined us. CIT, you know, bought a bank while he was at CIT and has, you know, 30 years of financial industry experience. We added two executives to our Board last year as well who have that experience. So, I think, the now is partially a function of OnDeck being ready and partially a function of our scale and I think partially a function of wanting to make sure our business is stable and a reliable source of funding for our small business customers, regardless of where we are in the cycle. Peter: Right. So, do you anticipate then being like a full service bank where you've got a whole range of different products? I mean, I presume you're going to continue to maintain your small business focus, but are you looking at small business checking accounts, small business savings accounts, are you going to have a consumer element to deposit gathering? What's the OnDeck bank going to look like? Noah: Yeah. So, we've been a little bit tightlipped about this publicly until we're more ready to announce kind of the methods and plans for obtaining a bank charter. But, what I can say is that's all business focus absolutely, that's our bread and butter, it's our core customer. This is really about hearing from our customers that they don't always feel well served by existing products that are out there in the market, and small business has always been a bit of the forgotten stepchild child between large commercial customers and the large scale of consumer banking, right. And so, we think that a digitally integrated front end of that combined kind of checking, savings and lending and really timely lending options that can leverage some of the data that we're able to share with our customers and know about their business, we can be a better partner to them. So, you know, I think a little bit TBB on the consumer piece of thisI think by getting back to our strategic focus, it really is on doing the best we can for our small business customers who have been somewhat underserved. So, that's the thinking for now and certainly as we get further down the road on this, we'll talk more about what our plans are. Peter: Sure, sure. And I know you can't really share much, but can you at least share like is your timetable that you had laid out for this is.are you on track with that? Noah: We are, but, again, I can't say too much about the specifics. So, you know, suffice it to say, I think it was our 2nd quarter earnings call where we changed the public facing language around this from sort of exploring to pursuing. We felt we kind of had to do that given how far we were getting in the process and we want our investors and the community around OnDeck to not be surprised, you know, if we, in the next x number of quarters, make an announcement sort of more specific about what our plans are. So, we felt that was the right kind of pre-signaling to do and we are on track for our timetable, so we wouldn't know of that change in language if we felt like we were years away from detailing what our plans are, but we're definitely not weeks away either. That's probably measured in the order of months. Peter: Right, right, okay. It's not a quick process, we all know that. So then.. Noah: That is true, not totally in our control either as others have learned, so I think we want to be respectful to the regulators and everyone else involved. Peter: Right, right. Hopefully, it will go quicker than what Varo Money has experienced which is certainly a multi-year process, but.anyway, let's talk about ODX for a second. Obviously, you made a big splashI still maintain it was the biggest partnership in the history of fintech when you announced you were going to be Chase's partner for online small business loans, maybe we can start off with that. So, when you signed, I think it was 2015, four years ago right around now from memory, when you announced that deal, did you expect it was going to last for five/ten years? Did you feel like four years, or thereabouts was about right, I mean, what did you think back then? Noah: Yeah, I think both back then and until relatively recently like as much as, you know, seven or eight months ago, we really thought it was a long term partnership, kind of been that five to ten-year time frame, we always knew that partnering with Chase.they are, you know, the biggest bank, they have the largest IT budget, and if anyone was going to try to build a solution themselves over time, it was probably them. But, you know, I got asked the question similar to this a couple of weeks ago and someone said, did you feel used by the whole experience (both laugh).. No, not at all. Even though I'm aware that's happening, I would do it again, and the reasoning why is it actually knew there's a better company not only for the ODX business, but in terms of even how we operate the company. Chase had a very high standard for compliance and data security and business continuity and how they thought about their customers, and we built a successful program and I think we're very proud of that. If you look at the loss rate, the volumes we achieved, we can't discuss these things publicly, but, you know, Chase also said in their public remarks that OnDeck was a fantastic partner to work with and so we're proud of what we did. I think we moved the ball forward in online small business lending, as you said, as a result of that partnership. What happened, simply put, was there was a change in leadership at Chase, you know, earlier this year and kind of with that is a strategic review and I think Chase was at a point where they were either going to have to invest a lot of money over the next three to five years kind of deepening the relationship with OnDeck, extending it to more products. That was not a small investment on their side to make, and it felt like well, we're Chase and a point of arrival for this even if it's three to five years down the road, probably is eventually bringing it on to our system. So, we learned from that and I think Chase is one of the few banks in the country, I think, that can make that trade, just given the size of their technology investment and what we learned. You know, we've announced several other banks, PNC, we have recently announced Investors Bank, we have some other banks who expect to sign between now and the end of the year, we may not announce them till next year, but what we're learning is that not every bank is prepared to make that investment and many of the smaller banks may never be able to make that investment on their own and partnership really is the right strategy for them. Peter: Right, do you think you need to be a top ten, top 25 bank to be able to really get something that is as good as an experience as an OnDeck customer gets with all of the effort that goes into that on many fronts, not just tech, it's marketing and all kind of things. So, do you feel like.what size bank do you think you realistically can pull that off? Noah: Yeah. So, I would say I don't think it's limited to the top ten, or 25, I mean, there's kind of a sweet spot where you're big enough to have a customer base and a sophistication level that would allow you.as you said, it's not just implementing the technology, it's absolutely about your credit modeling and your marketing strategy and how you approach your borrowers, but also..you know, what we did learn, with the Investors Bank deal, in particular, is working with five of these smaller banks can go faster. Peter: Right. Noah: There are fewer committees to go through and fewer hoops to jump through to get approval for different projects and the integration can be smoother and so, we haven't talked publicly about our timeline with Investors Bank, but suffice it to say..but, I did say on our prior earnings call is that the fail cycle was faster there than we experienced at the larger banks and the time to implement will be dramatically, I think, smaller as well. That's what we're learning, you know, so, top ten, top 25 banks still is a little restrictive, you know, top 100, top 200 banks feels like the sweeter spot maybe, overall, but you're absolutely right, a very, very small community bank, we haven't yet modularized the OnDeck technology and also there's a business case issue. How much are you actually going to be able to invest at that size of an institution to make the business case close. So, expanding our universe though from the top ten to the top 100, or 200 will keep us busy for a few years (Peter laughs) and we'll start with that. Peter: Right, right, yes, no doubt, no doubt. So, obviously with ChaseI mean, the fact that you had that relationship must make always others.I mean, even the fact that Chase is going away, you pulled it off without any major hiccups, at least externally (laughs). We don't hear anything, so, I imagine, that's a ..I mean, if you've done it with Chase people will say, well, they can certainly have the capability of doing it with anybody. How much did that really.the Chase kind of partnership drive the rest of these discussions? Noah: Yeah, I think, it was a big deal, you know, it's sort of.one person referred to it as the good housekeeping seal of approval and I think that absolutely has had an effect on building the ODX business up and it' still an asset today, even though Chase is no longer going to be working with us, we're still working through a wind down period on the portfolio. But, we also are very happy that our pipeline didn't stop there when we made the announcement because that was obviously a source of concern, you know, what will happen to the banks that are exploring an ODX solution because it is a longer sales cycle and everyone, you know, stood firm and that was good to see as well. So, I think, that's right, we did get a capability uplift from implementing the program with Chase and I think it is still serving us well, you know, going forward. Peter: Right, right. Okay, we're running out of time, but before I let you go.you know, you have a great window into the health of small businesses, even sector by sector, I'm curious to see, you know, you hear about..listened to NPR the other day talking about CEO confidence levels are lower than they were a year ago, so I'm curious about what you're seeing as far as the small business community are. Are you seeing any hints, any pockets of slowdown, or do you feel like people are still confident, still taking out loans to buy new equipment, to expand their business, I mean, what's it like out there? Noah: Yeah, that's a great question and we have a lot of data coming in to inform our perspective on this and so we said.you know, previously, about 2019, earlier this year, we did see a little bit of weakness in transportation and manufacturing and I think a lot of that was related to some of the trade uncertainty that we've had, right, fewer imports at our ports lead to fewer goods shipped across the country and, you know, it really hit in the transportation space, some of the owner operators out there. You know, the spot rates went down, manufacturing volumes declined a little bit as well and so that is.you know, they were exporting as well and those exports were being impacted by terrorists could be a challenge, so we did see some of that earlier in the year. You know, currently, I would say we are not sort of publicly talking about anything dramatic, we think the American consumer is still strong, but I think there's a lot of data sources that backed that up. But, to your point, the business climate and the business outlook is a little bit more conservative than it was last year. So, if you look at sort of the small business optimism index that, I think, it's run out of the University of Michigan, you've got the CEO temperature gauge that you just mentioned, I think, you know, businesses are still optimistic about the future, but maybe a little bit less so than they were a year ago and that's probably influencing demand for loans a little bit so, I think, that's our read on it right now. Just a little bit more caution, especially as we head into an election year in the US, obviously, a really different set of options in front of the American populace, in terms of voting. So, I think, you're going to see some uncertainty lead up to the election and we actually saw that a little bit even in Australia where there was an election not too long ago and there was a little bit of a slowdown in business investment right up to that election because people don't know who's going to win and what their policies are going to be. Peter: Right, right, got it. So, final question then, looking through into the future, what's the long game for OnDeck? If we get back together, Noah, in three years time, what do you hope you will have achieved? Noah: Yeah, it's a great question. So, I do think as we talked about earlier, this OnDeck bank idea is pretty exciting and I do think it will take a couple of years to get there because as you noted there's a number of applications going through the process now. It takes a while, but we, again, are in it for the long haul and so the idea of OnDeck's bank being the digital bank for small business is very exciting. We think we can spend the next five, or ten years really working on that vision, building it out and just creating a killer set of tools for our customers to manage their cash flow and when they have extra cash we can probably pay a more competitive rate than they're getting today from their current bank, and when they're in need of cash flow for the day-to-day expenses, we'll have products for that, and then when they're in need of cash, you know, for investments, we have term loan products today that deals with that. We could also offer potentially SBA products over time, or secured lending products like equipment finance, or asset-backed lending over time as well. And so, my hope is three years from now, we have a wider, you know, maybe a much wider variety of products to serve our customers with. Hopefully, we figured out how to navigate the overall bank charter process, and we've started to succeed in re-positioning ourselves in the market like, hey, you knew us as a leader in online lending, but now really know as more as a digital bank for small business and that would be a lot to get done in three years, but we'd be pretty excited if we did. Peter: Okay, well good luck with that. I know it's not going to be easy, but anyway, I really appreciate your coming on the show today, Noah. Noah: Thanks so much, Peter, always a pleasure. Peter: Okay, see you. The lines continue to blur in fintech between lending, digital banking and savings and all these different silos of products are really..the fintech companies are now becoming diversified financial institutions and, you know, this is going to be a long process as Noah mentioned. Getting a bank license is not a trivial process, but looking down the track you can see that consumers and small businesses are really going to be well served, better served than they've ever been with these options of digitally native companies that are now well established in their sector and offering a full suite of banking services. It's a really exciting time, I think, to be involved in finance. Anyway on that note, I will sign off. I very much appreciate you listening and I'll catch you next time. Bye.

Peter Renton: Today on the show, we have a special guest, someone who I would even say has become a bit of a legend in the fintech space. I'm delighted to welcome Steve McLaughlin, he is the Founder and CEO of FTPartners. Now, FTPartners is a boutique investment bank focused exclusively on the fintech space and it's been around since 2002, so Steve was really thinking about fintech before any of us, pretty much. I wanted to get Steve on the show, obviously, they're in many of the big deals that happened in fintech facilitated by FTPartners so he's got an incredible perspective on the industry. I want to talk about that, talk about the trends that he's seeing, we talk about the research reports that come out on a regular basis from FTPartners. We talk about valuation and the sort of the different ways that the private markets and public markets look at that; we talk about SoftBank, we talk about M...nd much more. It was a fascinating interview, I hope you enjoy the show. Welcome to the podcast, Steve! Steve McLaughlin: Thanks for having me on, Peter. Looking forward to it. Peter: My pleasure. Okay, so I would like to get this thing started is by giving the listeners some background. I know you've been doing FTPartners for many, many years, but just take us back to what you did before you started that and what you've done in your career to date. Steve: Sure, I started at Goldman Sachs initially as a Summer Associate in 1994 then started full time in 1995 in New York City in Goldman's Financial Institutions Group. This was, I guess, back when it was pre-public so a private company run by 118 partners at that time, but I got put into the Financial Services Group and that was 1995, during the pretty big boom in M...nd capital raising for our bank's insurance company as brokers, asset managers. It was pretty much the busiest shop on the planet for all that kind of stuff, but as you can imagine, given it was 1995, we also saw the beginnings of everything around the Internet creeping into financial services. So there was anything you could think of, dot com and financial services, mortgage.com, buying.com, insurance.com and bank.com, and banknet, you name it. That was kind of the company is in, so that's what I started to focus on. It was an area of the world that mostly undiscovered because most of the companies had no.very low revenues back in the day, but that was back when we started seeing these first signs of Charles Schwab going online and saturating E-Trade and Meritrade and so on and so forth and all those stock exchanges getting electronified and digitized. And so, I was in the middle of all that and was really one of the only people at Goldman buying loan on the street, focused on that area of fintech and that became 100% of what I was doing. I was either buying, or co-writing the fintech group toward the end of my tenure there before leaving in 2002 to start FTPartners. Peter: Okay. So, then what was it.I mean, you were really ahead of your time in many ways because fintech wasn't even a term back then, obviously, there was financial technology, but why decide back then..what was the thinking behind starting your own firm back in 2002? This was, obviously, coming out of a recession, why do it then? Steve: Sure, I saw just a huge, huge opportunity in fintech. Like you said, it wasn't called fintech back then, we called it financial technology which is the name of the company, Financial Technology Partners, so from 2002 that's been a monicker, but I just saw a tremendous amount of inefficiency in the system. Even today, the opportunity is way larger than what we're seeing, you know, in the market and people think it's large today. So, you know, back then it was pretty clear to me, but it was also clear to me there weren't any investment bankers that were that focused on it. Most were independents with key focus on the space and so, I thought that was a great combination of picking a great space that nobody was covering. The space is actually quite hard to cover because it covers a lot of different disciplines from, like I said, all the different pillars of financial services and all the different technology types, so it's quite complicated. You also got the big names, people coming out from a lot of different directions, in short, a tech company might have an insurance banker coming at it, you might have an IT services bank, you might an Internet banker, and on the research side, you know, there's sort of a fight for the clients wanting to be covered from more of the tech side, but some of the companies can be pushed over into the financial services research coverage. So, there is a lot of their internal difficulty in terms of people organizing. You still see it today, a lot of the big banks don't really have a cohesive fintech group around the world and there actually isn't a single investment bank that even have a single fintech group around the world. They're fairly fragmented where people in Brazil aren't talking to people in New York and not talking to people in London and certainly people in the tech group aren't talking to people in the FIG groups of these firms, so it just creates a lot of, you know, disjointedness in the client coverage and the knowledge base. So, I just saw a huge opportunity and really felt that for 18 years it still is not that large back then. So, we're about 160 people today focused 100% on fintech. That compares to just a few people focused on the stage of any other given bank, including the big guys, so it's an all out effort here. Peter: Right, I know you have a global focus these days, so where are your offices located? Steve: Yeah, we have our headquarters in San Francisco, then about five or seven years ago, we opened our New York office, and then we had a London office open up a couple of years ago so we're spread in New York and London. San Francisco is probably 80 people today, New York probably 50 and London 30 up from zero a couple of years ago. And then we're covering, like you said, the world, we have billion dollar deals and startups on really all kinds, other than Antarctica (Peter laughs).yeah, seriously, we haven't gone into Antarctica fintech yet, but we just announced a fairly large investment from a VC company called Interswitch which is one of the most viable companies in Africa now. We're working on a digital bank project in Southeast Asia, we're starting a significant payments company in Australia in a couple of billion dollar range, and so, really.we've worked on the Interstone IPO last year in Brazil, so really you think you pick your continent where they're doing things, so it's exciting times, fintech knows no bounds, I guess. Peter: Right, right. One thing that I've always appreciated, unlike many others as well, is your research report. You do this quarterly fintech research reports, you do have other industry reports and I just saw in my inbox this morning African Fintech Report. These are not just five to ten-page reports, these are hundred plus pages long. So, maybe you could talk a little bit about what goes into these and why kind of..this is all for free, obviously, why go out and provide all these great intel? Steve: Sure. Well, I think, like you said, it goes back to about 160 people focused on the space and there's a significant number of these people that are in our research and business development group which is the core of the company where all the knowledge, you know, kind of pervades from, if you will. So, a lot of it is.you know, we're doing an enormous amount of independent proprietary research for ourselves, what's going on in Africa fintech, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of companies which were growing fast and was getting funding, what segment, you know, what's going on in other emerging markets. So, we're doing a lot of it for ourselves and we're taking a sliver of that to sort ofkind of polishing it out to the marketplace. So, there's a lot more behind the scenes of what we're publishing and so it's a little bit of a teaser to, you know, what do we know. It's also a little bit of a public service because it's become quite popular and we've got millions of readers of our research, and we have only published something. we can see it light up on the screen as it gets opened up and with that forwarded around all over the world. So, part of it is we just become part of the ecosystem of what's going on and sort of, you know, central source of knowledge in defining how the space is structured and who's doing what around the world. There's really nobody else out there that's doing this the way we're doing it. There are people that are trying to collect the data, or trying to create a three-page newsletter once a month, but in terms of the volume and number of people that we have dedicated to this.so, surely, I've heard of, but it's actually a lot of fun. We get invited to speak to a lot of incredible board of directors and conferences and special think tank type groups, so we've got a great team that's focused 24/7 on that, so it's pretty exciting. Peter: Okay, so let's talk about some of the actual trends that we're seeing today. I was looking through your last research report and you isolate several things, but one thing that.maybe get your take on right off the bat and that isa lot of people talking about this lately with the big tech entering fintech. Obviously, we've got Google, Apple, Facebook, they've all been in the news in the last month or two doing new fintech initiatives. What do you expect to see from big tech going forward? Steve: Sure. I think you're going to see more and more convergence between sort of payments and financial technology and big tech. You saw PayPal make the acquisition of Honey the other day in the e-commerce space. You saw Google making the announcement of getting into checking additional banking; we've all seen Apple get into the space with Apple Pay and, of course, the Apple credit card. So, I think you're going to see more and more of that. You've also seen Amazon get involved with lending to its SMB's and they're all of them behind in the payments space, but catching up. And then, of course, you know, people like Grab in Southeast Asia and Uber here in the US getting more and more into financial services and I think what you're seeing is more of a trend towards financial services in fintech, if you will, kind of pervading every single type of business. So, the money flow is really what keeps businesses going, whether you're spending money, making a payment, saving money, optimizing an expense, you name it, it is a part of it's just a big, big part of each and every business and all the that flows between customers. So, you'll see more and more people get involved in it. I mean, I think there's an opportunity more for the big, you know, if you will, e-commerce players to get in and disrupt the banks. I do think that's possible. Would you rather have a checking account with Amazon, or Wells Fargo, I think that's debatable. Wells Fargo is certainly a very highly regulated bank, but it's got its customer service issues whereas Amazon is charged with customer satisfaction. Well, I think, what a lot of what this is coming down to is data. He who has the most data on the consumer can probably be helping the consumer manage their finances better than others, so I think long term, it's going to be a data play. Peter: Right, right, got it. So then, I think that points to another.obviously, many companies that you've worked with directly that have a big role to play here, companies like Marqeta that have really created a whole new kind of way of managing the payments infrastructure, you've got other companies like BlueVine on the small business side, I'm curious about the fact that there's becoming this plug and play type aspect of fintech, it feels like, and I know that Matt Harris from Bain had a piece out recently talking about this, do you think that we're going to see beyond just the big tech, but lots of the big brands come and have their own sort of fintech offering in the future? Steve: You know, I think, like I said earlier and the report that you're referring to Matt Harris put out there, huge Matt Harris fan, by the way, but in any event, yes, I think fintech is becoming a bit of the platform, right. There's a view that there was the Internet, there was mobile, there's the cloud and now, there's sort of fintech, right, and so fintech being sort of the fourth, if you will, horizon of platforms in tech. I do think there's a possibility that it could put that.the world thinks about it that way and we're seeing it embedded in all walks of life, you know, you look at what people like what Expensify is doing, or doing, what millions and millions of usersyou know, using their expense account for now. I just read there launching a car platform and I'm sure we'll eventually do payroll and billing and everything else. So, I think there's this concept of getting in and lending which particular enterprise, or SMB and then being able to offer them more myriad of services around financial services, or financial transaction processing. The other thing you're seeing a bit more of and Expensify is probably not a bad example, are companies that are able to sort of extremely uniquely penetrate both the business ecosystem and the consumer ecosystem. That's where we're seeing some really, really breakout players like you pick Square, for example, they're doing not only 25/30 million SMBs, but also going after and already have, call it 20 million consumers using their apps. So, at the end of the day, they can bring those two constituencies together and kind of create a super business model around financial services. You see the same thing with Facebook where their consumers are going to do their businesses and basically creating this like cohesive ecosystem and I think financial services will help bring them glue together on that as well. Peter: Right, okay. You haven't really talked much about digital banks yet. That feels to me like it's the hot sector globally, it feels like right now, where there's lots of mega rounds happening, there's a lot of customer acquisition happening, rapid growth..when I look at it, I think back to the lending days. The time when we first met in person was at LendIt 2015 in New York and that was sort of a conference where there was peak enthusiasm for the lending space and now it feels like peak enthusiasm for the digital banking space, but maybe what's your perspective? I mean, a lot of these companies aren't making money yet, what do you see playing out in the digital banking space? Steve: Sure. I think, you know, we like the online lending space too, but I always thought that the online lending space had issues, given the very nature of it being you're lending money out, you hope you'll get that money back. It tends to be a while of transaction where a few years later when the loan is paid off, the person's going to shop around and get the cheapest loan from somebody else and people have not really, I think, done a great job in the online lending space, sort of providing a loan to someone to getting a broader customer relationship. I think there was some attempt to do that, but it largely failed. So, on came the digital banks with the idea of, you know, if we can control your checking account, we can have an interaction with you every single day of the week with your spending card to debit or credit card and we can sort of collect all sorts of data and information and gets back to us the same before about the information game and data game. Once we start doing that, we're on your checking account we can see when your paycheck is coming in and what your monthly and daily expenses are, what your rent looks like. If you lose your job, or you get a promotion, we can see that too from a digital bank. And so, I think the idea is, you know, anchoring the client with a digital banking product and a checking product and a direct deposit product is a great banker, all of us would agree, it's fairly rare if you do change your core checking account. With that being said, the hardest part to get..I think, the idea is once you have that core checking account, you pull in all that data, it's not so far at that point to start offering savings products, or the lending products, or expense management products, or financial advice products. So, I think that's where there's a bit of a battleground, there is a branding battleground as well, and what the banks have anything thought of in terms of customer service, in terms of product offerings, and chances of digital offerings, it leaves a huge gap for some of the digital banks to come in and make hay. I think one of the things we're seeing is very few of these have sort of gone cross border. Revolut is a rare example of someone who has raised a significant amount of money and sort of, I would say, going for it, and a lot of these guys are talking about building a trillion dollar digital banking platform which is really exciting. We wish them all the luck in doing that, but, you know, you see a lot of other players that are more country specific and are focused on building. call it a $20 Billion/$50 Billion/$100 Billion businesses in single geographies. You know what, in the US it comes like Chime and Varo Money has a lot of money and one of my favorites being MoneyLion is sort of helping every man, or the working American. I think there's a big dearth of financial products out there for the working American, or the working European, or what have you. Some of these are really, really helping consumers think about saving and spending and retirement, things like that. Digital banking is sort of moniker people use, but it's more digital financial services, if you will, so it's the better way to think about it. Peter: Yeah, for sure. And, you know, along with that.I mean, obviously, the valuations aresome of these companies are attracting really pretty high valuations. I know you've got Nubank in Brazil that are, I think, $10 Billion, and you've got many others. At the same time, you've gotI mean, in the public markets a lot of these IPOs are struggling, Square is an exception, there are a couple of other exceptions, but when you're sort of talking with these private companies and they're getting these massive valuations, you also go and have taken several companies through IPO, do you see the factwhat do you tell people who are looking to go public as far as valuation goes? Do you think that this valuation feels like this bifurcation where you've got two completely separate realities, I mean, how do you see that sort of correcting itself, how do see it playing out? Steve: Well, I think, you know, you have to think what's going on in the public versus private markets. The private markets, first and foremost, most securities that are being sold are convertible preferred, so the downside protected, there's sort of unlimited upside potential and, you know, the trade up there is not just that .there's no liquidity in that, you know, theoretically less liquidity in public markets so, common stock with no downside protection. You think about the other distinction of private markets, you see all these rounds, it's typically what the top one or two people in the world are willing to pay after having done a significant amount of due diligence and under pressure whereas in the public market you're really only left with a 10K and some 10Qs and some research reports, limited amount of diligence you can do. You know, it's sort of the equilibrium of everyone who thinks it's a buy and everyone who thinks it's a sell as opposed to whoever is the best company in the world and with the highest price and that's typically not the valuation for the public market. So, I think, one of the realities of all these private companies when they go to the public market is like it's not about what you think one person would pay, you have to think of it as the entire universe to pay. That universe consists of a lot of skeptical research analysts whose careers are on the line and we're going to be, you know, potentially more skeptical than someone who is highly optimistic and has a highly diversified portfolio and has downside protection. So, I just think there's a huge difference between public and private markets and I think the public markets are serving as the ultimate reconciler of valuation to some extent, but .and we've also found public markets to be quite wrong about a lot of companies. You look at some of these companies, they're a bit, you know, out of favor like Lending Club or what have you, I mean, what Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook all had moments when their stocks were down and dropped, you know, no one cared about them and continued innovating and then later on in life became massive companies. So, I think, you can't really count any of these companies out, but it's what makes the world go round, supply and demand. I think you're not seeing a lot of retail investors piling into these private deals, these are smart incredibly well diligencing companies that are making these big bets, they're comfortable doing so. There will be winners, there will be losers and I don't think anyone should be surprised. Occasionally someone wants to invest in a company, $3 Billion valuation might go public at $2 Billion, that's just life and that's just what's going to happen once in a while, that's why it's called venture capital, so to speak. So, some of those are going to go from $2 Billion to $20 Billion. Look at Square, came out of the gate, everyone follows, overvalued and stock suffered in the IPO moment in time and you could have bought it for .anyone of us could have bought it for $9 a share and sold it for $100 and that was there for the taking for everyone in the space. So, you know, public markets could be a really good thing. Peter: So, when you're working with these CEOs do you encourage them to try and maximize the valuation, or is it just a case by case basis? Obviously, it has some downside if they are planning to go out in the public markets. Steve: I'd say when we talk to clients, we let them sort of think about what's important to them. We're usually encouraging them to think about the quality of an investor, leaving money on the table in order to make sure you're not overpricing your round. At the end of the day, the market's the market and we are getting some big valuations, but you really don't like it if I was too far ahead of yourself because it could become difficult to raise future capital. But, yes, it's all about what the client is willing to optimize and in a lot of these situations there is optimized valuation, but also we might not be in the same breath. Let's say I want an investor that can support me through the IPO, I want an investor that could be good at the board room, I want an investor that's going to be supportive of things when things aren't perfect because they never are and that's generally where they lean, is let's go find the right fit of investors and valuation is one that takes a bit of a secondary back seat. Peter: Right, right. So, I'd like to get your perspective on SoftBank because I just saw this morning there's a new deal that they've invested in India and Paytm, I'm curious about what impact do you think..you're talking with SoftBank at our LatAm Conference which will be in the past by the time this is actually published, but I'm curious about what your take is on their impact on fintech. Steve: Sure. I think SoftBank is, you know, still a force to be reckoned with despite some of the tricky stuff they had to deal with in terms of the WeWork situation and Uber and others, but at the end of the day, they're a very, very large venture capital player taking very, very big risks, they are swinging for the fences and it is a portfolio so we can also look at mistakes that they've made. They have made mistakes, certainly made those mistakes and they've publicized those mistakes, but, I think, at the end of the day, they have a chance to move some really big deals and take some big swings and they're trying to do that all around the world. So, you know, I sort of commend them for their efforts in doing it, but, I think they've also missed a lot of great opportunities and if they tend to chase momentum there's a lot of really good hidden things out there that they could be looking at. But, you know, it is the Vision Fund and so when you do talk to them, and we have a kind of respect for all the guys and gals that we talk to there, look, it's something that's really, really game changing, but they don't spend much time on it. Like I said, I commend them for that, but in terms of fintech, they're in SoFi, Kabbage, one of our clients, and, you know, they've done a lot of great deals in the space as well, but I don't think they're having an overall impact on fintech, to be honest with you. There are in a couple of deals here and there, but have they changed the game, have they king made anybody which is a word we hear from time to time and we really haven't met and seen that. Paytm is doing quite well with a huge universal investors including Ant and others. I don't think there's any magic thing put in there. And then there's plenty of competitors coming up on their heels in India as well. So, those things have a great place in this world and like anybody else, they're going to take their lumps and venture capital gamers swing it to the fences and probably need to slow down, select their loans and figure out where to go from here. Peter: Right, right. Anyway, we're running out of time, but a couple of things I really want to get to. I want to talk about M...ecause it seems surprising to me and I'd like to see if you're surprised, the fact that traditional banks have not been very active in fintech M...Where do you think future M...ctivities is going to come from? Steve: Sure. I think the banks have been slow on M...but, I think, I see some signs or light there. I think the thing that has been most eye-opening to us is we actually worked on what is called Assurance IQ. We sold it to Prudential for $3.5 Billion, you know, Prudential being a 144-year old company buying a company that has only been around for three and a half years for $3.5 Billion. You know, it's actually pretty impressive that they had the foresight to do that. I think when Prudential looks at its business and sees the changes out there in AI and automation and online applications and what that means globally for insurance, I think they have the guts to go out and swing and actually take a chance on buying a very brave, well-heeled, smart acquisition with Assurance. It's something that was probably the boldest move I've seen any financial services company make in the last 20 years. If you do the research, which we have, you just haven't seen anything like that in 20 years. You look at another deal we did, Allstate buying a company called SquareTrade. They saw the world of autonomous cars and saw that millennials were not buying automobiles as much, living at home longer and not buying home insurance. You know, this is to really get closer to the millennial universe and buy an electronics warranty company which Square Trade was. That was $1 Billion that time and it just worked out incredibly well for those guys. That was the thing, going back to the Prudential deal, I think that comes with Prudential acquiring a company for $3.5 Billion, but I think the market realized that this was a smart move. The stock went up 5/10% and even greater to buy the company over the next couple of weeks and it's been seen as a huge success. I think that transaction has hit a lot of CEOs' radar screens, hey, it's not just for the PayPals and the Amazons that can go up to $3/4 Billion deals and have the stocks go up. We can do it too if we're smart about it. I think (inaudible) CEO doing these deals, in part that was $1 Billion plus earn out for the management team There's a recognition there that you can't just sort of buy these companies and expect everyone to stick around, you have to think really hard about the team and what's going to happen going forward. So, let's give them an earn out, let's keep them motivated for three to five years so there's transition. You look at another deal we just did in Europe where Santander bought 51% of an amazing company called Ebury, another client of ours. Again, these are big..you look at Ebury and Santander, you look Square Trade getting bought by Allstate Insurance getting bought by Prudential and actually stacking it up. These are like three of almost the only transactions where major balance sheet businesses that have been around for almost 100 years plus or minus are making these kind of bets, but you're seeing the stuff and you really haven't seen this up until recently, so you could see a lot more of it. Peter: Interesting. So then, when you look across the sort of spectrum of fintech, this is the last question, what area do you think is most exciting? Where do you see the most growth coming from? Steve: I'm probably most excited about..I'm excited on all different spaces honestly, but I love what we talked about earlier, the Marqetas of the world, you know, the Plaids of the world, the Expensifys of the world, the ones that are really powering enterprises to do more around fintech. I also really like the B2B payment space, companies like AvidXchange, for example, you can't take it to too many people that are in the business of getting rid of paper checks, right, and the B2B enterprise world and have a chance at leading the space there. So, it just companies like that that are more in the B2B side of things where you're seeing a lot of action right now and look, I love the digital banking space, I love what the Revolut N26, Chime, MoneyLion, Varo Money, I love what they're doing. What is exciting to me isI really do think, at the end of the day, fintech is here to help consumers and help companies be more efficient which ultimately helps the end consumers as well. So, to me that's what keeps us motivated to keep going and keep building our businesses. The fintech space is really, really helping people, at the end of the day, and that's what it's all about. Peter: Okay, indeed. On that note, we'll have to leave it there. I really appreciate your coming on the show today, Steve. Steve: My pleasure, Peter, thank you and congrats on everything you're doing at Lendit. Peter: Okay, thanks, see you. Steve: Bye. Peter: That was really interesting, particularly, Steve was saying around M...rom traditional financial institutions. We keep wondering when the floodgates will open, well maybe 2020/2021. we're going to see many, many more deals here. He's obviously provided three examples there and, you know, I've heard of others that are sort of in the wings that are in the exploratory phase, so it's going to be super interesting. I feel like the traditional financial institutions are not playing as big a role in M...s anyone expected and that could be very much about to change. Anyway on that note, I'll sign off. I very much appreciate you listening and I will catch you next time. Today's episode was sponsored by LendIt Fintech USA, the world's largest fintech event dedicated to lending and digital banking.

We began the decade with a handful of startup companies beginning to apply new technology to finance and we ended with fintech becoming a major force. For our first show of the new decade, episode 228 of the Lend Academy Podcast, the CEO and founder of Crowdfund Insider[1], Andrew Dix (also known as JD Alois), reviews where we have come from and gives his perspective on the trends that will be most important going forward. </p><p>In this podcast you will learn: The idea that led to the founding of Crowdfund Insider. Why he decided to use a pseudonym when he started writing. How the content has evolved over time. Why equity crowdfunding has not taken off in this country. The problems with Reg CF and Reg A+ today. Where the promise of fintech was realized and where it fell short in the past decade. The fintech trends that will dominate this decade.

Peter Renton: Today on the show, I am delighted to welcome Andrew Dix, he is the Founder and CEO of Crowded Media Group which is the publisher of Crowdfund Insider. Now, Andrew's been covering the space for many, many years and I wanted to get him on the show to give a little bit of a retrospective of the first show of 2020 and also looking ahead at the coming year and the coming decade. We touch on many interesting topics here, we talk about equity crowdfunding and the challenges that it's faced, we talk about digital banking, we talk about Big Tech and Embedded Finance and crypto and much more. It was a fascinating interview, I hope you enjoy the show. Welcome to the podcast, Andrew! Andrew Dix: Good to talk to you, Peter. Peter: Okay. So, let's get started by giving the listeners a little bit of background about yourself. We all know everyone reads Crowdfund Insider, but why don't you tell us a little bit about what you did before you started that. Andrew: Yeah. That's actually an excellent question because I have kind of what I think is a good background to be covering fintech. Back in my youth which was some decades ago (Peter laughs), actually worked in Washington DC and I was in the political and policy realm and I've always had an interest in policy, in general. So, I was in DC for a while, that kind of exposed me to the workings of legislation and politics and that is, of course, a very important aspect of fintech because financial services is a highly regulated industry, so that helped. And then I worked in the media. I was in traditional media working in a small closely held company that owned print, it owned broadcast and at one point in time had television and I ended up doing running the digital operations. So, at that time media, specifically print, was going through it's own digitization and it was really, really difficult to kind of watch what was happening with traditional media. I'm kind of a news and information junkie, I could see how the wheels were falling off and how the Internet was impacting traditional media and it was a bit of a struggle for me because I was engaged on the digital side and creating applications to manage news and working with the technology. Meanwhile, it was kind of a circle the wagons approach with the traditional side, so that kind of gave me the perspective of digital media. At the same time, I always had an interest in playing it so my bachelors is in economics and when I had moved to the Cleveland area, which is where I'm located now, I took some classes in finance at Weatherhead because I've just always had a profound interest in finance. So, I think in a different life, I probably would have been a banker (Peter laughs). In this life, I ended up being a kind of a news and media guy that had a deep interest in financial services and policy and that's kind of how it all comes together in fintech, in covering fintech. Peter: Right. So then, was there one particular thing that was the impetus to actually start Crowdfund Insider? Was there some particular aha moment? Andrew: So, another good question. There was a period in the US.there was a discussion about the JOBS Act, the JOBS Act of 2012 and how this was going to transform capital formation. It had shifted from, you know, traditional capital formation to online capital formation, or crowdfunding. I had a friend who was an investment banker and he said, hey, do you know about this. I'm like, yeah, kind of and he said, well, I'm kind of curious about this, this may be interesting. I said, well, you know, I know two events, I happen to know two events that are taking place where they're going to discuss that piece of legislation. One was a law firm, a big corporate law firm in downtown Cleveland; another one had to do with a presentation, somebody from a second market which at that time was a platform I thought would get into the space, but did not. So, I went to these two events and I realized that the platform side was going to be very crowded, very competitive, but I thought to myself, gee, this has been really an interesting subject area to cover from a news side and that was kind of the aha moment, the genesis. I've always had a thesis that emerging sectors like these are opportunities for news. Now, I don't consider it as a blog site, or blog, I consider it to be news because we cover news in a more traditional fashion. And so, that was kind of the moment where I said, you know, this something that I want to pursue because I had that whole digital background and it was really easy for me to, you know, get a site up and live quickly and start doing some coverage of the subject. Peter: So, when did you go live exactly? Andrew: I can't remember the exact date, but it was after the JOBS Act of 2012 was signed into law and things take time, as we all know, when it comes to financial regulation. It was within months of that taking place and it took place in, I think, the summer of 2012, so it was either late 2012, or 2013. We started with the first domain which was crowdfundinsider.com and that really had to do with the fact that there was a lot of focus on facilitating capital formation and this act of legislation which was hugely bipartisan because that was the Obama administration and we got support from both the Republicans and the Democrats. It's one of the standout acts of legislation that saw people from both sides of the aisle support and it was kind of an exciting period which obviously has taken a lot longer than most people expected. Peter: Yeah, we'll get into that in a little bit, but before I do so, I wanted to maybe touch on one question that I think many people have because a lot of people might not know your name, but a lot of people know your pseudonym. So, I want you to tell us about what your pseudonym is and why you decided to use a pseudonym in the first place. Andrew: So, it's another good question. So, when we started, I hired my first employee and most of it had to do with the content creation, that's really what we needed somebody to do and that person did that. After running the platform for a while, we need to augment this, we need, you know, more content and in traditional media it's very common to do a stock report. And so, what I would do is at night when I came home, I would do some stock reports which is pretty easy to do, but there was a following conversation about how Google liked to see by-lines, liked to see an individual's name. I was still in my day job at that time and I thought, well, okay, I'll just do a pen name for this and I would just continue to do, you know, a couple of articles in the evening and just augment a little bit because this other person was doing a good amount of the content. So, that's kind of how it came to be and once you go down that path, you know, it's kind of difficult to put that genie back in the bottle, you know, how do you do that. And, I think that, over time, hopefully my prose has improved, but I do believe that I'm at a point where I'm probably the most prolific fintech writer in the world. Peter: Yeah, I would agree with that. Just tell the listeners what your pseudonym is. Andrew: My pen name is JD Alois and there is a reason for that name, but I've never shared it with anybody. Nobody knows why, but it's a derivative of something and it actually has to do with, you know, part of my history and past experience. Anybody who can figure it out, I'll give him a thousand dollars of free advertising. (Peter laughs) Peter: Okay, that's a challenge for everybody. So then, you started off covering the crowdfunding space and then the content has evolved over the years and you now cover a much broader sort of swath of content, So, tell us, has this been a conscious decision, or has this just evolved naturally? What's been the evolution there? Andrew: So, it was definitely a conscious decision. When we first started covering the ecosystem, we focused a lot of attention on the UK. The UK was first out of the gate and creating a regulatory environment that was robust and functional who worked on my capital formation and that was both debt and equity. As you know well, peer-to-peer lending really got it's start in the UK, they have the first really effective equity crowdfunding platforms, or investment crowdfunding platforms in the UK and so they had a head start on the US. I looked at the UK and said this was an opportunity to learn and see how they're evolving because they're ahead in the game. Over time, in the US, you have kind of the growth of the online lending sector and marketplace lending. You have the Lending Club, you have Prosper, you have Funding Circle and these platforms became more prominent. And so, we started to get outreach from those platforms and we started to pay more attention to those platforms. There was a certain point in time and I said, there's two sides of the coin. While equity can be kind of sexy, it's kind of small. While debt is not necessarily as sexy, it's huge, it's enormous and that's the way it's been in public markets since I don't know how long. I said, okay, it's just part of that financial stack and really, in my opinion, online capital formation was the catalyst for all of fintech because I think it should have a lot of people that were young, you know, finance executives, or they're going to Wharton or some place. They're looking at traditional finance and they're looking at the way they have things have resulted in the past, or say, wait a minute, with technology I can do things differently, I can do things better. And so, first, you had online capital formation, debt and equity and then everything is saying, I can do this, I can do that. And then you just have this kind of creative boom of platforms, ideas, services, you know, from banking, to lending, to trading, to crypto and it's really been amazing, the amount of creativity that I have seen and you have seen in the fintech sector for the full stock of financial services. So, that's kind of the genesis of the site. Peter: So, let's get back to equity crowdfunding and as you say, it'sI remember, I actually wrote about it as well in 2012, when Obama signed the JOBS Act and there was a lot of optimism and, you know, I think if we had said, let's look ahead in seven plus years and no one will expectit's still a very small industry. Why do you think it hasn't taken off in this country? Obviously, it's taken off at the UK, Israel with OurCrowd, they're very active, why has it not taken off in this country? Andrew: Yeah, it's got a multifaceted explanation there because as we know, regulations in the financial services industry is byzantine at best in the United States. You have to deal with 50 individual states and the new ones is dealing with state regulators, there are also around a dozen federal regulators that touch financial services. That's hard. If you are a startup, an early stage company that wants a challenge in trans finance, there's a significant hurdle that is costly to complete and that's just part of the environment in the United States. The rules that were created under the JOBS Act of 2012 were not the best. Now, I give a lot of credit to people that fought to get those rules done. In effect, you had three forms of investment crowdfunding had Reg D to succeed for credit investors, you have Reg + which requires $50 Million from both the creditors and non-accredited investors. We had Reg CF which initially integrates up to $1 Million via funding for all broker deals for both non-accredited and accredited investors, but in the infinite wisdom of our policy (inaudible) who always seem to air on the side of investor protection, the rules have been so stringent that they actually have put to the opposite side. When you look at Reg CF, that regulation has been good, but it's been a hobble by the strict regime. In fact, it's kind of like ..it creates an environment of negative selection where some issuers and some platforms they do it because they can't raise money anywhere else. That's no what you want, you want, in my opinion, to have your smallest investors have access to the very best deals, that's what you want to create, but that's not what the regulations actually did. So, it's been hobbled, it can only raise a million.$1.07 Million right now, there's several aspects of the rules that really need to fixed. Reg A + has been a bit of a disappointment because of deal quality, it's been described as a mini IPO type structure. The cost to do a Reg A + is hundreds of thousands of dollars, depending on who you talk to. I think some of the issuers have not been that great. I think the clear winner in the full stack of crowdfunding exemptions is Reg D 506(c), basically, a Reg D that you can generally solicit or advertise. I am optimistic that some of these things can be fixed and can be changed. I'm an Adviser to the Association of Online Investment Platforms (AOIP) and that's one of the things that Dan Lucas is pursuing, is a regulatory fix for Reg CF. There are some people who like to see it raised to $20 Million, some people want to see it to $10 Million. I think the lowest amount that people are advocating for is $5 Million AOIP, the association, they have asked for a $10 Million cap and that would also kind of bring into line with what you're seeing in the UK because under existing laws in the UK, there is a prospectus requirement once you raise 8 Million Euros or more. Creating a prospectus is a significant undertaking and what it does is it creates a bit of a speed bump, but under that amount you can raise as much as you want without a prospectus. You can still crowdfund as much as you want, but you have that speed bump and that has seemed to have worked well in the UK. You regularly see issuers raise, you know, multi million pound offerings, you regularly see very high quality issuers raise money on these platforms where they are frequently doing side by sides with big VCs, a lot of the digital challenger banks which have achieved unicorn status. I think just about all of them have, you know, pursued online capital formation like Monzo, or Revolut and they view it as a way to not only raise a little bit of money, but also to garner some earned promotion and to enlist the whole, you know, region of people that will advocate and utilize their services which is smart, if you think about it. Peter: Right, right, yeah, I know. It's really been, I think, one of the unique things about the UK fintech scene is that so many people now own slices of these neo banks and the challenger banks. They've seen the paper valuation of their investment increase dramatically which, obviously, helps future fundraising. Anyway, I want to sort of move along here and just talk aboutmaybe we can startwe're recording this a week before Christmas, but it's going to be published first Friday in January, so it's the first one of the new decade. First, maybe you could take a step back and look back to 2010s, a lot has happened in fintech in this last decade and fintech wasn't really used as a term ten years ago. So, from your perspective..you've been writing and covering the space for most of this decade, as you look back at the 2010s, where do you think the promise of fintech was realized and where did it fall short? Andrew: Well, I think, the promise of fintech is ongoing and I think that really we're talking about the digitization of finance, it's really applying the Internet to financial services. One area where the Chinese got it right is what they call Internet Finance and similar to what happened in the newspaper industry where the Internet just totally disrupted them, that is happening and will continue to happen in the financial services industry at an accelerated pace. So, I think, that's all good, but as we all know, innovation and change is never a straight line. Everybody wants to see the hockey stick where you're getting low and ends up usually successful, that's not reality. Anybody really understands that it's a roller coaster with many ups and many downs and many of these companies will end up failing which is fine, that's part of the process. So, I look at.from the early part of the decade and I look at some of these things as platforms that only did these, or only did that, they tried to excel at these areas and at the time, I think, everybody, including myself, I thought this is great, it's really going to change the world, but, I think, that, you know, maybe they overshot that hype a little bit. Some of these platforms, they realize that doing this one thing really well is not necessarily the best path. I think what you're seeing today and you're going to continue to see is you're going to continue to see these platforms that have some tractions in certain sectors either way and they're going to continue to iterate and provide services and look at their consumers or customers and say, well, I'm already doing this, I can do this as well and I can drive incremental income and scale more effectively. So, if you look at the equity side, you're going to see platforms that do other things besides Reg D, Reg CF, Reg A +, but they're also going to provide management services, they're also going to provide advisory services, they're also going to provide a whole host of investment banking type service, it'll just be digital and that kind of makes sense. I think for platforms as they earn their stripes and they toughed it out wanting to survive, it's going to make sense to do that. I think the same thing is going to happen on the lending side. I think that if you look at a Lending Club, a publicly traded company, there's a lot of debate as to whether they went public too soon. I think their idea about shifting into becoming a marketplace bank, provide additional banking services totally makes sense. They have the touch point of the consumer, they have the data, they have a lot of services they can already offer, to provide a few more services is not that much of a weep because it's all digital, whether they'll be successful or not, we're going to find out. I think that is kind of the pinnacle, or the transition that we are in now where the people, the platforms, they have captured certain amount of transactions, they have to continue to iterate to see how they remain competitive and to be able to compete, or partner with traditional finance. Taking that step further, I think these pieces about Big Tech and fintech is huge. So, I think, as we go into the 20's, that is going to continue to gain more traction, it's going to be bigger than what most traditional financial services firms think will be today. Peter: Okay, okay. So, that's interesting. You've already sort of started to answer my next question which is as we look ahead to this decade you touched on Big Tech, what are some of the other key trends you see as really being a huge part of a fintech going forward? Andrew: So, I believe that technology is at its best when it's ubiquitous, it's everywhere, but it doesn't get in your way. It's something that's there when we need it, but, otherwise, it doesn't bother you. I think that's what you see happening for financial services. When I need to pay something, I point my phone at it, when I need to access credit, the credit is there, it's working for me now. It doesn't matter what platform I am on, I have access to it. So, I no longer need to drive to my corner bank branch to do whatever I need to do with financial services, I'll be able to access it anyway, anytime as long as I'm digitally connected. And, I think, that that is a theme and a transition that is multi-decade, it's going to be, you know, years and years in the making, but it's inevitable, right? Peter: Yeah, that's where we're starting to talk about Embedded Finance which I think is a super interesting trend which we'll be covering in depth at LendIt this year, I feel like it's one of many. So, tell me about this thing, what do you think of the digital banking space in this country, specifically. You know, we've got some very fast growing operations here, we've got some of the Europeans arriving, none of them have worked out how to make money yet, so very few, I shouldn't say none, a few of them have, how does the digital banking story play out this coming decade do you think? Andrew: So, I think that traditional finance has always moaned and groaned about the regulatory environment to operate within the 50 states and across the country. I think, today, they're looking at it as maybe something that's a little bit better than bad because it's created a bit of a moat for looming competition. One thing about traditional finance is it's very effective with lobbying, they have a great voice in Capitol Hill and you can see that manifest itself from time to time in some of the things that happened inside the beltway. I think that for traditional finance, the policy attempting to innovate and adapt and change by building their own platforms, acquiring platforms, or partnering with platforms which is absolutely what they need to do. For the emerging founders, the fintechs, again, because of the regulations, it's been kind of a tough road to follow in the US because we have.. how many digital only banks have received a federal banking charter. Well, we have Varo lMoney which has a provisional charter, I believe, and they're still waiting on that FDIC and that process is taking God knows how many years. It's crazy, it's taking so long. Now, we have Marcus which bought a bank and that was probably a very smart move and we have a lot of other digital banks that have applied for, or are looking to apply for, or looking to finesse the regulations to offer bank-like services. I don't think a regulatory environment was meant to make it so difficult. Do these entities need to be regulated? Absolutely, Yes, we have to have high standards as traditional finance? Absolutely. But should there be a path where these vigilant challenger banks to become regulated at the national level? That's obvious. When you look at what happened in the UK and the number of challenger banks that have emerged and that are growing rapidly in leaps and bounds, that's what should be happening in the United States. Unfortunately, it's been a bit of a slow go there that's why you have banks like Revolut and Monzo coming into the United States to set up shop because they kind of cut their teeth in a different market and they've learned a lot of things. And they're saying, well, I can just apply that here and I'll do what everybody else is doing, I'll use regulatory arbitrage and partner with a chartered bank to optimize services and then at some point in the future I'll get a charter, maybe not. That's kind of a convoluted process to do that. When you start, you should have a clear bright-lined path to be regulated at the federal level. So, I disagree with the regulatory approach. I think that the OCC has made an attempt to pursue that path that you know as well as I do, legal challenge and battle from traditional finance in entrenched stakeholders has been enormous. I just wish that wasn't the case. It's also for legislators, you know, it's not necessarily a priority for them, it's not something that's going to get them a lot of votes, it's not something that they necessarily understand, you know, really well. So, there's not a whole lot of interest in fixing some of these issues which is unfortunate because in the end, the losers is always the consumer, right, because once you have more competition within the financial services industry, the people who will benefit are the consumers because class go down and the quality of services move up. And, if you are a congressman or senator that's what you should want, you should be pursuing that, but, unfortunately, that's not the case, outside a few exceptions, right. Peter: Yeah, now that's dead right. I feel like there isn't enough push in Washington to change the status quo and I think it's going to take a long time for that to happen, if ever, and it's certainly going to hold innovation back. Anyway, we're almost out of time and there's really a couple of things I wanted to get to. You know, we spent this entire interview, so far, and we haven't talked about crypto. You've written about this a great deal, and blockchain, in general, but maybe just give us a minute, or so thoughts on the crypto space and what are the things you're watching right now there. Andrew: When bitcoin was kind of emerging, we really didn't cover that, but then, all of a sudden, ethereum came along and ethereum enabled the smart contracts and ICOs and really we started covering it because people started sending us information about things we weren't doing and I'm like, what is this, I don't understand this. I mean, I need to spend some time researching this and you could see that it was a form of online capital formation that was kind of like, you know, cocaine-fueled crowdfunding offering that was highly illegal. And so, you has this whole ecosystem develop where people would raise money and it was all speculative, it was breaking existing securities law and a lot of people predicted it was inevitable disruption which is what happened. One thing it did do was it showed how technology can help remove some of the friction in financial services if you do it in a regulated and in a compliant fashion. So, I think, that ICOs will be kind of a footnote in history, it was a crazy, weird time and place with a lot of very interesting and colorful people, many of them doing things that they probably shouldn't have been doing, but I also think that now you're in this point where you have this transition to digital assets which in the United States means digital securities. I think the digitization of securities is coming, it's just going to happen. You know, I remember back in the day when I can call my broker and say, hey, send my certificate to me, I've got to hold on to my certificate, put it in the mail. Well, I really can't do that anymore. There's a lot of back office stuff that's still kind of analog-ish that can be pulled out of the system to drive efficiencies. You look at Cagney's new startup and I've heard him the other day where he is able to pull, I think, a hundred basis points out of a securitization process. If you're in traditional financial services, you'll say, wow, that's huge because at scale that makes me a lot of money. So, I think if you see that similar streamlining taking place in back office operations, it is really not that sexy, right. But, I think, that's where we are now, people are just trying to figure it out, visual studies are going to happen, how that manifests itself, I don't know, I just think it's going to happen. The other thing that I think may be of interest is a sector I call 'esoterics,' and that's because, all of a sudden, the technology you can securitize things that really we were not able to do in the past. This was not cost effective to do in the past and I think you've seen a little bit of this where people are kind of dabbling in real estate transactions. You some real estate transactions this is going to be managed on distributed ledger technology. I think people are going to start to experiment with other assets and other asset classes. When is it going be, I have no idea. We're going through a concept of utility token as opposed to security. You know, the juries out in the United States, or some jurisdictions in Europe that have facilitated that and in other countries, it's happening, I don't know whether it's going to continue to happen, or whether it's going to go, but in the United States, pretty much, if you're doing a digital asset, a security with a couple of exceptions. Peter: Okay. So, last question. You know, we're starting the year, we've talked about a lot of different things in this interview, what is the most interesting topic that you're following most closely right now? Andrew: So, beyond the regulatory stuffI think I have a generic flaw because I actually enjoy reading about regulations (Peter laughs).you can't take me out in public, my wife knows. She gets scared when we go out, I start talking to people and they have no idea of what I'm talking about, but beyond that I go back to the Big Tech in fintech. I just see that the pace has already happened in China where you have Big Tech like Tencent and Alibaba, Alipay and what you're seeing happen there..I think they're ahead of us in many respects, I think you're going to continue to see that happen within the US and elsewhere. Do I want Apple to be my bank? Absolutely. I trust them with all sorts of information that I wouldn't trust with anybody else and I'm already using them to pay for things. Is it a leap for them to provide more financial services to me, not at all. Is it dicey for them to go down that path due to the convoluted regulatory environment which is really, you know, kind of Jurassic? Yes, but I think over time they are going to continue to go down that path alongside other Big Tech firms like, you know, Google, Amazon, Facebook. I'm not a huge fan of Facebook, but I figure you will continue to see here in the United States and I think you're going to see it globally around the world and you've actually seen actual examples of that. Peter: Okay, it would be interesting to see. On that note, we'll have to leave it there. Andrew, I very much appreciate your coming on the show today. Andrew: Excellent, it was good talking too. Peter: Okay, see you. Andrew: Bye, take care. Peter: The continued encroachment of Big Tech into finance, the movement towards Embedded Finance, the crazy fast growth of the digital banks, these are all important trends, I think, we will continue to be paying attention to, continue to evolve our thinking on as this decade progresses and it's going to be a very exciting time. One thing I'm certain, I obviously don't know, I don't have a crystal bowl, I don't know how it's going to play out, but one thing I am certain of is that finance in 2030 is going to look very different from finance in 2020. Anyway on that note, I will sign off. I very much appreciate you listening and I'll catch you next time. Bye.

Peter Renton: Today on the show, I'm delighted to welcome Susan French, she is the SVP and Head of Product at BBVA Open Platform. Now, BBVA, obviously, is a well known, very large international bank, Open Platform is their new Banking-as-a-Service offering. BBVA is a real trailblazer here in offering. they're the largest bank offering a Banking-as-a-Service type product. I wanted to get Susan on just to talk about sort of the genesis of Open Platform, what it is exactly, who the clients are, the types of different clients they're targeting and how they differentiate themselves from others offering Banking-as-a-Service. And then we spend some time at the end discussing trends for 2020 and it was interesting. It was a fascinating interview, I hope you enjoy the show. Welcome to the podcast, Susan! Susan French: Thank you. Peter: Okay, I'd like to get this thing started by giving the listeners a little bit of background, you've had quite an interesting career at some of the major companies in finance. So, why don't you give the listeners just a little bit of background, particularly what you did before you came to BBVA. Susan: Sure. Immediately, before I came to BBVA, I was at Visa, I was there for twelve years and had a variety of roles. Started out as a product manager in the Disputes Area, eventually became Head of Enterprise Architecture and had what Visa called Research and Central Technology which was their CTO office. The last thing I did at Visa was to create and launch the Visa Developer Center which was Visa's program to expose its services externally to the world through APIs and other services like it. Before Visa, I ran my own independent consulting company for a number of years working with fintechs and web design firms. Before that, worked with a large IT consulting company and ran a division that created and delivered software for banks they can use for their credit operations, so application processing, credit bureau interfaces, behavioral scoring, collections recoveries. I've been working in the financial services business for a long time. Peter: Right, right, okay. So then, what was it that made you decide to go join BBVA? Susan: BBVA was doing some very interesting things, the genesis of Banking-as-a-Service. BBVA is the only bank of our size in the US that has opened APIs for Banking-as-a-Service. That was a nascent project at that time that I first started talking with BBVA and it was just such an interesting concept to be at the ground floor of buildings, be of service and seeing it grow, and evangelizing it. It was a great opportunity. Peter: Yeah, okay. So then, you arrived at BBVA, it sounds like, before Open Platform existed, right. So, tell us about the genesis of BBVA Open Platform and why the bank wanted to do this. Susan: The very beginning days of Open Platform was actually a development work that was needed to integrate Simple and BBVA bought Simple. At the time that BBVA acquired them, they were connected to a different bank so a set of integration APIs had to be built in order to enable Simple to integrate with BBVA core banking system. That kind of happened before my time. But when I came along, BBVA had discovered, as a result of the experience with Simple, that there was a much bigger world of opportunity out there by generalizing and extending the services that were built to support Simple into a much broader Banking-as-a-Service platform. When I joined, BBVA was just the beginning of that process where we started with the kernel of what was created for Simple and then expanded it and added new features and services built out of robust, scalable platform, both for technology and for compliance and regulatory monitoring and created an actual Banking-as-a-Service business. And that was the opportunity that I came to BBVA to do and what we've been working on since the two years that I joined. Peter: Right. So, is Open Platform really just focused on the US? I mean, obviously, BBVA is a Spanish bank with operations in many, many countries. So, what's the geographic footprint for Open Platform? Susan: For Open Platform, we're right now geographically just in the US. We are working to expand our ability to support cross border payments. That's something we're going to work on probably the first half of next year, but right now our focus is in the US for our specific platform. As you probably know, BBVA and the other geographies in Mexico with a partnership announced between Bank Homer and Uber and the number of the activities in BBVA Spain. There are similar activities going on in most of BBVA's major geographies, but, for right now, our focus is in the US. We think there is a sea of opportunity to support this service in the US before we have to worry about internationalizing. Peter: Sure, sure. So, let's dig into Open Platform for a minute. Why don't you tell us the different types of services, the different types of Banking-as-a-Service, I guess, offerings you have. Susan: Sure. There are fundamentally five services we currently offer on the platform. The first is consumer KYC, so it's a set of APIs and tools that enable our clients to perform bank grade KYC and a deeper view on their consumer customers. We have a similar set of APIs for business customers so Business KYB. All of that is digital, so our clients who are using those services can perform KYC and onboard their customers to our platform digitally. We have services related to the opening of BBVA accounts, so all of those can be done digitally and instantly; similarly, issuing debit cards associated with those accounts. Probably our biggest and most generative services is what we call Move Money which is our on-demand payment services. It has a single API that allows our clients to move money from one account to another via a variety of different payment methods, depending on what makes sense. So, we support payments via ACH debits and credits, same day and regular, via card-based push and pull so CardPull and CardPush. We have an agreement with a bill payment provider that enables us to support electronic bills payments and what we call PayAnyone. It is a service that allows our clients to electronically generate a check, paper check, and mail it to anybody who needs to be paid for anything that is required. We're looking at adding other payment options in the future, so both domestic and international wires, we're looking at other real time payments rails to see how those can be integrated. What's beautiful about the service is that a single integration to the Move Money API would enable a client to take advantage of any of those payment options as their option, depending on whether the source and the destination account is a bank account, a debit card, or a bill payment payee. They don't need to build a separate integration to use different forms of payment. The last piece is our Real Time Notification Service. So, we provide a whole set of real time notifications around every major event that occurs on the platform that a client can subscribe to and receive in real time. Peter: Right, okay. So, that's a pretty broad set of services. Maybe we can talk about I'd love to hear about some of the early clients. I think it was about a year ago you guys launched from memory, so tell us when you launched and maybe talk us through some of the different types of clients that you're working with and even a couple of examples, if you could. Susan: Sure. We had an early data at the beginning of last year with a couple of select clients to kind of shake down the service, but we launched BBVA Open Platform publicly in October of last year, so we've been in production live for roughly about 14 months. We have a variety of clients on our platform, we have a couple of examples, oh, in fact, generally, about who would be interested in Banking-as-a-Service because that's often a question we get, great, but who needs the stuff. We're here to think of our market as being divided up into five broad categories. The first and kind of most obvious is digital banks, so if you want to launch a digital bank in the US and you don't want to get your own banking charter then you need a bank partner to work with like us. We can provide you with the ability to onboard customers, open accounts, issue cards and make payments. So, there are a couple of digital banks who are existing clients, Simple being one of them; Azlo which is another BBVA found entity is a small business bank that sits on our platform, and we've recently launched a digital bank called Wise which is a small business bank as well on our platform Second category is what I would call Service Economy, or Gig Economy businesses. So, anybody who needs to pay contractors, pay independent workers, you know, think, dog walkers, drivers, delivery people, you know, anyone who is in a sort of non-traditional payroll category may see ability to embed within their apps the ability to pay those people. So, there's a large economy associated with that. We have a project going with Uber in Mexico that enables Uber drivers there to get paid through an integration between Bank Homer (?) and Uber. We don't do that in the US yet, but you can envision similar kinds of projects with clients in that industry. The second and third group is what we would call the Ecosystem Marketplaces where there's a need for affiliated parties to be able to collaborate together in an ecosystem that allows them to perform their business and at the same time pay and be paid. One of our current clients is a company called Tuvoli and they operate a marketplace for private jet aircraft charters where they bring together brokers who book trips on behalf of their customers, so people, or businesses and an ecosystem of providers, pilot, aircraft, fuel, caterers, hotels that have to deliver a booked charter and through Tuvoli's marketplace environment, the broker and the providers collaborate with each other around booking trips, scheduling them and then reserving them and when the trip is completed they use our Banking-as-a-Service capabilities to pay and be paid. Peter: Interesting. Susan: Now, a couple of other prospects that are similar ecosystems, one is around an ecosystem for residential construction, put everything together a collection of builders alongside who are building residential homes and on the other side, the suppliers and contractors and materials providers that need to get paid as part of that process. So, I think there's a number of opportunities there. The fourth category is kind of traditional disbursements. Enterprises of all kinds are realizing, especially in a B to C environment that more and more consumers want to receive payments electronically, or instantly and so there's that category of enterprise disbursement use cases for .take insurance companies, merchant rebates, suppliers settlement, purchase settlement where businesses want to operate from paper check disbursements to electronic payments, or from slower electronic payments to faster electronic payments. They want to be able to integrate that directly into their claims system, or into their rebate system rather than having to, you know, go to some payables, or ERP system on the side in order to generate those reimbursements. Peter: Right, right. Susan: Now, last one is kind of financial wellness, there's a whole group of emerging fintechs around helping consumers mostly how to manage their financial lives, whether it's automated savings programs, Robo advising programs, financial budgeting. So, a couple of our clients fall in that category. Digit is one of our largest clients and they have an automated savings program where they enable their consumers to connect their external bank accounts to their Digit account, set savings goals. Digit monitors their spending and income and finds opportunities when it's safe to tighten up small bits, save them toward a goal. One of those goals could be paying a bill, or paying their credit card debt which is a particular program that they're running with BBVA. Another client is a company called Catch and they describe themselves as a portable benefits platform for self-employed people. So, self-employed people don't have an employer to give them benefits like health insurance, IRAs, investing advice, the ability to save for their 'time off' and so Catch is building a platform based on our platform that enable self-employed people to create banks accounts and to use those to take advantage of these benefit services that Catch offers. It's kind of a pretty broad swath to go through who our target markets are and who some of our current clients are. Peter: Yes, interesting, So, you know, there's a mix there, but it seems to be mainly startups you're working with. I guess that's probably not unusual because they're the ones that have kind of a lot of the needs for these new services, but are you equally focused on more established companies, even large companies? Susan: Oh, absolutely. I think your observation is spot on. In our initial days, our initial focus was building and testing with small and medium sized fintech companies who are obvious targets for these, but also adaptable and amenable and helped us, you know, to find the features of the platform and shake out its operations. But now, we are very much engaging with larger and enterprise clients who have the similar need. Some whether it is a large fintech that wants to build banking services into their environment, or wants to be a bank, or whether it's a large enterprise that wants to add electronic payments, or instant payments and disbursements to their environment. They're equally likely targets of opportunity for a service like ours. Peter: And so, is the goal to sort of bring, or is the primary goal to bring new customers to the bank, or is this really a.like are you kind of a standalone division within BBVA that is really independent of that other goal? Susan: We're actually both. We are an independent venture of the bank, we have a profit and loss goal revenue target just like other ventures as a bank do, but one of the reasons why the bank has been willing to create us and invest in us is that we do bring customers to the bank that the bank may not otherwise get. If you think about how BBVA US could build its customer base, that's sort of traditional advertising, marketing, direct mail certainly generates a certain amount of new customer origination every year. But, if you think about it, the network effect of bringing customers to the bank through third party relationships.. if we have ten or 20 or 50 of these third party relationships that could be supported by our platform and each of them bring 50,000,100,000, 200,000 customers with them, it's an opportunity for BBVA to add customers, add deposits and add revenues that greatly eclipses what could be done through traditional customer acquisition channels for a bank. Peter: Right, sure, sure. So, BBVA has been, pretty famously, one of the more innovative big banks globally and I know about the BBVA Innovation Centers around the world, of course there's BBVA Ventures, the venture capital arm, I mean, how does Open Platform interface with these innovation centers, particularly with BBVA Ventures? Susan: What we are, as I mentioned earlier, we are an actual independent venture and we exist within a business line in BBVA called New Digital Businesses which has a couple of different functions. One is to incubate and create new digital businesses. There are several of them that share the same floor with us including Simple and Azlo the Open Platform which is the computer enabling platforms for that, as well as a business on its own right and then Total, propel and Visa Ventures for both investing at various levels of investment in other third party businesses. Peter: Right. Susan: So, we pay service at platforms for both incubating new businesses and for providing services as needed to the companies that BBVA Ventures invest in. We have less of a direct relationship with BBVA's innovation centers only because the US has been a little bit slower to build innovation center capabilities than Spain, for example. Peter: Right. Susan: So, out of the innovation center activities, hackathons and the other innovation programs that the global bank operates are more Spain-focused right now than they are in the US, but I would expect that as the US builds out its own innovation center, we will be very much connected to that as well. Peter: Okay. So then, there are sort of other companies in this space that are offering this Banking-as-a-Service, particularly some of them might be offering one, or two of the capabilities that you guys offer, how do you differentiate what Open Platforms offer compared to other Banking-as-a-Service providers? Susan: I think there's a couple of differentiators. If you look at most of the other Banking-as-a-Service providers who provide white label Banking-as-a-Service, you typically find that there is a partnership between a technology platform provider and a sponsor bank. And so, an enterprise that wants to integrate Banking-as-a-Service from one of them typically has to work with two parties. Peter: Right. Susan: They have to work with their technology provider and they have to work with whomever the sponsor bank is. Whereas, with BBVA they get all, both of those rolled into one. So, when they work with BBVA, we are both the sponsor bank and the technology platform which makes integration more straightforward, which gives them a closer relationship from a compliance and regulatory support point of view than they might otherwise get and a more seamless integration from their front end through our API platform to the bank's core. Peter: Okay, that makes sense. Susan: Now, there are other competitors who are similarly structured, who are both the bank and the technology platform and there are, obviously, all the big guys, you know, Chase, B of A, Wells Fargo, are building API platforms of their own. However, they've been primarily focused on those API platforms positioned as an alternative delivery channel of services to their existing clients rather than as a white-labeled service like we do. Will they wake up one day and discover the opportunity that we see? Probably. But, right now, both of them are focused on providing API-based integration as another way for their existing clients to access existing services. Peter: Right. By the time they wake up, you'll have a large and very well-established offering, so they'll be playing catch up. (laughs) Okay, so in the remaining time we have, I want to switch gears. Here we are at the end of the decade, we're recording this just a few days before Christmas and this will be published early in the new year, but as we look forward to the new year, you're in a very interesting position here at BBVA, you had your time at Visa and really interesting to hear your perspective on some of the fintech trends. What do you see, at least some of the main themes that you expect to be front of mind for the industry next year. Susan: Obviously, I think Banking-as-a-Service (Peter laughs) will continue to grow and become more and more prominent in the affairs of companies in the US. I think we're just scratching the surface of the number of use cases that can be supported by Banking-as-a-Service and I think to the extent that enterprises of all sizes adopted consumers and businesses. Customers will see future improvements in the level of servicing commitments they get from customers because now payments are becoming more invisible, or more automatic and banking opportunities exist for a wide variety of technology companies to offer, So, obviously, if we are counting on that from the point of view of BBVA's continuing investing in Open Platforms, but we also think that as a general trend that will see more and more of it coming in the new year. Peter: Sure, sure. So, what are some the other trends then? Susan: I think that we will see some continued growth in the US government's focus on faster payments. I think like most of my colleagues in the industry, I'd like to see it happen faster than I think it's actually going to. I mean, now is a great directional statement, but it's like more years away from being reality than I think we would like and so I think we, US financial institutions, are a little bit behind the curve compared to many other countries in the world that have been able to build truly ubiquitous real time payments. So, I hope to see an acceleration of that focus in the new year. I think it's going to be interesting to see what happens with some of the Big Techs and their sort of banking and payment-related activity. We have seen Google announcement, we have seen what Apple Pay and Goldman are doing, we've seen Amazon sort of get in and then get out of offering checking accounts. It will be interesting to see sort of who advances farther in developing digital banking and payment services for consumers and businesses. The small fintechs that seem to be driving most of the innovation today, or the bigger technology firms will finally sort of figure out how they're going to tackle this market and then be able to put their obviously massive investment and brand weight behind it. I would love to see and hope to see continued growth and ubiquitous mobile payments and contactless. We've seen a lot of improvement in penetration in the US over the last year, I'd love to see it happen faster. I think mobile payments, not necessarily mobile banking, but mobile payments has a huge outside opportunity that I hope will accelerate significantly in the coming year. Peter: Okay, we're almost out of time, but I would like to get your take on the digital banking space because it's been one of the things for 2019, is this incredibly rapid growth and big funding rounds that we've seen from these digital banks. I mean, you've got Chime and Dave that now have many, many millions of customers and adding them in very rapid rates, in Brazil, you've got Nubank, in the UK, you've got Revolut and Monzo and Starling Bank, N26 in Europe as well. It seems to me that these digital banks are adding customers faster than some of the biggest banks in the world can add them. So, what's your take looking at it from your perspective on what the prospects are of these digital banks. Susan: It's a very interesting question and I agree with you, new digital banks are popping up everywhere and some of those, the big established digital banking names in Europe, particularly N26, Monzo and Revolut have announced their plans to move to the US and tackle the US market. And, as you noticed, some of the digital banks like Chime have entered the unicorn territory now in terms of their value. I think a couple of things, most of them are announcing, as you noted, very rapid growth in the number of customers, what they don't talk about the number of active customers. Our own experience has been that there's a lot of experimentation by consumers. They find out for these accounts because they want to see what the experience is like, is this a more intuitive, more pleasant, more engaging experience than the last one I tried? but they don't necessarily deposit money and they don't necessarily transact. I think we're going to see a lot of churn for a while until the ones that have the most compelling value proposition and ones that are able to build an engaging experience that keeps the same consumer coming back all the time will emerge, and some of the others will tend to fall by the wayside. The challenge for these digital banks is, how do I build competitive differentiation? how many no- fee checking accounts can you offer (Peter laughs), or they have to find something else that creates that compelling value proposition, or an engaging enough experience that people stick with you rather than the others. The ease of establishing an account with a digital bank is a double-edged sword, it's really easy to apply and really easy and frictionless to become a customer, but then it's easy to do the same thing with the next bank that comes along. Peter: Yup, yup, that makes sense. Last question then, I'm just curious about .as you look ahead personally to 2020, what are you working on that you're most excited about for next year? Susan: Two things, one is just scaling the platform and as we talked about earlier, sort of working with larger companies that have more complex needs and much larger scale for us to see double, triple, quadruple the scale of clients and transactions that we're processing. The other thing that we're focusing on is just adding more options to the platform. Right now, we can digitally open checking accounts, but, you know, we'd love to be able to add the ability to digitally open other kinds of accounts and expand that service for our clients. We're always looking to adding more ways to pay. Peter: Right. Susan: So, whether it's adding RCT integration, or adding Zelle, or adding other suppliers, or whatever the next option is, the more opportunities we can provide our clients to use whatever payment rails makes sense for their customer using the single integration we provide and that just adds that much more value to our platform. Peter: Right, right, it sure does. Ok, we'll have to leave it there, Susan, I really appreciate your coming on the show today. Susan: Oh, you're welcome, thank you for the opportunity to chat, I really appreciate it. Peter: Okay, see you. Susan: Bye. Peter: You know, I think BBVA are in the right place at the right time with their Open Platform offering. Banking-as-a-Service is going to be a huge trend of the 2020s. We talked about Embedded Finance which is really what this is. I think the reality is every single company on the planet has a financial function and that is really underutilized. What Banking-as-a-Service does, what Embedded Finance does is getting more and more granular as time goes on and companies are going to be able to offer small, medium, large companies a range of financial services that could have only been offered by banks in the past. I think it's super exciting and it really feels like to me as a complete rewiring of the financial system and it's going to happen in this decade. Anyway on that note, I will sign off. I very much appreciate you listening and I'll catch you next time. Bye.

But they are the backbone behind 95% of digital banking activity today in this country.Our next guest on the Lend Academy Podcast is Clay Wilkes, the CEO of Galileo Financial Technologies[1]. Through their APIs Galileo is powering not just payment processing but digital banking, the gig economy, investing and lending today. Theirs was already a fascinating story and then they were acquired by SoFi[2] just a few weeks ago.This episode of the Lend Academy Podcast is sponsored byLendIt Fintech USA 2020[3].

So, join the fintech community online this year where you will meet the people who matter, learn from the experts and get business done. LendIt Fintech, lending and banking connected. Sign up today at lendit.com/usa Peter Renton: Today on the show, I'm delighted to welcome Clay Wilkes, he is the CEO and Founder of Galileo Financial Technologies. Now, Galileo is a fascinating company, they've been around since the early 2000's, they've kind of aged in the last few years and they are powering some of the biggest names in fintech, you know, companies like Chime, SoFi, BlueVine, Current Aspiration and many more. According to Clay, they do like.. 95% of fintech companies are using Galileo in some way and what they've created is a very simple API-driven system where any company can add a payments functionality very quickly and easily, you don't even have to be a fintech company or a bank. They've worked out a way to do this in a really streamlined fashion, we talk about that in some depth and how they were able to do that. We also talk about, of course, the acquisition by SoFi, that has been in the news a few weeks back and we go into some depth about the thinking behind that and what this might mean for SoFi and for Galileo going forward. It was a fascinating interview, I hope you enjoy the show. Welcome to the podcast, Clay! Clay Wilkes: Thanks so much, Peter, nice to be here, thanks for having me. Peter: Of course, my pleasure. So, I know you've been working at Galileo for many, many years, but I'd like to, at least, give the listeners some background about yourself, sort of what you did before that time and maybe even leading into why you decided to start Galileo. Clay: Yeah. My background is in operating systems and technology, communications. I had taken a prior company public, been retired for about six years before starting Galileo and that was 20 years ago so, that's my background as in technology. Galileo really started to solve a problem that I saw in financial systems and transformation that I felt like was badly needed to match the Internet age. In the last, you know, call it five to seven years, we've really seen a boom in fintech and Galileo has been in an integrated position to benefit from that. Peter: Okay, okay. So then, when you started it..because, obviously, 18 years is an eternity in fintech, I mean, fintech didn't really exist as a term. Obviously, it was companies like PayPal and a handful of others that were trying to do some things in financial technology, but why don't you just take us back to that time, what was the problem you were trying to solve when you started? Clay: What we saw was systems that were, you know, large, rigid, monolithic, difficult to work with, not that really API-based at all, not created in a way that would be flexible, scalable, architected in a way that can solve many diverse problems, just not well suited to solving that problems that we felt like needed to be solved in payments. Many of the card platforms were architected to handle the inputs and outputs of a card transaction, we don't do that. We organize information very similar to the way it might occur, for example, on the file system on your computer, or something such as that just happens to be financial information. Peter: Okay, So, maybe you could just sort of fast forward us through the last 18 years really quickly in just a minute or so, and talk about how the company has evolved really up until this year. Clay: You know, if you go back in payments and banking, what you find is credit initially starting in the general store, then into gas stations and department stores, eventually banks, Visa, Bank of America had an idea that they could invite other banks to extend the brand, get merchants on board. That really was all focused on credit, consumer credit, in particular, and revolving credit, bank-issued. Sometime after that, debit came along, again, it was a bank product, access to your DDA funds so you had traditional credit, traditional debit and anything that wasn't that was sort of thrown into this other bucket and that bucket was about the same time that Galileo started and came about. So, that was the problem that we were trying to solve.was many different business applications and diverse types of situations. So, it's our ability to be able to solve that has lent itself to being able to be kind of in the right place at the right time for fintech. Now, we see companies like TransferWise, Chime, Aspiration, Greenlight, Robinhood, Monzo, SoFi, Revolut, Remitly, Paysafe, just to name a few. You know, Galileo clients by one count, recent count, Galileo was powering 95% of all digital banking in North America. We have five out of the top five UK firms as clients.the top application in Canada is on our platform, the number one in the US, number one in Mexico, we've just been in Latin America for two months, but of the top 20 down there, we've already signed five. I think we must sign all 20 as clients so, you know, Galileo has done extremely well in API-based payments and banking. Peter: Yeah. So, that is a pretty impressive track record. You know, it's interesting because a lot of the companies that you mentioned there and the ones you're powering, they didn't exist certainly ten years ago and some of them didn't exist five years ago. I'm curious about the..you've had this front row seat to this explosion in fintech where you've been able to see, basically, a banking industry or a . there's been new products that have come out in financial services consistently over the last, I guess, 50 years, but really we have this kind of explosion in the last five years where things are really changing. I'd love to kind of get your take on how you sort of .. you had your business for about 18 years or so, but in the last five years things have really taken off, give us your take on how that's happened and how you've been able to take advantage of that. Clay: Yeah. Somebody mentioned to me that we were an overnight success 18 years in the making so it's been a ride, it's been interesting to watch. My own personal belief about this is that we're still in the early days of fintech. So, a lot of people are thinking, wow, you've seen a lot of progress in the last five years and that's true, we really have, but my own personal belief is that we're going to see a lot of change in the next five years. And so, we saw this with the Internet, you know, the Internet exploded, took off, it's a big deal and Internet 2.0 kind of came along and we saw a bunch of new leaders emerge. In my personal belief, we're going to see that again in the world of fintech over the next five to ten years, there's still a lot of stories to be told. I think they have companies like Jio in India and, you know, this global phenomenon that are..TikTok, just a lot of the world that are still yet to be defined so, I believe, we're still very early. We are going to see a response focused largely on consumer by the incumbents, I believe that way it's coming. Galileo has already seen it, many of them are reaching out to Galileo to trans-solve these types of problems. We're also going to see and have seen that we're going to see much more of the emergence of Big Tech in the world of payments. So, we're by no means done, in fact, we're just, just, just barely beginning. Peter: Right. On that, we feel like we've only just begun, but there are certainly some digital banks that have reached really impressive scale, several million customers here in the US, same internationally I mean, you look at Latin America, you've got Neobank with more than ten million, I don't know what the latest is, it's way more than ten million, I think, as far as customers there. So, as we grow, I mean, there's going to be..and as these companies mature, we have the need for really bank-like reliability, bank-like dependability where you go to the ATM or you load up your mobile app and it always is working, it's 100% of the time. So, what are you doing at Galileo to really ensure that you can provide that kind of ..the level of uptime, that dependability that some of the largest banks have really made us all accustomed to. Clay: Well, that's a great question. There's a lot that we're doing there. I want to take this slight exception with your point which is the big banks have made us accustomed to. Actually, you know, if you look back over 2019, Wells Fargo had an outage that lasted ten days, Bank of America had an outage that affected 60 million customers, Capital One had an outage that affected 106 million customers. So, the big banks aren't immune from this, you know, Amazon, the king of data centers, had an outage that have affected 2.3 million businesses, I've personally, been stranded by Delta Airlines three times and not for flight shortages, but for IT outages and Apple who spends trillions or billions, at least, on IT infrastructure has outages almost continually. So, outages are a phenomenon and the same that goes along with technology despite some of their biggest and best and most diligent efforts on the part of the big banks and other technology firms and Galileo is a part of that. Despite that, I agree with the thesis which is Galileo has done and is doing a lot and we've had a very, very good track record related to uptime, fortunately. One of the things that Galileo play was the incident in October and one of the things we've done since then, just to give you a sense, we had a project after that called 10X and what 10X enabled us to do was to scale to ten times our largest client. So, in short, what this was essentially 140 million active accounts representing somewhere in the order of 10 billion transactions and rating scale of about 5,000 transactions per second. So, we're doing all that we can to ensure there that we've got massive scale and capability. The good news is that the architecture is fully horizontally scalable, you know, very much like any well architected cloud-based solution today. Peter: Right, right. And so, given the changing environment here over the last three months where there's been certainly lots of pockets of activity that has scaled dramatically, we're seeing digital banks adding new customers, banks adding new deposits at record rates, how has this changing consumer behavior really impacted Galileo? Have you been ramping up along with this increase in demand? Clay: Galileo is seeing a massive growth since the beginning of the pandemic, just as an example. I think about the infrastructure we're using right now, Zoom, and the growth that they have gone through and the growth at Amazon. Quite honestly, we always hear that Amazon was built for the pandemic, and fortunately, for many of us it was in place, but I would say that's true, digital banking as well. Our clients have seen just incredible growth over the last three months. Just to give you a sense of that, for existing business, Galileo is up month over year..last month, 165% which is just absolutely incredible growth. So, we're doing all that we can and fortunately things are working extremely well right now and the growth has been incredible. We've got clients that are adding, in some cases, 50,000 new accounts a day, many of them have got a waiting list of over a million/a million and a half accounts that are waiting to get on. It's really a function of card production not a function of scalability press so there's a lot that is going on. Many of these companies like a Chime, a Robinhood, we just saw recent numbers coming out on Current, you know, these companies, Dave.com, they've all scaled incredibly well. Galileo's powering all of that. Peter: Right, okay. So, one of things that.. I presume you might have seen the column by Matt Harris last year about embedded finance because as you're talking and as I look at Galileo, I feel like, you know, you're really part of this movement toward embedded finance where.you know, maybe we'll step back and talk about Galileo Instant which from my understanding of it is sort of a way.it's like a plug and play for different kinds of financial services and it seems like this is a trend that's really going to getit's getting going and it's got legs, as far as I see. We'd love to sort of get your.firstly, explain what Galileo Instant is and then talk maybe more broadly about the trends toward embedded finance. Clay: Galileo has got an incredible platform for it's digital banks that we've been talking about here this morning. If you look at those digital banks and new digital banks coming along that wants to go, like great consumer experience, they've got some ideas around what they feel that data will like, Galileo tries to provide the services that would enable all of that, but the process to do it is expensive and it takes time. So, you know, for example, you would have needed to raise several million dollars, you need to know something about banking, and about fraud and about disputes, compliance &amp;#38; regulation, all of the rest of it. It's expensive and it's not easy, it's difficult to get into, but there are many businesses that just simply want to make a payment, they don't want to be a payments company, they just want to make a payment. So, that's that thing that we're trying to do with Galileo Instant. It's a product that we announced late last year, we've been in beta over the last several months, the product is going live this month and we've had 450 companies with inbound interest to sign up for and gain access to the API's that power Galileo Instant. To answer your question, the problem that Galileo Instant is trying to solve here is ..you know, I have a client, excuse me, a neighbor that is a .he owns a steel manufacturing company that uses welders to assemble the steel, 10,000 welders and he asked me, do you have a product that will allow me to pay my welders by the weld. I said, wait, you give me about two months, the answer to that is, yes, and so that's one application. Google has 23 million YouTube influencers that need to be paid every month so if you think about that and that particular portion of Google, I could imagine, doesn't necessarily want to be a payments company although Google itself might be, they just simply want to make a payment. So, whether you're talking about a welding company or Google, we see thousands of these applications and we've done some engineering and recent testing around what does it take to get into this type of business and we've reduced it from many, many months, you know, the sales process could be months, the integration could be months, the marketing ramp behind all of that on the part of our client can be many months. So, you can see one of these digital banks take anywhere from 12 to 24 months to really get started and begin to market their product. Whereas, on Galileo Instant we've reduced that to a number of minutes. So, somebody can come to the Galileo Instant product and gain access to it's all API-driven and within a matter of minutes we've eliminated all of the friction that goes into needing to make a payment and you can begin to do it. You can do it in a co-branded way so Google could do it, co-brand with YouTube, etc. and it's pretty powerful. We've seen this on the acquiring side, but not really much innovation here at all on the issuing side so I'm pretty excited about it. These are the types of products that I was talking about, I mentioned it earlier, around Fintech 2.0. We still have got a lot of headroom, another 20 years work, at least. Peter: Right. So, you think then that we're going to..the companies you just mentioned there, the welder, Google, these are not financial firms, but, obviously every single company on the planet has a financial function because, otherwise, they're just there by definition. Clay: Right. Peter: .so you think what you're going to see is, you know, a range of companies, it sounds like from what you're saying, even down to the reasonably small companies that can offer their sort of co-branded financial services, is that what where we're moving? Clay: Yeah. We've seen.in a law firm that needs to pay folks that are running satchels around town, bicycles.we've seen a restaurant firm that is paying millions of restaurant workers and they want to do it on an inter-roll that doesn't necessarily match to what is available and traditional applications. Again, it's not easy to find these types of applications or enabling technologies, and to my knowledge they're not out there today at all so I can see this range in from big to small. Peter: So, I want to talk about SoFi. Obviously, we know the company really well, we had Anthony Noto on the show last year and you have a partnership with them for quite some time. If you could give some sense of the history of your partnership with SoFi and when you sort of started to think that it could be more than just a commercial relationship. Clay: You know, my first meeting with Anthony Noto, I was impressed with him, he's a great leader, he's got incredible skills, he's an analyst, but as a CEO, he is driven, he's great, he's smart, he's quick on his feet, he's great in front of a group of analysts. So, if you've had him on the show you've seen probably some of those skills come through. You know, he and I hit it off, we share a vision. SoFi is in my view, has been fairly quiet although they raised an incredible amount of money. They, at one point, have raised more money than all of the fintechs combined, you know, $2.5 Billion so, very, very impressive. On the lending side, they have products available through consumer packaged type of approach and the idea was, could we take those products, wrap Galileo's enterprise grade API's around them and make them available out to our clients where we've done really well with the clients on that debit and banking side and provide these lending products in such a way that it's easy to integrate, easy to gain access. That's an exciting opportunity. I think this gives Galileo, you know, several years, a three-year or a five-year head start over anybody that's even thinking about doing anything similar. It takes a long time to build what SoFi has built, it's a really incredible business and very capital intensive. Peter: Yeah, I know and I think..I mean, it's been running for years and, obviously, Anthony hasn't been there since the beginning, but SoFi had built up a machine, particularly when it comes to consumer lending, student loans, student loans re-financing. Clay: Home mortgages. Peter: They invented student loan re-financing, basically, and they're a very impressive company. What you just said there sound like.what you're saying is that a company like Chime, a company like Dave, a company like Revolut may offer lending and it could be powered by SoFi, is that kind of what you're saying? Clay: Right. So, the lending products.the way that I think about SoFi is really as a,,,,yes, they've got a great consumer frontend and a great consumer experience. Galileo powers SoFi Money side of that, but they really have.on the backend they have thisI refer to it as a digital securitization pipeline and it's an incredible business. Anybody that wants to try and rebuild or compete, as you say, has got a lot of work to do to put all of that in place. What we want to do is make that available through our API's. Peter: Right, right. That could be super interesting because, as you say, SoFi.I mean, when you look at sort of the securitization volume in the consumer loan space, in the student loan space, they really have dominated that and it's been really interesting, it will be interesting to see how that really expands. So, I take it then from what you're saying, you didn't run like a full-like acquisition process where you wanted to hear from a bunch of different potential acquirors, is this something that you really justyou started talking with Anthony and the team at SoFi and wow, we really should so something more together. Clay: Right. It was more that latter. There was, definitely, not a process that we ran, timing of the deal was interesting, it all happened from mid-March on, think back to mid-March we were accelerating in the deepest financial trough we've been in, even deeper than the changes immediately preceding the Great Depression. You know, 35% correction in whatever it was, 28 days, beat the Great Depression by two days, in terms of that acceleration, that deceleration, I should say. So, that was kind of the backdrop to all of these. It takes tremendous fortitude on the part really of Anthony and that board to finish the deal. Forbes wrote it up as the first all-virtual deal in history, all of the diligence was done virtually because of the pandemic so there's a lot of notoriety to it in that regard, but, yeah, we were just feeling like we had a shared mission and a shared opportunity here and I'm a big believer in that. There's a role model for this in the industry, you know, you look at Amazon, they've got this great consumer business, right, and AWS is just a tremendous infrastructure business, but one of AWS' biggest clients is actually Netflix which is a big competitor to Amazon on the video on demand side. So, that interesting dynamic is there and we believe will play out and play out well and the receptivity to the combination of SoFi and Galileo has been tremendous. Our clients all greeted this with eagerness because it really provides them opportunity. Peter: So even though, you know SoFi has a number of different products which are directly competitive with many of your clients.obviously, you talked about the Amazon, Netflix example which are obviously directly competitive, so just like that.there hasn't been anyone who's sort of getting nervous about what's this going to mean for us when you're owned by SoFi.it sounds like what you're saying is there's no one that's expressed some hesitation with continuing to do business with you guys? Clay: Yeah, largely what we're seeing is meeting the deal with, you know, open arms, embracing the opportunity. Galileo is committed to be in an independent business, we're ring-fencing the data and data sharing, you know, we're doing that not only from a policy perspective, it's actually.we're putting in place the things that are needed to make sure that our clients..protecting our clients' information, our client information roadmap, strategies, etc. is key to what we do. We already powerI mentioned a few of our clients, but we power competitors today, if you will. So, we're not in the business of sharing that information between one client and other clients, that doesn't serve our or their purpose. SoFi is really no different, we'll, as I've said earlier, make available these products and that's the overall strategy, but having Galileo remain independent, serving the broader financial services industry, serving fintech specifically is absolutely the directive and the mission. Peter: Right, right. So, because obviously SoFi has a range of different products, but is this..what your clients are most interested in, is it the lending access to sort of the lending machine that SoFi has done, or is there something more? Clay: Well, we've got a number of products that are on the roadmap if you think about the SoFi Invest product which is a fee-free fractional share kind of capability of market. You know, Galileo.we intend to make that product available also through our API's. Our expansion, we haven't talked much our expansion into Latin America, we're also expanding into Asia Pacific. We recently purchased a broker dealer there and we will drive, we will power the cash management solution for that, but, in the meanwhile, we'll also go into Hong Kong and provide capabilities to the other 160 fintechs that are there. We're moving into Singapore and into Japan as well and we've had a lot of inbound interest from that region over the last several months and really since the announcement of the SoFi acquisition, so there's a lot that we're doing there and it isn't limited to US lending. We're seeing opportunity that's more global and more expansive than that. Peter: Right. For sure. And so, it sounds like from what you're saying, in a lot of these regions there really isn't a Galileo equivalent, is that what you're finding when you go around the world? Clay: Yeah, very true. We've seen this in Latin America and our move into Latin America. You mentioned Neobank earlier, they had to solve the problem themselves, but as they look to expand outside of Brazil they're looking beyond that. Same thing with Uala as they've looked to expand in Mexico and Colombia, beyond Argentina. If you look at Asia Pacific, there's really no capability there. That's true, let's be honest, despite the success in the UK, I mean look at the infrastructure providers there, they're somewhat limited as well. So, there really is a global opportunity to take these services international. Peter: Okay. So, last question as we wrap up, you talked about international, you talked about Galileo Instant, what's sort of the focus for the next 12 months? Maybe just answer that question open-ended. Clay: Yeah. I think it's two of three things. So, it's focusing on the integration of the lending products, API-based, (garbled) lending products, it's continuing the expansion into Latin America, we've identified beyond Mexico, we've identified six countries, we're moving very quickly right now into Brazil and Colombia, but, right behind that, we'll be in four of these top countries in Latin America. We're also expanding into Asia Pacific now, as I mentioned earlier, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore. So, that's a big part of what we're doing over the next 12 months. In the meanwhile, Galileo Instant will have launched and we've had a lot of interest and excitement around that. Lots of clients have actually already integrated to it and a big launch will come here in the next, call it 30 days, and it's going to be exciting to watch that product begin to emerge as a kind of new way of doing business in fintech. Peter: Well, that'll be interesting to see, we'll be following along. Clay, I very much appreciate your coming on the show today. Clay: Peter, thanks for having me. I really appreciate it. Peter: Okay, see you. Clay: Thank you. Peter: One of the trends that I think is probably the most fascinating right now, and that is this movement towards embedded finance which is. I mentioned that Matt Harris, Bain Capital had those two articles about it late last year and I find it fascinating because really what it comes down to is that Galileo Instant is going to help facilitate this. Any company can offer financial services and any company can offer really pretty customized, exactly to their needs like whether it's 10,000 welders that want to be paid by the weld or whether it's some sort of a bank that has a very specific need. A lot of these things can now happen and so we're going to see fintech continue to expand out into non-finance companies. I think that's going to be the most interesting thing of all where finance will become invisible and I think that's really where we're going, it's going to be all happening this decade. I think it's going to be very exciting and Galileo is certainly going to be a company that is going to help facilitate all that. Anyway on that note, I will sign off. I very much appreciate you listening and I'll catch you next time. Bye.

Think Google mixed with equal parts Amazon, Spotify and Uber and you\u2019re getting close to the sprawling empire that is Yandex\u2014a single, mega-corporation with its hands in everything from search to ecommerce to driverless cars.     But being the crown jewel of Russia\u2019s silicon valley has its drawbacks. The country\u2019s government sees the internet as contested territory amid ever-present tensions with US and other Western interests. As such, it wants influence over how Yandex uses its massive trove of data on Russian citizens. Foreign investors, meanwhile, are more interested in how that data can be turned into growth and profit.     For the September/October issue of MIT Technology Review, Moscow-based journalist Evan Gershkovich explains how Yandex\u2019s ability to walk a highwire between the Kremlin and Wall Street could potentially serve as a kind of template for Big Tech. This week on Deep Tech, he joins our editor-in-chief, Gideon Lichfield, to discuss how, in a world where the debates over regulating Big Tech are intensifying, this isn\u2019t just a Russian story.     Check out more episodes of Deep Tech here.    Show notes and links:     The uneasy coexistence of Yandex and the Kremlin August 19, 2020 Yandex N.V. (YNDX) Q2 2020 Earnings Call Transcript July 28, 2020  Full episode transcript:      Gideon Lichfield: Imagine a world where Google, Amazon, Spotify, and Uber are all one company. Everything from your morning news, music, and groceries, to your taxi home at night all delivered and operated by a single mega-corporation. Well, head over to Russia and you\u2019ll find that world is very much a reality.     Anchor for Bloomberg News:  If you thought LinkedIn was hot, wait until you get a load of Yandex. The Russian search engine company raised $1.3 billion in an IPO yesterday here in the United States on NASDAQ. And at $25 the stock is valued twice as high on a price-to-earning basis as Google.    Anchor for Bloomberg News:  What is the big attraction about Yandex? Why are investors so enthusiastic about this?    Reporter for Bloomberg News : The answer is pretty simple. It\u2019s just growth, growth, growth.    Gideon Lichfield: Yandex is the crown jewel of Russia\u2019s Silicon Valley. It has its hands in everything from search to autonomous vehicles. It even got an extra boost from the coronavirus pandemic. Revenue for the company\u2019s delivery apps grew 42% in the second quarter of this year.     But that success comes at a price. Russia has long-viewed the internet as a battleground in its escalating tensions with the West.     And some of Russia\u2019s power-brokers think Yandex is under too much foreign influence. They want Russia to have ultimate control of the massive amounts of data that tech companies hold on Russian citizens.    That means Yandex periodically gets caught between the demands of the Kremlin and of the foreign investors who hold most of its stock. But as we\u2019ll see today, in a world where the debates over how to regulate Big Tech are intensifying, this isn\u2019t just the Russian story.     Today, I\u2019m talking to Evan Gershkovich, a journalist for the Moscow Times. He wrote a story in our latest issue\u2014the techno-nationalism issue\u2014about Yandex\u2019s balancing act, and how it might be seen as a kind of template for tech companies in the rest of the world.    I\u2019m Gideon Lichfield, editor-in-chief of MIT Technology Review, and this is Deep Tech.     So Evan, when I lived in Moscow 15 years ago, people were already using Yandex Search and Yandex Maps and Yandex Translate, but it seems to have become way, way bigger since then. Can you give us a sense of how important it is?     Evan Gershkovich:  Yandex started expanding very much in the way that Google did over the years, starting from just a search engine to becoming a service that provided\u2026or a company that provided a variety of different services. And now when you live in Moscow, 15 years later, So many services are connected to this company from ordering food to ride sharing services, to figuring out what movies you\u2019re going to watch.    And this year during the coronavirus crisis when Moscow was under lockdown, Yandex really became this sort of all-encompassing company because people relied on its taxi service and people also used its food delivery services to ensure they weren\u2019t going to the supermarket so much. So it really became this sort of dominant presence in our lives here.    Gideon Lichfield: How did Yandex get to be so totally dominant in, in a way that not even Google is in the West? How does it beat out the competition?     Evan Gershkovich: What the company will tell you when you ask them this question is that it\u2019s through this diversification. About 10 years ago, around 2012, 2013, the company decided to start diversifying way beyond just the search and the maps, like you had mentioned. If you look at, you know, their movie recommending service, or if you look at their website that they have where you can buy cars or Navigator, they all have a competitor in Russia. So they don\u2019t dominate every single industry fully, but they are pretty much everywhere. And in this way, you just, you know, anything you try to do online in Russia, Yandex comes up as a very plausible tool that you would use.    Gideon Lichfield: There\u2019s this phenomenon in China, where the government went out of its way to help local tech giants beat out foreign competition. And one of the big things there, of course, is that the local firms are willing to cooperate with surveillance and censorship in a way that Google isn\u2019t, for example. But in Russia, Yandex didn\u2019t really have that sort of help, did it? It just kind of grew by itself.     Evan Gershkovich: Yeah, absolutely. For years the Kremlin and other state security services didn\u2019t really pay attention to the internet all that much. They were, the authorities here and Russia, were quite slow to coming around to the idea that this was an area that they should pay attention to. And this could be paradoxical or sound odd to a Western audience, but for years, Russia\u2019s internet was really the freest internet or.. one of the freest internets that there was in the world. So Yandex, which started in 97\u2019 and grew in the early aughts and through the 2010s, at that point, really, it wasn\u2019t touched. And so it was free to develop how it wanted to.     Gideon Lichfield: And when did this mentality of the Kremlin start to change? When did they start to think that a company as powerful as Yandex was going to be a problem?    Evan Gershkovich: One of the first moments was in 2008 when Russia fought a five day war with Georgia.     Anchor for CBS News:  Columns of Russian tanks and troops rolled into the American-backed former sovietrepublic of Georgia today after a nighttime barrage of artillery fire and rockets. Georgia said it was trying to retake control of south Ossetia; the breakaway province on Russia\u2019s border that\u2019s policed by Russian peacekeepers. Claiming more than 10 of its soldiers were killed in the night attack, Moscow said it would retaliate.     Evan Gershkovich: One of Yandex\u2019s services is called Yandex News, it\u2019s a sort of a news aggregator very similar to Google News. And at that point Russian media was much more diversified. There was many more independent and liberal outlets. And so Yandex\u2019s aggregator was picking up liberal and independent media news about the war and putting it in its feed and that really upset the Kremlin, which wanted its viewpoint to be highlighted.    Several years later when the Arab Spring swept across the Middle East in 2011, and then protests kicked off in Moscow against Vladimir Putin\u2019s rule in Russia a few months later, that also was really sort of this moment where the Kremlin saw the internet specifically as an arena that could be influential. Because all those protests in the Arab Spring and then in Moscow were organized through Facebook and similar social media tools.    Anchor for CBS News: There was more political unrest tonight throughout Russia. The largest crowds in two decades have come out to protest what they\u2019re calling corruption by the government.     Anchor for CBS News: Tens of thousands packed the streets of Moscow in the biggest Anti-government demonstrations the country has seen for 20 years. They shouted \u201cPutin is a Thief\u201d and \u201cRussia without Putin.\u201d     Evan Gershkovich: The Kremlin realized what power that the internet actually could have. So in both the war three years earlier in 2008, and then in 2011 during these mass protests, it started to sort of realize that this was an arena that it would if not control, at least pay close attention to.    Gideon Lichfield: And what kind of pressure did it start to put on Yandex?    Evan Gershkovich: So one of the first moments of pressure that Yandex actually faced was a potential takeover by Kremlin-linked oligarch Alisher Usmanov. He lobbied for the Kremlin support on national security grounds to take over the company. And a year later, in 2009, Yandex handed Russia\u2019s largest lender, the state owned Sberbank a so-called \u201cgolden share,\u201d which allowed the bank to veto transactions involving more than a quarter of Yandex\u2019s stock. And this was essentially meant to satisfy the Kremlin that if there were any transactions the authorities weren\u2019t happy with, they would be able to step in and limit them.     Gideon Lichfield: And what\u2019s been going on in the years since then?    Evan Gershkovich: So for about a decade this sort of golden-share arrangement seemed to satisfy the Kremlin and interest in Yandex pretty much waxed and waned. It was sort of left to its own devices until the fall of 2018 when rumors surfaced that Sberbank was now hoping to buy a 30% stake in Yandex to protect it from so-called \u201cpotential trouble.\u201d That morning in New York, when trading opened up // the company lost a billion dollars in market value over these worries.    Gideon Lichfield: Now How much leverage do you think Yandex has? It\u2019s one of Russia\u2019s biggest companies. It\u2019s majority owned by foreign investors. And obviously if Russia clips its wings, its share price would take a huge hit. Does that matter, do you think, to the authorities?    Evan Gershkovich: To the authorities, it seems like, not so much. Often it makes these decisions out of purely, you know, their own interests. But when there were these rumors that we spoke about, about Sberbank buying a 30% share in Yandex, it really appeared to be that that was coming from the Kremlin saying, you know, we have to sort of rein in Yandex.     And Yandex solved that with what seems to be a really neat solution. It took about a year, but they changed that golden-share, that veto power over major transactions into what they called the Public Interest Foundation. And this foundation has 11 seats on its board. Three belong to Yandex. And the other eight are divided up among influential business groups and state-affiliated universities. And this structure now has that veto power that used to be with Sberbank.     Gideon Lichfield: It seems like the Kremlin\u2019s policy towards Yandex varies a lot. Sometimes it\u2019s really concerned about foreign influence. Sometimes it just sort of lets it go. Why is there this inconsistency?     Evan Gershkovich: So we\u2019ve been speaking so far about the Kremlin as this sort of single entity. But to understand power in Russia, you need to understand more than just the Kremlin. The authorities are actually made up of these various rival groups. And there\u2019s a specific constituency that\u2019s known in Russian as the siloviki . These are officials with ties to law enforcement.     These are basically hardliners who are very protective of the regime and they aim to control all facets of society. Including the internet, which in recent years as conflict with the West has renewed, it\u2019s become one of these arenas they very much wanted to control. And Yandex for its part as this major tech company  in Russia has gotten caught up in the middle of that process.      And this is something I actually talked about with Tatiana Stanovaya, who is the founder of Russian political analysis site R.Politik. From her perspective, she says that for the siloviki , the Yandex foundation was seen as a half-victory.

Tate Ryan-Mosley: After very lengthy negotiations they settled on the idea of a public interest foundation. It\u2019s a half-measure. The logic behind it\u2026 was that, on one hand,\u2026 there were the siloviki, who thought Yandex should become a Russian company. Volozh , the CEO, should quit, there should be a change of ownership, and the company should be registered in Russia and carry out all its operations in Russia, and its main interests should all be here.  Tate Ryan-Mosley: And on the other hand you have the liberals in the government. They thought that the solution the siloviki proposed would be catastrophic for the Russian markets. So there was a compromise that neither group would get its way with the company. This public interest foundation is basically a buffer.    Evan Gershkovich: Tatiana says that the Public Interest Foundation has three main functions. The first is to block deals that would concentrate more than 10% of Yandex\u2019s stock under a single owner. The second is to control operations involving intellectual property. And third, and this is another sensitive subject for the siloviki involves control of personal data.

Tate Ryan-Mosley: So in this way, the foundation was supposed to somewhat mitigate the worries of the siloviki. But to them it\u2019s not a solution to the problem. To them it\u2019s more like a forced surrender\u2026 Meaning, Yandex has not become a Russian company, and for today the question is off the table, but that doesn\u2019t mean it couldn\u2019t come up tomorrow. And I think that the security establishment of the Russian elite could find a pretext, maybe not now but in the next few years, to revise this arrangement. We\u2019ll see.   Gideon Lichfield: So where we are today is that Russia is talking about much tighter constraints on the internet. Talk to us a bit about what\u2019s been happening there.    Evan Gershkovich: So in recent years, Russia has passed two key laws that have affected internet companies. The first one requires them to store data on servers in Russia and not anywhere abroad. And the second law is this notorious, so-called Sovereign Internet Law. This means that a state owned communications infrastructure would be created, that would allow the country to cut itself off from the global internet. What this means is that there would be a sort of a bubble of sorts of Russian own services that would create an internet that would only be Russian. And from the Kremlin\u2019s perspective, what it sees through the sovereign internet would be a way to control what its citizens can see online.     Gideon Lichfield: So it sounds like Russia is going for something much closer to China\u2019s model of the internet, where tech platforms can really only operate if they\u2019re friendly to the government?     Evan Gershkovich: Yes and no simultaneously. So yes, in that it\u2019s attempting to, but one of the main things in recent years has been the fact that a lot of these ventures haven\u2019t really succeeded.     One of the key moments in the past few years was when Russia tried to block a popular messenger app here called Telegram. And for about a year, it stated that that app was blocked. All the while, authorities kept using it themselves, including state media channels and even the Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov used it himself to communicate with foreign journalists.    So it became the sort of farcical, absurdist thing where the country said this technological service was blocked\u2014but it wasn\u2019t able to block it. And a year and a half later, it just announced \u201cyou know what? It\u2019s no longer blocked.\u201d So with the sovereign internet it does remain to be seen whether this is something that Russia is actually able to pull off. And so while it may want to be China in this sort of way, it sometimes falls short.    Gideon Lichfield: What would it mean for a company like Yandex if the Sovereign Internet Law really goes fully into effect?    Evan Gershkovich: It would be massive. Yandex has been hoping to expand its business beyond Russia\u2019s borders for a long time. It hasn\u2019t been incredibly successful at that, but there are some ways that it\u2019s been you know, reaching out beyond Russia recently. Its driverless car program has been piloted in Detroit and in Las Vegas and in Israel. The more Russia tries to cut off from the global internet, the more that would hamper a company like Yandex\u2014which is hoping to be not just Russian, but global.    Gideon Lichfield: So this at one level seems like a very specifically Russian story. There\u2019s this big company. It dominates practically every area of its industry. It\u2019s in this cozy, but tense relationship with the Kremlin. It\u2019s had to make some concessions. And yet at the end of your piece, you argue that this relationship with the government is something that Western tech companies might have to start emulating.    Evan Gershkovich: Right. Even, you know, companies like Google and Facebook have started coming under pressure namely for what\u2019s seen as their opaque content moderation processes. And this year, Facebook, in response to that, created this so-called oversight board. It\u2019s similar to how Yandex\u2019s Public Interest Foundation has universities and big companies that are part of it. Facebook\u2019s oversight board has legal and human rights luminaries who are able to review and overturn some of the platform\u2019s decisions.    So this is sort of like a small scale version of what Yandex\u2019s Public Interest Foundation is. And it may sort of foretell you know not just the sorts of demands that a company like Google and Facebook may face going forward, but the solutions that they might come up with to retain some sort of independence in the way that Yandex has here in Russia.      Gideon Lichfield: That\u2019s it for this episode of Deep Tech. This is a podcast just for subscribers of MIT Technology Review, to bring alive the issues our journalists are thinking and writing about.    You\u2019ll find Evan Gershkovich\u2019s article \u201cYandex\u2019s balancing act\u201d in the September issue of the magazine.    Before we go, I want to quickly tell you about EmTech MIT, which runs from October 19th through the 22nd. It\u2019s our flagship annual conference on the most exciting trends in emerging technology.     This year, it\u2019s all about how we can build technology that meets the biggest challenges facing humanity, from climate change and racial inequality to pandemics and cybercrime.     Our speakers include the CEOs of Salesforce and Alphabet X, the CTOs of Facebook and Twitter, the head of cybersecurity at the National Security Agency, the head of vaccine research at Eli Lilly, and many others. And because of the pandemic, it\u2019s an online event, which means it\u2019s both much cheaper than in previous years and much, much easier to get to.    You can find out more and reserve your spot by visiting EmTechMIT.com \u2013 that\u2019s E-M\u2026T-E-C-H\u2026M-I-T dot com \u2013 and use the code DeepTech50 for $50 off your ticket. Again, that\u2019s EmTechMIT.com with the discount code DeepTech50.     Deep Tech is written and produced by Anthony Green and edited by Jennifer Strong and Michael Reilly. I\u2019m Gideon Lichfield.

That could result in significant implications for the industry at a time when whispers of breaking up big tech are circulating, once gain.</p><p>The U.S. state attorneys general investigating Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google for potential antitrust violations are looking to push for the breakup of its ad technology business, CNBC reported on Friday, citing sources.</p><p>In March, Morningstar predicted that excessive fines and stifling regulations could hurt the value of Google and Facebook by as much as 15% and 11% respectively.</p><p>While social media companies have not seen investors hit the brakes just yet, the next few weeks, and months could be fraught with uncertainty.</p><p>A Congressional report on big tech expected to be released later this month and the upcoming November election could set the stage for a summer 'techlash' that will see social media companies on trial.</p><p>The Bull Case</p><p>Friday's trading session is an opportune moment to argue the case for social media stocks. The Nasdaq's record intraday high did a more eloquent job than I could, despite the late decline.</p><p>Laugh at the \"rising tide lifting all boats\" clich&amp;eacute;, but respect the Federal Reserve's ability to push the major indexes up to where they were before the Covid-19 lockdowns is clear.</p><p>Twitter closed 3% higher, Facebook finished the day 2% up and Snap ended up 5.6%.</p><p>But let's not ignore the cloud of government regulation hovering over those stocks. Trump's vow to remove the Article 230 provision, where social media companies can be held liable for content on their platforms.</p><p>That's been happening since last year. Is there any reason to think that the president will be more effective?</p><p>Breaking down the major public social media companies, only Twitter stands out.</p><p>If you were bullish on Snap before, you should be bullish on Snap again.</p><p>As soon as the company decided it would not promote the president's tweets, Trump threw accusations that the company acted \"illegally\" to rig the \"2020 election\"</p><p>But the administration has supplied no more on the subject.</p><p>If you're long SNAP, watch Kylie Jenner still, not the White House.</p><p>Moving on to Facebook, that's another easy one to be bullish. CEO Mark Zuckerberg bends with the wind. He never met a controversy he couldn't avoid and he called Trump to give the president support.</p><p>Any new legislation will favor Facebook.</p><p>That leaves Twitter, which decided to do to the president slightly less than it does to those who violate its terms of service.</p><p>Investors should agree the Twitter is adjusting to market forces. So many companies have now said they support the recent protests.</p><p>Fox CEO Lachlain Murdoch, no less, had this to say to his employees:</p><p>\"This is time to the time for people to come together in their grief, work to heal, and coalesce to address\".</p><p><br/>Investing.com offers an extensive set of professional tools for the financial markets.<br/>Read more News on Investing.com and download the new Investing.com apps for Android and iOS!</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOREN-176335932</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOREN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:602S-KXG1-JDJN-6278-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399231</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"821\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fusion Media Limited Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

Governments must act: any delay to act could put another generation in danger.</p><p>Javed Khan Chief executive, Barnardo's Where were the adults? Niall Ferguson talks of \"emocracy\" being driven by social media (Comment, last week), but why were schoolboys from Covington taken to attend a sociopolitically charged rally at all, much less in such a location as the Lincoln Memorial in Washington? What planning was done to reduce the risk of the schoolboys being exposed to adults campaigning on other issues there? Was there any reiteration of school policy with regard to decorum, or any specific edict about the emotiveness of wearing Make America Great Again hats in such an environment? Where were the responsible adult chaperones? Michele Savage Terenure, Dublin 6W Blank canvas I went along to support the young people in Theatre 57, who are the future of arts in Galway (\"Culture shock for Galway 2020\", News, last week). Galway is great for running festivals and promoting street events by the likes of Macnas, but is an absolute \"dead zone\" in terms of its lack of provision for art to be displayed or performed. There is no public art gallery, no school of music, and no large concert venue. Wexford and Castlebar do it better. Derrick Hambleton Kingston, Galway Bono's tiny taxes The gargantuan ego of pintsized pop singer Bono knows no bounds (Quotes of the Week, last week). He was in Davos with taoiseach Leo Varadkar extolling the virtues of capitalism. It's no wonder he loves it, since his band U2 have availed of just about every tax scheme available over the years.</p><p>Mark O'Higgins, Dublin 8 Fragile lives Your articles about Queen Anne, one of the subjects of the film The Favourite, and the tragedy of her miscarriages and the deaths of her children, reminds us of the fragility of life (Culture, last week).</p><p>Our existence is far more vulnerable to health issues than we seem to realise. While we are aware of major problems such as the black death and Aids, we have little recognition about less calamitous events and the personal tragedies arising.</p><p>On this small island we have 17 place names that are variations on tamhlacht - plague grave. Antoine \u00d3 Reachtabhra, one of the great poets in the Irish language, was blinded by smallpox in childhood and folklore has it that the last sight he remembered was of his eight siblings laid out dead on the floor of his family's cabin, all having succumbed. P\u00e1draig Ua Briain Baile an Chabh\u00e1in Irreplaceable McIlvanney Thank you for the tributes to the late Hugh McIlvanney (News Review and Sport, last week). His sports writing was a joy and I followed him for more than 50 years. It was his knowledge of boxing that was so very impressive to me.</p><p>Whenever there was a big fight, McIlvanney would be there, filing two dispatches: a preview on the Sunday before and a report the next week, usually the day after the contest. He called the fight in the first dispatch and his assessments were uncanny. If he got one wrong it must have been when I was on holiday. You could put your house on his prediction - and Hugh probably did. Irreplaceable. Paul Collins East Grinstead, West Sussex Pained expression I was initially sympathetic reading Rob McGibbon's \"How it feels to <url normalizedValue=\"http://www....be\">www....be</url> a secret gout sufferer\" (Magazine, last week). This evaporated when, complaining about how non-sufferers make light of his affliction, he wrote: \"It's not the achy stuff that makes old folk grumble.\" He himself was making light of arthritis, a bane for millions in every age bracket.

Strict travel restrictions were imposed and non-essential economic activity was curtailed, resulting in an almost unprecedented contraction in global GDP. US unemployment reached a record 14.7% in April, while analysts predicted that the US economy could shrink 30% annualised in Q2 - the largest quarterly contraction since the Great Depression. Thankfully, and in stark contrast to that earlier period, policymakers acted swiftly with massive monetary and fiscal stimulus, together with emergency legislation to support the economy and financial system. Where early efforts did not have the desired effect - such as the 50bp US interest rate cut and $700bn QE programme in early March - policymakers simply delivered more stimulus in order to prevent a cashflow crunch from developing into a financial crisis. In the US, this saw the Fed cut rates by 150bps and introduce unlimited QE while in Europe, the ECB launched its own EUR750bn programme. </p><p>Governments have been equally forthcoming; in the US, the planned fiscal stimulus was $2.6trn (more than 10% of GDP) while total announced German aid was equivalent to c.60% of 2019 GDP. This support, together with the tentative reopening of certain European economies, saw markets rally into our financial year end as focus shifted towards the perceived duration of the downturn, rather than its depth.<br/>   Record gains for US stocks during April (the S&amp;P rallying more than 11% in local terms, its best month since 1987) proved a fitting end to another year of US exceptionalism. While most markets registered total returns between 0 and -11% in Sterling terms, the S&amp;P 500 delivered +4.5% with much of the divergence explained by the outperformance of the technology sector (and more broadly, growth over value) as investors gravitated towards stocks able to deliver growth against a more uncertain economic backdrop and during the final third of the year, sectors perceived to win (or lose less) from COVID-19 disruption.<br/>   TECHNOLOGY REVIEW<br/>   The technology sector enjoyed an outstanding year of absolute and relative returns with our benchmark, the Dow Jones World Technology index, advancing 18.1% in Sterling terms. Technology outperformance was at odds with weakening sector fundamentals as IT spending increased by only 0.4% y/y during 2019, while sector revenues and earnings grew just 2.8% and 0.8% y/y respectively. However, this obscured the growing divergence between next-generation and legacy companies, as well as the impact of negative earnings from cyclical subsectors. However, it was painfully apparent at the sector level with the performance of software (+23%) and semiconductors (+20%) in contrast to hardware (-3%) and networking (-11%). Regional performance was also bifurcated with US large-caps, as measured by the Russell 1000 technology index, delivering almost twice the returns (+21%) of the Dow Jones World Technology ex US index (+11.5%). The final months of our year proved a boon for the sector as stay at home / social distancing acted as a massive accelerant to a number of key secular themes.<br/>   Next-generation software and payments stocks continued to deliver exceptional growth during the year, although strong share price performance was punctuated by an arguably overdue period of valuation compression between July and December reflecting profit-taking, higher bond yields and the debacle at WeWork which caused a scare in long duration assets. Despite this, the digital transformation imperative continued to drive demand for a plethora of SaaS (software as a service) solutions including unified communications (UCaaS), workflow automation, collaboration and real-time monitoring. Microsoft continued to execute flawlessly, solidifying its status as a new cycle winner. While strategic M&amp;A slowed during the year, private equity interest remained robust with Sophos, LogMeIn, Instructure and Cision all acquired by financial buyers which buttressed software valuations. Payment stocks enjoyed a solid year, with Visa (+13%) and Mastercard (+12%) benefitting from the transition from cash to card as well as eCommerce-related growth.<br/>   The semiconductor sector suffered its first cyclical correction this cycle during 2019, declining 12%, although excluding memory (where pricing was weak) the contraction was c.2%. There were pockets of strength including CMOS image sensors, MEMS microphones and microprocessors (due to hyperscale capex and a PC refresh cycle), but the most significant development during the year was the permanent bifurcation of the global semiconductor supply chain discussed in the outlook section. Hopes for a trade deal, together with excitement around 5G and a better 2020 saw semiconductor stocks post some of the strongest returns driven almost entirely by multiple expansion.<br/>   5G related excitement and trade deal hope also helped Apple (+54%) enjoy a remarkable year following its January 2019 profit warning, its first in over a decade. During the year, the stock benefited from a massive re-rating due to a number of positive developments including stabilisation of smartphone supply chain data, a better than expected iPhone 11 launch and continued growth and focus on its services business. In addition, Apple's accessories business posted strong growth, driven by AirPods (Bluetooth wireless earbuds) that became mainstream with c.60m sold during 2019. In addition, investors began to focus on prospects for a significant iPhone replacement cycle in 2020 driven by the expected introduction of 5G handsets.<br/>   Internet stocks experienced a mixed year with returns for most of the year in stark contrast with robust fundamentals. Regulatory risk became a reality as both the Department of Justice (DoJ) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced formal antitrust investigations of the leading Internet platforms in June. In the same month, Senator Elizabeth Warren - at the time a leading contender for the Democrat nomination - raised the spectre of \"breaking up Big Tech\" if she became President while in August, France passed a 3% digital tax on sales for large Internet companies. Despite these adverse developments, fundamentals at the leading platforms remained strong, evidenced by online advertising which grew 16% y/y in 2019. E-commerce trends also remained strong; Alibaba's Singles Day event saw gross merchandise value (GMV) increase 26% y/y while in the US, Black Friday online sales grew c.20% y/y. Fundamentals and stock prices converged during the final (coronavirus) phase of the year as the Internet subsector proved one of the greatest beneficiaries of stay at home / social distancing orders.<br/>   PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE<br/>   Our total return performance came in modestly ahead of our benchmark, our own net asset value (NAV) per share rising 18.6% during the year versus a 18.1% gain in the Sterling-adjusted benchmark. In the US, the most significant positive contribution to performance was made once again by AMD (+96%) as the company continued to execute on its product roadmaps, achieving its highest server CPU market share since 2013. In addition, the portfolio benefited from its overweight exposure to SaaS companies which delivered strong growth against a more challenging economic backdrop. Strongest performance was reserved for those with solutions that helped facilitate work from home (WFH) such as RingCentral (+104%), Everbridge (+56%) and Five9 (+54%).<br/>   The need to support remote workers also benefited next-generation security companies such as Cloudflare (+39%) and CrowdStrike (+32%) while social distancing measures helped the likes of Amazon (+33%), HelloFresh (+84%), PayPal (+20%) and Netflix (+18%). Stock selection was positive across all major regions and nearly all marketcapitalisation tiers with the exception of small-caps, which accounted for &lt;2% of the portfolio. Relative performance was also positively impacted by underweight/zero positions in a number of index constituents including Cisco, Broadcom, SAP, Oracle and DXC Technology which struggled with cloud migration, cyclical sensitivity and/or leverage. The portfolio also benefited directly from one corporate action following the purchase of Tableau Software by Salesforce.com at a 42% premium. This, together with a number of private equity transactions helped support software valuations during the year.<br/>   In terms of negatives, the most significant detractors were our large but still underweight positions in both Apple (+54%) and Microsoft (+44%). Apple enjoyed a banner year driven by AirPods, services and a better than expected iPhone 11 launch while Microsoft benefited from Office365 and Azure growth, with remote work driving rapid adoption of Teams, its unified communication and collaboration platform. In addition, a number of 2019 IPOs such as Pinterest (-31%) and Uber (-37%) performed poorly as a result of inconsistent growth and a loss of investor appetite for long-duration assets. Relative performance was also hindered by a number of other individual stock moves due to disappointing earnings progress and/or valuation deratings such as Arista Networks, 8x8 and Pagseguro Digital. Finally, our cash position (which averaged 5.5%) also detracted from performance in what ended up being another strong year for technology stocks. However, this drag was almost entirely offset during the period of market turbulence by strong gains in our NASDAQ put options that contributed nearly 100bps to portfolio performance. During the year, there was a significant divergence between large (+21%) and small-cap (-3%) US technology stocks as measured by the Russell 1000 and 2000 technology indices.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELECT-6335569311RN20200714</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELECT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60BV-D4W1-F0CC-S26H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">335987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1649\"/><timeReceived>7:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 London Stock Exchange All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>London Stock Exchange Aggregated Regulatory News Service (ARNS)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"44026\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 14, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Online travel -a vertical we had avoided due to its relative maturity - has been ravaged by the lockdown. Both Booking.com (not held) and Airbnb (private) have seen revenues decline by c.85% y/y with \"minimal\" evidence of recovery thus far according to Mastercard May travel volumes. Faced with an \"existential struggle\", travel companies have tapped capital markets to shore up balance sheets while valuations have plunged. This includes former darling Airbnb said to have recently raised money at a $18bn valuation having been expected to be worth $42bn at IPO this year. Weaker travel trends have also significantly hurt ride-share companies such as Uber and Lyft, delaying Uber's timeline to profitability while both companies have announced large workforce reductions. Data from reopened markets suggest that any travel recovery will be gradual and likely to involve different consumption habits (e.g. more domestic travel via car) until confidence is fully restored and/or a vaccine is found. We continue to sport large absolute positions in flagship e-commerce companies Alibaba and Amazon augmented with smaller holdings. These include those held before the crisis - Ocado, Meituan Dianping, Peloton and Uber as well as new purchases such as Autotrader, TripAdvisor and Zalando.</p><p><br/>   We have also added exposure to media content with the lockdown accelerating adoption of streaming video and music. Intensifying OTT competition that dominated the headlines in 2019 was soon forgotten as video streaming \"became everyone's favourite pastime during quarantine\". Consumers streamed 13.2bn hours in Q1'20, an increase of 49% y/y while Netflix added 15.8m subscribers in Q2, well ahead of the 11m expected by the Street. Having won the attention of Generation Z, short-form video has captured the zeitgeist of the lockdown with Tik Tok (owned by China's ByteDance) experiencing more than 200m downloads during Q1'20 with weekly average usage reaching 6 hours per week. In contrast, prime-time TV viewing fell 18% y/y among 18-34-year olds between March and April suggesting that 'cord-cutting' is accelerating. The pandemic has also exploded the myth that video is a 'winner takes all' market with the second wave of<br/>   competition arguably accelerating the demise of linear TV.<br/>   The same might also be said for music with stay-at-home orders leading to a surge in listening hours which, according to Sonos, increased 48% y/y in April while Spotify added 10m premium subscribers during Q1, taking its total to 130m. We continue to gain media exposure via mediumsized positions in both Netflix and Spotify and via Alphabet, which owns YouTube.<br/>   Unsurprisingly, the outlook for online advertising is less positive reflecting the slowdown in overall consumer spending, especially within the travel vertical. However, declines have been shallower than feared to date, aided by relative strength in direct response advertising (echoing the shift to ecommerce) and significantly higher usage of social media and messaging platforms. At Facebook, monthly active users (MAUs) across its 'family of apps' reached 3bn for the first time in March while in countries hardest hit by the virus, messaging and voice/video calling increased by more than 50% and 100% respectively. Soaring usage allowed advertisers to achieve higher ROIs and Facebook to deliver constant currency (cc) revenue growth of 19% y/y. Alphabet (Google) also performed better than feared with constant currency revenue growth of 15% y/y, aided by search usage which at its peak was four times the peak of Super Bowl search activity.<br/>   The resilience of both platforms highlighted how under-monetised they are now that millions of companies need to find customers online. At Facebook, there are 140m small businesses using free tools but only 8m that currently advertise on the platform. Without a similar surfeit of would-be advertisers, smaller platforms like Pinterest and Twitter struggled to monetise strong engagement trends. While we expect the advertising outlook to remain highly uncertain, we have been pleasantly surprised by relative strength at Facebook and Google and have added back to each, as well as to Tencent, the leading social networking platform in China. We are also excited about the potential of so-called social commerce as social networks move away from lead generation towards the final transaction, a trend likely accelerated by COVID-19.<br/>   While the pandemic has benefited the Internet subsector, we remain alive to the regulatory risks that could yet overshadow robust fundamentals. These risks relate to a number of different areas such as data protection, with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) the latest attempt to strengthen consumer rights relating to data collection. While this may (like GDPR) again benefit the platforms with the largest daily audiences at the expense of smaller players, antitrust risk is aimed squarely at the internet giants. This risk took shape in July 2019 when the DoJ formally announced it had opened a broad antitrust review of market-leading online platforms while Facebook later revealed that the FTC had launched a similar investigation into the company in June. Potential implications range from fines, new regulations on business practices or a breakup in a worst-case scenario, although this outcome appears less likely now with Biden as Democratic candidate for President. A series of long and drawn out inquiries look inevitable. Higher taxes represent another risk with the OECD having proposed a new international corporate tax system in October in order to prevent countries such as France and the UK unilaterally applying digital sales taxes. Finally, labour laws that tighten the definition of independent contractor, such as the California Assembly Bill 5 (AB5) legislation which went into effect on 1 January 2020 may threaten the \"two-way flexibility\" essential to the so-called Gig Economy.<br/>   We remain relatively sanguine about most of these risks. While the 'second Gilded Age' argument was always beguiling, it is fallacious to simply compare the market shares enjoyed by Google today with Standard Oil in the early 1880s, a view strongly supported by the current crisis. Not only have the large technology platforms greatly ameliorated the impact of COVID-19, but many have done everything possible to avoid profiting from it. In Q2, Amazon prioritised lower margin 'essential' products while reinvesting all of its operating income on COVID-19 related costs, including higher wages, PPE and testing capabilities. Likewise, Google Classroom - a free educational tool - was used by 100m students and educators in March. Even as the munificence of technology companies fades in the minds of policymakers, the crisis has revealed how network effects can quickly create natural monopolies by design or otherwise. Should Google be applauded for helping to keep schools open, or castigated for competing unfairly with free products? Likewise, will Zoom be investigated in years to come for offering free videoconferencing to hundreds of millions of people during the crisis? After two furious decades that have seen the internet radically rewire our societies, we may be overdue a period of consolidation and some recalibration. But this will not be easy for policymakers to deliver, particularly as the US internet giants represent the vanguard of American efforts to stay ahead of the Chinese in any potential 'technological cold war'. They may have to settle for higher taxes.<br/>   The crisis is likely to represent a turning point for the payments industry, accelerating secular trends in banking and digital payments at the expense of cash and incumbents. While previous crises have typically resulted in people hoarding cash, COVID-19 has seen consumers and businesses eschew it and the physical contact it requires. In the UK, cash usage halved in just a few days during March replaced by safer and quicker contactless payments that now account for nearly half of all in-store transactions between GBP30-50. The rapid adoption of e-commerce has also been hugely beneficial, with Adyen (not held) posting a 34% surge in Q1 revenue while PayPal saw payment volumes increase by more than 20% y/y during April. Greater use of digital services and fintech alternatives have also led consumers to reappraise their relationship with banks. Over time, this could leave traditional banks as 'dumb balance sheets', fit only to provide capital via a customer relationship owned by the fintech companies..<br/>   The recent inclusion of Square, PayPal and other non-bank finance companies in disbursing rescue loans for small businesses is testament to their unparalleled reach and speed, Square Capital was able to get a loan to a business in under 24 hours. Square has also experienced skyrocketing demand for its peer to peer payment app such that the term Cash App is now included in more than 2000 hip hops songs! However, COVID-19 has been far from unequivocally positive, hurting remittance and cross-border volumes (an important profit pool for the payment networks) and reducing overall spending. It may also accelerate the arrival of new competition in the form of 'big tech' with their large and engaged users bases and strong technology capabilities. Despite this, we remain excited about payment pure plays, our enthusiasm moderated only by elevated valuations that already embed some of the post pandemic opportunity. We currently hold PayPal, Mastercard, Visa, and Square while our positions in Tencent and Alibaba provide exposure to the two most important Chinese mobile payment assets, WeChat Pay and AliPay.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELECT-6335573315RN20200714</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELECT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60BV-D4W1-F0CC-S26N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">335987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1618\"/><timeReceived>7:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 London Stock Exchange All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>London Stock Exchange Aggregated Regulatory News Service (ARNS)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"44026\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 14, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In June, the US Federal government announced it was stepping up scrutiny of big technology companies with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission said to have struck a deal to divide oversight of Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet (Google) and Apple. In the same month, Senator Elizabeth Warren - a leading candidate in the race to win the Democrat nomination - further raised the ante when she announced she would \"break up big tech\" if she became President. In addition, Apple lost a Supreme Court ruling that will allow antitrust lawsuits against the App Store to proceed, while in August France passed a 3% digital tax on sales for large internet companies. Despite these adverse developments and headline risk, fundamentals at the leading platforms remained strong. </p><p>Google and Facebook both delivered impressive top-line growth, while Facebook added two million daily active users in Q3 in both the US and Europe, once again confounding engagement concerns. Deceleration at AWS and the decision to invest in free one-day shipping as the default to all Prime customers saw Amazon shares trail its peers. We have significantly reduced our Amazon holding, and in the summer trimmed our already underweight positions in Alphabet and Facebook on the regulatory developments. However, we have retained significant but smaller positions in both as their valuations remain compelling relative to their growth, which suggests that negative outcomes are at least partially priced in.<br/>   Next-generation software and payment stocks continued to deliver exceptional growth, but this was more than offset by an arguably overdue period of valuation compression, potentially triggered by limited evidence of macroeconomic uncertainty impacting earnings progress, while disappointing progress at Uber and the debacle at WeWork weighed on investor appetite for growth stocks. Having reduced our software exposure earlier in the year, we exited several more of our highfliers before beginning to modestly rebuild our sector exposure towards the end of the half year. A weaker than normal Q2 from PayPal hindered payment stocks which, like software, were also hampered by the rotation away from growth. Enterprise incumbents mostly struggled, as the shift towards the cloud continued to negatively impact organic growth at legacy vendors such as IBM and Oracle, as well as a number of IT services/outsourcing companies, including Cognizant and DXC Technologies.<br/>   Portfolio performance<br/>   Our total return performance came in below our benchmark, with the net asset value per share rising 2% during the first half of the year versus 4.6% for the sterling-adjusted benchmark. This largely reflected the underperformance of our US exposure (stock selection) which was hindered by the relative strength of large-cap technology (where we remain underweight, as we have for many years) which outperformed small caps by 8%. In addition, portfolio performance was negatively impacted by the drag of holding cash in a rising market and our own NASDAQ puts.<br/>   At the stock level, continued share price strength at Apple (up 26%) proved the most significant detractor to relative performance as our largest underweight position cost 100bps during the half year. However, in aggregate the rotation from growth/momentum to value post July proved more expensive still as a number of our software holdings experienced significant valuation compression, triggered by evidence of macroeconomic uncertainty creeping into earnings. At the same time, semiconductor stocks enjoyed one of their most significant periods of re-rating in recent memory driven by improvement at Apple, strength in China (as Huawei and others likely built inventory or established alternative supply chains) and trade war hopes.<br/>   Decelerating growth at Amazon Web Services (AWS) contributed to weaker performance of Amazon (-7%) while slower cloud capital spending caught up with both Arista Networks (-21%) and Xilinx (-23%), although we reduced all three of these positions during the period. Disappointing progress at Uber (-30%) directly impacted our own performance but, together with the travails at WeWork, this cast a shadow over other so-called long duration assets including Netflix (-22%) which was also impacted by concerns over competition and the pace of new user growth. There were also a few genuine disappointments, but these were largely contained to the portfolio tail with 2U, Forescout and Ubisoft each falling short of expectations, while Infineon was weak following its thesis-changing acquisition of Cypress Semiconductor.<br/>   In terms of positives, AMD (up 24%) continued to add to returns as the company delivered on its product roadmap while benefitting from the general upswing in semiconductor stocks, a dynamic that also aided our holdings in Tokyo Electron (up 31%) and Advantest (up 64%). In addition, a select group of software stocks generated strong relative returns including RingCentral, LivePerson and Medallia, a recent IPO. The Trust also benefited from the underperformance of incumbents such as Baidu, Broadcom, Cisco, DXC Technology and Nokia where we have limited or zero exposure because we perceive them to be negatively impacted by technology change and/or market share shifts. Finally, M&amp;A proved a modest positive following the acquisition of Tableau by Salesforce.com for a 42% premium in June.<br/>   Market outlook<br/>   Trade war uncertainty has taken its toll on the global economy which is now in a \"synchronised slowdown\" with growth this year estimated at just 3%, the slowest pace since the financial crisis. While growth next year is expected to improve to 3.4%, this is already 0.2% lower than forecast at our year end and considered \"precarious\", being dependent on emerging market (EM) reacceleration. According to the IMF, the negative impact of US/China trade tensions has cumulatively reduced GDP in 2020 by 0.8%. This has been most keenly felt in manufacturing where uncertainty, together with disruption in the automotive sector due to new emission standards, has weighed on capital spending. Fortunately, the services sector has remained robust, supporting employment, wage growth and consumption in developed markets. In addition, the absence of inflationary pressures (core inflation below target almost everywhere) has allowed policymakers to significantly ease financial conditions, which should boost GDP by an estimated 0.5% both this year and next. Despite this, risks to current growth forecasts appear skewed to the downside due to trade and geopolitical tensions, Brexit and risks associated with climate change.<br/>   In contrast, equity markets continue to grind higher led by cyclicals as the return of the Fed put and trade deal hope has ameliorated economic uncertainty and political risk. Third-quarter earnings season has also proved better than feared; as of 8 November, 89% of the S&amp;P 500 had reported third-quarter results and, in aggregate, 75% and 60% have reported EPS and revenues respectively ahead of estimates. While earnings look likely to fall by c2.4% y/y (marking the first three straight quarters of y/y earnings declines since 4Q15-2Q16), this is better than the -4.1% forecast at the end of September. However, this positive surprise is insufficient to fully explain the rise in  equity markets, which has largely been driven by multiple expansion; the forward 12-month P/E on the S&amp;P has increased to 17.4x from 16.8x at our year end, modestly above both the five (16.6x) and 10-year (14.9x) averages. As in previous years, international markets appear better value, but less so on a sector-adjusted basis, with the exception of the UK which remains a cheap outlier following record Brexit/Corbyn-related outflows. Equities nonetheless continue to look attractive relative to bonds and cash with US stocks currently boasting higher dividend yields than 10-year treasuries.<br/>   That more S&amp;P 500 constituents sport dividend yields in excess of 10-year US treasuries today than during the aftermath of the financial crisis and following the longest bull market on record, speaks volumes about the uniqueness of the current investment backdrop. Equally, it is highly unusual for an economy with full employment to experience three interest rate cuts in a calendar year, or for risk assets to stand at all-time highs in contrast to global PMIs at post-2009 lows based on hopes of a trade deal between two countries on an obvious and possibly unavoidable medium-term collision course. At a point when investors ought to be concerned about central banks being behind the curve, policymakers are so determined not to repeat their pre-financial crisis somnolence that around one quarter of the global government and corporate bond market currently trades with negative yields. The ECB's actions have enabled Greece to issue its first-ever negative yielding 13-week bills as investors - incredibly - now pay Athens for the privilege of lending it cash. Understandably the term 'Japanification' is in the air, capturing the zeitgeist of this new normal: permanently low growth, low inflation and super-loose monetary policy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELECT-5975723514RN</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELECT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR5-SC51-F0CC-S1SS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">335987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1559\"/><timeReceived>7:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 London Stock Exchange All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>London Stock Exchange Aggregated Regulatory News Service (ARNS)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"44026\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 12, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

President Trump (for all his many shortcomings) may have played a blinder, pressuring the Fed to fill the vacuum left by the trade war uncertainty he instigated before he calls a truce (aka interim deal) timed perfectly to juice the economy ahead of the 2020 Presidential election. While some of this is undoubtably already baked into stock prices (especially cyclical subsectors where strong stock prices have contrasted with negative earnings revisions), the overall market trend may still be upwards, particularly as investors appear conservatively positioned and sentiment remains muted, if not downright bearish. Obviously in the absence of a trade deal, or if central banks reverse course as in 1999 (when a 1.4% core personal consumption expenditure index did not prevent the Fed from raising interest rates three times once the emerging market crisis had passed) then downside risk is likely to prove substantial from current levels.</p><p><br/>   Political risk also remains elevated with impeachment proceedings making progress in the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives. However, the removal of the President ahead of the 2020 election remains a tail risk requiring around 20 Republican senators to vote against him, unlikely given that Republican voters remain overwhelmingly against impeachment. In the UK, Brexit risk has been somewhat sidelined as Parliament finally agreed to a General Election due to be held on 12 December. Despite this new uncertainty, sterling has held its recent gains as Prime Minister Johnson is campaigning on the basis of getting his agreed deal done (ie seemingly reducing the risk of a no-deal outcome) while currently enjoying a sufficient lead over Labour to obviate the need for an electoral pact with the Brexit Party. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn's own personal ratings continue to plumb new depths, the Labour leader's net approval score of -60 in a recent poll the worst score recorded since satisfaction ratings began 42 years ago.<br/>   We remain hopeful that equity markets can continue to move higher during the remainder of our financial year. Valuations that remain appropriate for the current low inflation environment are unlikely to expand easily from here given political/trade uncertainty and the potential for further negative earnings revisions in the absence of a trade deal. However, given that we still expect a trade deal to be concluded, downside risk to valuations should prove modest too, absent deflation or inflation, the two primary causes of sharply lower P/Es. Rather, we expect a return of volatility, which partially explains the current elevated level of cash in the portfolio.<br/>   Key risks<br/>   As outlined during our latest Annual Report, there are myriad risks to our sanguine market view. The most critical of these relates to the loss of policymaker support that has significantly ameliorated trade-related uncertainty and reversed the recent US yield curve inversion. The alignment of policymakers and shareholders that has underpinned risk assets since 2009 depends on central banks fearing deflation more than inflation, which still holds today. However, there is no guarantee that this will persist, particularly given how tight the US labour market is. The Fed could also resume its rate-tightening path once external conditions improve and reflexivity risk has passed. Until a trade war resolution is found, policymaker support is likely to remain critical given record amounts of debt, the slowdown in the global economy and increased recession risk. The global economy continues to lose momentum and although the US remains relatively robust, recent data suggests that uncertainty is beginning to catch up with the world's largest economy. As we articulated at year end, clarity on trade remains essential to restore confidence and return the global economy to firmer footing. An interim deal will probably suffice for now, although we remain somewhat sceptical that a grand bargain is even possible. In addition, there are additional risks that investors should consider, including the systemic risk posed by the magnitude of debt in the world, populism (especially Brexit) and the challenge to nation states posed by terrorism.<br/>   Technology outlook<br/>   Twenty-five years ago, a new genre of fiction - cyberpunk - epitomised by William Gibson's Neuromancer, envisaged a dystopian future where real and virtual worlds collide. Around the same time, TCP/IP was introduced - the protocols used to interconnect devices on the internet, a network that now connects 4.4 billion people who on average spend six hours and 42 minutes online every day. Everywhere we look, the collision of real and virtual is happening as the internet delivers on its promise as a so-called general-purpose technology around which nearly everything is being reordered. Today, 14% of retail sales are captured online as the likes of Amazon and Alibaba forever change the behaviour and expectations of consumers across the globe. Massive social media platforms like Facebook - boasting more than 30% of the world's population as customers - allow information to travel at a velocity previously thought impossible, enabled by billions of smartphones, arguably the most empowering and democratising technology of all time. Nowhere is the collision of virtual and real worlds more apparent today than in our selection of life partners with c40% of people meeting online today as data and artificial intelligence (AI) disintermediate friendship.<br/>   The pace of internet-fuelled disruption has been so furious that is easy to forget that (The) Facebook was only launched in 2004, that the first Google search happened just over 20 years ago or that Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. It was only 50 years ago that the first online message was sent when two academics used the ARPANET (the precursor of the internet) to communicate. At the time, only four universities in the world had computers which were room-sized and required underfloor air conditioning. Leonard Kleinrock had intended to send the word 'login' but the system crashed as he typed in the second letter and 'lo' -a biblical word used as an expression of surprise - appropriately became the first online message and \"served as a premonition of what was to become\". Last year, 65 billion messages were sent daily on WhatsApp alone.<br/>   A little more than two decades after the birth of the commercial internet, we are beginning to witness the first real efforts designed to slow its inexorable progress. In the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, data privacy has become a hot topic with the EU adopting the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2016 to replace a directive that was adopted in 1995 when the internet was in its infancy. The idea that a more innocent, decentralised internet has been transformed into one increasingly dominated by a handful of big technology companies has moved into the political mainstream with countries including France and Germany looking to introduce digital taxes. Cities are fighting back against the likes of Airbnb (apparently responsible for soaring long-term rents, rather than, say, soaring property prices and negative interest rates) and Uber has become a cause celebre with cities such as San Francisco looking to protect drivers rights that many appear comfortable waiving in order to be able to operate in the gig economy.<br/>   Senator Elizabeth Warren has significantly upped the ante with a progressive platform that includes the promise to \"break up big tech\" because \"a handful of monopolists\" should not \"dominate our economy and our democracy\". Her plan leans heavily on historical parallels with the Gilded Age and the monopolies associated with Carnegie, Ford, JP Morgan and Rockerfeller. Instead of robber barons, we are told that today's existential threat is posed by would-be data barons who have used people's private information for profit. As long-term investors in each of the internet winners \"needing to be broken up\" we would politely remind Senator Warren that at no point was the success of these platforms assured. Google's IPO was downsized, while arch-rival Yahoo! might have been a more formidable competitor had it accepted Microsoft's $45bn bid in 2008. Likewise, Facebook fell well below its IPO price once the risk associated with moving advertising from desktop to mobile became clear. While both Google and Facebook made some important acquisitions that have extended their reach and relevance, these transactions were considered controversial and expensive at the time. We will never know how much of the subsequent success of YouTube, Instagram or WhatsApp would have happened had they remained standalone companies.<br/>Amazon's dominance of US e-commerce has also been hard won, requiring years of losses and the deep pockets of Jeff Bezos as the company built out 150 million square feet of space across more than 175 fulfilment centres across the world. While it is true that Amazon employs fewer people per revenue dollar than Walmart did when Sam Walton was crowned America's richest person in 1985, Amazon relies extensively on third-party parcel carriers and agency workers; UPS alone has added 100,000 jobs in the past 16 years. Amazon's success has also spawned AWS, the leading public cloud company today which has not only transformed Amazon's financials but has enabled much of the disruption witnessed this cycle by providing cheap and flexible computing and storage to the likes of Lyft, Netflix, Pinterest and Slack, to name a few. Apple - a poster child for American technology if ever there was one - also falls foul of Senator Warren who insists that it should not operate a marketplace and compete in it at the same time, turning a blind eye to how supermarkets sell private label alternatives to branded goods in their own stores. For the record, Apple had paid out  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELECT-5975724515RN</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELECT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR5-SC51-F0CC-S1ST-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">335987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1698\"/><timeReceived>7:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 London Stock Exchange All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>London Stock Exchange Aggregated Regulatory News Service (ARNS)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"44026\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 12, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Even the 30% take-rate - an understandable focal point for the likes of Spotify - is only in line with what software companies have typically paid distributors.</p><p><br/>   The second Gilded Age argument is beguiling but ultimately fallacious; it is simply too easy to compare Google with 89% search market share with Standard Oil which enjoyed c90% of US refineries and pipelines in the early 1880s. The idea of breaking up the tech giants harks back to the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 which outlawed trusts - monopolies and cartels - and demonstrated that the age of unbridled corporate excess was coming to an end. However, this all-too-easy historical parallel makes no distinction between monopolistic practices and natural monopolies, nor does it consider the value being delivered to customers and society as a whole. Jimmy Wales (a co-founder of Wikipedia) is said to have dreamt of \"a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge\". Well, today billions of people ask more than one trillion questions of Google every year, of which 15% have never been asked before, while more than half of YouTube users rely on the video service to learn how to do things they have never done before.<br/>   Rather than the robber barons, it is to another 19th century group - the Luddites - that we should instead turn as a guide. Used today as a derogatory term to describe people opposed to new technology, the Luddites were a radical faction of English textile workers which destroyed textile machinery as a form of protest. The movement emerged from the harsh economic climate of the Napoleonic Wars, which at least rhymes with the post-financial crisis experience and the present climate of machine mania and stagnating incomes. After six years of protest, the Luddites were suppressed, leading some to conclude that the movement had little to no global significance on technological progress. However, there are better conclusions to be drawn. Contrary to popular belief, the Luddites were not opposed to the new technology but wanted a more gradual take-up of the machinery to give them time to learn new trades. Put differently, they were objecting to transformative change with no regard for the consequences and the fact that the new technology enabled less-skilled, lower-wage labourers.<br/>   After two furious decades that have seen the internet radically rewiring how our societies work we may be overdue a period of consolidation and some recalibration. This is likely to take the form of greater regulatory oversight, increased costs associated with taking responsibility for content and localising global networks, the right to be forgotten and, probably, higher taxes. We continue to believe that breaking up big tech remains highly unlikely, not least because the US internet giants represent the vanguard of American efforts to stay ahead of the Chinese in critical domains such as cloud computing, AI and even quantum computing. In time, the stocking frame (a popular Luddite target) helped the British textile industry grow and created many more jobs while their protests marked the beginning, rather than the end of what Thomas Carlyle later called \"a mechanical age\".<br/>   As we embark on the second half of our financial year and look to 2020, there is much to be excited about. The technology sector remains uniquely positioned as both source of and solution to disruption - the zeitgeist of this cycle - which continues to create an appropriate sense of urgency across myriad industries for companies to reinvent themselves to avoid disintermediation, obsolescence and/or irrelevance. We believe we are still in the early to middle stages of this process with $1.7trn of enterprise IT spending up for grabs with much of it being reallocated to modern cloud software and AI. This view was once again reinforced by my annual trip to the Gartner Symposium in Barcelona (along with 7,500 other people) where the pace of technology disruption remains palpable. According to one Gartner survey, the most important CEO priority today after revenue growth, is improving business agility - critical at a time when technology change is resulting in heightened corporate obsolescence.<br/>   Earlier this month, venerable Mothercare announced it would close all its UK stores. While many will point to price transparency facilitated by the internet and the role played by Amazon, retail disruption is far more embedded than being simply due to pricing or fulfilment. An estimated 70% of new mums now turn to YouTube for help while 'mommy bloggers' are the first people that brands go to when they want to launch new products - both roles once enjoyed by Mothercare. This disruption is fast becoming the norm; 83% of Board directors expect their respective industries to be disrupted significantly by the web giants over the next five years. Business agility is one way to guard against unforeseen disruption but requires companies to rethink how they operate, where they compute and to embrace hyper-automation, a term used by Gartner to describe the need to automate anything that can be automated.<br/>   Meanwhile, the tide continues to move ever further from enterprise compute and legacy technologies. Dampened IT budgets are expected to grow just 0.6% in 2019 (before recovering to 3.7% next year) and this has been felt disproportionately by incumbents. Even in the cloud, hopes for so-called hybrid computing (the combination of public and private clouds) are already giving way to the 'distributed cloud' where, according to Gartner, public cloud companies provide the on-premise compute and storage too. This has made it even less likely that we will invest in hybrid-cloud and infrastructure companies as workloads continue to gravitate towards the public cloud which today accounts for c20% of overall compute and storage. In contrast, our investments in the largest public clouds (Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Alibaba) are approaching a quarter of assets.<br/>   In addition, the software sector remains a firm favourite of ours as companies adopt next-generation software in order to transform themselves, improve the customer journey and automate decision-making. The cloud software market - worth $122bn in 2018 - is forecast to reach $550bn by 2025 which would see it grow 24% annually or 2x the broader software industry. However, this remarkable growth profile and heightened M&amp;A activity led to a material re-rating of software assets and this has begun to unwind since July, driven by the growth-to-value rotation in the broader market as well as some macroeconomic-related uncertainty at the margin at a time when stretched valuations could least afford it. This has presaged a significant and painful derating process with many individual names falling more than 30% from recent highs (and some more). While we have drifted money back into selected positions (many of which we reduced earlier on valuation grounds), we continue to tread carefully as growth stocks continue to act poorly, evidenced by asymmetric reactions to good and bad results thus far during earnings season.<br/>   In contrast, semiconductor stocks have taken on the baton as investors better position themselves for the uptick in global growth expected once a trade deal is agreed. Having steadily increased our semiconductor weighting (primarily via preferred 5G beneficiaries) we are reluctant to chase them further from here, particularly when current strength beyond Apple and 5G may be partially explained by Huawei and other Chinese companies building inventory or, more likely, establishing secondary supply chains designed to reduce their reliance on US chips. As such, and unwilling to embrace value, we will continue to look for further opportunities to add to our favoured names and perhaps add a few new ones that have eluded us thus far. Until then, we are likely to retain above-average levels of cash (augmented by a small amount of out of the money NDX puts) designed to reduce the natural excess beta of our portfolio.<br/>   With the US IPO market on track this year to surpass the issuance record set in 2000 (at the height of dotcom mania), it is worth recalling that while technology valuations have expanded, they remain far from anything resembling a bubble. Today, the S&amp;P technology sector trades at c20.6x forward earnings as compared to 18.9x at the start of our fiscal year, the c20% premium to the broader market (ignoring the sector's superior collective balance sheet) looking more than justified. We should also point out that our own portfolio remains highly liquid. According to internal risk team calculations, 95% of the combined portfolio of all three technology vehicles managed by Polar Capital could be liquidated in less than three days, assuming one third of daily traded volume. This is not a reaction to recent adverse industry developments; rather, we have long felt that the remarkable pace of technology change and associated obsolescence risk demanded sufficient liquidity to recalibrate the portfolio when necessary. While this may preclude us from investing in private companies, we are more than happy to trade a slightly smaller investment universe today (noting that most private companies will eventually come public) for best in class liquidity, particularly given the duration of this bull market.<br/>   Near term, the growth versus value debate is likely to be driven by the direction of risk-free rates and hopes of a trade deal. However, we remain hopeful that the current rotation is likely to prove a tremor rather than a seismic shift in investment style, particularly if the Japanese experience proves a useful guide. We certainly hope so as the past few months have been challenging for our investment approach and we have no desire to dust off our value playbook, nor hunt for value in washed-out enterprise tech, IT services companies and would-be turnarounds.<br/>   Ben Rogoff &amp;

Ongoing protests following the death of George Floyd have focused attention on racial injustice in the U.S. and how police use technology to track people.</p><p>But while all three companies are known for their work in developing artificial intelligence, including face recognition software, none is a major player in selling such technology to police. Smith said Thursday that Microsoft currently doesn't sell its face recognition software to any U.S. police departments. He didn't say if that includes federal law enforcement agencies or police forces outside the U.S.</p><p>Several other companies that are less well known dominate the market for government facial recognition contracts in the U.S., including Tokyo-based NEC and the European companies id\u0117mia and Gemalto.</p><p>Microsoft, Amazon and IBM are calling on Congress to set national rules over how police use facial recognition - something that's now being considered as part of a police reform package sparked by the protests following Floyd's death.</p><p>\"If all of the responsible companies in the country cede this market to those that are not prepared to take a stand, we won't necessarily serve the national interest or the lives of the black and African American people of this nation well,\" Smith said. \"We need Congress to act, not just tech companies alone.\"</p><p>Microsoft has spent two years warning of the potential dangers of face-scanning technology being abused to enable oppressive mass surveillance, but the company has opposed outright bans on government use of the technology passed in San Francisco and other cities. That's led to criticism from groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union, which says Microsoft is lobbying for weak regulations that could end up legitimizing and expanding police use of facial recognition.</p><p>\"Congress and legislatures nationwide must swiftly stop law enforcement use of face recognition, and companies like Microsoft should work with the civil rights community - not against it - to make that happen,\" said Matt Cagle, an attorney with the ACLU of Northern California, in a statement Thursday.</p><p>The Associated

I'm Hala Gorani.  We are live  in London.  Thanks for being with us on this Monday.  You are watching  continuing coverage of the terrorist attack that Britain's prime minister  called today an attack on the entire free world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Police have been working around the clock to identify the assailants and  now just in the last few hours, we have some photos and names.  Two of the  three attackers have been publicly identified, on the left, Khuram Shazad  Butt, he was British, born in Pakistan, and on the right, Rachid Redouane,  who police say claimed to be Moroccan and Libyan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, spoke at a vigil a short time ago and did not  hide his disgust.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MAYOR SADIQ KHAN, MAYOR:  As the mayor of London, I want to send a clear  message to the sick and evil extremists who commit these hideous crimes.   We will defeat you.  You will not win.  As a proud and patriotic British  Muslim I say this, you do not commit these disgusting acts in my name.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GORANI:  Police made several more arrests this morning as they expand their  search trying to determine whether the attackers who killed seven people  were part of a wider network.</p><p>CNN terrorism analysis, Paul Cruickshank is with me in the studio with new  details on the attackers and particularly the Khuram Shazad Butt.</p><p> PAUL CRUICKSHANK, CNN TERRORISM ANALYST:  Right.  Yes, they've identified  him as one of the attackers, 27 years old, a British national born in  Pakistan, somebody who came over to the U.K. and somebody, we understand,  from our very (inaudible), who did a lot of reporting on this group back in  2014, 2015, 2016 and actually met with Khuram Butt several times.</p><p> We understand that he became influenced by the British extremist group,  (inaudible), that's a group that has been supportive of ISIS.  Its leader,  Anjam Choudry (ph), last year was convicted for (inaudible) ISIS sentenced  to five years in jail.</p><p> He, Khuram Butt was very much part of this group, was influenced by them.   Our colleague, (inaudible), spent time with him, described him as very  quiet spoken.  He was not really a leader, more like a follower.  He really  appeared to have become brainwashed by this group's propaganda very, very  supportive of ISIS.  He was on the radar screen of the police and MI-5 for  some time, it appears.</p><p> Rachid Redouane, 30 years old, also from Banking, on the right of the  screen, that he was not on the radar screen of either the police or the  security services.</p><p> We also found out from a friend at the gym who just recently saw Khuram  Butt just a few days ago, just a few days before the attack, that he had  recently told this friend that he and his wife had a baby just a few months  before this attack.  So some very interesting details coming out.</p><p> We understand that Khuram Butt works as a receptionist at a fitness center  in east London.</p><p> GORANI:  All right, so we have two.  Police have not released the name of  the third.</p><p> CRUICKSHANK:  Police have not released the name of the third as of this  point, Hala.</p><p> GORANI:  All right, let's go back there because this Khuram Butt now  according to the reports I have read several neighbors expressed concern,  we understand, reportedly even called authorities.</p><p> [15:05:10]We understand as well that he was thrown out of his local mosque  for being too extreme.  He was in fact also in a documentary on television  last year, \"The Jihadis Next Door.\"  This guy was on the radar.</p><p> CRUICKSHANK:  Yes.  He was not only -- </p><p> GORANI:  This is not some random guy that nobody has ever heard of.</p><p> CRUICKSHANK:  You're right.  Not only on the radar screen, but on a major  television documentary (inaudible) on Channel 4.  Colleagues of us featured  several times in that documentary, including during a sequence when several  of them unfurled a black flag (inaudible).</p><p> Somebody who was moving in the circle of (inaudible), this pro-ISIS group.   This pro-ISIS group in the U.K. as you know has been around for a very long  time, since even before 9/11.</p><p> And they've actually been linked to about half of all terrorist plots in  the U.K. around the world where British nationals have been involved.</p><p> So a lot of questions to security resources given the fact he was part of  this proselytizing group on the streets of Islam and very visible  demonstrations -- </p><p> GORANI:  I mean, if he's unfurling an ISIS flag (inaudible) on television,  he is hardly flying under the radar, that's the thing.</p><p> CRUICKSHANK:  You better believe it.</p><p> GORANI:  Yes, absolutely.  Paul Cruickshank, thanks very much for your  reporting with that breaking new, the latest on the investigation.  We'll  be speaking with Paul a little bit later.</p><p> Let's get more now on what police is saying.  Samuel Burke is live at  Scotland Yard.  Tell us more about what police have announced today.  We  have some important elements here with names and pictures.</p><p> SAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, Hala.  We are learning more  about Rachid Redouane, 30 years old, claimed to be Moroccan and Libyan, but  more importantly what you and Paul were talking about just now about Khuram  Shazad Butt, again, 27 years old, a British citizen, but born in Pakistan.</p><p> And I say more importantly, when talking about him because the folks here  at Scotland Yard tell us that he was known by both police and MI-5.</p><p> And this gets to this very important question that is growing here in the  U.K. about A, what type of resources the police have, what type of  resources have been cut, and B, what they are doing with the information  that they do get about these people.</p><p> As you reference, as CNN reporters spoke to a neighbor who claimed that  they had flagged up one of these attackers to the authorities and Hala,  just a short time ago, we had the police commander for community engagement  come out here with a group of Muslim leaders.</p><p> And they said in a statement that they had crafted together that the  commander who is himself a Muslim fasting on Ramadan right now, he said,  and they said, quote, \"Muslims must do more.\"</p><p> Though Hala, you and I, were both in Manchester and we heard in the wake of  the Ariana Grande concert terrorist attack, members of the Manchester  Muslim community tell us that they were concerned about Salman Abedi.</p><p> That they had flagged him up to the authorities.  So I asked this police  commander, how can you reconcile saying that Muslims need to do more and  the fact that we've heard reports from U.K. media today saying that some of  those calls from people in the Muslim community may have gone to the wrong  department and fall into the crack, and this is what he told me.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MAK CHISHTY, METROPOLITAN POLICE COMMANDER FOR ENGAGEMENT:  Unlike --  single person rules, a lone wolf may keep everything to himself.  When you  got three people in concert, necessarily, there must have been some  discussion around that and some people even have the closest point to them  must have known something.  And we are saying they had a duty.  The Muslim  community say they had that duty to report it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURKE:  So even if Salman Abedi was just one person, what this police  commander was saying was that if three people must have known about this  attack, if the three attackers knew, he is saying that it's not enough for  the Muslim community to just flag up the attack.</p><p> He said they also have a responsibility to flag up the actual attack  because he said in his assumption if three people must have known then  other people would have known.  So it really calls into question if people  are flagging up these people as individuals and that's not enough.</p><p> What type of resources do the U.K. police need to carry out further  investigations to try and prevent attacks like we are living through here  in England?</p><p> GORANI:  All right, Samuel Burke, thanks very much.  We'll be obviously  asking those questions a little bit later in the program.  Do the police  numbers need to go back up to what they were a few years ago when then Home  Secretary Theresa May cut police numbers by about 20,000?  This is going to  be a big topic as well as we are in fact only three days away from the next  general election.</p><p> [15:10:00]Now let's get more in the investigation and on these suspects.   We have new video.  We were discussing with our terrorism analyst, Paul  Cruickshank, who is in the studio that Channel 4 last year featured around  Khuram Butt.  So we see him there with that ISIS flag.  Tell us more about  this individual.</p><p> CRUICKSHANK:  Yes, there he is right there on the screen right now.  Khuram  Butt, 27 years old, a British national from Barking and here you see him  with followers of this British pro-ISIS extremist group called (inaudible)  Barren Regents part just a few years ago.</p><p> We understand from our colleague, (inaudible), who actually did a lot of  reporting on this group in 2014, 2015, and 2016.  That one of his closest  associates in this group that you see here on the screen was a British  national known as (inaudible).</p><p> Now (inaudible) actually went off to Syria in October 2014.  He skipped  bail.  They wanted to arrest him.  They managed to arrest him, but he got  out on bail and he managed to get away from the country join ISIS.</p><p> He actually then taunted the British after joining the group and there is  some speculation that he was involved in a January 2016 execution video for  ISIS, somebody who appears to be playing a somewhat prominent role in the  terrorist organization.</p><p> Somebody that according to (inaudible) who did this great reporting was  very, very close to Khuram Butt and why is that interesting.  It is  interesting because as the British investigators probe overseas  connections, it is certainly plausible that he would have had a cell phone  number, an email, something for a very prominent British member and ISIS.</p><p> Could ISIS have had some role in this?  That's what they are claiming -- </p><p> GORANI:  Why wasn't he arrested, Khuram Butt?</p><p> CRUICKSHANK:  Khuram Butt?</p><p> GORANI:  Yes.</p><p> CRUICKSHANK:  Well, that's a question we are going to have asked British  police, British authorities, presumably they weren't able to arrest him  because they did not have enough evidence to charge him -- </p><p> GORANI:  Because Anjam Choudry (ph) is in jail for inciting people to join  a terrorist group, I mean, I guess, they didn't have enough evidence to  charge him with the same type of crime?</p><p> CRUICKSHANK:  Well, going to regent's part and helping unfurl a black  Islamic banner is not sufficient grounds for prosecution.  Attending a  group who have these views isn't necessarily sufficient grounds for  prosecution either, Hala, or there has to be sort of something more rising  to a certain threshold.</p><p> They managed to get that evidence when it came to Anjam Choudry (ph).  It  was a lot of YouTube videos that he posted, some of the things he'd said  that that the British Muslims needed to pledge their loyalty to Abu Bakar  al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS.</p><p> For Anjam Choudry (ph), the leader of this group, that sort of passed a  certain threshold.  He was a foot soldier in this movement.  They don't  appear to have focused on him and of course, there are many other foot  soldiers out there that in the days ahead could be inspired by what he did.</p><p> GORANI:  Well, (inaudible) group certainly is going to be looked at a lot  more closely after this.  Thanks very much, Paul Cruickshank and will catch  up with you little bit later with more of our breaking news.</p><p> Now witnesses to these attacks are describing obviously horrific scenes,  but also acts of heroism by the police.  I'm joined now by Liam Connell,  who was at a bar when it all unfolded.</p><p> Liam, thanks for being with us.  Where were you on Saturday?  What did you  see?</p><p> LIAM CONNELL, WITNESSED ATTACK:  I was at a (inaudible), which is a couple  (inaudible) and yes, it was a standard night -- I mean, I've never been to  London Bridge before (inaudible) that it's my first night there.  And yes,  like at 10-ish, we've started to get evacuated by staff and there's no  police at this point.  We were told it was best to stay where we were.  We  are actually in the basement (inaudible).</p><p> About 1020, I started to notice police and that's when I started filming,  and soon after that we were told to drop to the floor because they've  actually armed police in the place.</p><p> And yes, that was the scariest part (inaudible) and then, yes, there is a  lot of trying to find out what actually happened at this point we didn't  know.</p><p> GORANI:  Yes -- so it was 10:20 at that point so it was about 20+minutes  after the van started plowing into people.  When there were armed police in  the bar where you were on that Saturday night, what was the scene like  then?  What were they telling you to do?</p><p> CONNELL:  (Inaudible) is to leave.  No one knew what was going on.  We  didn't actually realize anything (inaudible).  We were completely used to  and that people tired on drinking.  People making jokes.  It looked fine.</p><p> [15:15:06]It wasn't until that the armed police came and that we were like  something is wrong.  Once we dropped to the floor, there was a lot of  speculation of what was going on.  A lot of people checking their phones.</p><p> I was saying to my friends actually that nothing bad had happened.  It was  something small and this is just almost like an overreaction or just  (inaudible).  It wasn't until -- we were told that if there's any armed  police, drop to the floor.</p><p> It wasn't actually until we got up and that I kind of realize how bad it  was because my friends told me that there was someone behind who actually  been outside.</p><p> GORANI:  And what did you see when you finally left the bar?</p><p> CONNELL:  We just kind of ran.  Yes, I mean, the police are there at the  hallway.  They helped us the whole way.  They were there and everyone was  saying thank you to them.  Everyone was so, so grateful to them.  Even  though everyone wanted to leave and quite quick to leave after all these  pieces of guns around, no one panicked.  No one was (inaudible) shoving,  everyone was just (inaudible) to leave almost.</p><p> GORANI:  OK, well, thanks very much, Liam Connell there on Saturday night.   I know it must have been really frightening for you and his first time at a  London Bridge bar as well.  Thanks for joining us this evening and sharing  your story.</p><p> Still to come, Saturday's shocking attack is bringing terror and security  to the floor, but this is all as we mentioned there happening three ahead  of a big general election year here.  We are live at Downing Street next.</p><p> Also the other news we are following, a diplomatic disaster after decades  of cooperation, Gulf nations turn their collective backs on tiny Qatar.   We'll explain why.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GORANI:  Even as the investigation intensifies, London slowed for a moment  today and pause to remember.</p><p> (VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GORANI:  Mayor Khan leading the crowd at a moment of silence in the shadow  of Tower Bridge to remember the victims, people like Christy Archibald, a  30-year-old Canadian, who worked at a homeless shelter until moving to  Europe to start a life with her fiance, Tyler, her family told the CBC.</p><p> It was her first trip to London. The young couple was crossing the bridge  together when the van hit Christy.  Tyler's sister told the CBC, he held  her until she passed away.</p><p> [15:20:09]Christy's family had asked people to honor her by, quote, \"making  your community a better place.\"</p><p> I want to go back to the vigil now.  Melissa Bell, joins me live from  Putterfield's Park with more on a day of remembrance but also a race  against the clock to get this investigation moving as quickly as possible - - Melissa.</p><p> MELISSA BELL, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, Hala.  And  even as we were hearing the beginnings of the fruits of that investigation,  it has taken a remarkably long time for those two names to be announced by  the police as you've been talking about tonight.</p><p> People gathered here for what was really the first opportunity, Hala, that  London has had to get together and remember those victims of Saturday  night, a tragic event.</p><p> And it was a minute of silence as you heard there led by Sadiq Khan, and he  spoke for many of those who'd gathered here a while ago, many of them  Muslims when he said that he spoke as a proud British Muslim, a proud  patriotic British Muslim speaking directly to the attackers and saying that  they did not speak in his name.</p><p> There were several groups of young Muslims here, young women, young men, a  group of imams, Hala, who were applauded as they made their way to put  their flowers at the memorial that's just begun -- the flowers that's been  put down by those who attended the vigil earlier on and still people  gathered there lighting candles and remembering those who lost their lives.</p><p> GORANI:  All right, Melissa Bell, it's become a depressingly familiar scene  after Manchester now London.  Thanks very much.</p><p> Saturday night (inaudible) here in London comes just a few days before a  crucial general election and it has put the issue of security front and  center once again.</p><p> Labour's Jeremy Corbyn has fiercely criticized Prime Minister Theresa May,  it is an election campaign after all, over her past handling of police  resources from the time she was home secretary.  May has hit back strongly  defending her record.</p><p> All right.  There you have both candidates of the leading parties.  Let's  go to Downing Street.  CNN's Nic Robertson is there.  So we are a few days  after this horrible attack, a few weeks after Manchester, and a few days  before this big election.  Politically describe the landscape, is the gap  between the two candidates still narrowing?</p><p> NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  The gap is still  narrow as we know it's been narrowing over the past several weeks.  So that  really gives an indication that there were other issues here.  Theresa May  has cast herself as a strong stable leadership, the only one who can lead  the country into the Brexit negotiations, which begins 11 days after the  election, 14 days to weeks from now, to be precise.</p><p> And that seems -- that campaign seems to have found a little bit.  There  have been -- Labour has been taking a run over the treatment of the health  service in Britain, over the treatment of schools.  There have been a lot  of talk about how you turn.</p><p> So as supporters eroded over a number of issues but over the issue of  terrorism, this is a place where she is particularly sensitive and open to  criticism because of the six years she had as the home secretary running  the country's security, if you will, overseeing the police.</p><p> She had an abrasive relationship with the police because she reduced the  number of police officers in the country by about 19,000 and that's what  the leader of the opposition is picking upon now.</p><p> She had tried -- she is leading obviously on the stable and strong  leadership.  It is hard to maintain that narrative when there are a number  of terror attacks going on to during the campaign in the run up of the  elections.</p><p> But that seems to be, you know, the terrorism part of it is an area where  she can also excel on whether the public thinks she is good because she  does have this image of being strong and her statement since this attack  have been declarative and have been clear, and have certainly given support  to her base.</p><p> So you know we're really not going to know until Election Day itself how  it's going to play.  We are getting very, very close, but there is no doubt  about it that with the polls being as narrow as they are, she's certainly  cannot afford any more erosion and she is -- she is open to that erosion  over this issue.</p><p> And that is what the leader of the opposition has been focusing on,  focusing in on over the past 24 hours.  So yes, this could be a key issue.</p><p> GORANI:  All right.  Certainly this is front and center in people's minds  across the country and especially in London.  Nic Robertson, thanks very  much.</p><p> By the way, we'll be speaking to a conservative MP a little bit later in  the program with more on the criticism that Theresa May, the prime  minister, has been facing because of those cuts to police forces while she  was home secretary.</p><p> The leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, this is a political campaign  criticizing the prime minister.  We will be the thing that later.</p><p> Now speaking of politics and rivalries maybe just on one side in this case,  while London authorities are working around the clock to try to crack a  possible terror network, the American president, Donald Trump, is ramping  up some personal attacks on the city's mayor.</p><p> [15:25:11]Originally he said on Twitter, \"At least seven dead and 48  wounded in terror attack and mayor of London says there is no reason to be  alarmed,\" quote/unquote.</p><p> Khan declined to comment to Trump directly.  His spokesperson said he had  more important things to do than respond to Mr. Trump's ill-informed tweet.   Now context, by the way, Sadiq Khan did not say that.  He said people  shouldn't be alarmed by the increased police presence.</p><p> Then in terms next week was even more negative in tone, \"Pathetic excused  by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had think fast on his no reason to be  alarmed statement, MSM,\" as in mainstream media, \"is working hard to sell  it.\"</p><p> In the last hour, the White House deputy press secretary weighed in.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  I don't see  that the president is picking a fight with the mayor of London at all.  I  think again the president's point is something he said frankly back on  almost two years now, a year and a half ago when the president talked about  how we have to be more committed to national security.  One of the reasons  we have the travel ban here through that executive order is a focus on  national security.  That was the point he was trying to make.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GORANI:  Sarah Huckabee Sanders.  He is not picking a fight.  Dan Merica is  there at the White House.  What would it be if you were picking a fight?   Those two tweets sure looked like he was trying to pick a fight with Sadiq  Khan?</p><p> DAN MERICA, CNN POLITICAL PRODUCER:  I think what's fair to say that this  is not exactly what the White House wanted to talk about today.  This is a  big week for them.  He tried over the weekend to float out that they're  going to push infrastructure reform throughout the United States.</p><p> At an event earlier today with the president to do that, but what is the  dominant talking point here with both Republicans and Democrats is the  president's early morning tweets.  It's not clear maybe he did not want to  pick a fight with the London mayor, but that is exactly what has had  happened.</p><p> The back and forth between these two men has led to not only some questions  domestically here in the United States, why is the president doing this?   But it's become somewhat of an international incident with both Mayor Khan  and other leaders having to respond.</p><p> What is very clear here is that the president relies on Twitter to get his  message out to his voters.  It's what he did during the campaign.  It's  what his done during in his White House.</p><p> Going forward though you have a number White House aides who after this  morning and have said we shouldn't focus as much on these on these tweets.   What remains clear, though, is that these tweets are the president's most  distilled thoughts.</p><p> This is what he thinks in the morning and this is how he gets his message  out.  So they may say he is not trying to pick a fight with the mayor, it  was pretty clear that he was doing something to antagonize him in these  tweets.</p><p> GORANI:  Right.  And the mayor as we mentioned through a spokesperson  saying he does not even have time to respond.  So it's not so much a spat,  but just two tweets by the president interpreted as being criticism of the  mayor of London during a very difficult time.</p><p> President Trump hasn't just been tweeting about Sadiq Khan, he's turning to  the Supreme Court for help with this executive order on immigration.  He's  now emphatically calling it a travel ban, Dan.</p><p> He tweeted that \"People the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever  they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a travel ban.\"   So now he's gone on this tweetstorm just as the administration is appealing  to the Supreme Court of the United States to reinstate this ban.  What is  exactly behind this move?</p><p> MERICA:  It's hard to state how much this undercuts what his aides had said  in the past.  You had Sean Spicer in January who said, it is a  misrepresentation of this to call it a travel ban.  But then you have the  president this morning saying outright it is a travel ban, I'm going to  call it what I want to call it.</p><p> This was very clear the way that it undercut those White House aides and  the Department of Justice.  This was clear in tweets by George Conway, who  funny enough his Kellyanne Conway, a top White House adviser's husband, who  tweeted today saying that this undercuts the Department of Justice's  ability to argue on behalf of this travel ban.</p><p> Going forward, you're going to hear President Trump use Twitter like this.   He is going to say what he wants to say, but it is very clear here in  Washington and this is an annoyance in the White House and is forcing, not  only forcing them to respond but really undercutting the credibility of  some President Trump's top aides.</p><p> GORANI:  But why very quickly -- why does the president keep tweeting like  this?  I mean, it is a fair question.  It is the focus -- taking away focus  from big policy questions.  It's dominating the headlines.  All of his  aides and advisors do not want this to happen anymore.  Why does he keep  doing it?</p><p> MERICA:  To be completely blunt, I think it's what he enjoys.  I think he  wakes up in the morning.  He watches the news.  We've been told multiple  times that he watches the news and response to it via Twitter.  And you can  actually correlate what he is watching in the morning with what he is  tweeting in the 6:00, 7:00, 8:00 hours here on the east coast.  So you  know, for a lack of a better explanation, it's just what he enjoys doing.</p><p> GORANI:  All right.  Dan Merica at the White House, thanks very much.</p><p> A lot more coming up, more on the men behind Saturday's attack in London,  review of the details, CNN is breaking this hour just ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [15:30:00] HALA GORANI, CNN ANCHOR:  -- more on the men behind Saturday's  attack in London, a review of the details CNN is breaking this hour just  ahead.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GORANI:  Welcome back.  We're covering Saturday's terrorist attack from  every angle.  Let's review what we know right now.  British police have  named two of the three men behind the assault, both from East London.  You  see their pictures there.  </p><p> Khuram Shazad Butt was a British national born in Pakistan.  He's on the  left.  He worked for the London Underground briefly last year.  Police and  MI-5 were familiar with him, but police say they had no intel leading up to  this attack.  </p><p> On the right is a man named Rachid Redouane.  He, also, was gunned down by  police on Saturday.  He claimed to be Moroccan and Libyan, was not known to  authorities.  </p><p> The three attackers were confronted by armed police and shot dead, as we've  been reporting, within eight minutes of the first emergency call, right  before 10:00 p.m., in the London Bridge area.  </p><p> Let's talk a little bit about what's coming up in three days because it's a  big general election.  Conservative politician, Kwasi Kwarteng, is here.  </p><p> Hi.  Thanks for being with us.  </p><p> KWASI KWARTENG, MEMBER OF THE PARLIAMENT, UNITED KINGDOM:  Thanks.  </p><p> GORANI:  There have been calls on Mrs. May, the Prime Minister, to resign  because, during her time as Home Secretary, she cut police forces by 20,000  and therefore, in some ways, she should be held responsible for the drop in  policing numbers.  What do you make of that?  </p><p> KWARTENG:  I think that's, you know, part of the election.  There's a lot  of big words.  Jeremy Corbyn's trying to make an impact.  I think it's  nonsense though because, as you pointed out in your report, the police came  within eight minutes and did an incredibly good job.  </p><p> So it's not just a question of the numbers.  If we're going to tackle this  thing, it's about mentality, it's about ideology, it's about philosophy.   And I think that, you know, as the Prime Minister outlined yesterday,  there's a lot more that we could do to try and integrate our communities.  </p><p> GORANI:  But the Prime Minister has been wanting this image, this strong  and stable image of the government, of the Prime Minister coming into this  campaign with an enormous lead in the polls.  It has done nothing but  shrink.  And here, also, we have really a government that perhaps seems may  be not as strong and not as stable, having to go back even on pledges made  in its own manifesto.  </p><p> KWARTENG:  I don't think that's true at all, I mean, if you look at  campaigns generally.  I remember 1997, the Labour Party headed hugely at  the beginning of that campaign and the lead actually shrunk.  I mean,  that's what often happens in general election campaigns.  </p><p> And the government's message has been very clear.  I think the Prime  Minister gave a good speech yesterday where she outlined that enough is  enough.  We can't simply carry on as we were before, and there has to be a  change of direction.  We have to look at the philosophy, as I say, the  ideology of Islamic extremism.  </p><p> [15:35:04] GORANI:  But how do you do that?  How do you do that?  </p><p> KWARTENG:  I think there's a lot more that could be done in some sort of --</p><p> GORANI:  I mean, there were no real specific actions or policy proposals in  that speech.  </p><p> KWARTENG:  No, she made a broad statement saying that, clearly, what we've  been doing in the past needs to change.  On that front, I think there's a  lot more that could be done to integrate actual communities for us to find  out what's going on, what sorts for messages are being preached in mosques.  </p><p> And also, as she said in her speech, we've been too tolerant of extremism  in our midst.  We've been too relaxed about a lot of the hate, that things  do --</p><p> GORANI:  Her critics would say she had years as Home Secretary to address  this and didn't.  </p><p> KWARTENG:  Well, as we know already, reports have suggested that MI-5 and a  lot of other security services have foiled many plots in the last year, and  I think that was the case, certainly, when she was Home Secretary for six  years.  </p><p> GORANI:  Now, regarding the campaign, you're saying it is not unusual for  parties that go into campaigns with a very strong lead in the polls to see  their lead shrink.  </p><p> KWARTENG:  True.  </p><p> GORANI:  But in this case, there have been some polls within the margin of  error.  Are you concerned your party's going to lose its majority in  parliament --</p><p> KWARTENG:  Well --</p><p> GORANI:  -- and therefore that Theresa May's gamble may backfire?  </p><p> KWARTENG:  Well, let's see what happens.  I mean, we've had lots of  predictions before ahead of elections that had been wrong.  I mean, there  was Brexit.  There was obviously President Trump that no one --</p><p> GORANI:  You want this one to be right though, don't you?  </p><p> KWARTENG:  -- no one foresaw.  </p><p> GORANI:  Yes.  </p><p> KWARTENG:  And, of course, the polls now are very varied.  I mean, some  polls have shown us, I think, 11 points ahead.  That was one today.  A  number have shown smaller leads.  So we'll have to see what happens on  Thursday.  </p><p> It's notable that no poll has shown Labour in the lead.  And I was a  candidate in 2015, and, of course, you know, every other people, half the  poll, showed Labour ahead and the conservatives won.  So the trend, I  think, is the conservatives are ahead.  We just have to wait and see what  the actual result is.  Nobody can say that now.  </p><p> GORANI:  What do you make of what Donald Trump tweeted about Sadiq Khan,  the mayor of London, calling him pathetic today?  </p><p> KWARTENG:  I think it would be helpful for Donald Trump to, you know, focus  on United States of America.  I mean, I don't know that we need to have  Donald Trump, the President, commenting on our internal affairs or internal  politics.  And Sadiq Khan is the mayor of London.  He's been elected, he  has a mandate, and he should be treated with the respect that he deserves.  </p><p> GORANI:   Theresa May said he was doing a great job.  Donald Trump,  obviously, wouldn't agree with her.  Do you think it's hurt Theresa May,  her close association with Donald Trump, in this country?  Donald Trump is  not popular in Europe or in the U.K.  </p><p> KWARTENG:  Well, I think as Prime Minister of Great Britain, any prime  minister would have to have a good relationship with the President of  United States, and I think Theresa May was very conscious of that.  </p><p> And in a way, the relationship is bigger than the actual individual holders  of the office, whoever the Prime Minister or the President happens to be.   It's more important relationship than that.  And I think Number 10 realize  and it was on that basis that she tried to form this relationship.  </p><p> GORANI:   Because she didn't sign, for instance, that letter condemning the  U.S.' decision to withdraw from the Paris Accord.  That was highlighted  perhaps and the -- </p><p> KWARTENG:  Well, I mean, as politicians, I mean, even at my low level, I  mean, we're asked to sign all sorts of things, and I tend to avoid that  because I want to use my words   But I don't know what the reason was.  </p><p> GORANI:  Kwasi Kwarteng, thanks very much.  We really appreciate it.   Always great having you on the program.  </p><p> KWARTENG:  Thank you.  </p><p> GORANI:  Well, speaking of the attack and the reaction from the Muslim  community, of course, I am not sure you saw this, but more than 130 British  Muslims -- imams and religious leaders -- issued a statement.  They're  saying they are refusing to perform the burial prayer for any of the  perpetrators of the attack.  </p><p> \"We will not perform the traditional Islamic funeral prayer for the  perpetrators, and we also urge fellow imams and religious authorities to  withdraw such a privilege.  This is because such indefensible actions are  completely at odds with the lofty teachings of Islam.\"  </p><p> The London Mayor, Sadiq Khan, had strong words for the perpetrators today,  too, saying, \"As a proud British Muslim, I say this, you do not commit  these disgusting acts in my name.\"  </p><p> Well, Khan's election as mayor last year was seen by many as a celebration  of London's diversity.  He also had to deal with attacks undermining it.   Take a look.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GORANI (voice-over):  When he was elected last year, expectations were high  for Sadiq Khan, London's first ever Muslim mayor.  He has since risen to be  one of the most recognized Muslim politicians in Europe.  </p><p> MAYOR SADIQ KHAN, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM:  I never dreamed that someone  like me could be elected as Mayor of London.  </p><p> GORANI (voice-over):  The son of a London bus driver and a seamstress, his  parents were Pakistani immigrants.  He grew up in public housing, went to  states schools, and then became a lawyer, Member of Parliament, and  government minister.  </p><p> Khan's role defies a political trend dividing Western nations across  America and Europe.  Islam has become an emotive, often fearful political  issue after large terror strikes in the U.S., France and Belgium, and now,  in the U.K.  </p><p> [15:40:04] And after the attacks in London, Khan is now facing that  challenge head-on.  </p><p> KHAN:  The basic promise has to be to recognize, just like a terrorist and  others are finding new ways to harm us, we've got to evolve and find new  ways to keep us safe.  </p><p> GORANI (voice-over):  And after the attack in Manchester two weeks ago, the  Mayor expressed the need for good interfaith relations.  </p><p> KHAN:  Here in London, we show that we don't simply tolerate different  faiths, we respect and celebrate them too.  And diversity is what makes  London the greatest city in the world.  </p><p> GORANI (voice-over):  Sadiq Khan's supporters say having him as the Mayor  shows many people here are very comfortable with the clear difference  between those who murder in the name of Islam and the rest of the Muslim  community.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GORANI:  This is THE WORLD RIGHT NOW.  Still ahead, the worst diplomatic  rift in decades, why the oil-rich nation of Qatar suddenly finds itself all  alone in the Persian Gulf.  </p><p> Also, Londoners keep calm and carry on as they return to work following the  terror attack.  We'll be right back.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GORANI:  Now to a diplomatic rift that has left one of the world's richest  nations -- and smallest nations -- isolated.  Multiple countries in the  region have abruptly cut off ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting  terrorism.  Those countries are Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, Yemen, the  Maldives, even, and the United Arab Emirates.  Qatar calls the allegations  baseless.  </p><p> The move is causing chaos for many people in the region, so what is really  behind this major diplomatic shift?  My next guest is Fawaz Gerges.  He's  the chair of Contemporary Middle East Studies at the London School of  Economics and the author of \"ISIS: A History.\"  </p><p> What's really behind this here?  You have GCC countries, normally should be  united.  In this case, they're all turning their backs except Kuwait,  interestingly, on Qatar at the same time.  </p><p> FAWAZ GERGES, PROFESSOR, LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE:   It's a very serious family dispute.  I think, this thought that triggered  the crisis was the summit in Saudi Arabia, as in Trump.  And basically, he  wants a broad coalition, not only against ISIS but also against Iran.  </p><p> The emir of Qatar, Thani, was very unhappy.  He went back and he criticized  the American president, he criticized the meeting, some Gulf States.  And  he said, well, look, Iran should not be turned into a hostile state.  That  was really the hair that broke the camel's back and has fathered the whole  crisis.  </p><p> But this goes back to 2014.  The reality is, I mean, I think what Qatar is  trying to do, Hala, is trying to really play a bigger role in the Middle  East by supporting Islamist groups throughout the region -- the Muslim  Brotherhood, Hamas, Islamists in Libya -- who are seen as this trap by the  pivotal states -- Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates.  </p><p> [15:45:06] What you will have now is that Qatar is isolated.  Qatar is in  the eye of the storm.  Not just physically but even politically and  diplomatically, they are pressuring Qatar to really change its behavior and  accept the consensus in the Gulf and the Arab world.  </p><p> GORANI:  So I'm getting this news, urgent, which is -- sorry, apologies,  I'm looking down.  The Kuwaiti emir has spoken out.  So Kuwait and Oman are  the two countries in the Gulf that has not cut ties with Qatar.  </p><p> Potentially, Kuwait would play a mediating role.  It looks like that's  what's happening.  The emir of Kuwait has urged Qatar's emir to exercise  self-restraint and refrain from steps that would escalate the situation.   So it appears as though, at least, from some members of the GCC, there's an  attempt to mend fences here.  </p><p> GERGES:  That's exactly what happened in 2014.  Saudi Arabia broke  diplomatic relations with Qatar.  It took nine months and the Kuwaitis  stepped in and brokered a settlement between Saudi Arabia and Qatar.  Saudi  Arabia now says, look, Qatar has not basically charged its obligations.  </p><p> In fact, if you read carefully, it's really amazing, Hala.  If you read  carefully what the Saudis and the Egyptians and the Emirates and the  Bahrainis, they accuse Qatar of supporting terrorist groups, including al  Qaeda and ISIS.  They accuse Qatar of conspiring against the national  security of Saudi Arabia and Egypt.  They accuse Qatar of supporting the  Houthis in Yemen.  </p><p> So this is a serious situation.  My take on it, the Kuwaitis will not be  able to do what they did in 2014 because neither Saudi Arabia --</p><p> GORANI:  But this is just a pretext, isn't it?  I mean, it's the fact that  the emir in Qatar made those comments that were broadcast, by the way, by  the state-run Qatari agency, later said to be fake and that they were  hacked, essentially in support of more openness toward Iran.  And this  tremendously angered the Saudis --</p><p> GERGES:  Absolutely.  </p><p> GORANI:  -- for whom their bete noire in the region is Iran.  </p><p> GERGES:  Iran is an existential enemy for Saudi Arabia.  Iran really is a  very, very important rival for Saudi Arabia.  The fact that the emir of  Qatar -- this is not the first time.  The Saudis did not really buy the  denial by the emir of Qatar.  </p><p> The reality is, this particular crisis today will not be resolved in the  same way that it was in 2014 --</p><p> GORANI:  But Qatar can't afford it.  It cannot afford to be isolated.  </p><p> GERGES:  Absolutely.  </p><p> GORANI:  I mean, it's a big gas producer and the rest of it, but it still  needs to trade with its partners.  It still needs to have open borders.  I  mean, they actually are throwing people out of --</p><p> GERGES:  Not only that, Hala.  </p><p> GORANI:  -- GCC countries that are Qatari also.  </p><p> GERGES:  Not only that.  Qatar has land borders with Saudi Arabia.  It's  the only land crossing Saudi Arabia.  It's physically isolated.  It's  bleeding.  I mean, it suffocates without the land.  That's it.  </p><p> Not only that, can Qatar afford to take on Egypt and Saudi Arabia, two  pivotal states in the region, given the fact that this coalition is  empowered?  My take on it, the Qataris will finally accept the terms made  by the Saudis.  </p><p> GORANI:  And what are the terms?  What are the terms, then?  </p><p> GERGES:  Desist from supporting Islamists, the Muslim Brotherhood and other  Islamists in the region.  Accept the consensus in the Gulf and in Egypt  about Iran being a rival and it should be confronted.  And also not to use  Al Jazeera.  It sponsors Al Jazeera, one of the most important satellite  stations, to criticize not only the Gulf States but also Egypt.  </p><p> These are very, very, I mean, important terms.  And my take on it, Qatar is  in a very weak position now.  </p><p> GORANI:  Yes.  </p><p> GERGES:  What choices, what card does it have?  They feel --</p><p> GORANI:  Well, it wants to be a world power.  It wants to hold the World  Cup.  It wants to be this big player.  But in the end, it's a tiny country.  </p><p> GERGES:  It really is.  And this is --</p><p> GORANI:  And if it doesn't have the support of its neighbors, what does it  have?  </p><p> GERGES:  And that's why the only card that Qatar has now are the American  bases in Qatar.  But even the Americans, the emir of Qatar criticized  President Trump.  There are major tensions between, I mean, the Trump  administration and Qatar.  </p><p> GORANI:  Last question.  After the Donald Trump visit, did this embolden  these countries to do what they did just now?  </p><p> GERGES:  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, what President Trump did basically to  really accept the strategic view of Saudi Arabia as the pivotal state in  the region, along with Egypt.  And this is why, now, they have Qatar where  they want it to be, in a corner.  It's squeezed and basically, they would  like to force Qatar to change its behavior in the region, not just in the  Gulf itself.  </p><p> GORANI:  Fawaz Gerges, as always, great pleasure having you on.  Thank you  very much.  </p><p> Coming up, London unbowed.  The U.K. capital shows its resilience.  People  head back to work following the terrorist attack.  We'll have reaction from  the streets of Central London.  We'll be right back.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [15:51:29] GORANI:  The streets of London are changing in the face of this  terrorist attack.  Barriers have been erected on some of the city's bridges  as authorities respond to the second attack in London where vehicles were  used as a weapon on a bridge.  You see it there on London Bridge.  It's a  difficult balance -- no, I should say that's Westminster Bridge, apologies.  </p><p> It's a difficult balance as they try to protect the innocent without making  them feel under a siege.  There are also calls for all police to be armed,  but the head of the Metropolitan Police and, in fact, it should be said, a  lot of Britons disagree.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CRESSIDA DICK, COMMISSIONER, METROPOLITAN POLICE SERVICE:  Those people who  carried out this attack wants to change our society forever.  I don't think  we want arms to the police officers or military standing on all our street  corners as an example.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GORANI:  As officials try to walk the fine line between ramping up security  and keeping society fundamentally unchanged, Londoners are keeping calm and  trying to carry on, as the expression goes.  </p><p> Fred Pleitgen is here with me.  He was out in the streets of London today.  </p><p> FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes,  absolutely.  And that's exactly what people are doing, they're keeping calm  and carrying on.  </p><p> I do have to say that we spoke to many people, especially around the London  Bridge area, many people who were going to their, obviously, first morning  commute on a Monday, and there were some who did say that they are more  concerned than they were before because, also, there had been, you know, so  many attacks in the past 10 weeks here in Britain.  </p><p> So that's something that did concern people.  But by and large, they were  very defiant and said, of course, the city is going to carry on.  Here's  what we saw.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Meticulously looking for even the tiniest clues,  forensic workers comb through the scene of Saturday's terror attack.  But  just a few yards away, the city is getting back to its normal pace,  commuters rushing to work, one of London's ways of defying the third act of  terrorism since April.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think over the weekend, the coverage and there are  a number of people that talks about London as being determined.  And I  think that's absolutely what we are.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The English are used to it.  It's something that we  just come together at times like this and just carry on.  </p><p> PLEITGEN (voice-over):  The terrorists plowed through London with a van on  Saturday night, hitting many people, killing at least seven.  </p><p> On Monday, the grief and sorrow still very present.  Many stopping and  laying flowers at the edge of the crime scene, some overcome with emotion.   There is more police on the streets for extra security but otherwise, the  city is barely missing a beat.  </p><p> PLEITGEN (on camera):  There was incredible carnage here on London Bridge  as the van apparently swerved from side to side trying to hit as many  people as possible.  But only two days later, the bridge is open once  again, with people walking across, enjoying the London skyline.  </p><p> PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Defiant in the aftermath, defiant during the  attack.  Romanian baker, Florin Morariu, is being hailed as a hero for  hitting one of the attackers in the head with a basket to save people  hiding in the store he works at.  </p><p> FLORIN MORARIU, BAKER:  I have two baskets, yes.  I need to take on two  baskets, yes.  One is (inaudible) is no -- it's like that these guys, yes.   Number two basket is delivered in the face, yes.  </p><p> PLEITGEN (on camera):  You hit him in the face with the basket?  </p><p> MORARIU:  Yes.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Come with me.  </p><p> MORARIU:  What are you doing (ph)?  Stop.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Pick that up (ph).  Somebody take it with me.  He's  stabbed.  </p><p> MORARIU:  Here, take this.  Take this, yes.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Florin Morariu also recorded the moments  immediately afterwards, the chaos and the carnage.  He says he doesn't feel  like a hero.  </p><p> MORARIU:  It's not about threat.  Maybe it's my father, maybe it's my  brother in this moment, yes?  If possible help, help.  </p><p> [15:55:01] PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Keep calm and carry on, they say in  Britain.  And that's exactly what London is doing, the residents and the  tourists appreciating their city and its many attractions even more after a  tough weekend.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PLEITGEN:  So you see Londoners carrying on as best as they can.  There is  a lot of grief, there is a lot of sorrow, but, of course, there is also a  lot of defiance.  And by the way, one thing that we didn't see is -- London  Bridge actually partially open to traffic.  </p><p> GORANI:  Yes.  </p><p> PLEITGEN:  One lane or one side is open to traffic.  No additional barriers  yet, but I'm sure that, especially there, some will come up pretty shortly.  </p><p> GORANI:  Yes.  So the ones we were showing our viewers were at Westminster  Bridge.  </p><p> PLEITGEN:  Yes.  </p><p> GORANI:  That's where the attack happened about 2 1/2 months ago in March,  outside of Westminster.  And the role of the police has been highlighted  quite a lot.  I mean, they have really just been described as heroes in  many cases.  When you spoke to people, what did say they wanted from the  authorities?  </p><p> PLEITGEN:  I think that a lot of them felt that the police reacted very  adequately.  I think that some of them who we spoke to said, look, they're  feeling a little bit of unease because these plots were able to able.  And  I think that has more to do probably with intelligence and others to have  worked rather than with the police work actually once something does  happen.  </p><p> GORANI:  Yes.  </p><p> PLEITGEN:  I think the reaction of the police force was something that  people were very pleased with, but they said, look, they had really hoped  that something just would have been discovered early on.  </p><p> But I think most people understand that when you have things like this,  plots like this, you know, with using a vehicle instead of a bomb, that is  so rudimentary, so difficult to detect, I think they understand it's pretty  hard to stop something like that altogether.  </p><p> GORANI:  All right.  Yes, and we've seen it in other places, Nice to  Berlin, and now in London.  Thanks very much, Fred Pleitgen.  </p><p> The attack is far from the first time the city has had to face adversity.   There was obviously the Blitz when thousands of German bombs rained down on  London, killing thousands and causing massive damage.  And then there were  decades of attacks from Irish Republicans.  Both times, the city rebuilt.   It moved on.  </p><p> So when a newspaper suggested London was reeling after Saturday evening,  they replied the way they know best, with sarcasm.  The hash tag, \"Things  that leave Britain reeling,\" filled with comments, such as, \"Not catching  someone's name and having to spend the next three decades avoiding  introducing them to anyone.\"  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> GORANI:  I've been there.  And \"People who stand to the left on the Tube  escalator.  Things that leave Britain reeling.\"  Don't get me started on  that.  </p><p> Thanks for watching this hour of special coverage.  I'll be back on the  other side of this break with more.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [16:00:03] GORANI:  Tonight, Britain's prime minister vows to crack down on  extremism as security services race to investigate the country's third  terrorist attack in three months.</p><p> Good evening from London.  I'm Hala Gorani.  Police have identified now all  three assailants in Saturday's attack and they have named two of them.  </p><p> On the left, a well-known character, Khuram Shahzad Butt, a British  citizen, born in Pakistan, who's even been in television documentaries.  On  the right, Rachid Redouane, who police say, claimed to be Moroccan and  Libyan and not known by authorities, we understand.  </p><p> Police are holding 11 people, following arrests in two locations.  A 12th  person arrested Sunday has been released.  Authorities say they don't  believe there any additional attackers at large.</p><p> The terrorist threat level remains at severe as new security measures are  being introduced, and those include extra barriers installed on bridges.   You see it there.  Didn't happen after the Westminster attack, but it's  happening now.</p><p> The prime minister, Theresa May, called for a renewed crackdown on  terrorism, online and on the street.  It was a harsher message than the one  she had delivered after the attacks in Manchester.</p><p> Theresa May warned there has been far too much acceptance of extremism.   Listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  THERESA MAY, PRIME MINISTER OF THE UNITED KINGDOM:  But as the threat  evolves, our response must do so too.  We cannot go on as we are.  Enough  is enough.</p><p> We must do more, much more, to take on and to defeat the evil ideology of  Islamist extremism that preaches hatred, sows division and promotes  sectarianism.</p><p> It is an ideology that promotes a false choice between our Western values  of freedom, democracy and human rights and the religion of Islam.  It is a  perversion of Islam and a perversion of the truth.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GORANI:  CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank is learning more about the  attackers.</p><p> All right.  Let's talk about first Khuram Butt, well known.</p><p> PAUL CRUICKSHANK, CNN TERRORISM ANALYST:  Well known, 27 years old, born in  Pakistan, came to the UK.  And at certain point became influenced by the  British extremist group, al-Muhajiroun.  That's a group that supports ISIS.   You see him on the left-hand side of the screen there.  </p><p> How do we know that he joined this group?  Well, our very own Sandi Sidhu,  a CNN reporter, spent 2014, 2015, 2016 reporting on this group and met him  several times while she was reporting on the group, describing him as  quiet, spoken, somebody that led the proselytizing that this group did to  others, but somebody who was very committed to the cause, Hala.</p><p> He's also appeared in a Channel 4 documentary, if you can believe that,  Jihadi Next Door.  You see video of this documentary.</p><p> GORANI:  That's him there in the foreground.</p><p> CRUICKSHANK:  There he is right there with the black flag, a black jihadi  style flag just before that video - in the actual video, you can hear that  one of the preachers there say that they want to unfurl that jihadi flag on  the top of 10 Downing Street.  This is in Regents Park in London, just  outside Regents Park mosque.</p><p> This is a very visible manifestation of radicalization.  He was on the  radar screen of British security services, of the police.  And so, there  are a lot of questions now from the Muslim community who are saying, we  warned you about this guy again and again and again.</p><p> We warned you about this group again and again and again.  Why didn't you  go after them?  Well, they went after the leader of the group, Anjem  Choudary.  They arrested him.</p><p> GORANI:  He's in prison.</p><p> CRUICKSHANK:  He's in jail.</p><p> GORANI:  Let's be blunt here.  This is a guy unfurling an ISIS flag in  Regents Park in London.  His neighbors, two of them that we know of at  least, went to the cops and said this guy is trying to - is radical.</p><p> One of them, in fact, said he tried to radicalize my child.  He was thrown  out of his local mosque for being too extreme.  This doesn't look good for  authorities, right?  You could not be a more public extremist than this  guy.</p><p> CRUICKSHANK:  You could not.  Appearing in a Channel 4 - that's one of the  main channels here - documentary, you could not be more public about your  radicalization.</p><p> One of the things we should point out, it wasn't actually an ISIS flag.  It  is a jihadi-style flag that they unfurled there in Regents Park, a sort of  a hardline symbol that they were putting out there.</p><p> But one of the interesting details we're learning, and this is from our  colleagues, Sandi Sidhu, a CNN journalist who spent time with him a few  years ago, is he was very close to a notorious British ISIS operative,  somebody called Abu Rumaysah, who left the UK in October 2014, joined ISIS.</p><p> And according to the belief of some, (INAUDIBLE) was featured in a ISIS  execution video in January 2016.  That's interesting because, if he has a  very close contact inside ISIS, someone who has moved up the hierarchy  there in the group, could he have been in touch with him in the weeks  before the attack, could he have given encouragement directly from ISIS in  Syria?</p><p> GORANI:  Quick last question on that.  ISIS has claimed responsibility, but  has provided no evidence that they were connected directly.</p><p> Cruickshank:  No evidence whatsoever, but -</p><p> GORANI:  They've claimed a lot of things, including a Manila thing that  ended up being a robbery.</p><p> CRUICKSHANK:  That's absolutely right.  But you have to say that there is a  connection there now because this British fighter Abu Rumaysah, his status  is not known, but believed to be still out there.  Was very close friends  with this individual.</p><p> Could he have found a way to communicate with him in some way?  Is there  some kind of video that's going to come out, like we've seen in the past  after attacks.  But a lot of questions for British authorities.</p><p> And just one thing to add.  I think this is important.  Mohammed Shafiq,  who is the chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation here in the UK, has  just come out with a statement saying that on the day after that terrible  killing of the British solider Lee Rigby in Woolwich in East London in May  2013, he was verbally accosted by this individual, Khuram Butt.</p><p> Butt called him murtad, which is essentially apostate, which the jihadis  believe means you can be killed.  Very, very strong language.  And he was  very upset because Mohammed Shafiq, this Muslim community leader was  speaking out against Anjem Choudary, the leader of the group.</p><p> And Mohammed Shafiq saying, why didn't the Brits take action earlier to go  after this group, al-Muhajiroun.  And I and other CNN colleagues, we've on  many occasions interviewed this guy, Anjem Choudary, before he was jailed.   He was very clear about his support for groups like Al Qaeda, groups like  ISIS, and he has really radicalized a generation of British extremists.</p><p> Half of all the terror plots in which British nationals had a role around  the world and the UK have links to this group, al-Muhajiroun.  Why weren't  they put out of business soon?</p><p> GORANI:  Right, absolutely.  Thanks very much.  Very important question.   Paul Cruickshank, thank you.  The investigation is unfolding against a  politically charged backdrop of bitter dispute between the British prime  minister, London's mayor and the president of the United States.</p><p> For his part, Mayor Sadiq Khan says his city is not getting the funds it  needs to protect itself.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SADIQ KHAN, MAYOR OF LONDON:  We don't receive the right level of funding  as a capital city we should receive.  We receive half of the funds we  should be receiving, 170 million versus 370 million.</p><p> But also, as the capital city, we have other responsibilities from major  events.  There's a big cricket match today to state visits.  Some welcome,  some less so.</p><p> But the fact is, as of yesterday seriously visits some, some less so.  But  the fact is we need to make sure that our police have the resources and  support they need.  And as the mayor, my job is to make sure our city is  safe.</p><p> And I will do my best as the mayor to be an advocate and a champion for our  police to get the tools they need.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GORANI:  Well, Prime Minister Theresa May says London's mayor is doing a  good job after President Trump launched two Twitter attacks against the  mayor.  Here's the comment Mr. Trump took issue with.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KHAN:  Londoners will see an increased police presence today and over the  course of the next few days.  No reason to be alarmed.  One of the things  that police and all of us need to do is make sure we're as safe as we  possibly can be.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GORANI:  All right.  You will see increased police presence.  There is no  reason to be alarmed.</p><p> On Monday morning, President Trump wrote, \"pathetic excuse by London Mayor  Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his \"no reason to be alarmed\"  statement.  Mainstream media is working hard to sell it.\"</p><p> It follows an earlier tweet where the president misconstrued those comments  when he urged Londoners not to be alarmed by extra security.  The White  House deputy press secretary insisted that president, after all of this,  after those tweets and everything he said about the mayor, was not trying  to pick a fight.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  I don't see that the  president is picking a fight with the mayor on London.  I think, again, the  president's point is something he said frankly back - gosh, it's been  almost two years now, a year-and-a-half ago when the president talked about  how we have to be more committed to national security.</p><p> One of the reasons we have the travel ban here through that executive order  is a focus on national security.  That was the point he was trying to make.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GORANI:  That's the explanation from the White House.  Nic Robertson, who  is our international diplomatic editor, he's outside 10 Downing Street.   Stephen Collinson is a CNN White House reporter.  He's in Washington for  us.</p><p> [16:10:08] Stephen, I want to start with you.  Why is the president  spending so much time thinking about the mayor of London?</p><p> STEPHEN COLLINSON, \"CNN POLITICS\" SENIOR REPORTER:  Good point.  You would  think, at the height of a terror attack as it was unfolding and in the  aftermath, he would be expressing solidarity and working out ways in which  he can help the British.</p><p> But this is Donald Trump.  This is - he is so different than any other kind  of president we've ever seen.  I think one thing to remember is that Donald  Trump doesn't necessarily see world events for what they are.  He sees them  for how they influence and how they affect him.  </p><p> So, as soon as this attack starting unfolding, the weekend, he started  tweeting about his travel ban.  Then on Sunday and Monday, he went into  this attack against Sadiq Khan.</p><p> And the reason is he sees political advantage.  He sees a chance to play to  his base who like the idea of Donald Trump saying that terrorism is taking  place because of political correctness and political leaders around the  world haven't been willing to call out Islam sufficiently.</p><p> So, that's the reason he's doing it.  It's very interesting.  He is a world  leader, but he doesn't behave like one.  He doesn't seem to have any  concept or even care how his remarks might go down over in the United  Kingdom and as we've seen with some of his other comments elsewhere in the  world.</p><p> GORANI:  I guess that's what his supporters like.  Nic Robertson, we heard  from the Prime Minister Theresa May congratulating Sadiq Khan for a job  well done.  That was after two tweets by Donald Trump criticizing Sadiq  Khan.  What do you make of that?  Was she trying to make a point?</p><p> NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:  I think she is trying  to put some political distance between herself and President Trump.</p><p> Look, she's come up for criticism in this election campaign and prior to it  as well for a close association with President Trump being the first world  leader to go visit him in Washington.  Seen together holding hands.</p><p> After that, there was that travel ban put in place or called for by  President Trump.  That resonated terribly here in Britain and it reflected  badly on the Prime Minister at that time.  </p><p> Go back to just a couple of weeks ago - a week or so - last week even  (INAUDIBLE) last week when President Trump announced he was withdrawing  from the climate change agreement.</p><p> Theresa May didn't sign a letter that the French, German and Italian prime  ministers signed condemning or criticizing President Trump for doing this.   She was criticized by the leader of the opposition here, Jeremy Corbyn.  He  criticized her previously for saying that - Britain was surrendering its  security agenda to Donald Trump.</p><p> So, add on top of that when Donald Trump does this and Jeremy Corbyn, the  leader of the opposition, comes out again and says that President Trump  doesn't have the sense to understand how to grasp the nuance of what's  going on here in Britain, Trump becomes part of the election campaign  that's being used against Theresa May.</p><p> She's being criticized by Jeremy Corbyn as well for the cuts on the police  force here.  So, this is part of the opposition's narrative.  The  opposition being the Labour Party, Sadiq Khan being of the Labour Party,  these tweets by President Trump are working against Prime Minister Theresa  May.</p><p> Yet, Donald Trump has said that he supports Theresa May at this time,  supports the British people.  It's perhaps an unintended consequence of his  tweets that this could have an impact on what's becoming a close electoral  race.</p><p> GORANI:  And, Stephen, there were some reports suggesting that Donald Trump  may have been considering a visit to the UK to show support with the  country after the attack.  I take it that's off the table.</p><p> COLLINSON:  Yes, there was some conversation about that on the Sunday talk  shows in the US yesterday.  That was fairly quickly shot down by White  House officials.  You can imagine the thought in Theresa May's mind that  the prospect of a visit from Donald Trump in the week of a British  election.</p><p> But I think what Nic was saying there was right.  Donald Trump has very  little conception about how the things he says play outside the United  States.  You saw after the NATO speech, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel  come out and make statements critical of the United States, implicit  criticism of Trump, because she is facing election and she is facing  candidates who are very critical of Donald Trump, much more critical than  she would like to be.</p><p> We saw Emmanuel Macron, the new French President, criticizing Trump over  the climate issue.  So, these leaders have got their own political things  to worry about.  And Donald Trump, by pushing his own political agenda, is  creating great political problems for them as they try and navigate this  very, very difficult relationship between their countries and the United  States.</p><p> GORANI:  And I found it interesting, Stephen, and Nic as well, in all the  elections we have covered since Donald Trump was elected president, the  populist candidates have actually underperformed the polls.</p><p> [16:15:01] I mean, Stephen, maybe you have a thought on that as well.  It  seems as though perhaps the Trump presidency is harming populist political  candidates in Europe.</p><p> COLLINSON:  Certainly.  And I think there is a real disconnect between the  philosophy that Donald Trump is advancing, this America first,  ultranationalist philosophy, which is calling really the US support for the  West as it has been for the last 70 years into doubt and what people in  Europe think.</p><p> I mean, I was in Berlin very recently and people were seriously considering  the state of Germany's relationship with the United States, and that's  something which would have been unheard of before the Trump presidency,  even when there was angst between Germany and the United States and Europe  and the United States over the Iraq war.</p><p> No one was calling into question the basic assumptions of the post-World  War II international consensus.  That is taking place right now in Europe  and in the foreign policy establishment in the United States, and it's all  because of Donald Trump.</p><p> GORANI:  Stephen Collinson and Nic Robertson, thanks to both of you.   Appreciate it.</p><p> Still to come this hour, Theresa May says the Internet has become a safe  space for terrorists and she is calling on tech companies to do more about  it.  Is it realistic?</p><p> We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GORANI:  Theresa May says much more needs to be done to tackle extremism in  the wake of the attack on Saturday and the two others as well.  The  president - the prime minister, I should say, is now calling out Internet  companies.</p><p> She says they are giving extremist ideologies a place to breed and it is  time governments band together to better regulate cyberspace.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MAY:  I believe it is right that the UK is engaged in taking on and  defeating groups like ISIS and their like around the world.  It is in our  own national interest to do so and it is interest of the wider world.</p><p> But as our efforts to defeat them overseas are ever more successful,  they're increasingly seeking to spread their poisonous ideology and to prey  on the weak and vulnerable in our own countries, inspiring them to commit  acts of terror here at home.  </p><p> They exploit the safe spaces of the Internet and social media and they  exploit them in the real world too.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GORANI:  Jim Killock joins me now.  He is the executive director of Open  Rights Group, which promotes the rights of free speech and privacy online.   Thanks for being with us.</p><p> How realistic is it to ask big tech giants to regulate this type of speech  and close down accounts of known terrorist sympathizers?</p><p> JIM KILLOCK, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, OPEN RIGHTS GROUP:  Well, they do a lot of  this already, so it is realistic to ask them to do something about it, but  I think we have to worry about exactly what Theresa May has in mind because  she is asking them to automate the detection of this material and then  automatically remove it, and to fine those companies if they are not acting  swiftly enough for the government's like.</p><p> [16:20:12] So, that could easily see content that's actually criticizing  these people, but maybe using some of the same images being swept into the  same regime of deletion and censorship.</p><p> And I don't see any sign, at the moment, that they're involving judges or  anybody independent.  They're just asking the companies to start deleting  things.</p><p> GORANI:  But what's the solution then?  What's the realistic solution to  crack down a little bit more on some of these messages?  But not just, I  mean, Islamic, you have hate groups on the far right who spread also quite  reprehensible language, what do you - what is realistic then in your  opinion?  Obviously, not an automated response.</p><p> KILLOCK:  I think automated response is a bad.  I mean, they can be done.   They are just bad.</p><p> I think we have to think about - yes, I'm sure there is more that they can  do to kind of look at this material, to work with government to identify  it.  But we just have to make sure what they do is accountable essentially  because, I think, they are not going to try to do that.</p><p> The other thing is, we have to remember that, companies will try to do this  as cheaply as possible.  And that's maybe one of the problems here.   Already, they use very strict rules that can be applied - done by people  who are very low paid.  They are not looking at context.  They are just  kind of doing things.</p><p> We saw that on the Guardian a few weeks ago.  And those rules can be pretty  arbitrary.  But as you say, there is no way that American companies are  going to want to suddenly sensor a lot of material that's essentially very  similar to views which are seen as reprehensible perhaps, but nevertheless  legal within the USA.</p><p> So, I think this is very, very hard to tackle actually.</p><p> GORANI:  And also, there is the other aspect which is, the more you close  down these accounts, which is a good thing, I'm not saying it's a bad  thing, but the phenomenon then ends up breeding an underground kind of  communication platform on apps like Telegram or these encrypted - end to  end encrypted - right?</p><p> So, you get a lot of those communications that happen anyway.  They just  happen somewhere else.</p><p> KILLOCK:  Exactly.  We have to remember, these people are dedicated to the  form of evil that they want to pursue.  So, if you move them off Facebook,  if you move them off Twitter or YouTube, they're going somewhere else, they  will plot their evil somewhere else.</p><p> And that may even make it worse for the intelligence agencies because if  they are hiding themselves even more effectively because they've been  chased off these platforms that do cooperate with law enforcement, they  could end up with less information.</p><p> So, I think we've got to be really careful here.  I feel that, to a certain  extent, this just looks like something that can be done.  The UK government  can complain to these companies and these companies will want to do  something.  And that makes everyone look good, but it doesn't actually  necessarily help you very much and doesn't necessarily deal with the  problem.</p><p> You have to remember, these are people associated with countries that are  in total chaos.  And I'm not saying that's an easy thing to deal with.   Certainly not.  But we can't expect countries that are effectively beyond  the rule of law - if we leave those countries in that state, we're going to  get terrorism.  It will come back to us.</p><p> So, we have to think a bit more broadly.  And I do feel this is a little  bit of a distraction technique.</p><p> GORANI:  Jim Killock, thanks very much, the executive director of Open  Rights Group.  Thanks for being with us.</p><p> Fighting shock and utter disgust, more than 130 Muslim leaders here in the  UK have signed a letter, saying they will not perform the traditional  Islamic burial prayer for the terrorists.</p><p> I want to bring in Imam Abdul Quddus Arif who joins us in the studio.   Thanks for being with us.</p><p> ABDUL QUDDUS ARIF, IMAM:  Thank you for having me.</p><p> GORANI:  Did you sign that letter?</p><p> ARIF:  I wasn't told about this letter.</p><p> GORANI:  What do you make of it then?  One hundred and thirty Imams and  religious leaders have said these are not deserving, these individuals of  the traditional prayer.</p><p> ARIF:  Well, first of all, let me start by saying that I condemn such  atrocities.  And being part of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, there's no  such thing as these individuals being part of our religion.  Terrorism has  no religion.</p><p> So, if this case has happened where Imams have signed, I will support that.   I don't think -</p><p> GORANI:  In principle, you agree with that then.</p><p> ARIF:  In principle, I agree with them.  (INAUDIBLE) to their families as  well, how they want to bury them.  We can't really impede on their rights  either.</p><p> GORANI:  But an Imam or a religious leader has the right to say, look, I'm  not going to perform this prayer.</p><p> ARIF:  Yes, he has the right to say that.</p><p> GORANI:  Now, to the wider question here, of course, this is the third  attack in two-and-a-half months.  And you heard the police perhaps today  say, well, some in the Muslim community, they need to speak up more, even  though we've been reporting after Manchester and after this attack that  neighbors and sometimes even family members of those who committed the  attack went to authorities.  What's your reaction?</p><p> ARIF:  So, the community that I belong to, it's a proven model how we work.   The Ahmadiyya Muslim community has been here in London for the past  century, and not a single person has been radicalized, not a single person  has committed such atrocities.</p><p> So, there must be something they're doing right.  For example, from a very  young age, we tell our children that you have to make a pledge of  allegiance to your country.  So, you serve country, you serve your nation,  and you serve your faith.</p><p> So, me as a Londoner, serving my faith, serving my - and loving my city are  hand in hand and is part of my faith.  So, this is - from the very  beginning, that's how we are brought up and is a proven model for why  radicalization and terrorism does not happen within our community, the  Ahmadiyya Muslim community.</p><p> GORANI:  But these terrorists, in fact, many of them, stop going to the  mosque altogether.  One of the suspects in the London Bridge attack had  been thrown out of his mosque for being too extreme.  </p><p> So, in a way, this radicalization that happens outside the mosque, how do  you address it in some people?</p><p> ARIF:  So, I think social media has got a lot.  I think you were discussing  it before as well, has a huge role to play.  I think social media companies  need to really crack down on certain accounts.  And we just have to have a  watchful eye.</p><p> I think the government, they should also play their part as well.  For  example, if someone they know is under - very suspicious, they should keep  an eye on him for more than -</p><p> GORANI:  It's just a question of staff or they say we just don't have  enough to monitor 23,000 potential -</p><p> ARIF:  The government's main responsibility is what?  To protect its  citizens, to safeguard their rights.  So, if we need to put more budget  into it, we should do that.  But we cannot allow a suspicious person to  walk free or just carry on doing his own activities.</p><p> If you have to put sanctions on that individual, you should do that.   Whatever the government, it's best to do so.  But it's important that these  measures are taken because always afterwards we have the case where we find  authorities always say that that person was under watch.</p><p> Well, yes, he was under watch.  Maybe the same should have been longer,  maybe up to two years even to - it requires a lot of resources.  But the  predominant thing is the government's responsibility is safeguarding its  people.</p><p> GORANI:  I see you have a T-shirt there, but I'm not sure what's written on  it.</p><p> ARIF:  So, this is a campaign that we were doing, today even at the vigil  where hundreds of Muslims, they came down at the vigil.</p><p> GORANI:  I am a Muslim.  #IAmAMuslim.  What's the purpose?</p><p> ARIF:  So, it's basically ask me anything.</p><p> GORANI:  OK.</p><p> ARIF:  So, they were standing in solidarity with all the Londoners.  London  is our city.  We love it.  Like I said, we love our city.  We love our  faith as well.  So, we're not apologetic about being Muslims either.</p><p> So, it was (INAUDIBLE) for the public to say that, you know, ask us about  Islam if you have questions about it.  It's a source for media -</p><p> GORANI:  You're put in a position where essentially the Muslim community,  you feel like you are forced into the position of having to explain over  and over and over again.  We do not support terrorism, this is not our  message, we do not support these acts.  Does it get tiring after a while?</p><p> ARIF:  It doesn't get tiring.  It's an opportunity to explain once again  what true Islam is.  </p><p> GORANI:  Right.</p><p> ARIF:  Coming together, showing solidarity as part of our faith as well as  (INAUDIBLE).  And it's nice when we go out into the street, it's a reaction  we get, we get people shaking our hands, we get people hugging us and  saying that you guys are doing a wonderful job and you're going to have to  come out.</p><p> But it's those reactions that we really - we enjoy.  And it was amazing  tonight as well that when we - I've come literally from there.  That's why  I might be a bit wet as well because it was raining.  </p><p> But we were there in numbers.  We had our love for all, hatred for none  posters up.  And we as the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, we really wanted to  show to the world, not in our name, as the mayor of London said as well.</p><p> Imam Abdul Quddus Arif, thank you so much for joining us on CNN.  We  appreciate your visit.</p><p> Coming up, London's defiant response.  The city replaces scenes of violence  with some tales of solidarity that we'll share with you.  Do stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GORANI:  Britain is coming to terms with the terrorist attack on its soil  in as many months.  Amid the horror of Saturday night, many stories of  bravery and solidarity are emerging, as is often the case after a tragedy.   Fred Pleitgen has our story.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Meticulously looking for even the tiniest clues.  Forensic workers comb  through the scene of Saturday's terror attack.</p><p> But just a few yards away, the city is getting back to its normal pace,  commuters rushing to work, one of London's ways of defying the third act of  terrorism since April.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think, over the weekend, the coverage - and there  are a number of people that talked about London as being determined.  And I  think that's absolutely what we are.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The English are used to it.  It's something that we  just - we've just come together at times like this and just carry on.</p><p> PLEITGEN:  The terrorists plowed through London with a van on Saturday  night hitting many people, killing at least seven.</p><p> On Monday, the grief and sorrow still very present, many stopping and  laying flowers at the edge of a crime scene, some overcome with emotion.</p><p> There is more police on the streets for extra security, but otherwise the  city is barely missing a beat.</p><p> (on-camera):  There was incredible carnage here on London Bridge as the van  apparently swerved from side to side trying to hit as many people as  possible.  But only two days later, the bridge is open once again with  people walking across enjoying the London skyline.</p><p> (voice-over):  Defiance in the aftermath, defiance during the attack.</p><p>Romanian baker Florin Morariu is being hailed as a hero for hitting one of  the attackers in the head with a basket to save people hiding in the store  he works at.</p><p> FLORIN MORARIU, BAKER:  I have two basket, yes.  So, I've got two basket,  yes.  One is give, yes, is no (INAUDIBLE) these guys, yes.  Number two  basket is delivered on the face, yes.</p><p> PLEITGEN:  You hit him in the face with a basket.</p><p> MORARIU:  Yes.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  ...take it with me.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Take this.  Take this, yes.</p><p> PLEITGEN:  Florin Morariu also recorded the moments immediately afterwards,  the chaos and the carnage.  He says he doesn't feel like a hero.</p><p> MORARIU:  It's normal.  Maybe it's my father, maybe it's my brother in this  moment, yes.  It's possible help, help.</p><p> PLEITGEN:  Keep calm and carry on, they say, in Britain, and that's exactly  what London is doing, the residents and the tourists, appreciating their  city and its many attractions even more after a tough weekend.</p><p> Fred Pleitgen, CNN, London.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GORANI:  Well, a few hours ago, the London mayor Sadiq Khan led a minute of  silence in memory of those killed during the attack.  A vigil was held at  Potters Fields Park, close to the site of that rampage.</p><p> Let's go to our own Melissa Bell.  She is there.  Tell us a little bit  about how this day - this tribute really unfolded today.</p><p> MELISSA BELL, CNN PARIS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it was remarkable, the crowds  that were here, Hala, given the windy and rainy conditions which continue  even now.</p><p> And you can see just behind me the flowers that were laid by those who  gathered here at 6 p.m.  this evening London time, just shy of the 48-hour  mark since those shocking attacks on London Bridge, not very far away.  </p><p> [16:30:01] We're right in front of Town Hall.  This is Sadiq Khan's office.   And his message to the crowd as he led that minute of silence really  reflected the view of so many people who turned up here, many of them  British Muslims who've come to say not in my name.</p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KHAN:  This is our city.  These are our values and this is our way of life.   London will never be broken by terrorism.  We will step up the fight  against extremism and we will defeat the terrorists.  Thank you.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BELL:  I am, he said, a proud and patriotic British Muslim.  And he spoke  directly to those attackers, saying you do not act in my name.  And that  was really the sense of what so many people who turned up here today wanted  to say a group of imams who cheered as they laid flowers of this makeshift  memorial just behind me.</p><p> Tomorrow, that minute of silence will be nationwide, Hala, as the entire  country remembers those who died so tragically on Saturday night.</p><p> GORANI:  And just ordinary people going to work for the first time today on  Monday after the attack, especially those around the London Bridge area,  what are they saying about this new reality they've woken up to on the  first day of the week.</p><p> BELL:  I think there is this great sense of shock not just at what happened  Saturday night, but as you've been saying, Hala, this new reality that  seems to be the one that everyone is trying to come to terms with, as  difficult as that is, three terrorist attacks in three months.  It is  simply not what Britain had become used to.  </p><p> It had largely been spared these last two years the horrors that we've seen  in Continental Europe.  And I think there is at once that sense of  disbelief, but also that sense of unity, of solidarity, of coming together  to bring another message of what London can represent.  </p><p> And I think one of the things that I have heard over and over again is  we've begun to hear about some of the names of those who've lost their  lives.  They may come from all over the world - Canadians, Australians,  French people, Germans have been victim in one way or another of this  attack, and it's a reminder really of all that London represents.</p><p> It's an extraordinarily cosmopolitan city, and I think that there is a  tremendous amount of pride in the spirit really that's been shown since  those attacks, and in particular today as London went back to work, as  London tried to go about its business, at once digested what had happened  and trying to come to terms with that dreadful new reality, but also I  think trying to show that it is stronger in a sense of the hatred - of the  hatred that was demonstrated so tragically on London Bridge Saturday night,  Hala.</p><p> GORANI:  All right, Melissa.  And tomorrow, of course, we'll be covering  that tribute, that minute's silence across the country.  Thank you.</p><p> Still to come.  Airlines have suspended flights to Qatar as the diplomatic  rift between neighbors threatens the stability of the Gulf region.  That's  next.  Richard Quest joins me.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [16:40:08] GORANI:  Six countries, including Saudi Arabia, and Egypt have  cut diplomatic with Qatar.  They accuse the Gulf state of supporting  terrorism and destabilizing the region.</p><p> Qatar said the move was unjustified, but the repercussions are already  being felt.  All transport routes by land, air, and sea into Qatar have  been blocked.</p><p> And you can see it on the map there.  Qatar is not a huge country, to say  the least.  The Dubai's Emirate and Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways are  suspending flights to and from Doha.</p><p> Some residents in Qatar have begun stocking up on food as the crisis  escalates.  A third of the country's food imports come from Saudi Arabia  and the UAE.  That will end now.</p><p> Air travelers could face significant disruption across the Gulf region.   Richard Quest joins me now from Cancun, Mexico, where airline bosses are  gathered for a major industry event.</p><p> Just sitting in for you for the day.  Richard, you had an opportunity to  speak with Qatar Airways, the CEO, off-camera.  What did he tell you about  this?  This has to be terrible news for his industry.</p><p> RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  It is.  He  described it as a crisis.  And he is in Egypt on his way back to his  country because the reality is - look, I'm here with IATA, which is the  international aviation body for all airlines.</p><p> And this has taken people completely by storm.  And the significance, Hala,  is that the three airlines that are most affected - Qatar Airways, Etihad  and Emirates - they are also three of the largest crossover airlines in the  world at the moment.</p><p> And so, not only now does Qatar Airways have to route itself different ways  to get to and from Doha, but also it is going to be very difficult for  those three lines to interact, to actually fly between each other's  countries, and I think you're looking at a sizable disruption of aviation,  certainly in that part of the world for the foreseeable future.</p><p> Here at IATA in Cancun, people are absolutely astounded by what's taken  place.</p><p> GORANI:  Right.  I mean, this is going to hurt Qatar Airways more than its  competition in the Gulf, right?  Because Qatar Airways is not going to able  to fly any of these countries that have cut diplomatic ties with Doha.</p><p> And that has to - I mean, I don't know exactly what percentage of its  market that is, but it would have to be a huge chunk of it.</p><p> QUEST:  It is.  That inter-GCC travel, basically Qatar Airways, like all  the Gulf carriers, is a sixth freedom carrier.  The passengers come in, the  passengers go out to different parts of the world.</p><p> But Qatar also connects people through the Gulf on to other parts of the  world.  So, yes, I would expect, coming on top of the laptop ban, which is  affecting its US routes very badly indeed, I would expect this to have a  dramatic effect.</p><p> Quite simply, it's not going to go out of business, Qatar Airways, but I  would certainly expect it to go into heavy losses and need much government  support.</p><p> GORANI:  All right.  Thanks very much, Richard Quest.  And we'll see you  back very soon on Quest Means Business.</p><p> Now, the move to isolate Qatar could have far-reaching repercussions.   Qatar is home to the largest American military base in the Middle East and  it is set to host the World Cup in 2022.</p><p> Mahjoob Zweiri is professor of Middle East politics at Qatar University and  he joins me from Doha, the Qatari capital.  What's really behind this?   What's really behind this GCC move, do you think?</p><p> MAHJOOB ZWEIRI, PROFESSOR OF MIDDLE EAST POLITICS, QATAR UNIVERSITY:  I  think there was a major political shift post what's so-called Arab Spring,  where every country in GCC has chosen different position.</p><p> And that positioning their political side, this contributes to this kind of  fragmentation, of division on where things should go in the region.</p><p> It is a ramification.  It is an important ramification of what happens in  the region post-2010 present.  And I think that's the reason.</p><p> What we see today is the second chapter of this crisis that started in  2014, lasted for eight months.  And this is the second chapter of it, where  basically Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates has chosen to maintain the  status quo in the region, maintaining the situation in Egypt, maintaining  the situation in Yemen.</p><p> However, Qatar has chosen a different choice.  And at least according to  their statesmen, they want to support the willing of people in different  places.  </p><p> GORANI:  Sorry to jump in there.  The hay that broken the camel's back was  when the Emir of Qatar was quoted as saying - by the way, they then claimed  that the state news website was hacked - that Iran shouldn't necessarily be  isolated.  Paraphrasing what he said.</p><p> And that to Saudi Arabia was unacceptable.  It's clear.</p><p> [16:45:10] ZWEIRI:  Again, the issue of hacking the news agency, that's the  story which is -according to the sources in Doha, it's been manufactured to  cause all of this crisis.  </p><p> Qatar does not deny that it as a diplomatic relation with Iran.  However,  the relation, as an observer, I see as not developing since 2010 because of  the situation in Syria.</p><p> If you look at the relation, for example, between United Arab Emirates and  Iran, it's more progress economically and politically than Doha/Tehran.  </p><p> And still, the relation, no one asks, for example, United Arab Emirates to  cut the relation with Tehran.  No one asks, for example, Oman to do so.</p><p> I think the issue of Iran and the whole story here is being added just to  lead to more pressure on Qatar politically because, as an expert in the  region, the relation has not developed a lot between Doha and Tehran in the  last five, six years.</p><p> GORANI:  But here's the thing, though, the other countries can afford to  cut ties with Qatar.  Qatar can't afford not to have ties with the other  countries.  It cannot be isolated like this.</p><p> It wants to host the World Cup.  It wants to have a voice on the world  stage.  It doesn't have a choice here, but to bow to the pressure, right?</p><p> ZWEIRI:  Again, as an observer, this is the first day of the crisis.  I  think - I assume, according to what I read in the last 13, 14 hours, that  there was all plan Bs for a lot of items according to the food supply, for  the contractors, there is a lot of preparation.</p><p> They learned the lesson from 2014 crisis.  Even in the street, I was just -  came back from one of the malls.  I didn't see any of the images, for  example, broadcast in social media.  People, they are shopping because it  is Ramadan and people normally choose specific hours to shop, which  basically - it shows that there is a traffic.</p><p> GORANI:  So, there is no panic is what you're saying?  These images on  social media misrepresent what's going on.</p><p> ZWEIRI:  I have not seen - I have not seen it myself.  I went out.  I just  came back from actually doing my shopping for my family.  I haven't seen  such thing on at least two of the malls I was there.</p><p> So, I think this tells me -</p><p> GORANI:  I'm glad you cleared that up.  I'm glad you cleared that up.  We  have seen these images, but you're right, it is Ramadan, and after all,  people stock up on food when they break their fast.</p><p> ZWEIRI:  As you know, Hala, sometimes people, they choose the time before  Iftar - they want to pick everything for after Iftar which caused a lot of  people crowding on malls and supermarkets.</p><p> GORANI:  And let's talk again, maybe in a few days and see how the reaction  has developed or evolved among ordinary Qataris and residents of Qatar.</p><p> ZWEIRI:  We'll keep our eyes on the situation.  </p><p> GORANI:  Absolutely.  Thank you, Mahjoob Zweiri of Qatar University.</p><p> ZWEIRI:  My pleasure, Hala.</p><p> GORANI:  Donald Trump is using the London terror attack to drum up support  for his executive order on immigration, affecting several mostly-Muslim  countries.</p><p> And one of his tweets this Monday, Mr. Trump referred to the order of the  travel ban.  Now, that appears to contradict his own administration, which  said many times this is not a ban, but a temporary pause among other names  and argued that it does not target Muslims.</p><p> Well, a few hours ago, the White House defended the president's latest  tweets.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SANDERS:  I don't think the president cares what you call it, whether you  call it a ban, whether you call it a restriction.  He cares that we call it  national security and that we take steps to protect the people of this  country.</p><p> It's real simple.  Everybody wants to get into the labels and the semantics  of it, but the bottom line is, he's trying to protect the citizens of this  country.  The danger is extremely clear.  The law is very clear.  And the  nature of this executive order is very clear.  And the president's priority  in protecting the people is very clear.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GORANI:  Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy press secretary.  Ariane de  Vogue is in Washington.  So, Ariane, we know several courts have struck  down this travel ban.  I mean, I am not sure.  Maybe we can call it that,  now that the president himself calls it that.</p><p> How will this affect the administration's appeal to the Supreme Court?</p><p>ARIANE DE VOGUE, CNN SUPREME COURT REPORTER:  It will definitely complicate  the job of the legal challengers, right?  Because below the challengers  have said, look, we won and we won because we could show that this was an  intent to ban Muslims.</p><p> And what did they use for their justification?  They used campaign  statements, right?  They used what the president said during the campaign.</p><p> [16:50:01] So, now, you have the Department of Justice lawyers and you have  these new tweets, and the Department of Justice lawyers, they have bent  over backwards to say, look, you have got to disregard those campaign  statements, disregard the tweets, look just at what the ban is.</p><p> And on its face, they say, it's religiously neutral and it targets national  security.  Plus, they say, we've come up with this revised ban.  It's  different than the ban that was first put out.</p><p> So, what did these tweets do at the end of the day.  The president, he sort  of dismisses the difference, right, between those two bans and also he kind  of says that his lawyers are simply making politically correct statements  to please the courts.</p><p> So, that can't be good for the Department of Justice lawyers.  And at the  end of the day, you ask will it matter?  And that depends if the justices  of the Supreme Court choose to look at these statements, the campaign  statements, the tweets, and if they choose to take those into  consideration.</p><p> GORANI:  But how is this going to change the way the Justice Department  lawyers are going to argue this case with the Supreme Court because it's  almost - I mean, it's almost an impossible task to argue it's not a ban  when the president himself several times tweets, after he's elected, it is  a ban.</p><p> DE VOGUE:  Well, the president can say, look, it's a travel ban.  What he  can't say is that it's a Muslim ban.</p><p> But I'll tell you, what's going on right now is the challengers have a  deadline from the Supreme Court and they have to reply to - send their  reply briefs and they've already gone on Twitter because now everybody  seems to use Twitter, and they're going to - and they've said, look, we're  going to use these tweets against him because what they suggest is that the  tweets show he's in bad faith.</p><p> He keeps saying that there is a national security justification for this.   But they say that, in fact, it's a veiled attack on Muslims.  And that's  why they think they'll their case before the Supreme Court.  </p><p> GORANI:  Ariane de Vogue, thanks very much, our Supreme Court  correspondent.</p><p> Coming up, we're learning more about those who lost their lives or got hurt  in the London attack.  We'll bring you their stories next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GORANI:  There was some heroism amid the horror.  Witnesses to the London  attack say quick action by police saved lives.  Liam Connell, who was at a  nearby bar when the chaos broke out, had this to say about them.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LIAM CONNELL, EYEWITNESS:  (INAUDIBLE) and it wasn't actually until we got  up that I kind of realized how bad it was because my friends told me that  there was someone behind us too that had actually been outside.</p><p> GORANI:  And what did you see when you finally left the bar?</p><p> CONNELL:  We just kind of ran.  I mean, the police were there the whole  way.  They helped us the whole way.  They were there.  And everyone was  saying thank you to them.  Everyone was so, so grateful to them.  </p><p> Even though everyone wanted to leave (INAUDIBLE) after all these police  with guns were around, no one panicked.  No one was pushing or shoving.   Everyone was just (INAUDIBLE) to leave almost.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> [16:55:13] GORANI:  Seven people were killed, 48 injured in the attack.   Erin McLaughlin has some of their stories.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  We're beginning to learn  more about some of the victims killed that horrific night.  </p><p> Chrissy Archibald is the first to be named, a Canadian national, who moved  to Europe to be with her fiance.  She helped a homeless.  She was there  with her fiance on the London Bridge when the terrorist van struck and  killed her.  The family releasing a statement saying she was beautiful and  loving.  She would never have understood the kind of callous cruelty that  claim her life.</p><p> We're also hearing of heroic acts that night.  Journalist Geoff Ho was at a  restaurant in the Borough Market when the assailant arrived.  He intervened  to help a bounced when he was stabbed by one of the terrorists in the neck.</p><p> Social media footage shows him calmly leaving the scene to seek medical  help, bleeding from his neck.  We understand from the newspaper that he  works for that he's OK.</p><p> We're also hearing appeals for help.  Maureen Vincent (ph) is a French  national.  She was at the Borough Market as well, badly wounded by the  terrorists, brought here to the King's College Hospital.  Doctors say that  her injuries are so sever, it will take her some 6 to 12 months to fully  recover, one of the many lives forever altered that tragic night.</p><p> Erin McLaughlin, CNN, London.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GORANI:  Thanks for watching.

The Labour Party is pointing the finger at the Prime Minister for cutting police forces during her time as Home Secretary. London Mayor Sadiq Khan faces the challenge of attacks undermining London's diversity, issuing a strong warning to the perpetrators of Saturday's terror attacks. Pivotal countries in the Persian Gulf are cutting off ties with Qatar, isolating the small nation over accusations of supporting terrorism. Londoners keep calms and carry on as officials try to balance ramping up security and keeping society fundamentally unchanged. Theresa May says the Internet has become a safe space for terrorists and she is calling on tech companies to do more about it; More than 130 Muslim leaders in the UK have signed a letter, saying they will not perform the traditional Islamic burial prayer for the terrorists; London mayor Sadiq Khan leads a minute of silence in memory of those killed during the attack and a vigil held at Potters Fields Park, close to the site of that rampage; Six countries, including Saudi Arabia, and Egypt have cut diplomatic with Qatar, who accuse the Gulf state of supporting terrorism and destabilizing the region; President Trump is using the London terror attack to drum up support for his executive order on immigration, affecting several mostly-Muslim countries and refers to the order a ban.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[15:01:17]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HALA GORANI, CNN ANCHOR: Hello, everyone. I'm Hala Gorani. We are live in London. Thanks for being with us on this Monday. You are watching continuing coverage of the terrorist attack that Britain's prime minister called today an attack on the entire free world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Police have been working around the clock to identify the assailants and now just in the last few hours, we have some photos and names. Two of the three attackers have been publicly identified, on the left, Khuram Shazad Butt, he was British, born in Pakistan, and on the right, Rachid Redouane, who police say claimed to be Moroccan and Libyan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, spoke at a vigil a short time ago and did not hide his disgust.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR SADIQ KHAN, MAYOR: As the mayor of London, I want to send a clear message to the sick and evil extremists who commit these hideous crimes. We will defeat you. You will not win. As a proud and patriotic British Muslim I say this, you do not commit these disgusting acts in my name.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: Police made several more arrests this morning as they expand their search trying to determine whether the attackers who killed seven people were part of a wider network.</p><p>CNN terrorism analysis, Paul Cruickshank is with me in the studio with new details on the attackers and particularly the Khuram Shazad Butt.</p><p>PAUL CRUICKSHANK, CNN TERRORISM ANALYST: Right. Yes, they've identified him as one of the attackers, 27 years old, a British national born in Pakistan, somebody who came over to the U.K. and somebody, we understand, from our very (inaudible), who did a lot of reporting on this group back in 2014, 2015, 2016 and actually met with Khuram Butt several times.</p><p>We understand that he became influenced by the British extremist group, (inaudible), that's a group that has been supportive of ISIS. Its leader, Anjam Choudry (ph), last year was convicted for (inaudible) ISIS sentenced to five years in jail.</p><p>He, Khuram Butt was very much part of this group, was influenced by them. Our colleague, (inaudible), spent time with him, described him as very quiet spoken. He was not really a leader, more like a follower. He really appeared to have become brainwashed by this group's propaganda very, very supportive of ISIS. He was on the radar screen of the police and MI-5 for some time, it appears.</p><p>Rachid Redouane, 30 years old, also from Banking, on the right of the screen, that he was not on the radar screen of either the police or the security services.</p><p>We also found out from a friend at the gym who just recently saw Khuram Butt just a few days ago, just a few days before the attack, that he had recently told this friend that he and his wife had a baby just a few months before this attack. So some very interesting details coming out.</p><p>We understand that Khuram Butt works as a receptionist at a fitness center in east London.</p><p>GORANI: All right, so we have two. Police have not released the name of the third.</p><p>CRUICKSHANK: Police have not released the name of the third as of this point, Hala.</p><p>GORANI: All right, let's go back there because this Khuram Butt now according to the reports I have read several neighbors expressed concern, we understand, reportedly even called authorities.</p><p>[15:05:10]We understand as well that he was thrown out of his local mosque for being too extreme. He was in fact also in a documentary on television last year, \"The Jihadis Next Door.\" This guy was on the radar.</p><p>CRUICKSHANK: Yes. He was not only --</p><p>GORANI: This is not some random guy that nobody has ever heard of.</p><p>CRUICKSHANK: You're right. Not only on the radar screen, but on a major television documentary (inaudible) on Channel 4. Colleagues of us featured several times in that documentary, including during a sequence when several of them unfurled a black flag (inaudible).</p><p>Somebody who was moving in the circle of (inaudible), this pro-ISIS group. This pro-ISIS group in the U.K. as you know has been around for a very long time, since even before 9/11.</p><p>And they've actually been linked to about half of all terrorist plots in the U.K. around the world where British nationals have been involved.</p><p>So a lot of questions to security resources given the fact he was part of this proselytizing group on the streets of Islam and very visible demonstrations --</p><p>GORANI: I mean, if he's unfurling an ISIS flag (inaudible) on television, he is hardly flying under the radar, that's the thing.</p><p>CRUICKSHANK: You better believe it.</p><p>GORANI: Yes, absolutely. Paul Cruickshank, thanks very much for your reporting with that breaking new, the latest on the investigation. We'll be speaking with Paul a little bit later.</p><p>Let's get more now on what police is saying. Samuel Burke is live at Scotland Yard. Tell us more about what police have announced today. We have some important elements here with names and pictures.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Hala. We are learning more about Rachid Redouane, 30 years old, claimed to be Moroccan and Libyan, but more importantly what you and Paul were talking about just now about Khuram Shazad Butt, again, 27 years old, a British citizen, but born in Pakistan.</p><p>And I say more importantly, when talking about him because the folks here at Scotland Yard tell us that he was known by both police and MI-5.</p><p>And this gets to this very important question that is growing here in the U.K. about A, what type of resources the police have, what type of resources have been cut, and B, what they are doing with the information that they do get about these people.</p><p>As you reference, as CNN reporters spoke to a neighbor who claimed that they had flagged up one of these attackers to the authorities and Hala, just a short time ago, we had the police commander for community engagement come out here with a group of Muslim leaders.</p><p>And they said in a statement that they had crafted together that the commander who is himself a Muslim fasting on Ramadan right now, he said, and they said, quote, \"Muslims must do more.\"</p><p>Though Hala, you and I, were both in Manchester and we heard in the wake of the Ariana Grande concert terrorist attack, members of the Manchester Muslim community tell us that they were concerned about Salman Abedi.</p><p>That they had flagged him up to the authorities. So I asked this police commander, how can you reconcile saying that Muslims need to do more and the fact that we've heard reports from U.K. media today saying that some of those calls from people in the Muslim community may have gone to the wrong department and fall into the crack, and this is what he told me.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAK CHISHTY, METROPOLITAN POLICE COMMANDER FOR ENGAGEMENT: Unlike -- single person rules, a lone wolf may keep everything to himself. When you got three people in concert, necessarily, there must have been some discussion around that and some people even have the closest point to them must have known something. And we are saying they had a duty. The Muslim community say they had that duty to report it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE: So even if Salman Abedi was just one person, what this police commander was saying was that if three people must have known about this attack, if the three attackers knew, he is saying that it's not enough for the Muslim community to just flag up the attack.</p><p>He said they also have a responsibility to flag up the actual attack because he said in his assumption if three people must have known then other people would have known. So it really calls into question if people are flagging up these people as individuals and that's not enough.</p><p>What type of resources do the U.K. police need to carry out further investigations to try and prevent attacks like we are living through here in England?</p><p>GORANI: All right, Samuel Burke, thanks very much. We'll be obviously asking those questions a little bit later in the program. Do the police numbers need to go back up to what they were a few years ago when then Home Secretary Theresa May cut police numbers by about 20,000? This is going to be a big topic as well as we are in fact only three days away from the next general election.</p><p>[15:10:00]Now let's get more in the investigation and on these suspects. We have new video. We were discussing with our terrorism analyst, Paul Cruickshank, who is in the studio that Channel 4 last year featured around Khuram Butt. So we see him there with that ISIS flag. Tell us more about this individual.</p><p>CRUICKSHANK: Yes, there he is right there on the screen right now. Khuram Butt, 27 years old, a British national from Barking and here you see him with followers of this British pro-ISIS extremist group called (inaudible) Barren Regents part just a few years ago.</p><p>We understand from our colleague, (inaudible), who actually did a lot of reporting on this group in 2014, 2015, and 2016. That one of his closest associates in this group that you see here on the screen was a British national known as (inaudible).</p><p>Now (inaudible) actually went off to Syria in October 2014. He skipped bail. They wanted to arrest him. They managed to arrest him, but he got out on bail and he managed to get away from the country join ISIS.</p><p>He actually then taunted the British after joining the group and there is some speculation that he was involved in a January 2016 execution video for ISIS, somebody who appears to be playing a somewhat prominent role in the terrorist organization.</p><p>Somebody that according to (inaudible) who did this great reporting was very, very close to Khuram Butt and why is that interesting. It is interesting because as the British investigators probe overseas connections, it is certainly plausible that he would have had a cell phone number, an email, something for a very prominent British member and ISIS.</p><p>Could ISIS have had some role in this? That's what they are claiming --</p><p>GORANI: Why wasn't he arrested, Khuram Butt?</p><p>CRUICKSHANK: Khuram Butt?</p><p>GORANI: Yes.</p><p>CRUICKSHANK: Well, that's a question we are going to have asked British police, British authorities, presumably they weren't able to arrest him because they did not have enough evidence to charge him --</p><p>GORANI: Because Anjam Choudry (ph) is in jail for inciting people to join a terrorist group, I mean, I guess, they didn't have enough evidence to charge him with the same type of crime?</p><p>CRUICKSHANK: Well, going to regent's part and helping unfurl a black Islamic banner is not sufficient grounds for prosecution. Attending a group who have these views isn't necessarily sufficient grounds for prosecution either, Hala, or there has to be sort of something more rising to a certain threshold.</p><p>They managed to get that evidence when it came to Anjam Choudry (ph). It was a lot of YouTube videos that he posted, some of the things he'd said that that the British Muslims needed to pledge their loyalty to Abu Bakar al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS.</p><p>For Anjam Choudry (ph), the leader of this group, that sort of passed a certain threshold. He was a foot soldier in this movement. They don't appear to have focused on him and of course, there are many other foot soldiers out there that in the days ahead could be inspired by what he did.</p><p>GORANI: Well, (inaudible) group certainly is going to be looked at a lot more closely after this. Thanks very much, Paul Cruickshank and will catch up with you little bit later with more of our breaking news.</p><p>Now witnesses to these attacks are describing obviously horrific scenes, but also acts of heroism by the police. I'm joined now by Liam Connell, who was at a bar when it all unfolded.</p><p>Liam, thanks for being with us. Where were you on Saturday? What did you see?</p><p>LIAM CONNELL, WITNESSED ATTACK: I was at a (inaudible), which is a couple (inaudible) and yes, it was a standard night -- I mean, I've never been to London Bridge before (inaudible) that it's my first night there. And yes, like at 10-ish, we've started to get evacuated by staff and there's no police at this point. We were told it was best to stay where we were. We are actually in the basement (inaudible).</p><p>About 1020, I started to notice police and that's when I started filming, and soon after that we were told to drop to the floor because they've actually armed police in the place.</p><p>And yes, that was the scariest part (inaudible) and then, yes, there is a lot of trying to find out what actually happened at this point we didn't know.</p><p>GORANI: Yes -- so it was 10:20 at that point so it was about 20+minutes after the van started plowing into people. When there were armed police in the bar where you were on that Saturday night, what was the scene like then? What were they telling you to do?</p><p>CONNELL: (Inaudible) is to leave. No one knew what was going on. We didn't actually realize anything (inaudible). We were completely used to and that people tired on drinking. People making jokes. It looked fine.</p><p>[15:15:06]It wasn't until that the armed police came and that we were like something is wrong. Once we dropped to the floor, there was a lot of speculation of what was going on. A lot of people checking their phones.</p><p>I was saying to my friends actually that nothing bad had happened. It was something small and this is just almost like an overreaction or just (inaudible). It wasn't until -- we were told that if there's any armed police, drop to the floor.</p><p>It wasn't actually until we got up and that I kind of realize how bad it was because my friends told me that there was someone behind who actually been outside.</p><p>GORANI: And what did you see when you finally left the bar?</p><p>CONNELL: We just kind of ran. Yes, I mean, the police are there at the hallway. They helped us the whole way. They were there and everyone was saying thank you to them. Everyone was so, so grateful to them. Even though everyone wanted to leave and quite quick to leave after all these pieces of guns around, no one panicked. No one was (inaudible) shoving, everyone was just (inaudible) to leave almost.</p><p>GORANI: OK, well, thanks very much, Liam Connell there on Saturday night. I know it must have been really frightening for you and his first time at a London Bridge bar as well. Thanks for joining us this evening and sharing your story.</p><p>Still to come, Saturday's shocking attack is bringing terror and security to the floor, but this is all as we mentioned there happening three ahead of a big general election year here. We are live at Downing Street next.</p><p>Also the other news we are following, a diplomatic disaster after decades of cooperation, Gulf nations turn their collective backs on tiny Qatar. We'll explain why.</p><p>GORANI: Even as the investigation intensifies, London slowed for a moment today and pause to remember.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: Mayor Khan leading the crowd at a moment of silence in the shadow of Tower Bridge to remember the victims, people like Christy Archibald, a 30-year-old Canadian, who worked at a homeless shelter until moving to Europe to start a life with her fiance, Tyler, her family told the CBC.</p><p>It was her first trip to London. The young couple was crossing the bridge together when the van hit Christy. Tyler's sister told the CBC, he held her until she passed away.</p><p>[15:20:09]Christy's family had asked people to honor her by, quote, \"making your community a better place.\"</p><p>I want to go back to the vigil now. Melissa Bell, joins me live from Putterfield's Park with more on a day of remembrance but also a race against the clock to get this investigation moving as quickly as possible - - Melissa.</p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Hala. And even as we were hearing the beginnings of the fruits of that investigation, it has taken a remarkably long time for those two names to be announced by the police as you've been talking about tonight.</p><p>People gathered here for what was really the first opportunity, Hala, that London has had to get together and remember those victims of Saturday night, a tragic event.</p><p>And it was a minute of silence as you heard there led by Sadiq Khan, and he spoke for many of those who'd gathered here a while ago, many of them Muslims when he said that he spoke as a proud British Muslim, a proud patriotic British Muslim speaking directly to the attackers and saying that they did not speak in his name.</p><p>There were several groups of young Muslims here, young women, young men, a group of imams, Hala, who were applauded as they made their way to put their flowers at the memorial that's just begun -- the flowers that's been put down by those who attended the vigil earlier on and still people gathered there lighting candles and remembering those who lost their lives.</p><p>GORANI: All right, Melissa Bell, it's become a depressingly familiar scene after Manchester now London. Thanks very much.</p><p>Saturday night (inaudible) here in London comes just a few days before a crucial general election and it has put the issue of security front and center once again.</p><p>Labour's Jeremy Corbyn has fiercely criticized Prime Minister Theresa May, it is an election campaign after all, over her past handling of police resources from the time she was home secretary. May has hit back strongly defending her record.</p><p>All right. There you have both candidates of the leading parties. Let's go to Downing Street. CNN's Nic Robertson is there. So we are a few days after this horrible attack, a few weeks after Manchester, and a few days before this big election. Politically describe the landscape, is the gap between the two candidates still narrowing?</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: The gap is still narrow as we know it's been narrowing over the past several weeks. So that really gives an indication that there were other issues here. Theresa May has cast herself as a strong stable leadership, the only one who can lead the country into the Brexit negotiations, which begins 11 days after the election, 14 days to weeks from now, to be precise.</p><p>And that seems -- that campaign seems to have found a little bit. There have been -- Labour has been taking a run over the treatment of the health service in Britain, over the treatment of schools. There have been a lot of talk about how you turn.</p><p>So as supporters eroded over a number of issues but over the issue of terrorism, this is a place where she is particularly sensitive and open to criticism because of the six years she had as the home secretary running the country's security, if you will, overseeing the police.</p><p>She had an abrasive relationship with the police because she reduced the number of police officers in the country by about 19,000 and that's what the leader of the opposition is picking upon now.</p><p>She had tried -- she is leading obviously on the stable and strong leadership. It is hard to maintain that narrative when there are a number of terror attacks going on to during the campaign in the run up of the elections.</p><p>But that seems to be, you know, the terrorism part of it is an area where she can also excel on whether the public thinks she is good because she does have this image of being strong and her statement since this attack have been declarative and have been clear, and have certainly given support to her base.</p><p>So you know we're really not going to know until Election Day itself how it's going to play. We are getting very, very close, but there is no doubt about it that with the polls being as narrow as they are, she's certainly cannot afford any more erosion and she is -- she is open to that erosion over this issue.</p><p>And that is what the leader of the opposition has been focusing on, focusing in on over the past 24 hours. So yes, this could be a key issue.</p><p>GORANI: All right. Certainly this is front and center in people's minds across the country and especially in London. Nic Robertson, thanks very much.</p><p>By the way, we'll be speaking to a conservative MP a little bit later in the program with more on the criticism that Theresa May, the prime minister, has been facing because of those cuts to police forces while she was home secretary.</p><p>The leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, this is a political campaign criticizing the prime minister. We will be the thing that later.</p><p>Now speaking of politics and rivalries maybe just on one side in this case, while London authorities are working around the clock to try to crack a possible terror network, the American president, Donald Trump, is ramping up some personal attacks on the city's mayor.</p><p>[15:25:11]Originally he said on Twitter, \"At least seven dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and mayor of London says there is no reason to be alarmed,\" quote/unquote.</p><p>Khan declined to comment to Trump directly. His spokesperson said he had more important things to do than respond to Mr. Trump's ill-informed tweet. Now context, by the way, Sadiq Khan did not say that. He said people shouldn't be alarmed by the increased police presence.</p><p>Then in terms next week was even more negative in tone, \"Pathetic excused by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had think fast on his no reason to be alarmed statement, MSM,\" as in mainstream media, \"is working hard to sell it.\"</p><p>In the last hour, the White House deputy press secretary weighed in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: I don't see that the president is picking a fight with the mayor of London at all. I think again the president's point is something he said frankly back on almost two years now, a year and a half ago when the president talked about how we have to be more committed to national security. One of the reasons we have the travel ban here through that executive order is a focus on national security. That was the point he was trying to make.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: Sarah Huckabee Sanders. He is not picking a fight. Dan Merica is there at the White House. What would it be if you were picking a fight? Those two tweets sure looked like he was trying to pick a fight with Sadiq Khan?</p><p>DAN MERICA, CNN POLITICAL PRODUCER: I think what's fair to say that this is not exactly what the White House wanted to talk about today. This is a big week for them. He tried over the weekend to float out that they're going to push infrastructure reform throughout the United States.</p><p>At an event earlier today with the president to do that, but what is the dominant talking point here with both Republicans and Democrats is the president's early morning tweets. It's not clear maybe he did not want to pick a fight with the London mayor, but that is exactly what has had happened.</p><p>The back and forth between these two men has led to not only some questions domestically here in the United States, why is the president doing this? But it's become somewhat of an international incident with both Mayor Khan and other leaders having to respond.</p><p>What is very clear here is that the president relies on Twitter to get his message out to his voters. It's what he did during the campaign. It's what his done during in his White House.</p><p>Going forward though you have a number White House aides who after this morning and have said we shouldn't focus as much on these on these tweets. What remains clear, though, is that these tweets are the president's most distilled thoughts.</p><p>This is what he thinks in the morning and this is how he gets his message out. So they may say he is not trying to pick a fight with the mayor, it was pretty clear that he was doing something to antagonize him in these tweets.</p><p>GORANI: Right. And the mayor as we mentioned through a spokesperson saying he does not even have time to respond. So it's not so much a spat, but just two tweets by the president interpreted as being criticism of the mayor of London during a very difficult time.</p><p>President Trump hasn't just been tweeting about Sadiq Khan, he's turning to the Supreme Court for help with this executive order on immigration. He's now emphatically calling it a travel ban, Dan.</p><p>He tweeted that \"People the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a travel ban.\" So now he's gone on this tweetstorm just as the administration is appealing to the Supreme Court of the United States to reinstate this ban. What is exactly behind this move?</p><p>MERICA: It's hard to state how much this undercuts what his aides had said in the past. You had Sean Spicer in January who said, it is a misrepresentation of this to call it a travel ban. But then you have the president this morning saying outright it is a travel ban, I'm going to call it what I want to call it.</p><p>This was very clear the way that it undercut those White House aides and the Department of Justice. This was clear in tweets by George Conway, who funny enough his Kellyanne Conway, a top White House adviser's husband, who tweeted today saying that this undercuts the Department of Justice's ability to argue on behalf of this travel ban.</p><p>Going forward, you're going to hear President Trump use Twitter like this. He is going to say what he wants to say, but it is very clear here in Washington and this is an annoyance in the White House and is forcing, not only forcing them to respond but really undercutting the credibility of some President Trump's top aides.</p><p>GORANI: But why very quickly -- why does the president keep tweeting like this? I mean, it is a fair question. It is the focus -- taking away focus from big policy questions. It's dominating the headlines. All of his aides and advisors do not want this to happen anymore. Why does he keep doing it?</p><p>MERICA: To be completely blunt, I think it's what he enjoys. I think he wakes up in the morning. He watches the news. We've been told multiple times that he watches the news and response to it via Twitter. And you can actually correlate what he is watching in the morning with what he is tweeting in the 6:00, 7:00, 8:00 hours here on the east coast. So you know, for a lack of a better explanation, it's just what he enjoys doing.</p><p>GORANI: All right. Dan Merica at the White House, thanks very much.</p><p>A lot more coming up, more on the men behind Saturday's attack in London, review of the details, CNN is breaking this hour just ahead.</p><p>[15:30:00] HALA GORANI, CNN ANCHOR: -- more on the men behind Saturday's attack in London, a review of the details CNN is breaking this hour just ahead.</p><p>GORANI: Welcome back. We're covering Saturday's terrorist attack from every angle. Let's review what we know right now. British police have named two of the three men behind the assault, both from East London. You see their pictures there.</p><p>Khuram Shazad Butt was a British national born in Pakistan. He's on the left. He worked for the London Underground briefly last year. Police and MI-5 were familiar with him, but police say they had no intel leading up to this attack.</p><p>On the right is a man named Rachid Redouane. He, also, was gunned down by police on Saturday. He claimed to be Moroccan and Libyan, was not known to authorities.</p><p>The three attackers were confronted by armed police and shot dead, as we've been reporting, within eight minutes of the first emergency call, right before 10:00 p.m., in the London Bridge area.</p><p>Let's talk a little bit about what's coming up in three days because it's a big general election. Conservative politician, Kwasi Kwarteng, is here.</p><p>Hi. Thanks for being with us.</p><p>KWASI KWARTENG, MEMBER OF THE PARLIAMENT, UNITED KINGDOM: Thanks.</p><p>GORANI: There have been calls on Mrs. May, the Prime Minister, to resign because, during her time as Home Secretary, she cut police forces by 20,000 and therefore, in some ways, she should be held responsible for the drop in policing numbers. What do you make of that?</p><p>KWARTENG: I think that's, you know, part of the election. There's a lot of big words. Jeremy Corbyn's trying to make an impact. I think it's nonsense though because, as you pointed out in your report, the police came within eight minutes and did an incredibly good job.</p><p>So it's not just a question of the numbers. If we're going to tackle this thing, it's about mentality, it's about ideology, it's about philosophy. And I think that, you know, as the Prime Minister outlined yesterday, there's a lot more that we could do to try and integrate our communities.</p><p>GORANI: But the Prime Minister has been wanting this image, this strong and stable image of the government, of the Prime Minister coming into this campaign with an enormous lead in the polls. It has done nothing but shrink. And here, also, we have really a government that perhaps seems may be not as strong and not as stable, having to go back even on pledges made in its own manifesto.</p><p>KWARTENG: I don't think that's true at all, I mean, if you look at campaigns generally. I remember 1997, the Labour Party headed hugely at the beginning of that campaign and the lead actually shrunk. I mean, that's what often happens in general election campaigns.</p><p>And the government's message has been very clear. I think the Prime Minister gave a good speech yesterday where she outlined that enough is enough. We can't simply carry on as we were before, and there has to be a change of direction. We have to look at the philosophy, as I say, the ideology of Islamic extremism.</p><p>[15:35:04] GORANI: But how do you do that? How do you do that?</p><p>KWARTENG: I think there's a lot more that could be done in some sort of --</p><p>GORANI: I mean, there were no real specific actions or policy proposals in that speech.</p><p>KWARTENG: No, she made a broad statement saying that, clearly, what we've been doing in the past needs to change. On that front, I think there's a lot more that could be done to integrate actual communities for us to find out what's going on, what sorts for messages are being preached in mosques.</p><p>And also, as she said in her speech, we've been too tolerant of extremism in our midst. We've been too relaxed about a lot of the hate, that things do --</p><p>GORANI: Her critics would say she had years as Home Secretary to address this and didn't.</p><p>KWARTENG: Well, as we know already, reports have suggested that MI-5 and a lot of other security services have foiled many plots in the last year, and I think that was the case, certainly, when she was Home Secretary for six years.</p><p>GORANI: Now, regarding the campaign, you're saying it is not unusual for parties that go into campaigns with a very strong lead in the polls to see their lead shrink.</p><p>KWARTENG: True.</p><p>GORANI: But in this case, there have been some polls within the margin of error. Are you concerned your party's going to lose its majority in parliament --</p><p>KWARTENG: Well --</p><p>GORANI: -- and therefore that Theresa May's gamble may backfire?</p><p>KWARTENG: Well, let's see what happens. I mean, we've had lots of predictions before ahead of elections that had been wrong. I mean, there was Brexit. There was obviously President Trump that no one --</p><p>GORANI: You want this one to be right though, don't you?</p><p>KWARTENG: -- no one foresaw.</p><p>GORANI: Yes.</p><p>KWARTENG: And, of course, the polls now are very varied. I mean, some polls have shown us, I think, 11 points ahead. That was one today. A number have shown smaller leads. So we'll have to see what happens on Thursday.</p><p>It's notable that no poll has shown Labour in the lead. And I was a candidate in 2015, and, of course, you know, every other people, half the poll, showed Labour ahead and the conservatives won. So the trend, I think, is the conservatives are ahead. We just have to wait and see what the actual result is. Nobody can say that now.</p><p>GORANI: What do you make of what Donald Trump tweeted about Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, calling him pathetic today?</p><p>KWARTENG: I think it would be helpful for Donald Trump to, you know, focus on United States of America. I mean, I don't know that we need to have Donald Trump, the President, commenting on our internal affairs or internal politics. And Sadiq Khan is the mayor of London. He's been elected, he has a mandate, and he should be treated with the respect that he deserves.</p><p>GORANI: Theresa May said he was doing a great job. Donald Trump, obviously, wouldn't agree with her. Do you think it's hurt Theresa May, her close association with Donald Trump, in this country? Donald Trump is not popular in Europe or in the U.K.</p><p>KWARTENG: Well, I think as Prime Minister of Great Britain, any prime minister would have to have a good relationship with the President of United States, and I think Theresa May was very conscious of that.</p><p>And in a way, the relationship is bigger than the actual individual holders of the office, whoever the Prime Minister or the President happens to be. It's more important relationship than that. And I think Number 10 realize and it was on that basis that she tried to form this relationship.</p><p>GORANI: Because she didn't sign, for instance, that letter condemning the U.S.' decision to withdraw from the Paris Accord. That was highlighted perhaps and the --</p><p>KWARTENG: Well, I mean, as politicians, I mean, even at my low level, I mean, we're asked to sign all sorts of things, and I tend to avoid that because I want to use my words But I don't know what the reason was.</p><p>GORANI: Kwasi Kwarteng, thanks very much. We really appreciate it. Always great having you on the program.</p><p>KWARTENG: Thank you.</p><p>GORANI: Well, speaking of the attack and the reaction from the Muslim community, of course, I am not sure you saw this, but more than 130 British Muslims -- imams and religious leaders -- issued a statement. They're saying they are refusing to perform the burial prayer for any of the perpetrators of the attack.</p><p>\"We will not perform the traditional Islamic funeral prayer for the perpetrators, and we also urge fellow imams and religious authorities to withdraw such a privilege. This is because such indefensible actions are completely at odds with the lofty teachings of Islam.\"</p><p>The London Mayor, Sadiq Khan, had strong words for the perpetrators today, too, saying, \"As a proud British Muslim, I say this, you do not commit these disgusting acts in my name.\"</p><p>Well, Khan's election as mayor last year was seen by many as a celebration of London's diversity. He also had to deal with attacks undermining it. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GORANI (voice-over): When he was elected last year, expectations were high for Sadiq Khan, London's first ever Muslim mayor. He has since risen to be one of the most recognized Muslim politicians in Europe.</p><p>MAYOR SADIQ KHAN, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM: I never dreamed that someone like me could be elected as Mayor of London.</p><p>GORANI (voice-over): The son of a London bus driver and a seamstress, his parents were Pakistani immigrants. He grew up in public housing, went to states schools, and then became a lawyer, Member of Parliament, and government minister.</p><p>Khan's role defies a political trend dividing Western nations across America and Europe. Islam has become an emotive, often fearful political issue after large terror strikes in the U.S., France and Belgium, and now, in the U.K.</p><p>[15:40:04] And after the attacks in London, Khan is now facing that challenge head-on.</p><p>KHAN: The basic promise has to be to recognize, just like a terrorist and others are finding new ways to harm us, we've got to evolve and find new ways to keep us safe.</p><p>GORANI (voice-over): And after the attack in Manchester two weeks ago, the Mayor expressed the need for good interfaith relations.</p><p>KHAN: Here in London, we show that we don't simply tolerate different faiths, we respect and celebrate them too. And diversity is what makes London the greatest city in the world.</p><p>GORANI (voice-over): Sadiq Khan's supporters say having him as the Mayor shows many people here are very comfortable with the clear difference between those who murder in the name of Islam and the rest of the Muslim community.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GORANI: This is THE WORLD RIGHT NOW. Still ahead, the worst diplomatic rift in decades, why the oil-rich nation of Qatar suddenly finds itself all alone in the Persian Gulf.</p><p>Also, Londoners keep calm and carry on as they return to work following the terror attack. We'll be right back.</p><p>GORANI: Now to a diplomatic rift that has left one of the world's richest nations -- and smallest nations -- isolated. Multiple countries in the region have abruptly cut off ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism. Those countries are Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, Yemen, the Maldives, even, and the United Arab Emirates. Qatar calls the allegations baseless.</p><p>The move is causing chaos for many people in the region, so what is really behind this major diplomatic shift? My next guest is Fawaz Gerges. He's the chair of Contemporary Middle East Studies at the London School of Economics and the author of \"ISIS: A History.\"</p><p>What's really behind this here? You have GCC countries, normally should be united. In this case, they're all turning their backs except Kuwait, interestingly, on Qatar at the same time.</p><p>FAWAZ GERGES, PROFESSOR, LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE: It's a very serious family dispute. I think, this thought that triggered the crisis was the summit in Saudi Arabia, as in Trump. And basically, he wants a broad coalition, not only against ISIS but also against Iran.</p><p>The emir of Qatar, Thani, was very unhappy. He went back and he criticized the American president, he criticized the meeting, some Gulf States. And he said, well, look, Iran should not be turned into a hostile state. That was really the hair that broke the camel's back and has fathered the whole crisis.</p><p>But this goes back to 2014. The reality is, I mean, I think what Qatar is trying to do, Hala, is trying to really play a bigger role in the Middle East by supporting Islamist groups throughout the region -- the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, Islamists in Libya -- who are seen as this trap by the pivotal states -- Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>[15:45:06] What you will have now is that Qatar is isolated. Qatar is in the eye of the storm. Not just physically but even politically and diplomatically, they are pressuring Qatar to really change its behavior and accept the consensus in the Gulf and the Arab world.</p><p>GORANI: So I'm getting this news, urgent, which is -- sorry, apologies, I'm looking down. The Kuwaiti emir has spoken out. So Kuwait and Oman are the two countries in the Gulf that has not cut ties with Qatar.</p><p>Potentially, Kuwait would play a mediating role. It looks like that's what's happening. The emir of Kuwait has urged Qatar's emir to exercise self-restraint and refrain from steps that would escalate the situation. So it appears as though, at least, from some members of the GCC, there's an attempt to mend fences here.</p><p>GERGES: That's exactly what happened in 2014. Saudi Arabia broke diplomatic relations with Qatar. It took nine months and the Kuwaitis stepped in and brokered a settlement between Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Saudi Arabia now says, look, Qatar has not basically charged its obligations.</p><p>In fact, if you read carefully, it's really amazing, Hala. If you read carefully what the Saudis and the Egyptians and the Emirates and the Bahrainis, they accuse Qatar of supporting terrorist groups, including al Qaeda and ISIS. They accuse Qatar of conspiring against the national security of Saudi Arabia and Egypt. They accuse Qatar of supporting the Houthis in Yemen.</p><p>So this is a serious situation. My take on it, the Kuwaitis will not be able to do what they did in 2014 because neither Saudi Arabia --</p><p>GORANI: But this is just a pretext, isn't it? I mean, it's the fact that the emir in Qatar made those comments that were broadcast, by the way, by the state-run Qatari agency, later said to be fake and that they were hacked, essentially in support of more openness toward Iran. And this tremendously angered the Saudis --</p><p>GERGES: Absolutely.</p><p>GORANI: -- for whom their bete noire in the region is Iran.</p><p>GERGES: Iran is an existential enemy for Saudi Arabia. Iran really is a very, very important rival for Saudi Arabia. The fact that the emir of Qatar -- this is not the first time. The Saudis did not really buy the denial by the emir of Qatar.</p><p>The reality is, this particular crisis today will not be resolved in the same way that it was in 2014 --</p><p>GORANI: But Qatar can't afford it. It cannot afford to be isolated.</p><p>GERGES: Absolutely.</p><p>GORANI: I mean, it's a big gas producer and the rest of it, but it still needs to trade with its partners. It still needs to have open borders. I mean, they actually are throwing people out of --</p><p>GERGES: Not only that, Hala.</p><p>GORANI: -- GCC countries that are Qatari also.</p><p>GERGES: Not only that. Qatar has land borders with Saudi Arabia. It's the only land crossing Saudi Arabia. It's physically isolated. It's bleeding. I mean, it suffocates without the land. That's it.</p><p>Not only that, can Qatar afford to take on Egypt and Saudi Arabia, two pivotal states in the region, given the fact that this coalition is empowered? My take on it, the Qataris will finally accept the terms made by the Saudis.</p><p>GORANI: And what are the terms? What are the terms, then?</p><p>GERGES: Desist from supporting Islamists, the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamists in the region. Accept the consensus in the Gulf and in Egypt about Iran being a rival and it should be confronted. And also not to use Al Jazeera. It sponsors Al Jazeera, one of the most important satellite stations, to criticize not only the Gulf States but also Egypt.</p><p>These are very, very, I mean, important terms. And my take on it, Qatar is in a very weak position now.</p><p>GORANI: Yes.</p><p>GERGES: What choices, what card does it have? They feel --</p><p>GORANI: Well, it wants to be a world power. It wants to hold the World Cup. It wants to be this big player. But in the end, it's a tiny country.</p><p>GERGES: It really is. And this is --</p><p>GORANI: And if it doesn't have the support of its neighbors, what does it have?</p><p>GERGES: And that's why the only card that Qatar has now are the American bases in Qatar. But even the Americans, the emir of Qatar criticized President Trump. There are major tensions between, I mean, the Trump administration and Qatar.</p><p>GORANI: Last question. After the Donald Trump visit, did this embolden these countries to do what they did just now?</p><p>GERGES: Oh, absolutely. I mean, what President Trump did basically to really accept the strategic view of Saudi Arabia as the pivotal state in the region, along with Egypt. And this is why, now, they have Qatar where they want it to be, in a corner. It's squeezed and basically, they would like to force Qatar to change its behavior in the region, not just in the Gulf itself.</p><p>GORANI: Fawaz Gerges, as always, great pleasure having you on. Thank you very much.</p><p>Coming up, London unbowed. The U.K. capital shows its resilience. People head back to work following the terrorist attack. We'll have reaction from the streets of Central London. We'll be right back.</p><p>[15:51:29] GORANI: The streets of London are changing in the face of this terrorist attack. Barriers have been erected on some of the city's bridges as authorities respond to the second attack in London where vehicles were used as a weapon on a bridge. You see it there on London Bridge. It's a difficult balance -- no, I should say that's Westminster Bridge, apologies.</p><p>It's a difficult balance as they try to protect the innocent without making them feel under a siege. There are also calls for all police to be armed, but the head of the Metropolitan Police and, in fact, it should be said, a lot of Britons disagree.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CRESSIDA DICK, COMMISSIONER, METROPOLITAN POLICE SERVICE: Those people who carried out this attack wants to change our society forever. I don't think we want arms to the police officers or military standing on all our street corners as an example.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: As officials try to walk the fine line between ramping up security and keeping society fundamentally unchanged, Londoners are keeping calm and trying to carry on, as the expression goes.</p><p>Fred Pleitgen is here with me. He was out in the streets of London today.</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, absolutely. And that's exactly what people are doing, they're keeping calm and carrying on.</p><p>I do have to say that we spoke to many people, especially around the London Bridge area, many people who were going to their, obviously, first morning commute on a Monday, and there were some who did say that they are more concerned than they were before because, also, there had been, you know, so many attacks in the past 10 weeks here in Britain.</p><p>So that's something that did concern people. But by and large, they were very defiant and said, of course, the city is going to carry on. Here's what we saw.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PLEITGEN (voice-over): Meticulously looking for even the tiniest clues, forensic workers comb through the scene of Saturday's terror attack. But just a few yards away, the city is getting back to its normal pace, commuters rushing to work, one of London's ways of defying the third act of terrorism since April.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think over the weekend, the coverage and there are a number of people that talks about London as being determined. And I think that's absolutely what we are.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The English are used to it. It's something that we just come together at times like this and just carry on.</p><p>PLEITGEN (voice-over): The terrorists plowed through London with a van on Saturday night, hitting many people, killing at least seven.</p><p>On Monday, the grief and sorrow still very present. Many stopping and laying flowers at the edge of the crime scene, some overcome with emotion. There is more police on the streets for extra security but otherwise, the city is barely missing a beat.</p><p>PLEITGEN (on camera): There was incredible carnage here on London Bridge as the van apparently swerved from side to side trying to hit as many people as possible. But only two days later, the bridge is open once again, with people walking across, enjoying the London skyline.</p><p>PLEITGEN (voice-over): Defiant in the aftermath, defiant during the attack. Romanian baker, Florin Morariu, is being hailed as a hero for hitting one of the attackers in the head with a basket to save people hiding in the store he works at.</p><p>FLORIN MORARIU, BAKER: I have two baskets, yes. I need to take on two baskets, yes. One is (inaudible) is no -- it's like that these guys, yes. Number two basket is delivered in the face, yes.</p><p>PLEITGEN (on camera): You hit him in the face with the basket?</p><p>MORARIU: Yes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Come with me.</p><p>MORARIU: What are you doing (ph)? Stop.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Pick that up (ph). Somebody take it with me. He's stabbed.</p><p>MORARIU: Here, take this. Take this, yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PLEITGEN (voice-over): Florin Morariu also recorded the moments immediately afterwards, the chaos and the carnage. He says he doesn't feel like a hero.</p><p>MORARIU: It's not about threat. Maybe it's my father, maybe it's my brother in this moment, yes? If possible help, help.</p><p>[15:55:01] PLEITGEN (voice-over): Keep calm and carry on, they say in Britain. And that's exactly what London is doing, the residents and the tourists appreciating their city and its many attractions even more after a tough weekend.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PLEITGEN: So you see Londoners carrying on as best as they can. There is a lot of grief, there is a lot of sorrow, but, of course, there is also a lot of defiance. And by the way, one thing that we didn't see is -- London Bridge actually partially open to traffic.</p><p>GORANI: Yes.</p><p>PLEITGEN: One lane or one side is open to traffic. No additional barriers yet, but I'm sure that, especially there, some will come up pretty shortly.</p><p>GORANI: Yes. So the ones we were showing our viewers were at Westminster Bridge.</p><p>PLEITGEN: Yes.</p><p>GORANI: That's where the attack happened about 2 1/2 months ago in March, outside of Westminster. And the role of the police has been highlighted quite a lot. I mean, they have really just been described as heroes in many cases. When you spoke to people, what did say they wanted from the authorities?</p><p>PLEITGEN: I think that a lot of them felt that the police reacted very adequately. I think that some of them who we spoke to said, look, they're feeling a little bit of unease because these plots were able to able. And I think that has more to do probably with intelligence and others to have worked rather than with the police work actually once something does happen.</p><p>GORANI: Yes.</p><p>PLEITGEN: I think the reaction of the police force was something that people were very pleased with, but they said, look, they had really hoped that something just would have been discovered early on.</p><p>But I think most people understand that when you have things like this, plots like this, you know, with using a vehicle instead of a bomb, that is so rudimentary, so difficult to detect, I think they understand it's pretty hard to stop something like that altogether.</p><p>GORANI: All right. Yes, and we've seen it in other places, Nice to Berlin, and now in London. Thanks very much, Fred Pleitgen.</p><p>The attack is far from the first time the city has had to face adversity. There was obviously the Blitz when thousands of German bombs rained down on London, killing thousands and causing massive damage. And then there were decades of attacks from Irish Republicans. Both times, the city rebuilt. It moved on.</p><p>So when a newspaper suggested London was reeling after Saturday evening, they replied the way they know best, with sarcasm. The hash tag, \"Things that leave Britain reeling,\" filled with comments, such as, \"Not catching someone's name and having to spend the next three decades avoiding introducing them to anyone.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GORANI: I've been there. And \"People who stand to the left on the Tube escalator. Things that leave Britain reeling.\" Don't get me started on that.</p><p>Thanks for watching this hour of special coverage. I'll be back on the other side of this break with more.</p><p>[16:00:03] GORANI: Tonight, Britain's prime minister vows to crack down on extremism as security services race to investigate the country's third terrorist attack in three months.</p><p>Good evening from London. I'm Hala Gorani. Police have identified now all three assailants in Saturday's attack and they have named two of them.</p><p>On the left, a well-known character, Khuram Shahzad Butt, a British citizen, born in Pakistan, who's even been in television documentaries. On the right, Rachid Redouane, who police say, claimed to be Moroccan and Libyan and not known by authorities, we understand.</p><p>Police are holding 11 people, following arrests in two locations. A 12th person arrested Sunday has been released. Authorities say they don't believe there any additional attackers at large.</p><p>The terrorist threat level remains at severe as new security measures are being introduced, and those include extra barriers installed on bridges. You see it there. Didn't happen after the Westminster attack, but it's happening now.</p><p>The prime minister, Theresa May, called for a renewed crackdown on terrorism, online and on the street. It was a harsher message than the one she had delivered after the attacks in Manchester.</p><p>Theresa May warned there has been far too much acceptance of extremism. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THERESA MAY, PRIME MINISTER OF THE UNITED KINGDOM: But as the threat evolves, our response must do so too. We cannot go on as we are. Enough is enough.</p><p>We must do more, much more, to take on and to defeat the evil ideology of Islamist extremism that preaches hatred, sows division and promotes sectarianism.</p><p>It is an ideology that promotes a false choice between our Western values of freedom, democracy and human rights and the religion of Islam. It is a perversion of Islam and a perversion of the truth.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank is learning more about the attackers.</p><p>All right. Let's talk about first Khuram Butt, well known.</p><p>PAUL CRUICKSHANK, CNN TERRORISM ANALYST: Well known, 27 years old, born in Pakistan, came to the UK. And at certain point became influenced by the British extremist group, al-Muhajiroun. That's a group that supports ISIS. You see him on the left-hand side of the screen there.</p><p>How do we know that he joined this group? Well, our very own Sandi Sidhu, a CNN reporter, spent 2014, 2015, 2016 reporting on this group and met him several times while she was reporting on the group, describing him as quiet, spoken, somebody that led the proselytizing that this group did to others, but somebody who was very committed to the cause, Hala.</p><p>He's also appeared in a Channel 4 documentary, if you can believe that, Jihadi Next Door. You see video of this documentary.</p><p>GORANI: That's him there in the foreground.</p><p>CRUICKSHANK: There he is right there with the black flag, a black jihadi style flag just before that video - in the actual video, you can hear that one of the preachers there say that they want to unfurl that jihadi flag on the top of 10 Downing Street. This is in Regents Park in London, just outside Regents Park mosque.</p><p>This is a very visible manifestation of radicalization. He was on the radar screen of British security services, of the police. And so, there are a lot of questions now from the Muslim community who are saying, we warned you about this guy again and again and again.</p><p>We warned you about this group again and again and again. Why didn't you go after them? Well, they went after the leader of the group, Anjem Choudary. They arrested him.</p><p>GORANI: He's in prison.</p><p>CRUICKSHANK: He's in jail.</p><p>GORANI: Let's be blunt here. This is a guy unfurling an ISIS flag in Regents Park in London. His neighbors, two of them that we know of at least, went to the cops and said this guy is trying to - is radical.</p><p>One of them, in fact, said he tried to radicalize my child. He was thrown out of his local mosque for being too extreme. This doesn't look good for authorities, right? You could not be a more public extremist than this guy.</p><p>CRUICKSHANK: You could not. Appearing in a Channel 4 - that's one of the main channels here - documentary, you could not be more public about your radicalization.</p><p>One of the things we should point out, it wasn't actually an ISIS flag. It is a jihadi-style flag that they unfurled there in Regents Park, a sort of a hardline symbol that they were putting out there.</p><p>But one of the interesting details we're learning, and this is from our colleagues, Sandi Sidhu, a CNN journalist who spent time with him a few years ago, is he was very close to a notorious British ISIS operative, somebody called Abu Rumaysah, who left the UK in October 2014, joined ISIS.</p><p>And according to the belief of some, (INAUDIBLE) was featured in a ISIS execution video in January 2016. That's interesting because, if he has a very close contact inside ISIS, someone who has moved up the hierarchy there in the group, could he have been in touch with him in the weeks before the attack, could he have given encouragement directly from ISIS in Syria?</p><p>GORANI: Quick last question on that. ISIS has claimed responsibility, but has provided no evidence that they were connected directly.</p><p>Cruickshank: No evidence whatsoever, but -</p><p>GORANI: They've claimed a lot of things, including a Manila thing that ended up being a robbery.</p><p>CRUICKSHANK: That's absolutely right. But you have to say that there is a connection there now because this British fighter Abu Rumaysah, his status is not known, but believed to be still out there. Was very close friends with this individual.</p><p>Could he have found a way to communicate with him in some way? Is there some kind of video that's going to come out, like we've seen in the past after attacks. But a lot of questions for British authorities.</p><p>And just one thing to add. I think this is important. Mohammed Shafiq, who is the chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation here in the UK, has just come out with a statement saying that on the day after that terrible killing of the British solider Lee Rigby in Woolwich in East London in May 2013, he was verbally accosted by this individual, Khuram Butt.</p><p>Butt called him murtad, which is essentially apostate, which the jihadis believe means you can be killed. Very, very strong language. And he was very upset because Mohammed Shafiq, this Muslim community leader was speaking out against Anjem Choudary, the leader of the group.</p><p>And Mohammed Shafiq saying, why didn't the Brits take action earlier to go after this group, al-Muhajiroun. And I and other CNN colleagues, we've on many occasions interviewed this guy, Anjem Choudary, before he was jailed. He was very clear about his support for groups like Al Qaeda, groups like ISIS, and he has really radicalized a generation of British extremists.</p><p>Half of all the terror plots in which British nationals had a role around the world and the UK have links to this group, al-Muhajiroun. Why weren't they put out of business soon?</p><p>GORANI: Right, absolutely. Thanks very much. Very important question. Paul Cruickshank, thank you. The investigation is unfolding against a politically charged backdrop of bitter dispute between the British prime minister, London's mayor and the president of the United States.</p><p>For his part, Mayor Sadiq Khan says his city is not getting the funds it needs to protect itself.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SADIQ KHAN, MAYOR OF LONDON: We don't receive the right level of funding as a capital city we should receive. We receive half of the funds we should be receiving, 170 million versus 370 million.</p><p>But also, as the capital city, we have other responsibilities from major events. There's a big cricket match today to state visits. Some welcome, some less so.</p><p>But the fact is, as of yesterday seriously visits some, some less so. But the fact is we need to make sure that our police have the resources and support they need. And as the mayor, my job is to make sure our city is safe.</p><p>And I will do my best as the mayor to be an advocate and a champion for our police to get the tools they need.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: Well, Prime Minister Theresa May says London's mayor is doing a good job after President Trump launched two Twitter attacks against the mayor. Here's the comment Mr. Trump took issue with.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KHAN: Londoners will see an increased police presence today and over the course of the next few days. No reason to be alarmed. One of the things that police and all of us need to do is make sure we're as safe as we possibly can be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: All right. You will see increased police presence. There is no reason to be alarmed.</p><p>On Monday morning, President Trump wrote, \"pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his \"no reason to be alarmed\" statement. Mainstream media is working hard to sell it.\"</p><p>It follows an earlier tweet where the president misconstrued those comments when he urged Londoners not to be alarmed by extra security. The White House deputy press secretary insisted that president, after all of this, after those tweets and everything he said about the mayor, was not trying to pick a fight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: I don't see that the president is picking a fight with the mayor on London. I think, again, the president's point is something he said frankly back - gosh, it's been almost two years now, a year-and-a-half ago when the president talked about how we have to be more committed to national security.</p><p>One of the reasons we have the travel ban here through that executive order is a focus on national security. That was the point he was trying to make.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: That's the explanation from the White House. Nic Robertson, who is our international diplomatic editor, he's outside 10 Downing Street. Stephen Collinson is a CNN White House reporter. He's in Washington for us.</p><p>[16:10:08] Stephen, I want to start with you. Why is the president spending so much time thinking about the mayor of London?</p><p>STEPHEN COLLINSON, \"CNN POLITICS\" SENIOR REPORTER: Good point. You would think, at the height of a terror attack as it was unfolding and in the aftermath, he would be expressing solidarity and working out ways in which he can help the British.</p><p>But this is Donald Trump. This is - he is so different than any other kind of president we've ever seen. I think one thing to remember is that Donald Trump doesn't necessarily see world events for what they are. He sees them for how they influence and how they affect him.</p><p>So, as soon as this attack starting unfolding, the weekend, he started tweeting about his travel ban. Then on Sunday and Monday, he went into this attack against Sadiq Khan.</p><p>And the reason is he sees political advantage. He sees a chance to play to his base who like the idea of Donald Trump saying that terrorism is taking place because of political correctness and political leaders around the world haven't been willing to call out Islam sufficiently.</p><p>So, that's the reason he's doing it. It's very interesting. He is a world leader, but he doesn't behave like one. He doesn't seem to have any concept or even care how his remarks might go down over in the United Kingdom and as we've seen with some of his other comments elsewhere in the world.</p><p>GORANI: I guess that's what his supporters like. Nic Robertson, we heard from the Prime Minister Theresa May congratulating Sadiq Khan for a job well done. That was after two tweets by Donald Trump criticizing Sadiq Khan. What do you make of that? Was she trying to make a point?</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: I think she is trying to put some political distance between herself and President Trump.</p><p>Look, she's come up for criticism in this election campaign and prior to it as well for a close association with President Trump being the first world leader to go visit him in Washington. Seen together holding hands.</p><p>After that, there was that travel ban put in place or called for by President Trump. That resonated terribly here in Britain and it reflected badly on the Prime Minister at that time.</p><p>Go back to just a couple of weeks ago - a week or so - last week even (INAUDIBLE) last week when President Trump announced he was withdrawing from the climate change agreement.</p><p>Theresa May didn't sign a letter that the French, German and Italian prime ministers signed condemning or criticizing President Trump for doing this. She was criticized by the leader of the opposition here, Jeremy Corbyn. He criticized her previously for saying that - Britain was surrendering its security agenda to Donald Trump.</p><p>So, add on top of that when Donald Trump does this and Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition, comes out again and says that President Trump doesn't have the sense to understand how to grasp the nuance of what's going on here in Britain, Trump becomes part of the election campaign that's being used against Theresa May.</p><p>She's being criticized by Jeremy Corbyn as well for the cuts on the police force here. So, this is part of the opposition's narrative. The opposition being the Labour Party, Sadiq Khan being of the Labour Party, these tweets by President Trump are working against Prime Minister Theresa May.</p><p>Yet, Donald Trump has said that he supports Theresa May at this time, supports the British people. It's perhaps an unintended consequence of his tweets that this could have an impact on what's becoming a close electoral race.</p><p>GORANI: And, Stephen, there were some reports suggesting that Donald Trump may have been considering a visit to the UK to show support with the country after the attack. I take it that's off the table.</p><p>COLLINSON: Yes, there was some conversation about that on the Sunday talk shows in the US yesterday. That was fairly quickly shot down by White House officials. You can imagine the thought in Theresa May's mind that the prospect of a visit from Donald Trump in the week of a British election.</p><p>But I think what Nic was saying there was right. Donald Trump has very little conception about how the things he says play outside the United States. You saw after the NATO speech, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel come out and make statements critical of the United States, implicit criticism of Trump, because she is facing election and she is facing candidates who are very critical of Donald Trump, much more critical than she would like to be.</p><p>We saw Emmanuel Macron, the new French President, criticizing Trump over the climate issue. So, these leaders have got their own political things to worry about. And Donald Trump, by pushing his own political agenda, is creating great political problems for them as they try and navigate this very, very difficult relationship between their countries and the United States.</p><p>GORANI: And I found it interesting, Stephen, and Nic as well, in all the elections we have covered since Donald Trump was elected president, the populist candidates have actually underperformed the polls.</p><p>[16:15:01] I mean, Stephen, maybe you have a thought on that as well. It seems as though perhaps the Trump presidency is harming populist political candidates in Europe.</p><p>COLLINSON: Certainly. And I think there is a real disconnect between the philosophy that Donald Trump is advancing, this America first, ultranationalist philosophy, which is calling really the US support for the West as it has been for the last 70 years into doubt and what people in Europe think.</p><p>I mean, I was in Berlin very recently and people were seriously considering the state of Germany's relationship with the United States, and that's something which would have been unheard of before the Trump presidency, even when there was angst between Germany and the United States and Europe and the United States over the Iraq war.</p><p>No one was calling into question the basic assumptions of the post-World War II international consensus. That is taking place right now in Europe and in the foreign policy establishment in the United States, and it's all because of Donald Trump.</p><p>GORANI: Stephen Collinson and Nic Robertson, thanks to both of you. Appreciate it.</p><p>Still to come this hour, Theresa May says the Internet has become a safe space for terrorists and she is calling on tech companies to do more about it. Is it realistic?</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>GORANI: Theresa May says much more needs to be done to tackle extremism in the wake of the attack on Saturday and the two others as well. The president - the prime minister, I should say, is now calling out Internet companies.</p><p>She says they are giving extremist ideologies a place to breed and it is time governments band together to better regulate cyberspace.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAY: I believe it is right that the UK is engaged in taking on and defeating groups like ISIS and their like around the world. It is in our own national interest to do so and it is interest of the wider world.</p><p>But as our efforts to defeat them overseas are ever more successful, they're increasingly seeking to spread their poisonous ideology and to prey on the weak and vulnerable in our own countries, inspiring them to commit acts of terror here at home.</p><p>They exploit the safe spaces of the Internet and social media and they exploit them in the real world too.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: Jim Killock joins me now. He is the executive director of Open Rights Group, which promotes the rights of free speech and privacy online. Thanks for being with us.</p><p>How realistic is it to ask big tech giants to regulate this type of speech and close down accounts of known terrorist sympathizers?</p><p>JIM KILLOCK, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, OPEN RIGHTS GROUP: Well, they do a lot of this already, so it is realistic to ask them to do something about it, but I think we have to worry about exactly what Theresa May has in mind because she is asking them to automate the detection of this material and then automatically remove it, and to fine those companies if they are not acting swiftly enough for the government's like.</p><p>[16:20:12] So, that could easily see content that's actually criticizing these people, but maybe using some of the same images being swept into the same regime of deletion and censorship.</p><p>And I don't see any sign, at the moment, that they're involving judges or anybody independent. They're just asking the companies to start deleting things.</p><p>GORANI: But what's the solution then? What's the realistic solution to crack down a little bit more on some of these messages? But not just, I mean, Islamic, you have hate groups on the far right who spread also quite reprehensible language, what do you - what is realistic then in your opinion? Obviously, not an automated response.</p><p>KILLOCK: I think automated response is a bad. I mean, they can be done. They are just bad.</p><p>I think we have to think about - yes, I'm sure there is more that they can do to kind of look at this material, to work with government to identify it. But we just have to make sure what they do is accountable essentially because, I think, they are not going to try to do that.</p><p>The other thing is, we have to remember that, companies will try to do this as cheaply as possible. And that's maybe one of the problems here. Already, they use very strict rules that can be applied - done by people who are very low paid. They are not looking at context. They are just kind of doing things.</p><p>We saw that on the Guardian a few weeks ago. And those rules can be pretty arbitrary. But as you say, there is no way that American companies are going to want to suddenly sensor a lot of material that's essentially very similar to views which are seen as reprehensible perhaps, but nevertheless legal within the USA.</p><p>So, I think this is very, very hard to tackle actually.</p><p>GORANI: And also, there is the other aspect which is, the more you close down these accounts, which is a good thing, I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but the phenomenon then ends up breeding an underground kind of communication platform on apps like Telegram or these encrypted - end to end encrypted - right?</p><p>So, you get a lot of those communications that happen anyway. They just happen somewhere else.</p><p>KILLOCK: Exactly. We have to remember, these people are dedicated to the form of evil that they want to pursue. So, if you move them off Facebook, if you move them off Twitter or YouTube, they're going somewhere else, they will plot their evil somewhere else.</p><p>And that may even make it worse for the intelligence agencies because if they are hiding themselves even more effectively because they've been chased off these platforms that do cooperate with law enforcement, they could end up with less information.</p><p>So, I think we've got to be really careful here. I feel that, to a certain extent, this just looks like something that can be done. The UK government can complain to these companies and these companies will want to do something. And that makes everyone look good, but it doesn't actually necessarily help you very much and doesn't necessarily deal with the problem.</p><p>You have to remember, these are people associated with countries that are in total chaos. And I'm not saying that's an easy thing to deal with. Certainly not. But we can't expect countries that are effectively beyond the rule of law - if we leave those countries in that state, we're going to get terrorism. It will come back to us.</p><p>So, we have to think a bit more broadly. And I do feel this is a little bit of a distraction technique.</p><p>GORANI: Jim Killock, thanks very much, the executive director of Open Rights Group. Thanks for being with us.</p><p>Fighting shock and utter disgust, more than 130 Muslim leaders here in the UK have signed a letter, saying they will not perform the traditional Islamic burial prayer for the terrorists.</p><p>I want to bring in Imam Abdul Quddus Arif who joins us in the studio. Thanks for being with us.</p><p>ABDUL QUDDUS ARIF, IMAM: Thank you for having me.</p><p>GORANI: Did you sign that letter?</p><p>ARIF: I wasn't told about this letter.</p><p>GORANI: What do you make of it then? One hundred and thirty Imams and religious leaders have said these are not deserving, these individuals of the traditional prayer.</p><p>ARIF: Well, first of all, let me start by saying that I condemn such atrocities. And being part of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, there's no such thing as these individuals being part of our religion. Terrorism has no religion.</p><p>So, if this case has happened where Imams have signed, I will support that. I don't think -</p><p>GORANI: In principle, you agree with that then.</p><p>ARIF: In principle, I agree with them. (INAUDIBLE) to their families as well, how they want to bury them. We can't really impede on their rights either.</p><p>GORANI: But an Imam or a religious leader has the right to say, look, I'm not going to perform this prayer.</p><p>ARIF: Yes, he has the right to say that.</p><p>GORANI: Now, to the wider question here, of course, this is the third attack in two-and-a-half months. And you heard the police perhaps today say, well, some in the Muslim community, they need to speak up more, even though we've been reporting after Manchester and after this attack that neighbors and sometimes even family members of those who committed the attack went to authorities. What's your reaction?</p><p>ARIF: So, the community that I belong to, it's a proven model how we work. The Ahmadiyya Muslim community has been here in London for the past century, and not a single person has been radicalized, not a single person has committed such atrocities.</p><p>So, there must be something they're doing right. For example, from a very young age, we tell our children that you have to make a pledge of allegiance to your country. So, you serve country, you serve your nation, and you serve your faith.</p><p>So, me as a Londoner, serving my faith, serving my - and loving my city are hand in hand and is part of my faith. So, this is - from the very beginning, that's how we are brought up and is a proven model for why radicalization and terrorism does not happen within our community, the Ahmadiyya Muslim community.</p><p>GORANI: But these terrorists, in fact, many of them, stop going to the mosque altogether. One of the suspects in the London Bridge attack had been thrown out of his mosque for being too extreme.</p><p>So, in a way, this radicalization that happens outside the mosque, how do you address it in some people?</p><p>ARIF: So, I think social media has got a lot. I think you were discussing it before as well, has a huge role to play. I think social media companies need to really crack down on certain accounts. And we just have to have a watchful eye.</p><p>I think the government, they should also play their part as well. For example, if someone they know is under - very suspicious, they should keep an eye on him for more than -</p><p>GORANI: It's just a question of staff or they say we just don't have enough to monitor 23,000 potential -</p><p>ARIF: The government's main responsibility is what? To protect its citizens, to safeguard their rights. So, if we need to put more budget into it, we should do that. But we cannot allow a suspicious person to walk free or just carry on doing his own activities.</p><p>If you have to put sanctions on that individual, you should do that. Whatever the government, it's best to do so. But it's important that these measures are taken because always afterwards we have the case where we find authorities always say that that person was under watch.</p><p>Well, yes, he was under watch. Maybe the same should have been longer, maybe up to two years even to - it requires a lot of resources. But the predominant thing is the government's responsibility is safeguarding its people.</p><p>GORANI: I see you have a T-shirt there, but I'm not sure what's written on it.</p><p>ARIF: So, this is a campaign that we were doing, today even at the vigil where hundreds of Muslims, they came down at the vigil.</p><p>GORANI: I am a Muslim. #IAmAMuslim. What's the purpose?</p><p>ARIF: So, it's basically ask me anything.</p><p>GORANI: OK.</p><p>ARIF: So, they were standing in solidarity with all the Londoners. London is our city. We love it. Like I said, we love our city. We love our faith as well. So, we're not apologetic about being Muslims either.</p><p>So, it was (INAUDIBLE) for the public to say that, you know, ask us about Islam if you have questions about it. It's a source for media -</p><p>GORANI: You're put in a position where essentially the Muslim community, you feel like you are forced into the position of having to explain over and over and over again. We do not support terrorism, this is not our message, we do not support these acts. Does it get tiring after a while?</p><p>ARIF: It doesn't get tiring. It's an opportunity to explain once again what true Islam is.</p><p>GORANI: Right.</p><p>ARIF: Coming together, showing solidarity as part of our faith as well as (INAUDIBLE). And it's nice when we go out into the street, it's a reaction we get, we get people shaking our hands, we get people hugging us and saying that you guys are doing a wonderful job and you're going to have to come out.</p><p>But it's those reactions that we really - we enjoy. And it was amazing tonight as well that when we - I've come literally from there. That's why I might be a bit wet as well because it was raining.</p><p>But we were there in numbers. We had our love for all, hatred for none posters up. And we as the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, we really wanted to show to the world, not in our name, as the mayor of London said as well.</p><p>Imam Abdul Quddus Arif, thank you so much for joining us on CNN. We appreciate your visit.</p><p>Coming up, London's defiant response. The city replaces scenes of violence with some tales of solidarity that we'll share with you. Do stay with us.</p><p>GORANI: Britain is coming to terms with the terrorist attack on its soil in as many months. Amid the horror of Saturday night, many stories of bravery and solidarity are emerging, as is often the case after a tragedy. Fred Pleitgen has our story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Meticulously looking for even the tiniest clues. Forensic workers comb through the scene of Saturday's terror attack.</p><p>But just a few yards away, the city is getting back to its normal pace, commuters rushing to work, one of London's ways of defying the third act of terrorism since April.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think, over the weekend, the coverage - and there are a number of people that talked about London as being determined. And I think that's absolutely what we are.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The English are used to it. It's something that we just - we've just come together at times like this and just carry on.</p><p>PLEITGEN: The terrorists plowed through London with a van on Saturday night hitting many people, killing at least seven.</p><p>On Monday, the grief and sorrow still very present, many stopping and laying flowers at the edge of a crime scene, some overcome with emotion.</p><p>There is more police on the streets for extra security, but otherwise the city is barely missing a beat.</p><p>(on-camera): There was incredible carnage here on London Bridge as the van apparently swerved from side to side trying to hit as many people as possible. But only two days later, the bridge is open once again with people walking across enjoying the London skyline.</p><p>(voice-over): Defiance in the aftermath, defiance during the attack.</p><p>Romanian baker Florin Morariu is being hailed as a hero for hitting one of the attackers in the head with a basket to save people hiding in the store he works at.</p><p>FLORIN MORARIU, BAKER: I have two basket, yes. So, I've got two basket, yes. One is give, yes, is no (INAUDIBLE) these guys, yes. Number two basket is delivered on the face, yes.</p><p>PLEITGEN: You hit him in the face with a basket.</p><p>MORARIU: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ...take it with me.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Take this. Take this, yes.</p><p>PLEITGEN: Florin Morariu also recorded the moments immediately afterwards, the chaos and the carnage. He says he doesn't feel like a hero.</p><p>MORARIU: It's normal. Maybe it's my father, maybe it's my brother in this moment, yes. It's possible help, help.</p><p>PLEITGEN: Keep calm and carry on, they say, in Britain, and that's exactly what London is doing, the residents and the tourists, appreciating their city and its many attractions even more after a tough weekend.</p><p>Fred Pleitgen, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GORANI: Well, a few hours ago, the London mayor Sadiq Khan led a minute of silence in memory of those killed during the attack. A vigil was held at Potters Fields Park, close to the site of that rampage.</p><p>Let's go to our own Melissa Bell. She is there. Tell us a little bit about how this day - this tribute really unfolded today.</p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNN PARIS CORRESPONDENT: Well, it was remarkable, the crowds that were here, Hala, given the windy and rainy conditions which continue even now.</p><p>And you can see just behind me the flowers that were laid by those who gathered here at 6 p.m. this evening London time, just shy of the 48-hour mark since those shocking attacks on London Bridge, not very far away.</p><p>[16:30:01] We're right in front of Town Hall. This is Sadiq Khan's office. And his message to the crowd as he led that minute of silence really reflected the view of so many people who turned up here, many of them British Muslims who've come to say not in my name.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KHAN: This is our city. These are our values and this is our way of life. London will never be broken by terrorism. We will step up the fight against extremism and we will defeat the terrorists. Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BELL: I am, he said, a proud and patriotic British Muslim. And he spoke directly to those attackers, saying you do not act in my name. And that was really the sense of what so many people who turned up here today wanted to say a group of imams who cheered as they laid flowers of this makeshift memorial just behind me.</p><p>Tomorrow, that minute of silence will be nationwide, Hala, as the entire country remembers those who died so tragically on Saturday night.</p><p>GORANI: And just ordinary people going to work for the first time today on Monday after the attack, especially those around the London Bridge area, what are they saying about this new reality they've woken up to on the first day of the week.</p><p>BELL: I think there is this great sense of shock not just at what happened Saturday night, but as you've been saying, Hala, this new reality that seems to be the one that everyone is trying to come to terms with, as difficult as that is, three terrorist attacks in three months. It is simply not what Britain had become used to.</p><p>It had largely been spared these last two years the horrors that we've seen in Continental Europe. And I think there is at once that sense of disbelief, but also that sense of unity, of solidarity, of coming together to bring another message of what London can represent.</p><p>And I think one of the things that I have heard over and over again is we've begun to hear about some of the names of those who've lost their lives. They may come from all over the world - Canadians, Australians, French people, Germans have been victim in one way or another of this attack, and it's a reminder really of all that London represents.</p><p>It's an extraordinarily cosmopolitan city, and I think that there is a tremendous amount of pride in the spirit really that's been shown since those attacks, and in particular today as London went back to work, as London tried to go about its business, at once digested what had happened and trying to come to terms with that dreadful new reality, but also I think trying to show that it is stronger in a sense of the hatred - of the hatred that was demonstrated so tragically on London Bridge Saturday night, Hala.</p><p>GORANI: All right, Melissa. And tomorrow, of course, we'll be covering that tribute, that minute's silence across the country. Thank you.</p><p>Still to come. Airlines have suspended flights to Qatar as the diplomatic rift between neighbors threatens the stability of the Gulf region. That's next. Richard Quest joins me.</p><p>[16:40:08] GORANI: Six countries, including Saudi Arabia, and Egypt have cut diplomatic with Qatar. They accuse the Gulf state of supporting terrorism and destabilizing the region.</p><p>Qatar said the move was unjustified, but the repercussions are already being felt. All transport routes by land, air, and sea into Qatar have been blocked.</p><p>And you can see it on the map there. Qatar is not a huge country, to say the least. The Dubai's Emirate and Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways are suspending flights to and from Doha.</p><p>Some residents in Qatar have begun stocking up on food as the crisis escalates. A third of the country's food imports come from Saudi Arabia and the UAE. That will end now.</p><p>Air travelers could face significant disruption across the Gulf region. Richard Quest joins me now from Cancun, Mexico, where airline bosses are gathered for a major industry event.</p><p>Just sitting in for you for the day. Richard, you had an opportunity to speak with Qatar Airways, the CEO, off-camera. What did he tell you about this? This has to be terrible news for his industry.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: It is. He described it as a crisis. And he is in Egypt on his way back to his country because the reality is - look, I'm here with IATA, which is the international aviation body for all airlines.</p><p>And this has taken people completely by storm. And the significance, Hala, is that the three airlines that are most affected - Qatar Airways, Etihad and Emirates - they are also three of the largest crossover airlines in the world at the moment.</p><p>And so, not only now does Qatar Airways have to route itself different ways to get to and from Doha, but also it is going to be very difficult for those three lines to interact, to actually fly between each other's countries, and I think you're looking at a sizable disruption of aviation, certainly in that part of the world for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Here at IATA in Cancun, people are absolutely astounded by what's taken place.</p><p>GORANI: Right. I mean, this is going to hurt Qatar Airways more than its competition in the Gulf, right? Because Qatar Airways is not going to able to fly any of these countries that have cut diplomatic ties with Doha.</p><p>And that has to - I mean, I don't know exactly what percentage of its market that is, but it would have to be a huge chunk of it.</p><p>QUEST: It is. That inter-GCC travel, basically Qatar Airways, like all the Gulf carriers, is a sixth freedom carrier. The passengers come in, the passengers go out to different parts of the world.</p><p>But Qatar also connects people through the Gulf on to other parts of the world. So, yes, I would expect, coming on top of the laptop ban, which is affecting its US routes very badly indeed, I would expect this to have a dramatic effect.</p><p>Quite simply, it's not going to go out of business, Qatar Airways, but I would certainly expect it to go into heavy losses and need much government support.</p><p>GORANI: All right. Thanks very much, Richard Quest. And we'll see you back very soon on Quest Means Business.</p><p>Now, the move to isolate Qatar could have far-reaching repercussions. Qatar is home to the largest American military base in the Middle East and it is set to host the World Cup in 2022.</p><p>Mahjoob Zweiri is professor of Middle East politics at Qatar University and he joins me from Doha, the Qatari capital. What's really behind this? What's really behind this GCC move, do you think?</p><p>MAHJOOB ZWEIRI, PROFESSOR OF MIDDLE EAST POLITICS, QATAR UNIVERSITY: I think there was a major political shift post what's so-called Arab Spring, where every country in GCC has chosen different position.</p><p>And that positioning their political side, this contributes to this kind of fragmentation, of division on where things should go in the region.</p><p>It is a ramification. It is an important ramification of what happens in the region post-2010 present. And I think that's the reason.</p><p>What we see today is the second chapter of this crisis that started in 2014, lasted for eight months. And this is the second chapter of it, where basically Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates has chosen to maintain the status quo in the region, maintaining the situation in Egypt, maintaining the situation in Yemen.</p><p>However, Qatar has chosen a different choice. And at least according to their statesmen, they want to support the willing of people in different places.</p><p>GORANI: Sorry to jump in there. The hay that broken the camel's back was when the Emir of Qatar was quoted as saying - by the way, they then claimed that the state news website was hacked - that Iran shouldn't necessarily be isolated. Paraphrasing what he said.</p><p>And that to Saudi Arabia was unacceptable. It's clear.</p><p>[16:45:10] ZWEIRI: Again, the issue of hacking the news agency, that's the story which is -according to the sources in Doha, it's been manufactured to cause all of this crisis.</p><p>Qatar does not deny that it as a diplomatic relation with Iran. However, the relation, as an observer, I see as not developing since 2010 because of the situation in Syria.</p><p>If you look at the relation, for example, between United Arab Emirates and Iran, it's more progress economically and politically than Doha/Tehran.</p><p>And still, the relation, no one asks, for example, United Arab Emirates to cut the relation with Tehran. No one asks, for example, Oman to do so.</p><p>I think the issue of Iran and the whole story here is being added just to lead to more pressure on Qatar politically because, as an expert in the region, the relation has not developed a lot between Doha and Tehran in the last five, six years.</p><p>GORANI: But here's the thing, though, the other countries can afford to cut ties with Qatar. Qatar can't afford not to have ties with the other countries. It cannot be isolated like this.</p><p>It wants to host the World Cup. It wants to have a voice on the world stage. It doesn't have a choice here, but to bow to the pressure, right?</p><p>ZWEIRI: Again, as an observer, this is the first day of the crisis. I think - I assume, according to what I read in the last 13, 14 hours, that there was all plan Bs for a lot of items according to the food supply, for the contractors, there is a lot of preparation.</p><p>They learned the lesson from 2014 crisis. Even in the street, I was just - came back from one of the malls. I didn't see any of the images, for example, broadcast in social media. People, they are shopping because it is Ramadan and people normally choose specific hours to shop, which basically - it shows that there is a traffic.</p><p>GORANI: So, there is no panic is what you're saying? These images on social media misrepresent what's going on.</p><p>ZWEIRI: I have not seen - I have not seen it myself. I went out. I just came back from actually doing my shopping for my family. I haven't seen such thing on at least two of the malls I was there.</p><p>So, I think this tells me -</p><p>GORANI: I'm glad you cleared that up. I'm glad you cleared that up. We have seen these images, but you're right, it is Ramadan, and after all, people stock up on food when they break their fast.</p><p>ZWEIRI: As you know, Hala, sometimes people, they choose the time before Iftar - they want to pick everything for after Iftar which caused a lot of people crowding on malls and supermarkets.</p><p>GORANI: And let's talk again, maybe in a few days and see how the reaction has developed or evolved among ordinary Qataris and residents of Qatar.</p><p>ZWEIRI: We'll keep our eyes on the situation.</p><p>GORANI: Absolutely. Thank you, Mahjoob Zweiri of Qatar University.</p><p>ZWEIRI: My pleasure, Hala.</p><p>GORANI: Donald Trump is using the London terror attack to drum up support for his executive order on immigration, affecting several mostly-Muslim countries.</p><p>And one of his tweets this Monday, Mr. Trump referred to the order of the travel ban. Now, that appears to contradict his own administration, which said many times this is not a ban, but a temporary pause among other names and argued that it does not target Muslims.</p><p>Well, a few hours ago, the White House defended the president's latest tweets.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDERS: I don't think the president cares what you call it, whether you call it a ban, whether you call it a restriction. He cares that we call it national security and that we take steps to protect the people of this country.</p><p>It's real simple. Everybody wants to get into the labels and the semantics of it, but the bottom line is, he's trying to protect the citizens of this country. The danger is extremely clear. The law is very clear. And the nature of this executive order is very clear. And the president's priority in protecting the people is very clear.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy press secretary. Ariane de Vogue is in Washington. So, Ariane, we know several courts have struck down this travel ban. I mean, I am not sure. Maybe we can call it that, now that the president himself calls it that.</p><p>How will this affect the administration's appeal to the Supreme Court?</p><p>ARIANE DE VOGUE, CNN SUPREME COURT REPORTER: It will definitely complicate the job of the legal challengers, right? Because below the challengers have said, look, we won and we won because we could show that this was an intent to ban Muslims.</p><p>And what did they use for their justification? They used campaign statements, right? They used what the president said during the campaign.</p><p>[16:50:01] So, now, you have the Department of Justice lawyers and you have these new tweets, and the Department of Justice lawyers, they have bent over backwards to say, look, you have got to disregard those campaign statements, disregard the tweets, look just at what the ban is.</p><p>And on its face, they say, it's religiously neutral and it targets national security. Plus, they say, we've come up with this revised ban. It's different than the ban that was first put out.</p><p>So, what did these tweets do at the end of the day. The president, he sort of dismisses the difference, right, between those two bans and also he kind of says that his lawyers are simply making politically correct statements to please the courts.</p><p>So, that can't be good for the Department of Justice lawyers. And at the end of the day, you ask will it matter? And that depends if the justices of the Supreme Court choose to look at these statements, the campaign statements, the tweets, and if they choose to take those into consideration.</p><p>GORANI: But how is this going to change the way the Justice Department lawyers are going to argue this case with the Supreme Court because it's almost - I mean, it's almost an impossible task to argue it's not a ban when the president himself several times tweets, after he's elected, it is a ban.</p><p>DE VOGUE: Well, the president can say, look, it's a travel ban. What he can't say is that it's a Muslim ban.</p><p>But I'll tell you, what's going on right now is the challengers have a deadline from the Supreme Court and they have to reply to - send their reply briefs and they've already gone on Twitter because now everybody seems to use Twitter, and they're going to - and they've said, look, we're going to use these tweets against him because what they suggest is that the tweets show he's in bad faith.</p><p>He keeps saying that there is a national security justification for this. But they say that, in fact, it's a veiled attack on Muslims. And that's why they think they'll their case before the Supreme Court.</p><p>GORANI: Ariane de Vogue, thanks very much, our Supreme Court correspondent.</p><p>Coming up, we're learning more about those who lost their lives or got hurt in the London attack. We'll bring you their stories next.</p><p>GORANI: There was some heroism amid the horror. Witnesses to the London attack say quick action by police saved lives. Liam Connell, who was at a nearby bar when the chaos broke out, had this to say about them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIAM CONNELL, EYEWITNESS: (INAUDIBLE) and it wasn't actually until we got up that I kind of realized how bad it was because my friends told me that there was someone behind us too that had actually been outside.</p><p>GORANI: And what did you see when you finally left the bar?</p><p>CONNELL: We just kind of ran. I mean, the police were there the whole way. They helped us the whole way. They were there. And everyone was saying thank you to them. Everyone was so, so grateful to them.</p><p>Even though everyone wanted to leave (INAUDIBLE) after all these police with guns were around, no one panicked. No one was pushing or shoving. Everyone was just (INAUDIBLE) to leave almost.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[16:55:13] GORANI: Seven people were killed, 48 injured in the attack. Erin McLaughlin has some of their stories.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We're beginning to learn more about some of the victims killed that horrific night.</p><p>Chrissy Archibald is the first to be named, a Canadian national, who moved to Europe to be with her fiance. She helped a homeless. She was there with her fiance on the London Bridge when the terrorist van struck and killed her. The family releasing a statement saying she was beautiful and loving. She would never have understood the kind of callous cruelty that claim her life.</p><p>We're also hearing of heroic acts that night. Journalist Geoff Ho was at a restaurant in the Borough Market when the assailant arrived. He intervened to help a bounced when he was stabbed by one of the terrorists in the neck.</p><p>Social media footage shows him calmly leaving the scene to seek medical help, bleeding from his neck. We understand from the newspaper that he works for that he's OK.</p><p>We're also hearing appeals for help. Maureen Vincent (ph) is a French national. She was at the Borough Market as well, badly wounded by the terrorists, brought here to the King's College Hospital. Doctors say that her injuries are so sever, it will take her some 6 to 12 months to fully recover, one of the many lives forever altered that tragic night.</p><p>Erin McLaughlin, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: Thanks for watching.

Gould's Bill C-76, passed in december and intended to apply to the upcoming federal election, created new regulations for third-party political advertisers on electronic platforms. This had an immediate comic effect, as anybody knows if they watched Google representatives being harangued at the Commons Access to Information, Privacy and ethics Committee on May 9.</p><p>Google was hauled before the committee because it couldn't figure out a way to comply with C-76's requirements in time for the election. As Colin McKay and Jason Kee tried to explain to the vexed legislators, Google is in the business of serving unfathomable mass quantities of advertising to other people's websites and phone applications and keeping some of the cash. They don't make either the ads or the sites to which they're served: they are, for this purpose, a pipeline company that imposes a lucrative toll. Like other platforms they are busily trying to stamp out the most socially obnoxious and unethical content in the pipeline, with varying amounts of success: a screening algorithm that gets invented on January 1 is bound to be gamed before sunrise January 2.</p><p>In other words, it's a technological arms race. But some of the specifics of C-76's rules on political advertising presented immediate and difficult problems for Google, and it did its best to explain them to the committee. The law, as passed, imposes \"registry\" requirements on the sites and apps connected to the pipeline, who may not even know what ads they are showing. And the registry, if it could be created by Google for its customers, would have to be updated daily. \"This effectively means,\" observed Google lawyer Jason Kee, \"that the registry must be updated in real time, as a regulated political ad that was displayed at 11:59 p.m. would need to be included in the registry before midnight.\"</p><p>Not feasible, said Kee, at least on such short notice. Finally, the broad definition of \"election advertising\" written into the law was a problem: it includes any ad \"taking a position on an issue with which a registered party or candidate is associated,\" which might literally change from minute to minute during a campaign. What's the technological solution to that? (even if Google could hire a billion human editors to do that work, could the company be sure of complying with C-76?) So Google, the accused social poisoner and wrecker of democracy, decided to obey the law by cancelling all political ad sales in Canada during the upcoming regulated period.</p><p>You might suppose that they would be thanked for withdrawing the poison at their own undoubtedly significant expense. Instead, the Liberals, like the restaurant patron who complains that the food is lousy and the portions are so small, flew into a genuine rage. Nathaniel erskine-Smith whined that \"We are too small for you ... you are too important, and we are just not important enough for Google to take us seriously.\" erskine-Smith and other committee members demanded to know exactly how soon Google would be bringing political ads back to Canada, furiously trying to pin down a 2023 date.</p><p>In the video of the meeting they seem quite desperate about this - as one might expect from representatives of a technologically aware major political party, one with well-developed demographic targets that can really only be attacked with Google's help. If you read the transcript of the meeting, or better yet view erskine-Smith's cranky demeanour in the archived video, you will understand that the Liberal dialogue with big tech really has the goal of being seen to do something about social media and online advertising without flustering the golden goose.</p><p>Which makes Karina Gould's tantrum in the foyer even funnier. Having treated Google peevishly for taking the Atlas Shrugged approach to C-76, the government was suddenly upholding it as the ultimate good citizen for the purpose of castigating Twitter, a platform \"(We) know ... has been used and manipulated by foreign and malicious actors.\" Increasingly, when politicians discuss social media, they seem to be advancing the premise that we can only preserve an open, free and internationalist society as long as someone will agree to keep all those devious and unclean outsiders off our internet. (Our own privilege as Canadians of hopping on Twitter and hurling memes and insults at the Saudis or the Israelis or the russians or the Americans, of course, is never to be questioned.)</p><p>National Post Twitter.com/ColbyCosh !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, organisations representing the print and broadcast media industries, and the Law Council all expressed serious misgivings.</p><p>But for the local tech community it was a particularly bitter pill to swallow. It was just the latest in a lengthening list of policy defeats the community has suffered in recent times. There was the defeat over encryption laws last year. Before that, the clawing back of research and development tax breaks and changes to the rules over highly skilled migration.</p><p>Part of the problem is that in Canberra, \"tech\" more often than not means the branch offices of the US tech giants (think Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple). After all, these are the most substantial tech businesses operating in Australia. They employ thousands of people, generate billions of dollars in revenue and make products used by millions.</p><p>They are also deeply out of favour with politicians all around the world, and Australia is no exception. \"There is so little respect for them,\" one Canberra source says of Big Tech. \"Their kneejerk reaction to everything is 'regulation won't solve this'. But the government is jack of it.\"</p><p>The succession of recent scandals involving tech companies, and their fierce resistance to regulation (including over taxation) are coming home to roost. The local branches of Big Tech firms (government relations staff often report to offices in Singapore, and don't have major clout with headquarters in the US) are proving ill-equipped to deal with the backlash.</p><p>All of this is little comfort to Australia's homegrown tech community - a collection of scrappy start-ups and a handful of substantial companies headed by software firm Atlassian. These firms have little in common with each other, let alone Big Tech, but unfortunately are indirectly tarred with the same brush.</p><p>It's tempting to view the string of recent policy defeats as evidence our elected officials just don't understand tech and innovation - and that is certainly part of the problem. But here's the thing: our politicians don't understand a lot of things. (Have you ever watched a Senate estimates hearing? Or even just Question Time?) If you are starting from the premise that politicians will act logically you are already doing it wrong.</p><p>It also may be tempting to view this as a partisan issue that might be resolved if the Coalition loses power at the election. Perhaps, but Labor voted for the legislation the local sector is most upset about, and has had its own howlers in the past, (Remember Internet Filter?)</p><p>Navigating the shadowy corridors of power is one of the few areas where the tech scene can arguably learn from the old economy industries they seek to disrupt. Forging relationships, attending fundraisers, and so forth, isn't pretty work. But politics is a grubby game and to succeed at it you need to get your hands dirty.</p><p>\"Telco and media may not win every battle, but they certainly put up a better fight,\" one former staffer says. \"They know they are going to get regulated somehow, so they work with government to make it work. With tech, it's their way or the highway. Inevitably, it leads to a worse outcome\".</p><p>Every time legislation passes affecting the sector there are veiled threats to leave Australia - which is not the way to endear yourself to politicians. As the Attorney General Christian Porter put it last week: \"It's like Alec Baldwin saying he's going to leave America every time a Republican is elected president - it just doesn't happen.\"</p><p>There are also arguments that the measures will cost jobs that don't yet exist. Again, the sentiment is valid but these are not winning arguments.</p><p>Being good at lobbying is not a virtue that we should celebrate. Yet if the local tech sector really is the key to our future prosperity in a post mining economy, and if Canberra's bad policy is seriously threatening that, then it is becoming a necessary evil.</p><p>The Twitter diplomacy favoured by our most prominent tech entrepreneurs and venture capitalists might be refreshing and entertaining (it also makes for good newspaper copy). But that alone isn't going to cut it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc74tejdrx6k7w8rcb5bi</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VTY-8XC1-F0J6-J4GH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"808\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; First Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 8, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

The local branches of Big Tech firms (government relations staff often report to offices in Singapore, and don't have major clout with headquarters in the US) are proving ill-equipped to deal with the backlash.</p><p>All of this is little comfort to Australia's homegrown tech community - a collection of scrappy start-ups and a handful of substantial companies headed by software firm Atlassian. These firms have little in common with each other, let alone Big Tech, but unfortunately are indirectly tarred with the same brush.</p><p>It's tempting to view the string of recent policy defeats as evidence our elected officials just don't understand tech and innovation - and that is certainly part of the problem. But here's the thing: our politicians don't understand a lot of things. (Have you ever watched a Senate estimates hearing? Or even just Question Time?) If you are starting from the premise that politicians will act logically you are already doing it wrong.</p><p>It also may be tempting to view this as a partisan issue that might be resolved if the Coalition loses power at the election. Perhaps, but Labor voted for the legislation the local sector is most upset about, and has had its own howlers in the past, (Remember Internet Filter?)</p><p>Navigating the shadowy corridors of power is one of the few areas where the tech scene can arguably learn from the old economy industries they seek to disrupt. Forging relationships, attending fundraisers, and so forth, isn't pretty work. But politics is a grubby game and to succeed at it you need to get your hands dirty.</p><p>\"Telco and media may not win every battle, but they certainly put up a better fight,\" one former staffer says. \"They know they are going to get regulated somehow, so they work with government to make it work. With tech, it's their way or the highway. Inevitably, it leads to a worse outcome\".</p><p>Every time legislation passes affecting the sector there are veiled threats to leave Australia - which is not the way to endear yourself to politicians. As the Attorney General Christian Porter put it last week: \"It's like Alec Baldwin saying he's going to leave America every time a Republican is elected president - it just doesn't happen.\"</p><p>There are also arguments that the measures will cost jobs that don't yet exist. Again, the sentiment is valid but these are not winning arguments.</p><p>Being good at lobbying is not a virtue that we should celebrate. Yet if the local tech sector really is the key to our future prosperity in a post mining economy, and if Canberra's bad policy is seriously threatening that, then it is becoming a necessary evil.</p><p>The Twitter diplomacy favoured by our most prominent tech entrepreneurs and venture capitalists might be refreshing and entertaining (it also makes for good newspaper copy). But that alone isn't going to cut it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-doc74tfkuw5s2h3q7ij5bi</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VTY-8XC1-F0J6-J48V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"808\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

One of the focus areas of the discussion was the debate on rights versus the state; see our coverage of the event here. He likened rights versus the state to \"David and Goliath, individual rights versus the state.\" Nehaa Chaudhari of Ikigai Law said, in the context of Aadhaar, that denial of service was an effective tool that the state adopted time and again.</p><p><br/><br/>The panel extensively discussed the idea of rights vis-a-vis the insurmountable growth of technology, the state's need to collect citizens' data, business interests of enterprises, and even the classist division in rights.<br/><br/>Please note that quotes aren't verbatim, and have been edited for clarity.<br/><br/>State vs rights: 'Not infringing free speech should be easy for the state'<br/><br/>Malavika Raghavan of Dvara Research said that ensuring civil rights should be an easy thing for the state to do. \"It's much easier to guarantee civil political rights for the state because it just doesn't have to infringe your speech,\" she said.<br/><br/>The PDP bill process was pretty well done, but there were demands that could have been more transparent. @nehaachaudhari #PolicyNext - MediaNama.com (@medianama) June 27, 2019<br/><br/>Mohanty on the other hand said that the state has constantly shifted narratives and is becoming smarter in attacking rights.<br/><br/>\"The State is also shifting narratives by itself and deploying those shifting narratives. The draft encryption policy in 2014 faced a huge uproar, but that didn't happen with the Data Protection Bill. So, the objective remains the same, but the narratives are constantly shifting and the state's becoming a lot smarter when it comes to attacking rights\"<br/><br/>- Bedavyasa Mohanty, Researcher<br/><br/>Beni Chugh from Dvara Research who was seated in the audience said, \"One pattern that has come out in both the panels is that perhaps the citizen state contract is much weaker when the state is leading the citizen's privacy and also the principal agent model is much weaker when the state is dealing with corporations who might have an impact on citizens' privacy.\"<br/><br/>Talking about Rebecca McKinnon's study that ranked telecom and internet companies from 27 countries on the aspect of privacy, an audience member Shubhodeep Jash from New America said that only two companies participated in the India. However, he wasn't sure about the disclosures made by them. \"Did Airtel report specifically as to how many shutdown requests came to them in 2017-2018?\" he asked. Another audience member, Arun P, research scholar at the University of Delhi pointed out that \"Puttaswamy did discuss about necessity and proportionality, but the problem with our surveillance law is it does not even give basic statistical information of number of requests they have sent, the requests they have received in response from the companies.\"<br/><br/>Tech vs rights: 'Tech is everywhere, which is why it's all the more important for us to get this right'<br/><br/>Mohanty argued that while there is a lot of talk about individual rights and the state's role in it, we often forget how seemingly unstoppable developments in technology often undermine basic human rights. \"It's really difficult to keep up with the rapid evolution of technology. The truth is that the people who innovate and create technology are often able to direct the narrative around it. And then individual rights come as an afterthought,\" said Mohanty.<br/><br/>\"Lawyers keep focusing on individual rights and policy-making being central to the country's development, but they in fact, aren't central to how technology develops\"<br/><br/>- Bedavyasa Mohanty, Researcher<br/><br/>The truth is that not many technologies develop with keeping rights in mind. We are seeing a rise in the sophistication of technology coming today. Rights come as an afterthought. @darth_beda #PolicyNext - MediaNama.com (@medianama) June 27, 2019<br/><br/>\"Tech is increasingly becoming all-pervasive. It's not a vertical sector, it's everywhere - your data, the internet, free speech, the whole gamut, which is why it's all the more important for us to get this right,\" Chaudhari said.<br/><br/>\"Only the person building the product knows how it can be deployed, and therefore I think that you need to be responding to user harm and user right and not override those. You can't expect the user to say build your encryption standard in this particular way so that when there's a third party server accessing my chats, that's a completely incomprehensible standard, and I think there are good ways to build around that just by using principles, using rights and holding people accountable to principles, rights and harms and then leaving them to build technology\"<br/><br/>- Malavika Raghavan, Dvara Research<br/><br/>Business vs rights: Can businesses in India have rights?<br/><br/>\"From the perspective of tech companies, both startups and big tech companies are essentially looking at two things. One, they're looking for a certainty of the process and an idea or visibility of the regulator's thinking,\" Chaudhari said before adding \"The second is the content of the regulation itself.\"<br/><br/>For Chaudhari, however, \"in the past two years, we've been lacking on at least one of these two counts. No matter which tech policy instrument I pick up, there have been very few, that I would say, have got right on both levels, on the process of getting through the regulation itself as well as the content of the regulation.\"<br/><br/>The harm done to businesses by failing on one of these two fronts would eventually befall on the users and the general public, according to Chaudhari.<br/><br/>\"Most of the conversation today has unfortunately become that of industry versus the state and that's actually a failure on all of our parts. When the industry is affected, you are also fundamentally talking about harms to the user\"<br/><br/>- Nehaa Chaudhari, Ikigai Law<br/><br/>Collective vs individual rights: 'Individual privacy is seen as a decadent for a collective'<br/><br/>Chaudhari said that the idea of collective rights goes hand in hand with the argument of national interest, that we are seeing play out a lot these days. Talking about the Srikrishna Committee's Data Protection Bill and the E-commerce Policy, she said that the former seems to be still grounded in the notion of individual rights according to the Puttaswamy framework, while the latter is completely opposite to it. \"The Shrikrishna Committee said that the Data Protection Bill is a concept that we need to think about a little bit moreWe're talking about the individual being in control of their information,\" she added<br/><br/>\"The e-commerce policy draft just does a complete u-turn, because it takes you to a property rights ground it has been working on and starts talking about data ownership, which is then tricky territory. The e-commerce policy is more of a collective rights argument\"<br/><br/>- Nehaa Chaudhari, Ikigai Law<br/><br/>Mohanty said, \"One of the things that we've seen in the e-commerce policy in terms of demand for community data is that the government believes it doesn't have enough data, and so for example, they want traffic data from Google maps or from Uber and say that that's community data belonging to the Government of India.\"<br/><br/>Nikhil Pahwa, Founder &amp; editor, MediaNama, said that \"the national security narrative is becoming overbearing and how can we protect rights in the environment that we are in. Individual privacy is seen as decadent, a problem for a collective, and the integrity of the state to be maintained.\"<br/><br/>Class vs rights: 'Rights were never championed by the most powerful in India'<br/><br/>Do rights mean different to different classes in the society, and should the fundamental ideas of privacy and right to speech be not constant and cut across class divides?<br/><br/>Malavika said that there is a difference in the way India perceives rights as opposed to how western countries like the US do. For her, this distinction is drawn because rights in the US were never championed by the state, but by powerful people in the society, unlike here in India.<br/><br/>\"India went straight into constitutional rights and in countries like the US, it is always championed by the most powerful in society. As each interest group gained rights, women's movement boomed more, gay rights movement boomed more, but whereas for us I find one reason perhaps in the political framework, it [privacy] is more expendable, is funnily enough it was not necessarily always championed by the most powerful, by the ones who could monetise at the most,\" she said<br/><br/>\"We do low-income household stories. I would love to actually have some other think tank or research agency do high-income stories - like just the picture of a guy, at the end of the day and he's is in a 3-piece suit he can't make a phone call because his phone is blocked  I think that would resonate with the people making policy.\"<br/><br/>- Malavika Raghavan, Dvara Research<br/><br/>Referring to Aadhaar biometric authentication, Nikhil Pahwa said, \"One joke I had made around the time the Aadhaar debate was - because low-income people were being deprived of rations - let's make it [Aadhaar authentication] mandatory for flights. Every time it's going to fail, someone won't be able to take a flight. Then we'll see what happens,\" he said.<br/><br/>* MediaNama's first #PolicyNext conference, held in Delhi, was supported by Internet Society (APAC), OYO, Google, Amazon, Mozilla and Facebook.

Combined with new technologies such as artificial intelligence, it is set to change society perhaps more than any previous technological revolution \u2013 growing the economy, making us more productive, and raising living standards. Harnessing the benefits of new technologies is at the heart of our Industrial Strategy, through which we are supporting innovation and the commercialisation of ideas. We are investing an additional \u00a37 billion in research and development by 2021/22, delivering major upgrades to our digital infrastructure, and ensuring that people are ready to seize the opportunities of technology through investing in our skills system.  As well as opportunities, new technologies have brought new challenges and risks. The internet can be used to spread terrorist material; it can be a tool for abuse and bullying; and it can be used to undermine civil discourse, objective news and intellectual property. Increasingly sophisticated use of data and AI can create powerful insights from our behaviour online, which can be deployed in ways that influence the decisions we make, or target the services and resources we receive. And legitimate concerns have been raised about the balance of power between the big tech platforms, citizens and others.  Government must lead the way in tackling these challenges. Our starting point is that we will have the same rights and expect the same behaviour online as we do offline. We will take action to ensure that the internet and new technologies are not only safe and secure, but also that they are developed and used responsibly and ethically, with users\u2019 interests at their heart. And we will ensure that businesses can compete on a level playing field and digital markets deliver the best outcomes for consumers.  In some cases this will be through shifting expectations of behaviour; in some we will need to agree new standards; and in others we will need to update our laws. Where regulation is necessary, we will ensure it is well-targeted, proportionate and delivers a stable and predictable business environment for innovation to thrive. We will develop it in collaboration with industry and international partners and ensure our overall approach is coherent and easy to understand for citizens as well as businesses.  We are guided by these principles:      the internet should be free, open and accessible      people should understand the rules that apply to them when they are online      personal data should be respected and used appropriately      protections should be in place to help keep people safe online, especially children      the same rights that people have offline must be protected online      the social and economic benefits brought by new technologies should be fairly shared    Work programme  To support our ambition for the UK to be the safest place in the world to be online;  We have:      published a Social Media Code of Practice, which sets expectations for preventing and responding to abusive behaviour, and annual transparency requirements      taken a range of actions to raise cyber security standards across the UK, backed by \u00a31.9bn of new funding, including the creation of the National Cyber Security Centre      published a Code of Practice for Internet of Things devices to ensure that strong security is built into internet-connected products by design      set new standards for protecting personal data, and given people more rights and control over the use of their data through the Data Protection Act    We will:    introduce a new statutory duty of care, which will be overseen and enforced by an independent regulator, as set out in the Online Harms White Paper. This regulatory framework will require companies to take reasonable and proportionate action to tackle harmful online content and activity on their services.  To ensure that technology works for society as a whole;  We have:      established the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation - a new advisory body which will provide independent, expert advice on the measures needed to enable and ensure safe, ethical and innovative uses of AI and data-driven technologies      published the independent Cairncross Review, which considers how the news industry in the UK can become more sustainable as it transitions from print to digital.    We will:      engage with the Centre to examine areas that pose key policy challenges; initial projects include a study of the use of data in shaping people\u2019s online experiences, and the potential for bias in decisions made using algorithms      review how online advertising is regulated in the UK, recognising the need to look right across the different challenges brought by online advertising to develop an effective response    To promote fair and efficient digital markets;  We have:      published an independent review of competition in the digital economy, undertaken by an expert panel in digital competition led by Professor Jason Furman      through the Intellectual Property Office, facilitated a Code of Practice signed by search engines and copyright owners, which has reduced the prominence of websites hosting illegal copyright infringing content in natural search results    We will:      continue to develop a National Data Strategy to unlock the power of data across government and the economy, while building public trust and confidence in its use      set out our response to the range of challenges posed by digital markets as part of wider work to update the UK\u2019s competition regime    Approach  We look to the tech sector, businesses and civil society to own these challenges with us, using our convening power to bring them together to find solutions where possible. But we will not be afraid to take direct action or legislate where necessary.  We are committing to:      make it as easy as possible for citizens and others to give us their views      harness the ingenuity of the tech sector, looking to them for answers to specific technological challenges, rather than government dictating precise solutions      consider the full range of possible solutions, including domestic legal changes where necessary, to establish standards and norms online      lead by example, including through our procurement policy and the data we hold    These are challenges with which every nation is grappling. The internet is a global network and we will work with other countries that share both our values and our determination to get this right.     </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURUNN-RLPMN948349520190408</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURUNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVB-8CY1-J9XT-P0D4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400456</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1188\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>European Union News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"660\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 8, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

However, with a few exceptions these policies only raise the level of GDP. It is only by removing the regulatory barriers that prevent new technologies from being adopted that we can increase the trend rate of growth. </p><p>Even relatively small increases in the trend rate of growth (0.1pp) can lead to very large increases in living standards over a few decades. This highlights the importance of getting innovation policy right. To advance in innovation in the UK we will focus on three key areas in 2018. Emerging technologies such as drones, autonomous vehicles, and consumer genetics could save lives, cut pollution and save money for millions of consumers. But the rate of innovation of depends on the speed at which entrepreneurs can bring new products to market. While centrally planned rollouts often backfire (e.g. smart meters), government can play a role. By proactively deregulating in favour of emerging technologies, they can create the space for entrepreneurs to experiment with new technologies. Britain is a world-leader in FinTech as a result of the Financial Conduct Authority's regulatory sandbox[1]. The FCA's sandbox allows start-ups to trial new products without going through extensive regulatory approval processes. This reduces risk for investors as firms are able to demonstrate business models before getting full regulatory approval. This is particularly useful to start-ups who both cannot afford legal counsel to navigate the regulatory process and cannot attract investment without demonstrating their business model is viable. We should apply the FCA's regulatory sandbox approach to other emerging technologies such as driverless vehicles, consumer genetics, and commercial drones. It also important that regulation does not deter innovative business models. Ridesharing firms such as Uber have expanded flexible employment[2] and delivered a cheaper, faster service. To ensure the sector remains competitive and to avoid a chilling effect on innovation, central government should restrict the ability of local authorities to unfairly crack down on disruptive firms. Competition policy should protect competition, not competitors. But in recent years, innovative tech giants including Amazon, Facebook and Google have come under attack for being too large by the so-called 'hipster antitrust[3]' movement. There is a risk that we return to a na\u00efve 'big is bad'[4] policy. The European Commission's intervention against Google highlights the risk posed to innovative businesses. Even though there was little evidence that Google harmed consumers[5], the Commission forced Google to restructure its Shopping business. They risk deterring innovation and harming consumers. Recent attacks on Google, Facebook and Amazon rely on overhyped theory (network effects) when evidence suggests that platforms can still face intense competition (e.g. the fall of Myspace)[6]. There is a risk that firms face restrictive data requirements deterring innovation in AI[7]. Others call for burdening Facebook and Google by treating them as publishers[8]. Both policies would be a step backwards: they will reduce investment and make consumers worse off. If we're to keep our economy innovative, competition policy must be guided by consumer welfare. As we live more of our lives online, the importance of cybersecurity is increasing. However, government intervention risks making us less safe. Attempts to prevent terrorism by undermining encryption through backdoors, make us more vulnerable to cybercrime[9]. At the same time, attempts to prevent children from accessing online pornography may put adults at risk of fraud and leave sensitive data unprotected[10]. We should also ensure that reducing the risk of terrorist cyber-attacks using driverless vehicles and drones does not create restrictive standards[11] that impede innovation and create lengthy regulatory approvals processes. This is the second part of our Policy Priorities in 2018 series. Check out how we will boost productivity[12] and how we'll support the return of practical liberalism[13] in British politics.

In part one, we make the case for creating a more prosperous society post-Brexit[1]. In part two, we discuss how practical liberalism will tackle Britain's burning injustices[2]. The future is going to be awesome. Driverless cars reducing traffic congestion and fuel usage[3] while saving millions of lives[4]. Lab grown meat[5] ending animal cruelty and starvation. Nuclear[6], fusion[7], micro power plants, renewable and storage technologies providing cheap, reliable and low emission energy. Air taxis[8] flying us to our destination in minutes. </p><p>A free, open internet built on the superfast 5G mobile[9] network providing limitless entertainment and choice. Drones[10] delivering us orders in minutes. OLED TVs that roll up and down[11] as required. AI improving services like healthcare[12] and meaning we can spend more time with our kids. Robots saving us[13] from monotonous, dangerous, and strenuous work. Desalination and water recycling providing limitless safe water for drinking, agriculture and industry. Blockchain securing, decentralising and reinvigorating finance[14], trade[15] and the rule of law[16]. Safe, quiet and affordable supersonic flight[17] ending the tyranny of distance across our planet. The sharing economy setting workers and consumers free to voluntarily cooperate, increasing trust and meaning more efficient use of resources. Pills and treatments curing evermore diseases including cancer and extending our lives. Diets customised[18] to the individual. Start-ups using open data to innovate in healthcare, fintech and energy. Hyperloop between cities[19] cutting journey times from hours to minutes. The Adam Smith Institute is excited, optimistic and ready for the future. In 2019, we will continue to crusade for progress against the neo-philistines who seek to hold back progress with pessimism and needless red tape. If the last two hundred years, since we unleashed human potential[20] in the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution, have shown us anything it is that the limits of human potential are our imagination. But this future will only be possible if we are willing to grasp the opportunity. Our public policy must be open to new technology[21], even when it is disruptive in the short-run, because the costs of stagnation are too high. We know that too much regulation stifles innovation[22], which not only damages economic growth and wages but also lowers our quality of life and prevents social progress. Let's take the future of transport: a topic that the ASI will be talking about more this year. Driverless cars will substantially reduce if not entirely obliterate congestion, emissions, and crashes. Surveys have found that people are broadly excited about the potential for driverless cars[23] - 52% of Britons have a positive view and just 14% have a negative view of self-driving vehicles. Nevertheless, many are fearful about safety. Governments must resist the temptation to respond to the extremely rare cases of crashes - there has been just a single fatally[24] in a fully self-driving car, compared to 1.24 million annual fatalities[25] in conventional cars - by overregulating. There are some complex safety, ethical[26] and insurance[27] issues to address. Nevertheless, it is essential that misguided regulation[28] does not slow down lifesaving technology. The same principle, encouraging innovation, also applies to other new transport technologies, including scooters[29] (share schemes are booming in the United States[30], however they are banned[31] on British roads and pavement), air taxis[32], drones[33], Hyperloop[34] and supersonic[35] travel. The ASI are techno-optimists. We will continue to make the case for embracing developing technologies from artificial intelligence and big data to lab grown meat and blockchain. There are many, however, who do not share our optimism. There are now endless streams of books and articles predicting a forthcoming jobs apocalypse because of a mixture of robots, artificial intelligence, the sharing economy, and big data. While it is true that new technology has been displacing jobs for centuries, there is a lack of evidence[36] that automation has reduced the number of available jobs. We are now doing safer, less strenuous, more complex, interesting and higher paid jobs than in the past. Humanity would be much worse off today if the Luddites had succeeded in preventing the mechanisation of factories, or the pessimists who said that computers would lead to joblessness had been allowed to prevent technological development. Meanwhile, the gig economy means that individuals have more flexibility[37], a trade-off many are willing to make for less job security than a traditional job. Efforts to regulate the sharing economy, such as Transport for London's ill-fated[38] attempt to ban Uber, at the behest of rent-seeking old industries, will inevitably hurt consumers. If we want a bright digital future, we must not overregulate the internet. The internet is central to the future of technology: it is not only how we communicate, work, and find information, it is also the necessary backbone for practically all future technology. But there are several threats to the future of the internet. There are increasing calls from the political left and right reign in alleged 'monopolies'[39] such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, limit usage of big data[40], and introduce digital taxes, despite the lack of consumer harm[41]. There are also substantial efforts by governments to undermine encryption, such as those proposed by Prime Minister Theresa May[42] and passed last month in Australia[43], that will make the internet less safe. We must fight crime and terrorism without threatening cybersecurity and privacy by building backdoors into existing technology. Encryption is not a threat; it is absolutely key to the digital economy and liberty. As American founder Benjamin Franklin is often quoted, 'Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.' In the Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves[44], Matthew Ridley argues that 'ideas have sex,' that is, over time new technologies, concepts, and governance evolves by the merging and moulding together of ideas, they 'meet and mate'. Over the last few hundred years, this process has accelerated because of, as Deirdre McCloskey argues[45], Britain first and subsequently the Anglosphere, the West and the rest of the world, embracing the bourgeoisie love of entrepreneurship, innovation and creation. We must continue to embrace this love of those who create. There's truly never been a more exciting time to be alive - let's unleash the opportunities of the future. ---- Adam Smith Institute's Policy Priorities 2019 Part 1: Rebooting Britain\u2014Creating a

The probe will include a series of hearings and will give lawmakers an opportunity to seek information from the companies about their practices through requests and subpoenas.</p><p>The committee said that the probe would focus on three areas: documenting where competition is lacking in digital markets, exploring whether large companies are suppressing competition and determining whether Congress and regulators need to do more to address Big Tech's dominance.</p><p>\"As tech has expanded its market share, more and more questions have arisen about whether the market remains competitive,\" Rep.

Fed-watchers and investors have increased the odds of a rate reduction as trade tensions and stock market volatility cloud the economic picture.</p><p>The economy is expected to grow at a slower rate in 2019 than in 2018, when U.S. gross domestic product increased 2.9 percent over the year. Rising trade tensions between the U.S. and several crucial partners, including China, Mexico and the European Union, may also weigh down the economy.</p><p>The Fed is also concerned that inflation has lingered below its 2 percent target range as measured by the personal consumption expenditures index minus food and energy prices.</p><p>The Fed raised interest nine times since 2015 and seven since Trump took office in 2017 in a bid to prevent rampant inflation. Trump has been fiercely critical of the Fed's interest rate policies and has called on the bank to cut rates throughout 2019.</p><p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in May that the bank would likely be \"patient\" and keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged barring a major shift in the economy.</p><p>\u00af Sylvan Lane</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HILLNW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HILLNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJK-K791-JCB9-40T3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">153182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"933\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2019 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp.

The DEA, which is charged with keeping controlled substances from being diverted for abuse, had already been criticized by advocates for not using its powers to curb the opioid epidemic.</p><p>\"Every aspect of the pharmaceutical supply chain bears responsibility for the havoc and senseless death unleashed upon West Virginia \u00af and the DEA is no exception,\" said West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey (R), who sued the DEA over its quota system.</p><p>\"For years, the DEA was grossly negligent in its mismanagement of the national drug quota system. Unfortunately, this mismanagement contributed to the senseless death of many Americans.\"</p><p>Every year, the DEA sets a quota for how many opioid pills drugmakers are allowed to produce in the U.S.</p><p>The DEA permitted drugmakers to increase their production of oxycodone, a highly addictive painkiller, by 400 percent between 2002 and 2013, according to the report.</p><p>The DEA didn't substantially cut the quota until 2017, when opioid overdose deaths reached a peak in the U.S., according to the report. That year, the DEA cut the quota by 25 percent, and a record-high 48,000 people died from opioid overdoses.</p><p>\u00af Jessie Hellmann</p><p>Finance - Trump blames Federal Reserve for manufacturing slump amid trade war</p><p>President Trump on Tuesday blamed the Federal Reserve for a sharp decline in U.S. manufacturing activity that experts say is driven largely by his trade battles with China and Europe.</p><p>In a Tuesday tweet, Trump accused the Fed and its chairman, Jerome Powell, of harming U.S. exporters by keeping the value of the U.S. dollar too high.</p><p>The president repeated his call for the Fed to slash interest rates to the near-zero levels seen across Europe, where the economy is considerably weaker than in the U.S.</p><p>\"As I predicted, Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve have allowed the Dollar to get so strong, especially relative to ALL other currencies, that our manufacturers are being negatively affected,\" Trump tweeted. \"Fed Rate too high. They are their own worst enemies, they don't have a clue.

Despite the rich literature on scenarios and ways of constructing them, the current scenario methodologies, current approaches to scenario constructions are often not well aligned with the needs of policymakers. Emerging technologies that are likely to achieve high social relevance in the short to mid-term future and that call for quick policy interventions are difficult to reflect using current scenario approaches. We have therefore developed a new type of scenario that we call a policy scenario. This paper develops the principles and justification for policy scenarios. We provide a detailed description of how they can be constructed, focusing on their key characteristics of policy requirements, plausibility, probability, credibility, expertise, objectivity and legitimacy. Following our stakeholder-based approach allows researchers to construct scenarios that are uniquely suited to inform policymakers and, in effect, the policy development process.</p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FULL TEXT</emphasis></h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1. Introduction and purpose</emphasis></h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Policymakers are pressed for time. Yet, to keep informed of what might happen, they must engage in horizon-scanning which is a time-consuming activity. Scenarios make sense of the weak signals discovered in horizon-scanning. Policymakers need concise scenarios illuminating the ramifications of new and emerging technologies, but until now there has not been a scenario methodology that addresses the needs of policymakers in a structured way like an impact assessment. This article posits a new methodology for constructing scenarios specifically for policymakers. It is a structured methodology focused on highlighting the potential impacts of these technologies.1 By structured, we mean that the scenario has several section headings that simplify the policymaker's hunt for the salient points. In addition, the methodology itself is structured as a scenario construction process, not only with regard to which items are discussed and in what sequence in a stakeholder workshop, but also the whole sequence of activities leading to the creation and dissemination of stable scenarios. And by \"stable\", we mean when the scenario leaders reckon they have had sufficient stakeholder inputs so that the scenario is no longer changing.</p><p>Policymakers also need scenarios that derive from engaging stakeholders. Policy scenarios, of the type described in this paper, provide a useful methodology to engage an increasing number of stakeholders in exploring the issues expected to influence the development and take-up of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, and to arrive at a consensus about a socially acceptable future regarding the technology and desirable and undesirable pathways for achieving it. This meets a policymaker's needs too - scenarios that have involved a lot of people from a range of stakeholder groups. Unlike many other scenario methodologies, our approach is specifically designed to engage stakeholders from the beginning to the end of the scenario construction process. Indeed, the legitimacy of our scenarios stems from our inviting increasing numbers of stakeholders to comment on each iteration of the scenario.</p><p>Many scenarios and scenario methodologies do not follow a structured approach, as we put forward here. Section\u00a02 below refers to several methodologies, with some comments from the literature. The structure of the scenarios created using our methodology highlight ethical, legal, social and economic issues that are relevant for policymakers. For most other types of scenarios, policymakers need to deconstruct the scenario in order to determine what is relevant for policymaking. For the policy scenarios, as described here, it is not necessary to deconstruct them because they are already structured in such a way as to facilitate policy analysis, to highlight the factors that policymakers must take into account in developing new policies. The policy scenario methodology helps policymakers and other decision-makers in identifying what steps they need to take to pre-empt such issues and drive policymaking, for example, towards a desired future, and away from an undesired one. These features make the policy scenario methodology both innovative and well-suited to be an instrument of policymaking.</p><p>This article outlines how to construct policy scenarios and to generate comments from stakeholders, especially to help identify and discuss the ethical, human rights, data protection and social consequences arising from the application of emerging technologies.</p><p>Given that the purpose of policy scenarios is to inform policymaking, we recommend that policy scenarios be placed in a timeframe of five to seven years in the future. This will generally give policymakers enough time to act on the recommendations that emerge from the scenario, while providing a not-too-distant horizon for engaging non-experts. With an eye to that timeframe, we believe that it is both possible and necessary to create plausible scenarios. Plausibility is important for policymakers. If the scenarios were positioned much later - say a decade or two hence - policymakers would not feel the same urgency to respond to the recommendations. Plausibility as a criterion is also important for engaging non-experts. Plausibility emphasises the relevance of the scenario and invites people to think how such scenarios can relate to their own lives in the future.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. Scenarios and their use in policymaking</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0001\"/>The use of scenarios in future and policy-oriented research is well established. Scenarios are used for various purposes. A pioneer of modern scenario construction, Herman Kahn, used scenarios for strategic planning and war games while he was with the RAND Corp in the 1950s. In the following decade, as director of the Hudson Institute, a non-profit research institute, he used scenarios for issues related to US public policy, international development and defence. Shell became an early adopter of scenarios for predicting the volatility of oil prices and the future of the Soviet Union, a big competitor in the oil market. Shell has, since that time, led the commercial world in the use of scenarios - and in the development of more practical techniques to support these.2 Peter Schwarz, author of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Art of the Long View</emphasis> (1991), helped to popularise the use of scenarios in business planning (<link><marker>Schwartz,\u00a01991</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0001\"/></link>). The UN International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has used scenarios for many years to predict the impacts of climate change.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0002\"/>Since Kahn and Weiner published <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Year 2000: A Framework for Speculation on the Next 33 Years</emphasis> in 1967, in the earliest days of scenario construction, there have been many types of scenarios and methodologies promulgated. Mietzner and Reger summarise some of these approaches (<link><marker>Mietzner\u00a0and Reger,\u00a02005</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0002\"/></link>). The European Foresight Monitoring Network has compiled many types of scenarios.3 Charles Thomas has written about different types of scenarios (<link><marker>Thomas,\u00a02012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0003\"/></link>). Cairns and Wright's book on scenario thinking is an important contribution to the scenario construction domain (<link><marker>Cairns\u00a0and Wright,\u00a02018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0004\"/></link>).</p><p>Some of the principal types of scenarios are the following:<list><listItem><label>i  </label><bodyText><p>Best case, status quo, worst case - The scenario authors create three scenarios: one describes a best-case scenario, the second describes the status quo (i.e., a future is based on a continuation of present trends), the third describes a worst case. This was the approach that Herman Kahn followed,4 and is an approach frequently used in financial modelling.5 A strength of this approach is that each scenario can take into account different factors or the intensity of a range of factors. Such scenarios are not optimal for policymakers, as they offer three different outcomes depending on what steps stakeholders take or don't take to reach a desired future or avoid an undesired one.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>ii  </label><bodyText><p>Orthogonal futures - The approach is based on a matrix containing four quadrants. Each quadrant represents a permutation of the future based on two key driving factors represented by the X and Y axes. The X and Y axes can also represent likelihood (low to high) and impact (low to high). The independent Information Society Technologies Advisory Group (ISTAG), established by the European Commission, created orthogonal scenarios to explore a future embedded with ambient intelligence (<link><marker>Ducatel\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2001</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0006\"/></link>). The two axes in the ISTAG scenarios are efficiency vs. sociability and individual vs. communal. They contrast technology applications that serve to optimise efficiency, whether in business or in society, against those that emphasise human relationships, sociability or just having fun. They also underline the place of ambient intelligence (AmI) in serving society and the community as well as individuals. A weakness of the orthogonal approach is that it is driven by two axes, two factors. Hence, orthogonal futures may lead to somewhat formulaic, over-simplistic views of the world, skimming through more nuanced factors and complex interactions inherent in stakeholder insights.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>iii  </label><bodyText><p>Dark scenarios - This approach focuses on a future where things go wrong. An example of a dark scenario is that created by the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) about a cyberattack targeting digital networks and resulting in power cuts, drones and ransomware. More than 700 security experts participated in the October 2016 scenario exercise (<link><marker>Cyber\u00a0Security Review 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0007\"/></link>). Dark scenarios serve as warnings. At best, they steer us away from negative futures, but give little guidance on what steps to take to reach a desired future. However, with a policy scenario, we recognise that an emerging technology will have some good points and bad points, some pluses and minuses.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>iv  </label><bodyText><p>Ethical dilemma scenarios - This approach focuses on a future where there is no obvious correct course of action. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Psychology</emphasis> Today carried an article with 10 ethical dilemma scenarios (<link><marker>Nemko,\u00a02017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0008\"/></link>). Ethical dilemma scenarios set out a dilemma and provide a basis for discussion by stakeholders to, desirably, reach consensus on a course of action (<link><marker>Wright\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0009\"/></link>). Ethical dilemmas can arise in many fields but the value of these scenarios is most pronounced in areas where there is a strong public interest and obvious ethical concerns, such as questions of justice in public health (<link><marker>Lehoux\u00a0and F.A.Miller,\u00a02020</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0010\"/></link>). By contrast, a policy scenario already represents a consensus of stakeholders.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>v  </label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Narrative scenarios</emphasis> - tell a story. These stories are often in the form of scripts that include roles and can be very elaborate, as the film <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Minority Report</emphasis> is.6 Narrative scenarios can be confining in the sense that they focus on telling a story and may not allow the authors (the stakeholders) to explore all ethical, legal, social and economic aspects raised by the new technologies. Moreover, for the sake of narrative consistency, this type of scenario may gloss over existing contradictions. This type of scenario is characterised by the structure of the intervention, i.e., the narrative that provides the basis of the possible future to be explored. This type of scenario can therefore cover the topic areas of other types of scenario. For example, a narrative scenario approach can address ethical issues in healthcare (<link><marker>Jaarsma\u00a0and Gelhaus,\u00a02019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0011\"/></link>).</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>vi  </label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trend scenarios</emphasis> (sometimes called reference, extrapolative or predictive scenarios) start from the present and project forward on the basis of to-be-expected trends and events [forecasting]. They are intended to be realistic rather than, for instance, normative or extreme. A trend scenario consulting company describes its offering thusly: \"We examine the future from a variety of angles based on the trends. The combination of the customer's given perspective and the consideration of changing market structures leads to a concise Picture of the Future with relevant derivations for specific areas of innovation and action.\"7 Trend scenarios can cover a broad range of topic areas and employ various data types and analysis methods to describe trends that can influence decision making across different sectors (<link><marker>Jaarsma\u00a0and Gelhaus,\u00a02019</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0011\"/></link>). A shortcoming of trend scenarios is that they do not take into account black swan events or other unexpected disruptions of existing trends.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>vii  </label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Normative scenario</emphasis>s are developed to define a desirable future and evaluate how it can be reached. They are designed on the basis of a set of desired values or 'norms' that the future world should possess. The exercise then consists of tracing backwards (backcasting) a viable path from such an outcome to today-pointing the way to reaching that desired future (<link><marker>Ogilvy,\u00a01992</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0013\"/></link>) (<link><marker>Ogilvy,\u00a02002</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0014\"/></link>). According to one group of scenario experts, \"Normative scenarios are less frequently used today than was the case in the 1960s and 1970s. In some ways a normative scenario can be thought of as a cross between a scenario environment and a vision statement. Normative scenarios describe what an organization wants to be or the environment that emerges. Normative scenarios are less of an objective planning document than a goals statement\" (<link><marker>Ogilvy,\u00a01992</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0013\"/></link>). Normative scenarios may surface more radical discontinuities and reflect combinations of technological possibilities and political ambitions or target (<link><marker>Thomas,\u00a02012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0003\"/></link>).</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>viii  </label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Exploratory scenarios</emphasis> are explorations of what might happen in the future and applied as a process of sense making of complex and uncertain systemic problems (<link><marker>Brey,\u00a02017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0016\"/></link>). They are based on identifying critical uncertainty factors and on different expectations of technical and/or policy developments over the near- to medium-term. They can be trend-driven respecting a mainstream worldviews or contrasted, i.e., breaking away from traditional views (<link><marker>Riddell\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0017\"/></link>). Policymakers have criticised exploratory scenarios for not being relevant to policy processes and assessments.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>This non-comprehensive list of key types of scenarios shows the breadth and richness of the scenario discourse. Despite this richness, we find weaknesses in these scenario types in their utility to policymakers. The weaknesses of current scenario approaches include a lack of wide stakeholder support, insufficient guidance for particular policy actions, lack of sensitivity to outliers and potential relevance to policy decisions. Hence, we conclude that there is a need for further development of scenario methods for policymakers.</p><p>Although scenarios have been used for making policy decisions right from the start, from the early days of Herman Kahn and Shell, most are not structured or specifically tailored for policymakers. Similarly, the use of scenarios as a participatory exercise is also well established. Others have pointed to still further uses: e.g., the use of scenarios as techniques that can bring together different types of knowledge and act as platforms for knowledge brokerage. Despite the history of scenarios, there is no established structure or template for scenarios that are specifically geared towards the preparation of policy decisions in well-defined areas. This is a challenge that policymakers face in setting policy around emerging technologies that are likely to have a significant social impact in the near to mid-term future (three to seven years) but that are not yet sufficiently regulated. This timeframe is sufficiently near to the present to call for action while still allowing policymakers time to react.</p><p>Policy scenarios, as described in this paper, serve policymakers as policy input and stakeholders as a participatory exercise.8 Our scenario development supports policymakers in several ways:<list><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>To engage stakeholders in participatory, deliberative policy-making</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>To uncover issues that might otherwise be overlooked</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>To explore possible consequences of current trends</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>To consider desired and undesired futures</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>To help decision-makers in the decision-making process</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>To determine what steps should be taken to reach the desired future and avoid an undesired future.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>We believe that our approach can greatly benefit policymakers in several ways. It draws their attention to the key issues that may arise with the development of a new technology (but see footnote one), the impacts they may have and recommendations. It draws their attention to these issues and impacts far enough in advance (say seven years) when there is still time to develop an appropriate policy response to steer the development of a new technology. Legitimacy and plausibility of scenarios are two central features that emerge from our methodology that are of key importance for the adoption of scenarios by policymakers.</p><p>Our policy scenario approach goes beyond established scenario development methodologies in that we offer a structured approach, from brainstorming on how technology and applications might evolve over the medium-term to formulating recommendations to policy-makers. The structure of the scenarios created using this methodology highlights ethical, legal, social and economic issues that are relevant for policymakers. Ethical issues of concern to policymakers might include a determination about whether stakeholders are adequately informed about the consequences of using a new technology. Legal issues will concern whether a new technology is compliant with relevant legislation (for example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation). Social issues might concern whether society benefits from a new technology or programme or whether big tech companies (for example) are acquiring more power at the expense of society. Economic issues often concern inequality. The specific ethical, legal, social and economic issues will vary, of course, depending on the scenario.</p><p>Using this approach, policymakers can create various scenarios that enable comparative analyses. In addition, increasing the number of stakeholders invited to comment on the scenario is a key element in our approach. Furthermore, we do not focus on developing a set of scenarios, rather we aim to achieve the greatest possible consensus on a single policy scenario.</p><p>Policy scenarios as described here can complement other policymaking instruments such as Delphi studies. Recommendations emerging from scenarios constructed by engaging a wide range of stakeholders, including the public, can be compared with those emerging from a small group of selected experts.</p><p>The requirements of policymakers arise from the need to adequately and flexibly develop policies of scientific and technical developments that are about to gain significant social impact. A topical example of this type of policy need is in the area of big data analytics and machine learning, often referred to as artificial intelligence. This scientific-technological development is recognised as highly impactful; it raises significant public concerns and calls for policymakers to develop policies rapidly. In such cases, the input that policymakers require has to be relatively clear and straightforward. It is no longer blue-sky exploration, but at the same time, there is no certainty about the impact of the technology, hence the need for a future-oriented approach such as a scenario.</p><p>We can summarise the policymakers' requirements for the type of input that we address with the policy scenario, as follows:<list><listItem><label>a  </label><bodyText><p>Policy need: The scenario should illuminate ethical, legal, social and economic issues, including risks to privacy and data protection (<link><marker>Ogilvy,\u00a02002</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0014\"/></link>). Uncovering, exploring and addressing these issues is at the heart of our methodology. They are what give the scenario policy relevance.\u00a0There is a clear and broadly recognised need for policy development in the area covered by the scenario, while there remains sufficient uncertainty to require future-oriented approaches such as scenarios.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>b  </label><bodyText><p>Plausibility: A scenario that can inform policymaking needs to be plausible, not only for the individual policymaker, but for the majority of stakeholders who are likely to be affected by the eventual policy outcome.9</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>c  </label><bodyText><p>Probability and credibility: As in all future-oriented work, there cannot be certainty about the truth of the scenario.10 However, the process for creating the scenario needs to be credible.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>d  </label><bodyText><p>Expertise: In order to be plausible, the scenario needs to combine the various areas of expertise that influence it. Scientific-technical developments in need of policy scenarios tend to draw on a broad range of scientific, technical but also legal and social areas, all of which need to be represented in the scenario.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>e  </label><bodyText><p>Objectivity: The scenario needs to represent different and competing interests equally and find a balanced way of exploring potential resolutions by establishing what constitutes common ground, and delineate where distances of opinions exist and what fuels them. As technologies emerge, diverse interests will often be pushing their development in particular directions, in response to what the respective impacts are expected to be for different stakeholder groups. In most instances, the dynamics of technology emergence, development and dissemination are powerfully shaped by commercial interests and resources. The challenges facing policymakers relate not just to the technologies themselves, but also to the conflicting interests being asserted, including the potential interests of groups traditionally lacking in access and voice in the political arena. Hence, by \"objectivity\", we mean that scenario construction should seek to surface a full range of such perspectives and find a balanced way of exploring potential resolutions.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>f  </label><bodyText><p>Legitimacy: The earlier bullet points combine to provide the scenario legitimacy, i.e., the ability to be accepted in principle as a realistic representation of a likely future by all relevant stakeholders. Legitimacy, along with salience and credibility, are important features of scenarios, especially environmental scenarios [(<link><marker>Volkery\u00a0and Ribeiro,\u00a02009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0020\"/></link>), p. 1201].</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>g  </label><bodyText><p>Stakeholder engagement and consensus: If possible, an agreement of the stakeholders on a policy scenario is desirable, as it indicates to the policymaker that there is broad agreement on the likely future that can motivate appropriate policy decisions (<link><marker>Kahn\u00a0and Wiener,\u00a01967</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0005\"/></link>).</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>h  </label><bodyText><p>Process and trust: Volkery and Ribeiro cite an important requirement for a policy scenario. \"Process is an important factor, because it has implications for the extent to which people trust scenarios and thus use them.

Additionally, trust is gained from methodological credibility, i.e., confidence in the method used to generate the scenarios\" [(<link><marker>Volkery\u00a0and Ribeiro,\u00a02009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0020\"/></link>), p. 1202].</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>It is unlikely that all of these requirements can be fulfilled in any one case. There may well be limitations and trade-offs among these criteria. We are also aware that to some degree these requirements go in a direction opposite from traditional scenario methodologies. Typically, scenario work aims to open up different and possible futures, to widen thinking and considerations. Policy scenarios that are constructed in circumstances that call for policy action have to incorporate this openness, but they also have to limit it and provide a focus, to help ensure that policymakers act accordingly.</p><p>The policy scenario methodology described here was developed to meet these requirements. This approach describes a future and results in recommendations that policymakers and/or other stakeholders can implement and the steps that policymakers should take to reach a desired future and avoid an undesired future. It seeks consensus among stakeholders about how to manage the issues raised in the scenario. Policy scenarios are designed to explore the key factors (drivers) affecting ethical, legal, social and economic aspects of everyday life in the future. They provide a shared view on the issues arising from the emergence of particular technologies and on recommendations to address those issues. The technologies are grounded in plausibility so that we can tease out the ethical and social issues that we think will confront policymakers and other stakeholders in the near future.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Policy scenarios</emphasis></h><p>Having now stated the need for a novel type of scenario for the specific needs of policymakers facing short- to medium-term policy challenges regarding emerging technologies, we now provide in this section detail on the process of constructing a policy scenario.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.1. Stakeholder consultation to meet the requirements</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0021\"/>One activity key to policy scenario development is stakeholder consultation. Consultation is \"necessary to engage more widely with the public as well as with stakeholders, to increase the accountability of the process by providing better opportunities for the public to participate early and effectively in major policy decisions (in line with the Aarhus Convention)\" [(<link><marker>Wright\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2008</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0021\"/></link>), p. 62]. Engaging stakeholders is a fundamental requirement in the construction of policy scenarios of the type outlined in this article. It is important to engage stakeholders in the scenario construction process from the outset to drill as deeply into the future as time permits.</p><p>There are several reasons why this should be so:<list><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>One can get stakeholder buy-in by involving stakeholders right from the beginning of the process of constructing the scenarios.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Stakeholder involvement is important for the plausibility and credibility of the scenarios. If stakeholders are involved in the scenario construction process from the outset, the prospect of credible scenarios is much higher than if they were not involved.

Consultation supports the expertise represented in the scenario, thus contributing to the relevance of issues included as well as the plausibility and probability of the scenario playing out in reality. A stakeholder-generated scenario promises objectivity in the sense of allowing competing views and viewpoints to be voiced, establish what constitutes common ground, and delineate where distances of opinions exist and what fuels them (e.g., competing stakeholder interests or values, different assessments around technology risks, their likelihood and/or impact, etc.). Hence, stakeholder engagement lends scenarios a higher level of legitimacy. If a consensual view of the issue in question is possible, then stakeholder engagement will indicate the degree to which consensus can be achieved and areas where it may be impossible.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref0022\"/>One key question that needs to be considered is the way in which stakeholders are selected and which criteria for stakeholder selection are used. The term 'stakeholder' was coined to move beyond the focus on stockholders as the primary group of interest when looking at an organisation (<link><marker>Freeman\u00a0and Reed,\u00a01983</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0022\"/></link>). It has engendered significant discussion, predominantly in management studies and business ethics (<link><marker>Goodpaster,\u00a01991</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0023\"/></link>) but resonates widely across fields and disciplines. A definition of the term that is relevant to this paper is that stakeholders \"are identified through the actual or potential harms and benefits that they experience or anticipate experiencing as a result of [the firm's] actions or inactions\" (<link><marker>Donaldson\u00a0and Preston,\u00a01995</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0024\"/></link>). This understanding of the term is relevant to policy scenarios because policymakers in democratic societies are responsible for representing the interest of all citizens who are positively or negatively affected by a particular policy. The inclusion of all relevant stakeholders is therefore a necessary condition for policy advice to be taken seriously by policymakers.</p><p>While the inclusion of stakeholders is conceptually unproblematic in policy scenarios, it raises significant practical problems. The broad definition of the term means that there is a potential infinity of stakeholders for a sweeping policy intervention. In our examples of smart information systems, there is a large number of possible applications and for each application there may be various stakeholder groups. For each application in education, warfare, transport and law enforcement, there will be individual groups including teachers, students, soldiers, drivers, police officers, offenders and many others. In most cases, the companies producing the technologies and their investors could count as stakeholders as well. The appropriate selection of the stakeholders is therefore an important condition for legitimate outcomes of policy scenarios. There is no perfect way of ensuring the inclusion of the right stakeholders or their representatives, but the inclusion criteria need to form part of the active reflection of the methodology development.</p><p>Having now clarified the need for the policy scenario methodology, shown the requirements that such a scenario has to fulfil and argued for the importance of stakeholder consultation, we now turn to how a policy scenario can be constructed, thus providing the details of the methodology.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.2. Kicking off with a scenario workshop</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0025\"/>The first step in constructing a policy scenario is to identify stakeholders to participate in an initial brainstorming workshop.11 Cairns &amp; Wright advocate a workshop with external participants because they see a \"potentially more serious problem with adopting an internal expertise approach [which] is that of myopic or bounded thinking-that those within the problem domain will be constrained by the limitations of their contextual expertise\" [(<link><marker>Cairns\u00a0and Wright,\u00a02018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0004\"/></link>), p. 15]. They advocate a workshop early in the scenario construction process.12 In one example of a scenario construction process, they say that the objective of the workshop was to introduce the scenario team members and the workshop facilitators to each other; and to provide an overview of the proposed scenario process, the intended objectives, scenario agenda and the horizon year [(<link><marker>Cairns\u00a0and Wright,\u00a02018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0004\"/></link>), p. 216]. Garnett et\u00a0al. also advocate starting the scenario construction process with a workshop: \"A high degree of stakeholder involvement is critical to arriving at a shared view of potential drivers of change within the policy environment. Early stakeholder workshops with key policy actors ... provide some metrics to evaluate the vast quantity of information produced during horizon scanning, thus focusing scan activities\" [(<link><marker>Garnett\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0025\"/></link>), p. 86].</p><p>Stakeholder participants for the kick-off workshop should be selected carefully. It is useful to invite one or two policymakers who can act as a kind of reality check on what is possible or might be possible in development of specific policies. Similarly, if the scenario workshop is focused on the implications of an emerging technology, it is useful to have one or two technical experts who can provide workshop participants with considered opinion on where a technology is going or might go in the next six or seven years. As the policy scenario is designed to consider different impacts - ethical, legal, social, economic - it is useful to have a mix of stakeholders who can brainstorm on those impacts. We avoided having a workshop just for policymakers, partly because we wanted to avoid the so-called echo chamber effect and partly because we wanted to bring a variety of perspectives to the workshop.</p><p>There are many reasons for having a workshop early in the scenario construction process. With a workshop, the organiser can bring together a diverse set of stakeholders who are likely to provide insights valuable to construction of the scenario that may not all occur to the scenario writer on his or her own. For a scenario to be regarded as a legitimate consultative exercise, stakeholders should be engaged from the start of the process - preferably from start to the finish of the process. We <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">want</emphasis> their ideas and views and we want to foster a participatory, deliberative process.</p><p>The workshop provides key information and ideas on which the scenario is drafted and opened up to consultation. Hence, it is desirable to have workshop participants from diverse backgrounds and disciplines, who will help ensure that different viewpoints are taken into account in constructing the scenario. We view 10-15 as an optimum number of participants. With such a number, all participants can actively engage in brainstorming on the development of the scenario, which becomes more problematic with a larger number of workshop participants. Such a number is favourable for generating a diversity of stakeholders - and reviews - which becomes less favourable with a smaller number of participants.</p><p>In advance of the workshop, participants should be encouraged to do their own literature search around the topic and suggest any background reading.13 They could also be sent some literature about the technologies on which the scenarios focus. Giving workshop participants some preparatory work in advance of the workshop is helpful to make sure that participants are starting from a similar vantage point and have a shared vocabulary with which to communicate their positions. To avoid the risk that one publication might inject a bias in the scenario development, the workshop leader should provide two or three or more publications from different, credible sources. Workshop participants should be made aware of the status of those texts. For instance, they could be asked questions such as: do workshop organisers lend support to the claims made in those documents? Do they endorse their forecasts? Should workshop participants be encouraged to read those with a critical eye? If the workshop leader agrees with an article, he or she can say so, but should also be open to discussion of alternative points of view.</p><p>As most or all of the participants may not know one another, brief introductions should be made at the outset. It is helpful for participants to understand what type of scenario is to be constructed and why. As our policy scenario is innovative in structure (while building on the results of others) and in engagement with increasing numbers of stakeholders, the scenario leader needs to explain the type of scenario and why we have chosen a policy scenario to explore the implications of technologies under investigation.</p><p>Workshop participants will benefit from being explicitly informed about what is meant by a plausible scenario and how they are supposed to envisage such a future. Participants should feel able to make sure their intentions and assumptions are reflected in the draft scenario (the first iteration, see below). At the outset of the scenario workshop, the workshop leader should provide an introduction to the purpose of brainstorming and what participants should aim to achieve during the day. It is important to emphasise that Chatham House rules will apply, i.e., views expressed during the workshop will not be attributed to particular participants.</p><p>Following introductions and a presentation of the workshop's objectives and its agenda, the workshop leader might wish to invite a technology expert to give an overview of the state of the development of the technology and to speculate where the technology might be in several years from now.</p><p>The agenda for the initial workshop should cover the following key questions to ask scenario workshop participants:<list><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Expected technological progress:</emphasis> Where will the technology be by the time horizon specified (e.g., 2025)? How advanced will it be? In what applications will it be used? Workshop participants should be encouraged to stretch their imaginations, about how technology will develop and be used in six or seven years. Participants should be reminded that technology development is accelerating all the time. They should consider how fast technology has developed in recent years14 and how fast it might develop in the next six years. It is important to allow sufficient time for this first brainstorming session, as it will provide the context for the drafting of the initial scenario that follows. The workshop leader must steer the discussion towards the advance of technology and its applications rather than let it drift toward topics that will be discussed later, e.g., ethical issues. Through the brainstorming on the technology and its application, the workshop participants can reach a consensus on the application(s) that will feature in the vignette, which aims to illustrate how the technology might be used.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>Through the discussion of where the technologies and their applications might be in 2025, the workshop participants should discuss a vignette that illustrates the possible use of such technologies several years hence. If participants consent, it will be useful to record the brainstorming discussion as a reference for constructing the scenario. As a minimum, the workshop leader should have someone who can take detailed notes of the discussion.</p><p>The next key questions in the scenario construction process should be:<list><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Drivers:</emphasis> the second step in the scenario construction process is to consider the drivers that impel the development of these technologies and applications. Drivers can be social, economic (or financial), political, regulatory, technological, etc. Workshop participants should discuss the relevance of each of these different drivers.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Barriers and inhibitors</emphasis>: Next, workshop participants should consider the potential barriers and inhibitors for the production and uptake of these technologies in the time horizon specified. While some barriers are foreseeable, others appear unexpectedly, \"out of the blue\". So workshop participants should consider whether there are \"black swan\" events, i.e., externalities that may impact the development of the technology. A black swan event might be Silicon Valley and the rest of California cascading into the Pacific Ocean as a result of a major earthquake along the San Andreas fault.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>There are two different approaches for identifying drivers. The first is the traditional approach, as advocated by Cairns &amp; Wright. Each of the workshop participants identifies five drivers on sticky notes that can be affixed to a wall. The drivers can be just a single sentence, but should be self-explanatory and clear as to what it means. We suggest five drivers as a manageable number for participants. A larger number, such as 10, would leave participants grasping for less important or inconsequential drivers simply to fill their quota. The first to finish writing his or her drivers can place them horizontally on a wall. As the other participants finish writing their drivers, they can see what has already been fixed and add their notes in column formation to any that are similar or, if not, create a new column. The various sticky notes can then be grouped or clustered under some key words that describe those under each column. We are especially interested in those regarded as the most important cluster(s) of drivers in terms of their impact and those that reveal the greatest certainty.</p><p>If the brainstorming workshop has a large number of participants, e.g., 20 or more, a second approach could be to form groups of say five participants and to have two groups to exchange views and identify drivers and two other groups to identify barriers or inhibitors to development and application of the technologies under discussion. Each of the groups then reports to the plenary where there is further discussion of the drivers and barriers until participants reach a consensus on the principal drivers and barriers. The policy scenario should reflect consensus on the drivers that will impel development of the technology and its applications as well as the barriers that might inhibit such development.</p><p>The final steps to scenario construction in the initial workshop are:<list><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Impacts:</emphasis> The participants should consider the ethical, legal, social and economic impacts of these technologies and their applications in 2025 or whenever.

Any exercise focused on a \"most likely\" future is inevitably a predictive exercise and draws participants away from the scenario mindset and analysis. The best scenarios reflect many variables and possible turns of events that shape the dynamics of a system under study. It is quite unlikely that any single scenario is the true future as it evolves. Fortunately, the scenario-building process does not focus on uncovering the \"most likely\" forecast but, rather, on identifying the range of feasible outcomes [(<link><marker>Cairns\u00a0and Wright,\u00a02018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0004\"/></link>), p. 12].</p><p>With policy scenarios, we do not aim to predict a specific or most likely future. That is impossible. However, we can envisage a plausible future (the vignette) and the many factors - the drivers, barriers, impacts - that policymakers should take into account to enable or avoid a future like that envisaged in the vignette. We do not want to create a scenario with too many variables and possible turns of event. Policymakers prefer a clear, single course of action that has stakeholder support. In addition to the structured approach to its development, our scenario construction method shows the range of factors that policymakers should also take into account in the formulation of policy and recommendations.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.4. Reaching out to more stakeholders with new iterations</emphasis></h><p>Constructing scenarios is an iterative process. We want to engage an increasing number of stakeholders with each iteration of the scenario. Stakeholder engagement can help to identify potential conflicts of interest that may create ethical and/or legal dilemmas. Stakeholder engagement is a vital part of scenario construction. The scenario must have buy-in to be credible. For policy scenarios, we believe it is important to maximise stakeholder participation.</p><p>Therefore, with each iteration of a policy scenario, we disseminate it to a wider group of stakeholders, from experts to the public. We recognise that, in doing so, we are likely to encounter more diverse opinions and views - and that is okay, as those diverse views can help identify any weaknesses in the scenario and potential solutions too. We want to gather comments from stakeholders until the scenario is stable, i.e., we have resolved most if not all stakeholder comments and issues, and the remaining stakeholders have no or a few minor comments. It would not be appropriate to disseminate the first draft of a scenario to a large number of stakeholders; sending a first draft that has no significant support from any stakeholders is an unfair imposition on a larger group of stakeholders. A scenario sent out to a large number of stakeholders for comment should already represent a consensus among a smaller number of stakeholders.</p><p>We suggest four iterations with stakeholders.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.4.1. First iteration</emphasis></h><p>The first iteration of the scenario emerges from the first stakeholder workshop, where we delineate the issues to be explored in the scenario. Taking into account the discussion during the workshop, the scenario leader drafts an initial scenario. The leader sends the first draft of the scenario to workshop participants to gather their comments and then prepares a second iteration. The draft scenario should desirably be fewer than 10 pages in length, so as to encourage policymakers and other stakeholders to review and comment on it, as the longer the scenario is, the fewer who will do so.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.4.2. Second iteration</emphasis></h><p>The scenario leader sends the second iteration of the scenario to a larger group of stakeholders, perhaps 30 or so, to seek their comments. In addition to the second iteration, the scenario leader may wish to include some questions, mainly qualitative, to stimulate responses from stakeholders. The scenario leader can prepare a two-column table, with the scenario in the first column and the questions in the second column. The questions should relate to each principal section of the scenario. The scenario leader gathers comments from the stakeholders, which are used to prepare a third iteration of the scenario.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.4.3. Third iteration</emphasis></h><p>The scenario leader sends the revised scenario, together with the questions, to a much larger contact list. The leader can use various methods, including e-mailing the scenario to stakeholders on a contact list or refer them to a webpage where they can respond to questions.</p><p>A word of caution: the scenario leader must be careful to avoid turning the scenario into a mish-mash of comments and amended text. The policy scenario must be coherent, must make sense, must be easily readable. This will partly depend on the scenario writer exercising his or her judgement, experience and expertise. It will also partly depend on the comments received. If the scenario does become a mish-mash as a result of comments received in the second iteration, stakeholders in the third iteration are more likely to criticise its incoherence.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.4.4. Fourth iteration</emphasis></h><p>Following receipt of comments from stakeholders on the contact list, the scenario leader revises the scenario again (the fourth iteration), posts it on the project website and invites comments from visitors (the wider public) to the website. The scenario leader should fix a cut-off date for comments. The scenario leader then revises the scenario one last time, at which point the scenario can be regarded as stable, containing a set of policy, regulatory, technical, organisational and/or other recommendations to address the challenges raised by the technologies.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.4.5. Discussion</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref0026\"/>Policymakers will be interested in recommendations that emerge from scenarios that are both credible and useful. And to be credible and useful, scenarios have to respect five conditions: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">pertinence, coherence, likelihood, importance</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">transparency</emphasis> [(<link><marker>Durance\u00a0and Godet,\u00a02010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0026\"/></link>), p. 1488]. The authors of the present article collaborated on developing five scenarios. We applied these five conditions to our scenario as follows:<list><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>The subject matter. The scenarios we developed covered topic areas that correspond to the demands of policy scenarios of being relevant, visibly in need of policy development and of high general interest: predictive policing, deepfake technologies, self-driving cars, autonomous weaponry, AI in education.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>The scenario is coherent. It follows a logical sequence from the introduction of the technology to the recommendations to policymakers.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>The scenario's likelihood can be debated, but as Durance and Godet point out, a scenario is not a future reality.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>The scenario is important, as it raises numerous ethical, legal, social and economic matters, including risks to privacy and data protection.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>The scenario fosters transparency. The scenario emerges from a workshop of stakeholders. And as increasing numbers of stakeholders are invited to comment on the scenario, such an open invitation is an indicator of transparency.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>In addition to meeting the above conditions, the policy scenario builds on existing scenario methodologies. It includes a narrative (the vignette), drivers, impacts, importance and uncertainty factors, barriers and inhibitors, but it goes beyond such existing structures, to consider the ethical, legal, social and economic impacts, how the negative impacts can be mitigated and the positive impacts accentuated, and finally makes recommendations to policymakers. The various factors in each of the principal sections of the scenario serve as guidelines for others writing policy scenarios.</p><p>The structure of policy scenarios, as postulated here, resonates well with another point made by Durance and Godet. They note that \"Morphological analysis... has become amongst the most popular tools. ... it lends itself perfectly to the construction of scenarios. Using morphological analysis, a ... system can be decomposed into dimensions ... demographic, economic, technological, and social/organizational\" [(<link><marker>Durance\u00a0and Godet,\u00a02010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0026\"/></link>), p. 1490]. Our policy scenario approach is, in effect, a morphological analysis of the factors several years hence that affect the development and deployment of new technologies that meet a social need. The structure and process that we use to create a technology policy scenario facilitate the identification of such issues and ways in which to address the risks. Our process is open and transparent. It seeks out comments from an increasing number of stakeholders. Our scenario construction process meets the final test set out in Durance and Godet's article, i.e., \"the complexity of the problems and the need to address them collectively require methods that are as rigorous and participatory as possible so that the individuals involved may identify the appropriate problems and agree upon solutions\" [(<link><marker>Durance\u00a0and Godet,\u00a02010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference0026\"/></link>), p. 1491]. Our scenario construction process is inclusive and participatory. It seeks out engagement with stakeholders from the initial brainstorming workshop with stakeholders to posting the scenario on a project website and inviting comments from the wider public.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.5. Getting the scenario in front of policymakers</emphasis></h><p>When the scenario is stable, the scenario developer will want to get as many policymakers as possible to review it and consider and adopt the recommendations.

Conclusions, recommendations and next steps</emphasis></h><p>Policymakers will be interested in recommendations emerging from a stakeholder group where there is a consensus on recommendations. Consensus-based decision-making leads to better decisions and improved group relationships. Of even greater interest will be a comparative analysis of the outcomes and recommendations of different technology policy scenarios so that they can make a comparison of the recommendations emerging from each, to see how coherent or divergent the recommendations might be. Of particular interest, of course, will be those instances where there is a congruence of recommendations or where the recommendations are similar.</p><p>Of even greater interest will be how recommendations cohere across other foresight tools such as a Delphi and case studies. Policymakers will more likely be interested in recommendations where there is congruence from the different approaches (case studies, scenarios, Delphi studies).</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4.1. Limitations</emphasis></h><p>With policy scenarios, we seek to achieve the greatest possible consensus. Plausibility and probability are both important to achieving consensus. If stakeholders view the scenarios as plausible or probable, they are more likely to lend their weight to the recommendations that emerge from the construction of the scenarios. Nevertheless, one should not discard outlier opinions. Rather, they can be noted in the scenario, especially where contrary views offer some useful insights and depend on contextual factors that present critical uncertainties.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4.2. Contribution</emphasis></h><p>In this article, we have argued that established scenario methods have limitations in cases where short to medium term scientific and technological developments call for actions by policymakers. We suggest that a different type of scenario that we call a policy scenario has the potential to overcome these limitations. Based on the descriptions of the requirements that such a policy scenario would have to fulfil, we have described the methodology of developing it.</p><p>The article contributes to the overall field of future and foresight research, in particular, the stream of discussion of scenarios by offering a novel approach that acknowledges prior scenario methodologies but provides detailed guidance on how to move beyond them and create policy scenarios. This novel methodology will be of interest to audiences involved in policy advice and support. The paper makes a unique contribution to knowledge by providing detailed guidance on how to develop policy scenarios. This contribution is in the first instance to the methodology of future and foresight studies. Methodological advances are key to the progress of the field overall and therefore constitute an important aspect of academic development. While the scenario approach is well developed and the individual components of undertaking scenario-based research is well established, our work provides a demonstration based on empirical experience and evidence that this policy scenario approach is workable, comes to novel insights and can be employed successfully.</p><p>None.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></h><p>This article is based on research undertaken in the SHERPA project which has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 786641.

But the big question remains - will they work? The announcement moves the goalposts to correct a power imbalance that threatens media companies, market-economy principles, journalism and a viable democracy.</p><p>The crucial question remains unknown. What exactly will be the mechanism and what might be the quantum of remuneration the Big Tech companies must offer in order to keep using the content of media companies that they now get for free?</p><p>An alliance has been sealed - the Morrison government, established media and the ACCC - working to legislate as quickly as possible to check one of the greatest scams in history. Each reached the same conclusion: Big Tech was refusing to negotiate in good faith, the upshot being the proposed voluntary code is now replaced with a mandatory code to be legislated.</p><p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg presents this as an act of fairness and economic justice. That's correct, but his targets are some of the most powerful and arrogant companies ever built. The COVID-19 eruption has injected urgency into the crisis, with regional newspapers closing and mainstream papers under pressure courtesy of the collapse in advertising revenue simultaneous with an increase in reader subscriptions.</p><p>Frydenberg and Communications Minister Paul Fletcher said the government's purpose was to enhance consumer protection and \"support a sustainable Australian media landscape in the digital age\".</p><p>While regulatory plans differ among countries, there is now a global movement seeking Big Tech accountability, an essential condition for success. The critical factors at home were the advice from News Corporation that it had \"no confidence\" in progress towards a voluntary code and advice from ACCC chairman Rod Sims that the parties were unlikely to agree, with the sticking point being payment for content.</p><p>News Corp Australia executive chairman Michael Miller said Google and Facebook had built trillion-dollar businesses refusing to pay for other people's content and the media industry was now \"at a tipping point\".</p><p>He said the mandatory code must be enacted urgently and the price required for digital companies to pay for their content must be \"fair\" and \"significant\". \"Real journalism must not be destroyed by companies that take it for their own use,\" Miller said.</p><p>The government has now instructed the ACCC to develop the mandatory code that will cover sharing of data, display of news content and sharing of revenues generated from news. It will have enforcement and penalty provisions. The size of this revenue share will be pivotal for news publishers. Unless this is meaningful, the project falters. The mechanism to sort this is not yet developed. It requires a framework for calculating value and a process for arbitration in the case of stalemate.</p><p>The theme running through the government's statement cannot be missed - use of state regulatory and legislative power to hold Google and Facebook accountable. With the global virus only likely to strengthen their relative power, such action against the digital companies becomes imperative. The draft mandatory code is to be ready for release before the end of July, which means legislation soon after.</p><p>Frydenberg is under no illusions as to the struggle he faces. He has referred to the way Big Tech has thwarted efforts in Spain and France to hold them accountable.</p><p>\"There is a need to take this issue head-on,\" he said. \"To date the global experience underscores the challenge we face.\" He called the 2019 ACCC report \"groundbreaking\" and \"world-leading\" in its 23 recommendations to restore market-economy norms in the media landscape.</p><p>That means correcting for the bargaining power imbalance between Big Tech and news publishers. The speed of government decision-making was conspicuous. It received the ACCC advice on April 14 and ratified the new policy within a couple of days.</p><p>This represents a turning point. But success depends upon several critical factors - parliamentary bipartisanship, the support of public opinion, astute design of the mandatory code and a commitment to speed in the process.Sims told this paper last year: \"The business models of Google and Facebook rely on customers not actually understanding what data is being collected from them or how that data is being used. This problem needs to be comprehended and then it needs to be fixed.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-794270cc821b11eabe53753ad749af51f0a06423f073e8809d721e62f0bf78d9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YPJ-X7H1-F0JP-W0K2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"782\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 20, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

While some firms choose to run lots of political and issue ads with little oversight, others opt to ban them altogether. Why it matters: Absent strict government regulation of political ads across all media, the decision over how to manage those ads is left to companies. </p><p>And while most firms have faced this dilemma for years, the hyper-political environment leading up to 2020 is shining a stronger spotlight to their decisions.Driving the news: TikTok, the Chinese-owned viral karaoke app, said[1] Thursday that it would ban political ads because they don't fit the company's goal of creating an \"entertaining, genuine experience\" for users. \"Any paid ads that come into the community need to fit the standards for our platform, and the nature of paid political ads is not something we believe fits the TikTok platform experience,\" the company said in a statement. That position is unusual compared to its Big Tech competitors in the U.S. Political ad experts expect well over $1 billion to be spent on digital ads alone this campaign cycle. So far, presidential campaigns have spent[2] more than $60 million on Google and Facebook this year. About $1.2 million has been spent[3] on political ads on Snapchat since last June. Yes, but: Facebook, Google and others have faced enormous scrutiny for letting groups buy ads that promote false or misleading claims. Most recently, Facebook banned ads from conservative news outlet The Epoch Times, after NBC News reported[4] that the company had funneled its Facebook ads through other dummy sites to hide their connection to its $2 million pro-Trump campaign. The company sharpened its political ad rules[5] shortly thereafter. Facebook, Google and most recently Snapchat have all set up political advertising archives to bring transparency to their advertising policies and the ads that run on their platforms. Be smart: It's not just Big Tech that's grappling with these decisions. On Thursday The Daily Beast reported[6] that CNN refused to air two Trump campaign ads that push misleading claims and suggest the network's anchors are the Democrats' \"media lapdogs.\" The Trump campaign says the ad is factually accurate. According to the law, over-the-air broadcasters and local cable companies can't reject ads from legally qualified candidates. But that precedent hasn't been tested for national cable companies. It is unprecedented for TV networks to reject political ads for inaccuracies, but these types of situations don't usually occur this far out from the general election. Metro authorities and other out-of-home (billboard) companies also struggle with this dilemma. The WMATA (DC's Metro authority) banned political and advocacy ads in 2015 after a receiving a request[7] to run ads featuring the Prophet Muhammad. The MTA, New York City's transit authority, also banned[8] them that year on buses and subways. Most recently, WMATA reversed its decision[9] for ads for an art exhibition on the migrant crisis this summer, but didn't give a reason for the switch. The big picture: Traditional media companies have had years to develop rigorous political and advocacy advertising guidelines and approval processes. But for newer tech companies that were born without regulations, and for national cable and transit companies, figuring out the appropriate balance between oversight and acceptance has proven difficult. The bottom line: Some companies find that the risk raised by allowing controversial ads can often outweigh the money they bring in. Others recognize that risk, but believe allowing political ads aligns with their mission of supporting fair debate. Ahead of the next election, their decisions either way will be closely watched.

Democrats are eager to chip away at the GOP\u2019s growing advantage, and Sens. Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Kristen Gillibrand say they wouldn\u2019t rule out expanding the court, imposing term limits on judges and more if elected president in 2020. \u201cWe are on the verge of a crisis of confidence in the Supreme Court,\u201d said Harris, D-California. \u201cWe have to take this challenge head on, and everything is on the table to do that.\u201d [POLITICO]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Happy Monday.</p><p>Topping the news The Legislature failed to pass a tax reform bill this session, but plans to extensively restructure the state\u2019s tax system remain on the table. [Trib] [DNews]</p><p>-&gt; While lawmakers scrapped plans to borrow $1.6 billion for transportations projects just before the close of this year\u2019s legislative session, they did pass a bill that would direct existing funds to specific pet projects.

[Trib]</p><p>In other news Though activist groups in Utah have been pushing for greater civilian oversight of the police force in Salt Lake City and beyond, lawmakers passed a bill to block municipalities from granting more power and autonomy to police review boards. [Trib]</p><p>-&gt; The Midvale City Council passed a possibly first-of-its kind ordinance earlier this month recognizing pygmy goats as pets, not livestock, and allowing them in residential zones. [Trib]</p><p>-&gt; A group of Tooele County residents has filed a lawsuit against the county for rejecting its petition that rezoning decisions be placed on the ballot, thus allowing residents to decide the fate of a large development project. [DNews]</p><p>-&gt; The Utah League of Cities and Towns said the 2019 legislative session brought wins for local governmental control, as several bills that would have regulated cities in areas ranging from gravel pits to plastic bags either died or were amended. [DNews]</p><p>-&gt; Utah lawmakers and citizens showed support for members of the state\u2019s Muslim community in the wake of two mass shootings that took the lives of nearly 50 people at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. [Trib] [ABC4]</p><p>Nationally Using his first veto since becoming president of the United States, Donald Trump rejected a bipartisan resolution from Congress that would have reversed his declaration of national emergency at the nation\u2019s southern border with Mexico. Lawmakers don\u2019t have the votes to overturn his veto. [NYTimes] [WaPost] [Politico]</p><p>-&gt; New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand officially announced that she will join a long list of Democratic hopefuls as a candidate in the 2020 presidential race. [NYTimes]</p><p>-&gt; Former Vice President Joe Biden has not yet formally announced that he is seeking the Democratic nomination, but he seemed to almost accidentally do so while speaking at a fundraiser in Delaware. [WaPost]</p><p>-&gt;The divergence between Democrats and big tech companies is broadening ahead of 2020, as many presidential hopefuls denounce Silicon Valley giants. [Politico]</p><p>Got a tip?

He told ACA CEO Matt Polka there's more agreement than disagreement over a \"reasonable framework\" of regulation. </p><p>\"We're in troubled times\" due to a particularly polarized political process, even as a rapidly changing digital market requires an active Congress. He said advocates need to stick to substance and avoid hyperbole. Kimmelman is encouraged by interest on Capitol Hill for privacy legislation, which could be a galvanizing moment for Congress. He said any such legislation needs to lead to more transparency for and choice by consumers about what of their data is being handled and how, and perhaps nonnegotiable limits on how data can be used. Asked about the likelihood of a DOJ-led breakup of big tech companies, Kimmelman said there's \"some logic\" to that, but antitrust laws aren't \"well equipped\" for that and there needs instead to be a look at other government accountability tools to prevent discrimination and abuse. DOJ's intervening in vertical mergers like AT&amp;T/Time Warner was \"very refreshing,\" though the Justice loss in court was disappointing. He hopes that won't dissuade Justice in the future. Kimmelman said Nexstar/Tribune will surely face the same regulatory scrutiny about concentration in local markets and calls for some station divestiture, but they're likely more willing to work with the government than Sinclair was, so the deal is more likely to go ahead.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDEM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VJ6-26T1-DYRJ-049P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"275\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 04, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

This week new information came from the Mueller investigation that Gates was in contact with one ofTrump campaign chair Paul Manafort's close colleagues, who worked for a Russian intelligence agency. Reportedly, Gates was aware of that fact in September and October of 2016 when he was part of the Trump campaign (CNN, \"Source: Mueller pushed for Gates' help on collusion,\" 03.30.2018).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Head of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt has sentTrump a proposition for lowering fuel efficiency standards. This would be very beneficial to the auto industry and would dramatically undercut one ofFormer President Obama's biggest actions against climate change (Reuters, \"EPA poised to announce rejection of Obama vehicle fuel efficiency rules,\" 03.29.2018).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump announced on Thursday, March 29 thatU.S. troops will be leavingSyria very soon. The President's statement came only hours afterthe Pentagon's recommendation that the U.S. remain in Syria. The Pentagon was not informed of the decision prior to the speech (CNN, \"Trump says the US will withdraw from Syria 'very soon,'\" 03.29.2018).</p><p>AfterPresident Trump imposed tariffs on aluminum and steel imports,China, on April 2, established tariffs on U.S. imports. The Chinese tariffs will affect 128 products including fruits, nuts and recycled aluminum, which are worth about $3 billion. While China claims that the tariffs are violating global trade rules, Trump argues they are a national security necessity. While the two countries have been holding trade talks, Trump has threatened further tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports (CNN Money, \"China hits the United States with tariffs on $3 billion of exports,\" 04.02.2018; \"Tariffs, Trump and trade wars: Here's what it all means,\" 03.09.2018).</p><p>South Korea obtained an exemption from the tariffs imposed byPresident Trump by re-negotiating their current trade deal with the U.S. Under the new deal, the tariffs have been extended on the truck manufacturers and new quotas have been imposed on South Korea's steel exports. Moreover,Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, Canada and theEuropean Union have also obtained exemptions from U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum (The Economist, \"Even if America wins concessions, worry,\" 03.28.2018).</p><p>Trump attackedAmazon last week, accusing the company on Twitter of paying almost no taxes. Officially, the attack on the retail giant comes as part of the policy of protecting small businesses. However, many questions have been raised regarding whether the motive behind the attack could be Trump's personal dislike forAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who is also the owner ofThe Washington Post, a newspaper that has publicly criticized Trump (Financial Times, \"Amazon respite as big tech stocks bounce,\" 03.29.2018).</p><p>AFacebook memo called \"The Ugly\" was leaked on March 29. In it,Facebook Vice President Andrew Bosworth wrote that Facebook's goal of connecting people should continue and will always be a worthy objective, even if it sometimes results in negative consequences such as loss of life (Financial Times, \"Facebook memo outlines 'ugly truth' behind its mission,\" 03.29.2018).</p><p>Moreover, America'sFederal Trade Commission recently opened an investigation into Facebook's privacy policies. This comes as a result of the scandal in which the data of 50 million Facebook users was obtained by the political analytics firmCambridge Analytica.Mark Zuckerberg has been asked to testify before Congress. The scandal is raising the question of how much responsibility Facebook should hold in the data breach, and many are anticipating increased regulation of social media. These scandals caused a significant drop in Facebook's share price. As the protest against the mishandling of users' personal data has ramped up in the past few weeks, the hashtag #DeleteFacebook has spread on social media (The Economist, \"Getting a handle on a scandal,\" 03.28.2018.)</p><p>Luxury car manufacturerTesla recalled around 123,000 cars due to a potential steering fault. This represents the largest-ever vehicle recall for the company. Moreover, Tesla's shares fell by eight percent due to Moody's downgrade of their credit rating. This comes as a result of low production of the new Model 3 electric car and a rise in concern regarding self-driving vehicles after a deadly crash of one of their Model X cars last week (Financial Times, \"Tesla recalls 123,000 Model S sedans,\" 03.29.2018)</p><p>Around the world...</p><p>After the alleged Russian poisoning of theRussian former secret agent Sergei Skripal and his daughterYulia Skripal in Salisbury, England, U.S., UK and several other European countries are expelling more than 100Russian diplomats. Russia is responding by expelling around 150Western diplomats, as well as closing the U.S. consulate in St. Petersburg. Both Skripals are still in the hospital, and while Yulia Skripal is improving rapidly, her father remains in critical, but stable condition. (Financial Times, \"Russia to expel more than 150 western diplomats,\" 03.30.2018)</p><p>On April 27, a high-level summit betweenNorth andSouth Korea will be held for the first time in a decade. This is a historic achievement in the relations between the two countries and could be a step in the direction of resolving a decades-old stand-off between the two countries and minimizing the threat of nuclear attack by North Korea (Financial Times, \"Koreas lay groundwork for Kim-Moon summit,\" 03.29.2018)</p><p>Keeping up with 2020 hopefuls...</p><p>A poll by SSRS for CNN revealed on [date] thatFormer Vice President Joe Biden is currently the most popular presidential candidate among Democrats, with 84 percent saying they are very likely or somewhat likely to support his possible nomination. The second in the polls wasSenator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) with 75 percent, and third place went toSenator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) with 68 percent. Three younger Democrats also rumored to be considering a presidential bid areSenator Kamala Harris (D-CA), who obtained 58 percent,Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), who obtained 50 percent, andSenator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) who obtained 48 percent (CNN Politics, \"#2020Vision: Biden a popular 2020 pick; Holder plans early 2019 decision; Harris schedules several big appearances,\" 04.01.2018)</p><p>On April 2, prospective Republican nominees,Ohio Governor John Kasich and entrepreneurMark Cuban visited Ohio State University to discuss automation and innovation in the workplace. Both Kasich and Cuban are vocal critics ofTrump and are reported to be considering challenging him in the 2020 Republican primaries (CNN Politics, \"#2020Vision: Biden a popular 2020 pick; Holder plans early 2019 decision; Harris schedules several big appearances,\" 04.01.2018)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-3397455</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S1Y-B801-JBSN-314N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1148\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Miscellany News: Vassar College</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 4, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Poughkeepsie</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>NY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

That number began to plummet during Lyndon Johnson's administration and by Election Day 1968 had fallen to the low 60s. It continued to fall under Richard Nixon, and by the time Jimmy Carter's term as president had ended, public trust in the federal government was down to just 30 percent. It briefly spiked above 50 percent after 9/11, then sank even lower. Barack Obama's presidency saw public trust fall to the teens, which is where it remains under Donald Trump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Why did Americans stop trusting their government? There is no single answer, of course. But perhaps part of the reason is that the size and scope of the federal establishment metastasized far beyond the level at which it could maintain a reputation for fairness and reliability. Since the 1960s and 1970s, Washington has insisted on doing more, regulating more, intervening more, spending more, and micromanaging more than ever before. As the view increasingly took hold that the government is obliged to solve every problem, its inevitable failure to do so became impossible to ignore. The bigger government grew and the more it intruded in citizens' lives, the sourer the taste it left in many mouths.</p><p>Americans embark on this presidential election year with their trust in Washington's abilities at or near an all-time low. Yet most of the Democratic politicians running for president want the government to be given even greater powers. As vast as the federal behemoth has grown, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, and the others want it to grow vaster. In countless areas of life \u2014 medical costs, energy, college loans, gun control, labor unions, child care, and so many others \u2014 they call for more regulation, greater spending, new entitlements. They propose sweeping economic transformations and radical social shifts. And never do they voice even a qualm about the wisdom of conferring more authority and dominance on a bloated government that most Americans say they don't trust.</p><p>The same politicians and political activists who mistrust so many people in the private sector feel no such wariness about the public sector. Everywhere they look, these politicians see citizens who cannot be trusted to make decisions for themselves: employers, gun owners, Big Tech executives, oil producers, health insurers, Wall Street investors, even Christian bakers and florists. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, however, they never seem to lose their faith \u2014 their almost religious faith \u2014 in the fundamental wisdom and benevolence of government regulators.</p><p>Atheists sometimes scorn religious believers as irrational for having faith in an omniscient God. But while God's existence can be neither proved nor disproved, every day's news brings fresh evidence of incompetence, fraud, waste, and dishonesty in government: Presidential impeachments. Police brutality. City Hall shakedowns. Campaign-finance chicanery. Men and women who work for the state may not be more prone to venality, bias, or screwing up than other people. But surely they are no less so.</p><p>Politicians and public officials are only human. They aren't endowed with superhuman powers or godlike insights. They cannot foretell the future or avoid error. Their moral judgments are no better, on average, than those of the taxpayers who support them. And their schemes and projects are about as likely to succeed as most endeavors are. An estimated 95 percent of product launches fizzle. Half of all new hires don't work out. Twenty percent of small businesses go bust within a year. If the odds against success are so high even in such limited undertakings, how likely is it that the massive plans touted by candidates like Warren, who has issued more than 60 blueprints, many quite radical, for reconstructing American society, would work out as planned? Even if you find her (or any other candidate's) ideas appealing in the abstract, isn't it overwhelmingly likely that they would fail in the real world? And when that happened, wouldn't the result be even more cynicism toward the federal government?</p><p>This month marks the 190th anniversary of an essay every candidate for office ought to read. In January 1830, the British historian and statesman Thomas Babington Macaulay wrote a review of a book on politics and history by Robert Southey, England's poet laureate. Macaulay, a classical liberal, scathingly rejected Southey's statist worldview:</p><p>\"He conceives that the business of the magistrate is, not merely to see that the persons and property of the people are secure from attack, but that he ought to be a jack-of-all-trades, architect, engineer, schoolmaster, merchant, theologian \u2026 His principle is \u2026 that no man can do anything so well for himself as his rulers \u2026 can do it for him, and that a government approaches nearer and nearer to perfection, in proportion as it interferes more and more with the habits and notions of individuals.\"</p><p>It may be appealing, wrote Macaulay, to imagine that a wise government should guide the people. \"But is there any reason for believing that a government is more likely to lead the people in the right way than the people to fall into the right way of themselves?\"</p><p>Macaulay's plea for prudence and modesty in government is even more relevant in our time than it was in his \u2014 and even more likely to go unheeded. Never has America's political class been so sure that it knows exactly how to engineer society. And never have Americans trusted their government less.</p><p>Jeff Jacoby can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jeff.jacoby@globe.comFollow\">jeff.jacoby@globe.comFollow</email> him on Twitter@jeff_jacoby</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-852ab112-2da0-11ea-836d-040b55585715</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XX5-3D31-JC2G-C566-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"982\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 5, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

Some policymakers now seem determined to \"take on\" Big Tech - whether by breaking up companies, enforcing divestment, or directly regulating them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet watching the grandstanding lawmakers and parsing the CMA report, an obvious problem becomes clear. Neither has any robust evidence that consumers are harmed by tech companies' current actions. Instead, it is assumed that competitors' complaints about tech companies' business practices are synonymous with competition being undermined.</p><p>Given their sheer size and prevalence, \"Big Tech\" firms certainly occupy a \"psychological monopoly\" status in today's landscape. Yet economists know that big need not be bad for customers, especially when high user numbers enhance the service or company size reflects developing the best product.</p><p>All these businesses compete with each other across numerous domains, from digital assistants to devices and streaming. What matters from a competition perspective is whether each dominates any relevant product market, restricting competition to consumers' detriment.</p><p>Defining that relevant market is easier said than done. Google began as a user search engine, yet competes for paid custom in digital advertising. Increasingly people don't use Google to search for websites, but to get quick information or see a destination they're looking for, including via maps, flight bookings, videos and more. These are sub-sectors with many competitors.</p><p>Facebook arguably faces more complex strands of competitive pressure. It competes with any website spoiling for users' time - including in messaging, telecoms, newsfeeds, connection apps, review websites and more. Its paying customers are, again, advertisers, who enjoy a range of options for placing ads, as shown by a recent Facebook boycott by some advertising companies.</p><p>Amazon and Apple have more obvious \"core\" markets. But even beyond operating in the retail and phone sectors, the pair compete across other products, from e-books to operating systems. Both have developed rich digital ecosystems that allow third parties to sell goods or apps, actively broadening competition in many sectors.</p><p>It's certainly true that Big Tech companies, while providing openings for small businesses, have disrupted many others, from newspapers to high street shops. But that's consumer-led capitalism, as pointed out in Amazon owner Jeff Bezos's opening statement. Government shouldn't use competition policy to protect incumbents from products or services consumers prefer. Its job should be to protect the welfare of customers who benefit from dynamic competition.</p><p>Here, the big picture shows a boon for users and advertisers. Amazon delivers goods to us more efficiently than ever. Apple has trail-blazed with smartphones and apps. Facebook and Google provide us with valuable services free at the point of use. Digital advertising costs overall have fallen by 40pc in the past decade, with better targeting. Instant messaging is free. All this has improved our resilience in the pandemic.</p><p>To say Big Tech engages in harmful, anticompetitive conduct then you have to make the more speculative case that all these benefits we've enjoyed would have been delivered in more fragmented markets. That, if just a few more social media companies, app platforms, search engines and online retailers existed, we'd have seen lower prices still, lower advertising costs, better privacy and more innovation.</p><p>Such speculative hypotheticals have proved necessary in the absence of real evidence of consumer harm. The CMA report, for example, used the term \"could be\" 91 times, \"we believe\" 27 times, and \"might\" 76 times. As NetChoice's Christopher Marchese concluded, such speculation might be expected when announcing a competition review, but not in a report justifying huge government interventions in the functioning of the world's biggest companies.</p><p>The US politicians' focus on the impact of Big Tech on competitors highlighted the lack of evidence of harm to consumers. A lot expressed worries about the effects of supposedly aggressive tech mergers and acquisitions on the competitive landscape - including Google's purchase of YouTube and Facebook's of WhatsApp and Instagram.</p><p>Yet as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg explained, these mergers enhanced real-world competition by strengthening competition to traditional TV and mobile companies. While in hindsight these mergers might look like tech companies snuffing out possible competition to their own services that presumes acquired companies would have done as well without the investment and expertise of their purchasers. One could hardly claim consumers have suffered worse or fewer services as a result, regardless.</p><p>Confusingly, other times the politicians complained about having more competitors in markets, bemoaning instances where Amazon and Google used data they'd acquired to enter new product lines.</p><p>Apparently, Big Tech companies competing with existing businesses through lower priced own-brand products is a bad thing.</p><p>The lack of evidence about consumer welfare, however, was probably best exemplified by how many questions attacked the companies for non-economic reasons, such as alleged failures in fighting online harms, or content moderation choices. Yet these have little to do with market structure and competition. There's no reason to think smaller companies would do better policing criminal activity or protecting speech.</p><p>In all then, the congressional testimony, like the CMA report, served a useful purpose in exposing the paucity of any competition case against these companies. Yes, they are big and hold hard-earned incumbency advantages, whether on user numbers or data. But their success overwhelmingly comes from consumers valuing their services.</p><p>If you think sustained dominance for these companies is just assured, however, without them engaging in continual innovation to stay on top, you should check out how well MySpace, AOL Instant Messenger and Microsoft Internet Explorer are doing today.</p><p>Ryan Bourne holds the R Evan Scharf chair for the public understanding of economics at the Cato Institute</p><p/><p>'This has served a useful purpose in exposing the paucity of any competition case against these companies'</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Jeff Bezos, the Amazon boss, testifies on Capitol Hill in WashingtonAFP VIA GETTY</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-161985272</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GF-PRP1-JCBW-N3XM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1093\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

First, the White House directed the Federal Communications Commission to \"clarify that Section 230 does not permit social media companies that alter or editorialize users\u2019 speech to escape civil liability\" \u2014 something the FCC absolutely cannot and will not do. </p><p>Then, Trump tweeted:</p><p>Tweet</p><p>It's abhorrent enough for the leader of the supposedly small-government party to boast about using executive orders to punish private companies because of his own personal animus.

And whereas the majority of the public polled by Morning Consult last year said that they want presidential candidates to criticize healthcare, Big Pharma, and higher education, just 40% said the same thing about tech. That's a smaller percentage than the number of people who said to criticize the news media, manufacturing, and renewable energy.</p><p>When asked point-blank by pollsters from the Hill, the majority of Democrats and Republicans said that the government should not regulate tech companies like they are monopolies.
