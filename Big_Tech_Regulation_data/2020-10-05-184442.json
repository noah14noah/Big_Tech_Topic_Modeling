And there was little doubt that, given the breadth of the law and the many suspected violations by global tech firms, there would soon be heavy fines or, at least, sanctions that would force Big Tech to change its operating methods.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But that promise has not been fulfilled. Aside from a (EURO)50 million fine that France's privacy regulator imposed on Google in January, there have been no fines or remedies levied at a U.S. giant since the GDPR came into effect. And the two nations most directly responsible for policing the tech sector - Ireland and Luxembourg, where the largest tech firms have their European headquarters - have yet to wrap up a single investigation of any magnitude concerning a U.S. firm.</p><p>Now the Irish regulator which oversees Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter, among other giants, says that its first decision will not be delivered until early next year, adding to previous delays.</p><p>Ireland and Luxembourg have faced special scrutiny because so many U.S. tech companies have set up shop in those tiny nations, which have actively courted them thanks to a mix of low corporate tax rates and business-friendly regulation. Those close relationships have created a strong degree of economic dependency, particularly in the Irish case, which raises questions as to whether these countries are best suited to regulating Big Tech.</p><p>Now, regulators in other countries are speaking out about their doubts. Hamburg's data protection authority says that the current \"one-stop-shop\" system, in which many major investigations are carried out by authorities in Dublin or Luxembourg, creates serious bottlenecks and an \"unsatisfactory\" situation for millions of web users.</p><p>\"After nearly one and a half years we must concede that we have a huge problem with the enforcement of cross border processing especially by globally acting companies,\" a spokesperson for the authority, one of 16 in Germany, told POLITICO, referring to cases that concern web users in more than one country. \"It is absolutely unsatisfactory to see that the biggest alleged data protection violations of the last 15 months with millions of individuals [concerned] are far away from being sanctioned.\"</p><p>Luxembourg's regulator declined numerous requests for comment. Irish privacy chief Helen Dixon insisted in an interview that the delays have to do with the complexity of enforcing a new law.</p><p>Probes take time because Europe's law is untested and cases need to stand up to the scrutiny of all 28 EU nations, as well as in national court. \"It's going to take as long as it takes to do it properly,\" she said, echoing points made by some other senior European data protection officials.</p><p>But Dixon's explanation is not good enough for other regulators, lawyers, privacy campaigners and consumer protection groups around Europe. They argue that the longer Europe takes to enforce its privacy rules against the world's biggest data-hungry companies, the more Silicon Valley will take advantage of wiggle room, run circles around regulators and undermine the spirit of the EU's law.</p><p>In interviews with officials and privacy specialists around Europe, critics pointed to a range of problems in the bloc's privacy system including:</p><p>-A bureaucratic logjam that has delayed action on dozens of complaints including alleged violations of GDPR in Google's location tracking and privacy failures on behalf of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Twitter and others, prompting privacy activists to threaten legal action;</p><p>-Lead supervisory authorities in charge of regulating some of the world's most powerful tech companies that leaned heavily toward \"engagement\" - or doling out advice on how to stay legal - over investigations and enforcement; </p><p>-A lack of transparency and cooperation between European data protection authorities that are meant to work hand-in-hand to enforce the rules, but end up being stymied by divergent national legal systems, cultural differences and an outmoded information exchange system;</p><p>-Increasingly glaring differences in how EU watchdogs are interpreting the rules and, at times, breaking out of the one-stop-shop system to create what resembles a patchwork of privacy regimens instead of a single European landscape.</p><p>Few doubt that consequential decisions will be forthcoming in 2020. But when the first big calls are made on Google, Facebook and other big players, the critics warn it will only be the start of legal arguments, as European regulators are likely to battle one another over fines and remedies in arguments that could take years to untangle, and which may only get resolved by judges at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.</p><p>The irony, argue these same critics, is that after plenty of crowing about Europe's comprehensive approach to privacy, it's in the United States, where regulators have hit Facebook with a $5 billion fine over the Cambridge Analytica scandal, that enforcement has been the quickest on privacy.</p><p>\"Europe has great laws on paper. But where are the enforcements? Where's the beef?\" said Thomas Shaw, an Ireland-based American privacy lawyer who has authored several books on data protection.</p><p>* * *</p><p>To understand the growing frustration, critics say, it helps to look over some of the more prominent complaints that have piled up since GDPR came into effect and remain unresolved, prompting several parties to consider legal action that would force regulators to get moving.</p><p>On the day the law was enforced, Austrian privacy lawyer Max Schrems filed four lawsuits against Facebook, Google, Instagram and WhatsApp, respectively, over the idea that they were \"forcing\" users to agree to have their personal data harvested in order to be able to use services. These suits, which were first filed with regulators in France, Germany, Austria and Belgium, were subsequently all forwarded to the Irish Data Protection Commission - which became Europe's \"lead\" regulator for all the firms concerned overnight - for further processing.</p><p>A year and a half later, Schrems and the other lawyers in his \"None of Your Business\" (noyb.eu) group are still waiting for decisions, and considering legal action that would the Irish regulator to get moving on their claims.</p><p>An investigation into one of their complaints, against Facebook, was \"completed\" by Ireland over the summer, but it's still stuck in a review process between noyb.eu and Facebook's lawyers, according to Gaetan Goldberg, one of Schrems' associates. Asked for an update on the status of that complaint, Irish privacy chief Dixon said it had yet to reach her desk and was outside her legal purview as Irish Data Protection Commissioner for the moment.</p><p>Schrems and his colleagues say they are bound by confidentiality rules and cannot discuss the 66-page report on Ireland's probe, which looks into whether Facebook users gave users a real choice over having their data collected if they wanted to use the platform. But people familiar with their thinking say they are less than satisfied with the outcome, and could bring objections through the Austrian court system. </p><p>On all of noyb.eu's other complaints, including an additional volley against Amazon and Apple filed in January of this year, there is no clear end in sight.</p><p>Schrems said the slow pace fits in with what he describes as the Irish regulator's track record of avoiding enforcement.</p><p>He points to an ongoing case before Europe's top court, which started way back in 2013 when Schrems complained to the Irish regulator that the data of European Facebook users would not be safe from snooping if it was sent on to the United States. Instead of ruling on the matter, the Irish authorities kicked it up to the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg, which is due to issue a final ruling in the case next summer, seven years after the original complaint. In a hearing about the case earlier this year and an opinion from its advocate general in December, the court was critical of the Irish decision to pass on the case.</p><p>\"All cases are still stuck with the Irish, some with no response for more than 1.5 years now,\" said Schrems, who was behind a lawsuit that brought a major transatlantic data flow agreement, Safe Harbor, crashing down and is also a complainant in proceedings against its successor, Privacy Shield.</p><p>The slow pace fits in with a track record of easygoing treatment of Facebook from before the GDPR era, when the Irish regulator had next to zero power to sanction firms, Schrems and other critics say.</p><p>After granting the social media giant a clean bill of health on privacy following a three-month audit in 2011, the Irish Data Protection Commission went on to advise Facebook on how to comply with the GDPR in the run-up to the law coming online, several people familiar with the matter said, including on controversial matters like its facial recognition tool for matching photos online - which other regulators have singled out as being problematic under EU rules. </p><p>Luxembourg's regulator is, if anything, less transparent than its Irish counterpart.</p><p>Located on \"rue du Rock 'n' Roll\" in a town far from the country's administrative center, the regulator that watches over Amazon, eBay and Paypal in the European Union did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and provided no information about any investigation into those companies in its public statements.</p><p>\"We have blockage situation,\" added Schrems's colleague Goldberg in a phone conversation, referring to the GDPR's one-stop-shop mechanism that gave lead oversight authority to Ireland and Luxembourg due to the companies' choice to locate their main establishment in those countries. \"My fear is that this [bottleneck] will ultimately have a chilling effect on individuals seeking to assert their privacy rights.\"</p><p>Another long-waiting party is La Quadrature du Net, a French digital rights group that filed no fewer than seven lawsuits against five big tech companies just a few days after GDPR came online. One of the cases, concerning Google's Android mobile operating system, resulted in the French CNIL regulator hitting the search giant with a (EURO)50 million fine in January of 2019 for breaching GDPR by failing to obtain legally valid consent for gathering their data for ad personalization.</p><p>Others remain in limbo. Luxembourg's data protection authority has reached out to Amazon over La Quadrature's complaint, the company confirmed to POLITICO, yet decisions still seem to be a distant prospect.</p><p>\"We have very little information on how things are progressing,\" said Arthur Messaud, a lawyer for the French group.</p><p>* * *</p><p>After an initial volley of complaints which took aim at the beating heart of Silicon Valley's data collection model, others have followed that target different aspects of Big Tech's privacy practices.</p><p>An umbrella group of European consumer protection organizations, BEUC, filed a complaint last November against Google over alleged privacy failures in the way it tracks users' location, while Johnny Ryan, an executive at web browser Brave, complained to Ireland's privacy regulator in September, 2019, over what he called a \"GDPR workaround\" that was allowing the search giant to collect data on users without valid consent.</p><p>Both cases are pending, and several complainants told POLITICO they were considering further legal action to force data protection authorities to get moving via what's called an \"urgency procedure\" in the GDPR. Speaking to the \"International Grand Committee on Fake News\" held in Dublin in November, Ryan said that he could sue regulators to push things along. Noyb.eu's representatives said they also had been considering additional legal action, while BEUC - which represents 42 consumer groups across 32 countries - wrote in a sharply worded open letter in late November that Europe's data protection authorities need to get moving.</p><p>\"When companies break the law, consumers need to be able to rely on enforcement bodies to get their rights respected,\" wrote the group's director general, Monique Goyens, in a thinly veiled reference to the Irish enforcement body investigating the group's complaints.</p><p>Finn L\u00fctzow-Holm Myrstad, Director of Digital Policy at Norway's consumer protection agency, said that after the letter was published, Ireland's privacy regulator invited members of BEUC to Dublin to discuss changes it said the search giant had made in response to the complaint. But these changes have yet to be made public, and the case took nearly a year to be addressed - too long, L\u00fctzow-Holm Myrstad said, in today's world.</p><p>\"In a constantly moving digital world, we can't wait for years to see Google take action to fix abusive practices,\" he wrote in response to emailed questions.</p><p>Ireland's Dixon, who told U.S. Congress in May it was likely that Silicon Valley companies had violated the GDPR, acknowledges the impatience. Having said that she would hand down a first draft decision in a case involving WhatsApp in December, Dixon now says that decision will not be forthcoming until \"early in the new year.\"</p><p>\"We're all impatient,\" she said. The problem was that there was nothing her office could to do speed up the clock on legal procedures that granted companies a right of response. In the case of the WhatsApp probe - in which the company is suspected of having failed to give users enough information about how their personal data was being shared with parent company Facebook - lawyers for the firm had raised objections, which needed to be taken into account.</p><p>\"We are getting wary of quoting timelines and mentioning 'end of the year, start to next month,' because it's simply not a process that we control end-to-end,\" she said in November on the sidelines of a privacy conference in Brussels. \"This is a novel and new procedure that we are going to step through at EU level, where a controller raises a legitimate concern, or puts something on the table to say... We do have to pause and answer those queries carefully.\"</p><p>As of late November, Dixon said she had yet to decide whether WhatsApp has, in fact, breached the GDPR. If and when she does, her first decision is likely to subject Europe's privacy enforcement system to its first real stress test because other regulators will get to weigh in on decisions that concern millions of web users and are expected to push back against the Irish ruling.</p><p>So far, open disagreements have been kept to a minimum. According to the umbrella organization that gathers all EU privacy regulators, regulators have made decisions in 70 cases that concerned data subjects in more than one country - or what are known as \"cross-border cases\" in the European Union's 28-member bloc. But every case had been resolved via a consensus decision, never once triggering a dispute resolution mechanism in the GDPR that would allow one watchdog to voice concern.</p><p>For Andrea Jelinek, the Austrian privacy chief who chairs the umbrella group of EU privacy regulators, the unbroken record of decision-via-consensus amounts to proof that Europe's enforcement system is working. Those cases \"were not that glamorous but they were important.\"</p><p>But if Europe's regulators have sung from one hymn-sheet, it could also be that those decisions were narrower in scope and did not concern a powerful tech company. That is likely to change when Dixon hands down her draft decision in the WhatsApp case.</p><p>If Dixon's decision is perceived as too friendly to the company, the first pushback could come from Hamburg. The regulator in Northern Germany has repeatedly underscored concerns about WhatsApp and Facebook, citing two court decisions ordering the two entities to stop sharing data.</p><p>\"After the transmission of user data between WhatsApp and Facebook was stopped, they [Facebook] took the entry into force of the GDPR as an opportunity to return to their former practice,\" the regulator's chief told POLITICO last year.</p><p>Hamburg's more recent comments - citing \"unacceptable\" delays - suggest frustration over WhatsApp and other pending data protection matters is reaching a boiling point. And Hamburg is not alone, as Ulrich Kelber, the head of Germany's federal privacy watchdog, voiced concerns in November that Ireland may lack sufficient funding to carry out its frontline mission to regulate Big Tech. In November, according to heise.de, he warned about \"misery\" at Ireland's data protection regulator, and offered to provide Ireland formal help from German authorities.</p><p>A spokesman for the Irish regulator said the two countries had agreed to enhance their cooperation, but the Irish regulator's funding shortage is real. In 2020, the budget increased by only (EURO)1.6 million to (EURO)16.9 million - \"less than one third of the funding that the DPC requested in its budget submission\" to the Irish government, Dixon complained in October. The shortfall was particularly problematic in light of the watchdog's workload, which included more than 7,000 complaints, almost 5,000 breach notifications more than 40,000 requests for guidance from organizations in 2019, her statement read.</p><p>In her interview with POLITICO, Dixon underscored that the budget shortfall would not affect investigations or the regulator's ability to carry out expensive litigation against Big Tech companies known for \"flooding the zone\" with battalions of lawyers, drowning regulators in procedural moves.</p><p>But observers of European privacy rules are concerned, noting that even if the litigation budget is cordoned off, a lack of funding for a crucial update of outdated IT systems and human resources operations could have an impact on the regulator's functioning as a whole. In a complaint sent to the European Commission in October, Daragh O'Brien, a Dublin-based privacy consultant, urged EU authorities to intervene to make sure that privacy regulations were being properly enforced. \"It is their function [the European Commission's] to oversee how Member States are implementing EU law,\" he wrote in a blogpost.</p><p>Among other problems, he underscored that the Irish regulator badly needed upgrades, noting \"file size restrictions and the inability to manage basic file sharing capabilities.\"</p><p>\"For email and case management they are using the same basic technology I began my career administering in a telco back in 1997,\" he added.</p><p>O'Brien did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Another sore point is how well, or how poorly, Europeans are working together to enforce a bloc-wide privacy regulation that is meant to be a gold standard for the world. Under the current system, any investigation that concerns users in more than one country can prompt investigative assistance from other countries. But the system that connects the regulators, the IMI, or Internal Market Information System, is not up to the task of managing cooperation across borders, several officials complained.</p><p>More than 20 years old, it was originally conceived to share information about Europe's internal market, and isn't suited to handling the high volume of complaints that has come with the GDPR. \"This is really yesterday's technology, which slows everything down,\" said one German data protection official who asked not to be named.</p><p>Even so, regulators insist they are doing plenty of collaboration. A spokesperson for the French data protection authority spoke of \"active cooperation\" on investigations. The Irish regulator cited a list of ongoing modes of collaboration with other regulators including monthly gatherings of privacy authorities in Brussels, bilateral information exchanges, on-site visits to Dublin by regulators in third countries and an incipient collaboration with the Spanish regulator on an investigation. And yet, a spokesman for the Irish said that neither the Irish regulator nor any other had yet launched a \"joint investigation\" - a formal process that would involve sending officials from one regulator to help out another on site, and could enable better resourced regulators, like the Information Commissioner's Office in London, to lend legal and investigatory firepower to the Irish.</p><p>Reasons invoked for not doing so included language barriers, disparities between judicial systems in different EU countries and legal restrictions in some states. </p><p>But Bojana Bellamy, President of the Centre for Information Policy Leadership, offered up another: cultural differences.</p><p>Liberal regulators in northern EU countries like Ireland would not see eye-to-eye with their more legalistic German colleagues or statist French, and therefore would not want them looking over their shoulders. And while such differences have long existed, they are growing more pronounced.</p><p>\"Some lines have been broken, and there is mistrust\" between regulators, said Bellamy, whose group counts Google and Facebook as members.</p><p>In the absence of a centralizing force, regulators are starting to forge ahead with the own national actions, raising the possibility of patchwork decision-making that the GDPR sought to avoid with the \"one stop shop\" provision that designated each firm's headquarters country as lead regulator.</p><p>Hamburg's authority in August took the rare step of triggering an urgency procedure to protect the privacy rights of its citizens in a case involving Google's voice assistant. The move, which prompted the German regulator to call a temporary halt to human processing of voice recordings by Google, suggested Hamburg could not wait for the lead supervisory authority, in this case Ireland, to act.</p><p>In a separate case, Belgium's privacy regulator has asked Europe's top court to clarify when a national regulator is able to move forward with an investigation of concern to people in the country. The case stretches back to 2015, when the Belgian authority ordered Facebook to stop using a tool to track users on third-party websites, only to see the decision overturned by a court which argued that Ireland, not Belgium, was the firm's main regulatory port of call in Europe.</p><p>By appealing to the European Court of Justice, Belgium wants to know just how far its own authority stretches under the one-stop-shop.</p><p>In France, the U.K., Germany, Spain and elsewhere, regulators are rolling out differing positions on matters such as GDPR fining guidelines, limits on web browser cookies and facial recognition.</p><p>Critics point a finger at the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), which is meant to coordinate action between regulators, as needing to step up. In its annual review of the GDPR, the European Commission said that the EDPB should take on a stronger oversight role to forge common policy positions, a position that the Council of the European Union - which gathers all EU states - echoed in December.</p><p>But Jelinek said her office has no legal mandate to do more. Ultimately, the problem could land at the doorstep of the originator of the GDPR, the European Commision. Under new President Ursula von der Leyen, the bloc's executive arm has pledged to assert Europe's \"digital sovereignty\" - a concept that involves using antitrust law to look into questions of data monopolies.</p><p>But already, European data protection officials are bristling at having their turf trampled on. In a chat with POLITICO, incoming European Data Protection Supervisor Wojciech Wiewi\u00f3rowski - who's in charge of policing EU institutions - sent a clear signal that privacy regulators wanted antitrust enforcers to stay on their patch.</p><p>That leaves the agencies to decide among themselves whether reform of the GDPR's current statutes is needed, and whether action should be taken to prod the lead authorities. The biggest players are hedging their bets. Asked if it was time to reevaluate the one-stop-shop, an official at France's CNIL regulator said that question would come up after the first major decisions were handed down.</p><p>\"These procedures will be an occasion to evaluate the cooperation mechanisms foreseen by the regulation, and any need to improve them,\" the official said.</p><p>Article originally published on POLITICO Magazine</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-089617</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XVD-55K1-F118-92K8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4058\"/><timeReceived>10:03 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 27, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Six months ago we, a labor leader and an Amazon vice president, would have been on opposite sides in discussing the future of work at Big Tech in general and Amazon in particular. Then on May 1, one of us, Tim, walked away from a senior role at Amazon Web Services, and potentially millions in compensation, in protest over the firing of workers who spoke out about conditions in the company\u2019s warehouses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During the pandemic, we\u2019ve seen Big Tech share prices and revenue rocket, while some of Amazon\u2019s warehouse workers say they fear coming to work and catching the coronavirus. The company\u2019s decision to fire the activists who demanded safer jobs is unacceptable.</p><p>Both of us now agree: Amazon \u2014 and the rest of Big Tech \u2014 must change. And that includes allowing its workers to unionize.</p><p>We\u2019re not alone in wanting accountability from these companies: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/technology/amazon-apple-facebook-google-antitrust-hearing.html\">Jeff Bezos</url> and the heads of Facebook, Google and Apple will appear before the House judiciary\u2019s antitrust subcommittee today.</p><p>The coronavirus has killed over half a million people worldwide and pushed global unemployment to rates not seen since the Great Depression. Shared sacrifice is called for, yet the burden has been far from even. Since mid-March, when quarantined shoppers turned to Amazon\u2019s vast retail platform, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/technology/amazon-apple-facebook-google-antitrust-hearing.html\">its shareholder value increased</url> by nearly $500 billion, to more than $1.4 trillion. Stock market shares are owned disproportionately by the richest people in society, and by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/technology/amazon-apple-facebook-google-antitrust-hearing.html\">Mr. Bezos in particular</url>; his lead over the other richest people on earth has increased markedly.</p><p>This wealth is not shared with the workers who help create it. The temporary Covid-19-related hourly raise <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/technology/amazon-apple-facebook-google-antitrust-hearing.html\">was rolled back in June</url>, but <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/technology/amazon-apple-facebook-google-antitrust-hearing.html\">the order flow remains high</url>, making the already stressful work of those who sort, package and deliver Amazon goods even worse.</p><p>As this was unfolding, most of Big Tech, including Amazon, sent white-collar workers home to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d and fight the pandemic. Tim saw company leadership go to great lengths to make sure this new system was working and actively seek feedback from the remote workers. Christy heard from a warehouse employee who said productivity targets made it difficult for workers to take a break even for hand washing without a mark on their record. Pay for warehouse workers <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/technology/amazon-apple-facebook-google-antitrust-hearing.html\">starts at $15 an hour</url> with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/technology/amazon-apple-facebook-google-antitrust-hearing.html\">minimal access to time off</url>; in May Amazon<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/technology/amazon-apple-facebook-google-antitrust-hearing.html\">ended the unpaid leave policy</url> that for a few weeks allowed them to stay home if they had Covid-19 symptoms. The contrast in the treatment of knowledge and warehouse workers couldn\u2019t be starker. Equally clear is the cause: One group has power, the other doesn\u2019t.</p><p>Amazon\u2019s decision to fire the activists was easy to make in the United States, where Amazon workers have no union and are left to fend for themselves. With no right to paid sick leave or protection from unfair dismissal, American workers are among the most vulnerable in the world to pressure from any employer, not just Amazon.</p><p>Union-represented Amazon workers in Spain, Italy, France and Germany initially failed to resolve their concerns through negotiation, but with court action, regulatory intervention and strikes, they got their needs addressed.</p><p>Let\u2019s look at France: Unions there <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/technology/amazon-apple-facebook-google-antitrust-hearing.html\">brought a civil case</url> arguing that Amazon had taken inadequate steps to protect workers from infection risk and that it had sidestepped the unions\u2019 statutory role. The court ordered Amazon to limit its sales to only \u201cessential\u201d items, or face harsh penalties until it could reach a safety agreement with the unions. Rather than negotiate, Amazon<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/technology/amazon-apple-facebook-google-antitrust-hearing.html\">closed its French operations</url> and appealed. But the appellate court also sided with the workers, who ultimately <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/technology/amazon-apple-facebook-google-antitrust-hearing.html\">negotiated a settlement</url> including mandatory union consultation over safety measures, union hiring of external experts to assess the measures\u2019 effectiveness and a continued increase in workers\u2019 hourly pay. The news from Europe shows that Amazon can work with unions and get good results.</p><p>Both of us want Amazon to share the wealth with workers and stop putting the relentless pursuit of revenue growth ahead of all other concerns. One way or another, this requires putting more power in the hands of workers. Regulation and legislation are part of the solution. But there\u2019s no need to wait; power can be taken, not just given. That\u2019s what unions are for.</p><p>Amazon is a data-driven company. It should recognize the evidence showing that countries with more collective bargaining have a stronger social fabric and better growth, and are more able to weather economic ups and downs. Businesses with collective bargaining relationships, including Auchan Retail and Carrefour, navigated the Covid-19 crisis with less disruption to their businesses and emerged with their reputations intact and even enhanced.</p><p>For its own future and the future of the global economy, Amazon should become more responsive to the women and men who\u2019ve enriched shareholders and be willing to recognize and bargain with their representatives. When it comes to the rights of its workers, it should be a leader, not a laggard.</p><p>It\u2019s not just Amazon: The need for more unionization is urgent across Big Tech. Amazon stands out because it combines the extraordinary profit margins of these companies with employing hundreds of thousands of front-line workers. There are fewer of these workers at the other big tech companies, but nevertheless their employees also deserve a voice over the issues that matter to them.</p><p>The question for Mr. Bezos and the billionaires of the world is: Are they ready to rise to the occasion? Will Big Tech listen to and work with its employees to help the world overcome the worst economic and social crisis in recent history?</p><p>Tim Bray is a former vice president at Amazon. Christy Hoffman is the general secretary of UNI Global Union.</p><p>The Times is committed to publishing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/technology/amazon-apple-facebook-google-antitrust-hearing.html\">a diversity of letters</url> to the editor.

Neguse asked of the Facebook co-founder.</p><p>'Congressman, I don't specifically, but it sounds like a joke,' Zuckerberg said.</p><p>The newly revealed 2012 email chain, Neguse said, came directly after Facebook closed on its purchase of Instagram - one of its biggest competitors at the time.</p><p>In the emails, Zuckerberg detailed that his goal is to 'neutralize potential competitors,' especially those that could be 'disruptive' to Facebook.</p><p>'Here's why I ask these questions, Mr. Zuckerberg,' Neguse said in closing. 'It strikes me that over the course of the last several years, Facebook has used its market power to either purchase or replicate the competition.'</p><p>'And Facebook, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram are the most now downloaded apps of the last decade - and your company, sir, owns them all,' the Colorado representative concluded.</p><p>'And we have a word for that - that word is monopoly.'</p><p>Jerrold Nadler, the Democrat who heads the House Judiciary Committee, told Zuckerberg that the documents obtained from the company 'tell a very disturbing story' of Facebook's acquisition of the Instagram messaging service.</p><p>And Democrat Pramila Jayapal asked Zuckerberg: 'Has Facebook ever threatened to clone the products of another company while also attempting to acquire that company?'</p><p>When he replied 'no,' she said: 'I'd like to remind you that you're under oath,' then detailed how when Facebook bought Instagram, it was also developing a similar product called Facebook Camera.</p><p>Jayapal said that Instagram founder Kevin Systrom believed that Zuckerberg would go into 'destroy mode' if he did not sell to Facebook. The billionaire denied the claim. </p><p>Facebook acquired several social media and messaging apps - the most high-profile being Instagram and WhatsApp - since growing to one of the most popular platforms in the world and the major social media power. It has also attempted to buy others, like Snapchat. </p><p>Jayapal pushed Zuckerberg on whether Facebook had ever copied its competitors. 'We've certainly adapted features that others have led in,' he said.</p><p>'How many companies did Facebook end up copying?' she asked. 'Is it less than five? Less than 50?' </p><p>'Congresswoman, I don't know,' Zuckerberg said.</p><p>Zuckerberg was just one of the four CEOs who were called to testify before the subcommittee on Wednesday - the others were Google's Sundar Pichai, Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Apple's Tim Cook.</p><p>All were present, virtually, to argue they face stiff competition from each other and other outside rivals.</p><p>Both sides of the political aisle accused tech firms of 'trafficking in hate' - Democrats slammed predatory behavior against competitors and Republicans went through a laundry-list of claims about bias and complaints about involvement in China. </p><p>Unfortunately, the Big Tech hearing was decidedly low-tech. Bezos escaped questioning for about an hour in what may have been a technical issue, and was caught on screen reaching for what appeared to be a snack.</p><p>Poor audio, flat-screen televisions switching off, and chief executives appearing together as thumbnails on a large screen frustrated viewers and led to mockery of the virtual set-up on Twitter.</p><p>Lawmakers descended into shouting at points, with a pandemic twist. One lawmaker shouted: 'Put your mask on!'</p><p>Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat and chair of the antitrust subcommittee, set the tone when he began by accusing Google of theft.</p><p>'Why does Google steal content from honest businesses?' he asked.</p><p>Cicilline alleged Google stole reviews from Yelp Inc. and said Google threatened to delist the crowd-sourced review results from its search engine if it objected.</p><p>Pichai responded mildly that he would want to know the specifics of the accusation. 'We conduct ourselves to the highest standards,' he added, disagreeing with the characterization that Google steals content to win users.</p><p>But it was the Facebook executive who came under some of the most harsh lines of questioning from Democrats over potential antitrust and competition issues and from Republicans over alleged anti-conservative bias.</p><p>                     ALEXA, TELL JEFF BEZOS HE'S ON MUTE                   </p><p> Jeff Bezos escaped questioning for about an hour in what may have been the result of a technical glitch - and then got caught trying to answer while on mute.</p><p>He also sneaked in a snack, which was caught on camera. </p><p>Lawmakers, who held the hearing via videoconference, focused on asking the CEOs of Alphabet Inc's Google and Facebook Inc a barrage of questions on alleged abuses of market power.</p><p>Bezos was questioned intensely later on in the hearing. Any issue with his video stream would not have been the only technical challenge affecting the antitrust grilling in Washington, however.</p><p>Poor audio quality, flat-screen televisions going off, chief executives appearing together as thumbnails on a large screen - led to observers on Twitter and frustrated viewers to mock the virtual set-up.</p><p>The committee did not immediately comment on the issue.</p><p>'Worst zoom quiz night ever,' tweeted Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, sharing a screenshot of the executives shown in small side-by-side boxes.</p><p>It was not clear what happened with Amazon's virtual feed, according to a congressional aide with direct knowledge of the matter.</p><p>Amazon did not immediately comment on the issue.</p><p>The committee also took a 10-minute break to fix technical issues for those in the hearing room. </p><p>REPUBLICANS HIT FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE BOSSES WITH BIAS CLAIMS </p><p>Republican lawmakers on the panel tore into big technology firms at the start of Wednesday's House Judiciary Hearing on antitrust laws, claiming the platforms all exhibit anti-conservative bias.</p><p>'I'll just cut to the chase, big tech's out to get conservatives. That's not a suspicion, that's not a hunch. That's a fact,' Representative Jim Jordan asserted at the top of his opening remarks.</p><p>The Ohio Republican then launched into examples where conservative voices, accounts, posts and articles were either silenced or taken down - specifically airing his concern that these actions have been taken during an election year. </p><p>'We're 97 days before an election, and the power - as the previous chairman and ranking member have said - the power these companies have to impact what happens during an election, what American citizens get to see before their voting, is pretty darn important,' he said.</p><p>'If it doesn't end, there have to be consequences,' he continued of tech companies trying to influence elections and silence conservative voices.</p><p>He specifically pointed to Twitter censoring President Donald Trump's tweet last month when he asserted he would use 'force' if rioters attempted to establish an autonomous zone outside the White House. </p><p>'There will never be an Autonomous Zone' in Washington, D.C., as long as I'm your President,' Trump tweeted at the time, referring to an area in Seattle that was occupied by protesters. 'If they try they will be met with serious force!'</p><p>Jordan said: 'Former Facebook employees admit Facebook routinely suppressed conservative views.'</p><p>He also insisted that excuses from tech companies asserting that post removals from conservatives are 'just a glitch' are bogus.</p><p>'If I had a nickel for every time I hear, 'it's just a glitch,' I wouldn't be as wealthy as our witnesses but I'd be doing alright,' Jordan quipped.</p><p>Wisconsin Republican Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, the ranking member of the Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law Subcommittee, said: 'Conservatives are consumers too, and they need the protection of the antitrust laws.' </p><p>Sensenbrenner took a forceful, yet blas\u00e9 approach to the hearing as he prepared to retire at the end of his term this year. </p><p>Noticeably absent from the hearing was Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey - even though he and his platform face some of the most intense criticism from Trump and his allies.</p><p>Jordan assured that Republicans wanted Dorsey to testify as one of their witnesses at the hearing - but said their request was denied by Democrats who control the Judiciary Committee.</p><p>President Trump also railed against tech giants before departing the White House earlier Wednesday morning. </p><p>'There's no question that what the big tech companies are doing is very bad,' President Trump told reporters when he was specifically asked about the U.S. potentially banning TikTok. </p><p>                     ZUCKERBERG'S EMAILS ON INSTAGRAM AND WHATSAPP WHICH REVEAL PLAN TO BUY OUT COMPETITION - AND JOKING ABOUT BUYING GOOGLE</p><p> House Democrats revealed a series of internal communications between Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives. Some are to unnamed recipients but others showed him emailing the company's chief financial officer David Ebserman in 2012 before buying Instagram, and then before the purchase of WhatsApp</p><p>The president's comments came just two hours before the world's largest tech CEOs joined the virtual hearing before the House Judiciary Committee regarding competition and potential violations of antitrust laws. </p><p>'We're going to be watching the hearing today, very closely,' Trump said while his Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin stood over his right shoulder and Chief of Staff Mark Meadows over his left before departing the White House for Texas.</p><p>Trump is highly critical of technology companies, mainly Twitter and Facebook, claiming they silence and disproportionately censor and show bias against conservative voices and content. </p><p>AMAZON'S BEZOS IS SLAMMED FOR PLAN TO KILL COMPETITION AND 'ABUSING' THIRD-PARTY SELLERS</p><p>Bezos, in his first ever appearance before a congressional committee, defended Amazon's dealings with third-party sellers after a blistering attack from Rep. Cicilline.</p><p>Regulators in the U.S. and Europe have scrutinized Amazon's relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products. </p><p>'Isn't it true that small businesses have no real option but rely on Amazon to connect with customers to make online sales?' the committee chair asked.</p><p>'We've heard from third party sellers again and again during the course of our investigation that Amazon is the only game in town,' Cicilline continued in his grilling of Bezos, who also acquired The Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million. </p><p>But then Bezos admitted that he couldn't guarantee that Amazon had not accessed seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives have previously denied. </p><p>Cicilline detailed how one seller did well as a third-party on Amazon - but then the company launched its own version of their product but at a lower price.</p><p>He read the account of the seller who said: 'We called it Amazon heroin. Amazon strings you along for a while, because it feels so good to get that paycheck every week.' </p><p>Democrat Pramila Jayapal pressed Bezos on whether Amazon used data from third-party sellers in making sales decisions. In a previous hearing, an Amazon executive denied this under oath and was contradicted by a later news report.</p><p>Bezos answered cautiously that the company had a policy against such actions. 'If we found that somebody violated it, we would take action against them,' he said. </p><p>'We have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,' Bezos said in a response to a question from Jayapal. 'But I can't guarantee to you that that policy hasn't been violated.' </p><p> But he came under sustained assault on what happened between his company and one-time competitor Diapers.com, with emails revealing how executives said it had to be beaten on price 'at any cost.'</p><p>Diapers.com and Soap.com were run by Quidsi, before the Amazon made a $545 million deal in late 2010 to buy the startup.</p><p>The online retailer later shut down its Quidsi unit, which runs websites Diapers.com and Soap.com, due to a persistent lack of profitability there in 2017.</p><p>At the time an Amazon spokesperson: 'Quidsi has great brand expertise and they will continue to offer selection on Amazon.com; the software development team will focus on building technology for AmazonFresh.'</p><p>AmazonFresh lets people shop online for grocery store goods, including pet, baby and beauty supplies.</p><p>Quidsi co-founder Marc Lore went on to create another online commerce company, Jet.com, which was bought last year by Walmart for about $3 billion in a move aimed at competing with Amazon. </p><p>                     'MATCH PRICING, NO MATTER THE COST...THEY EXPECT TO LOSE MONEY, THIS WILL MAKE IT WORSE.' HOW AMAZON TOOK DOWN DIAPERS.COM REVEALED                   </p><p> Emails from 2010 show Amazon's internal plan to take out Quidsi, which ran diapers.com and soap.com - which it then acquired.</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: I DIDN'T KNOW FACEBOOK INFLATED VIDEO CLAIMS - WHICH LED TO JOURNALISTS BEING FIRED (BUT I WON'T APOLOGIZE)</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg denied knowing that Facebook's video stats were inflated for more than a year during Wednesday's hearing. </p><p>He had been asked about the scandal by Nadler, who tore into the Facebook boss because 'based on these metrics, news publishers fired hundreds of journalists, choosing instead to boost their video division.' </p><p>'Congressman, no I did not and we regret that mistake and we have put in place a lot of other measures since then,' Zuckerberg said. </p><p>Nadler gave Zuckerberg the opportunity to apologize. </p><p>'What do you have to say to the journalists who lost their jobs due to Facebook's deception?'</p><p>Zuckerberg didn't, instead replying, 'Congressman I disagree with that characterization and also your description of what ...'</p><p>Zuckerberg didn't finish his statement as Nadler snapped, 'OK, reclaiming my time.' </p><p>In October 2018, advertisers filed a complaint in California federal court, which was part of a 2016 lawsuit against the tech giant. </p><p>The filing, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal, said that Facebook knew there was a problem in how the company measured viewership of videos on the platform for more than a year before publicly disclosing the issue in 2016. </p><p>Plaintiffs in the lawsuit called this fraud alleging Facebook knew of the irregularities by January 2015 and understood the impact within a few months, though didn't disclose the issue for more than a year. </p><p>The 2018 filing was based upon some 80,000 internal documents from the tech company obtained through the lawsuit. </p><p>Nadler opened up this particular bit of questioning with Zuckerberg by bringing up the stakes. </p><p>'The news and journalism industry in this country are in economic free-fall, over 200 counties in America no longer have a local newspaper and tens of thousands of journalists have been laid off in recent years,' the New York Democrat began. </p><p>The reason journalism is in free-fall is that Google and Facebook now capture the vast majority of digital ad revenue,' he continued. 'Although news publishers produce valuable content, it is Google and Facebook that increasingly profit off that content.' </p><p>Nadler then accused Google and Facebook of practicing 'anti-competitive conduct,' which was the broader topic of the Wednesday hearing in the subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law. </p><p>Nadler asked Zuckerberg if he realized the harm he caused journalists around the U.S. </p><p>Zuckerberg didn't answer questions directly about the media industry. </p><p>'Congressman, certainly I know how important it is that the metrics that we report are accurate and we've put in place additional measures to make sure we can audit those,' the Facebook boss said. </p><p>And Google was also attacked on its handling of media advertising, with Jayapal detailing how it operates a market in ads and accusing it of 'insider trading' by acting on the buy and sell sides of media advertising, and running the exchange system. </p><p>'YOU STOLE YELP'S REVIEWS': GOOGLE IN THE CROSSHAIRS</p><p> Cicilline alleged Google stole reviews from the company Yelp Inc and said Google threatened to delist the company from search results if it objected. </p><p>'Why does Google steal content from other businesses?' he said.</p><p>'The evidence we collected showed Google stole restaurant reviews from Yelp to bootstrap its own local search business. Do you know how Google responded when Yelp asked you to stop stealing their reviews? They threatened to delist them.' </p><p>Yelp raised that issue about a decade ago before before Pichai became CEO in 2015.</p><p>Pichai responded that he would want to know the specifics of the accusation. 'We conduct ourselves to the highest standards,' he added, disagreeing with the characterization that Google steals content from other businesses to keep users on its own services. </p><p>Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline's attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day. </p><p>He said this is part of its effort to keep them coming back instead of defecting to a rival service, such as Microsoft's Bing.</p><p>'PUT YOUR MASK ON!' REPS SQUABBLE AMID PARTISAN SHOUTING MATCH </p><p>Tensions between Jordan and the subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline started early, when the Republican requested unanimous consent</p><p>Before yielding back to Cicilline, Jordan requested that his Republican colleague Rep. Mike Johnson, who is the ranking member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties, be given time to speak.</p><p>A Democratic member objected and Cicilline rejected the request for Johnson to speak - which goes against usual precedent observed at subcommittee hearings.</p><p>Jordan was not pleased.</p><p>'Why are we not allowing - it is customary -' he began, but was cut off by Ciclline.</p><p>'This has never happened,' Jordan spoke over the chairman.</p><p>'Mr. Jordan, I have the time,' Cicilline shot back as he attempted to introduce the witnesses for the hearing.</p><p>'We're talking about people's liberties here,' Jordan argued back, but Ciclline ignored him and continued in the hearing's procedures.</p><p>'Put your mask on!' another member could be heard yelling at Jordan.</p><p>Members are required to wear masks when they are not questioning witnesses.</p><p>'I'm going to remind members of the committee, unless you are speaking, our rules require you to wear a mask, according to the attending physician,' Cicillone said in another interruption of his introduction.</p><p>Jordan, who had already put on a face covering, indicated he had done so.</p><p>Cicilline clarified he was 'speaking about another member of this committee,' likely referencing Florida Republican Representative William Gregory Steube, who had his bandana mulled below his mouth.</p><p>About an hour into the hearing, the issues of masks came up again when Jordan got into a squabble with Pennsylvania Representative Mary Scanion.</p><p>'I'd like to redirect your attention to antitrust law rather than fringe conspiracy theories,' she said of Jordan's line of questioning to the witnesses, then began to ask a question of Bezos.</p><p>'Mr. Chairman we have the email, there is no fringe -' Jordan was cut off by a myriad of shouting from Democrats.</p><p>Cicilline shouted, 'Excuse me, it's not your time!,' while repeatedly pounding his gavel. 'Please be respectful.'</p><p>Jordan continued talking through the cross speak.</p><p>'Put your mask on!' Rep. Raskin could be heard yelling, along with some other talk about facial coverings.</p><p>'When someone comes after my motives for asking questions, I get a chance to respond,' Jordan lamented.</p><p>Cicilline ignored the Ohio Republican and yielded back to Rep. Scanion. </p><p>The four CEO's opening remarks, which were released Tuesday ahead of Wednesday's hearing, portrays four chief executives who are looking over their shoulders at competitors who could render them obsolete.</p><p>The testimony before the antitrust panel comes as they investigate how these businesses' practices and data gathering have hurt smaller rivals.</p><p>Bezos, in a lengthy 4,600-word statement, highlighted Amazon's contribution to the economy and how it has invested $270 billion in the U.S. over the last decade and created more than 700,000 'indirect' jobs. </p><p>His statement emphasizes the company's dedication to getting its products to customers - which he says are jobs that cannot be outsourced 'to China or anywhere else'. </p><p>'To fulfill our promises to customers in this country, we need American workers to get products to American customers. When customers shop on Amazon, they are helping to create jobs in their local communities,' he says.</p><p>He adds that Amazon hired an additional 175,000 employees during the coronavirus pandemic, including many who were laid off from other jobs. </p><p>Bezos includes personal information about his life before becoming a billionaire and how he was raised by a teen mother and Cuban immigrant adoptive father. </p><p>'It's not a coincidence that Amazon was born in this country,' he says. </p><p>'We nurture entrepreneurs and start-ups with stable rule of law, the finest university system in the world, the freedom of democracy, and a deeply accepted culture of risk-taking.'</p><p>Zuckerberg also touched on the theme of the American success story, arguing that Facebook grew into a billion-dollar business 'the American way, by starting out with nothing and providing products that people find valuable. </p><p>'Although people around the world use our products, Facebook is a proudly American company. We believe in values - democracy, competition, inclusion and free expression - that the American economy was built on,' he says. </p><p>He also argues Facebook faces intense competition from large rivals adding: 'We compete against the companies appearing at this hearing, plus many others that sell advertising and connect people. We also compete globally, including against companies that have access to markets that we aren't in.'</p><p>Zuckerberg will also defend Facebook's acquisitions by saying the social-media platform helped companies like WhatsApp and Instagram grow. Both are owned by Facebook.</p><p>He plans to remind lawmakers of the competitive threat U.S. tech companies face from China, saying the Asian country is building its 'own version of the internet focused on very different ideas, and they are exporting their vision to other countries.'</p><p>The billionaire tech exec also renewed Facebook's call for government regulation in areas such as harmful content in social media, election integrity, and privacy - areas where the company has been criticized. </p><p>In his prepared remarks released ahead of the hearing, Pichai argued that search - which Google dominates by most metrics - was broader than just typing a query into Google, and said he remained concerned about being relevant as people turn to Twitter, Pinterest or other websites for information.</p><p>'We know Google's continued success is not guaranteed. Google operates in highly competitive and dynamic global markets, in which prices are free or falling, and products are constantly improving,' Pichai said.</p><p>Apple's Tim Cook will tell the committee the company 'does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business. That is not just true for iPhone, it is true for any product category.'</p><p>He will argue the company's 'commissions are comparable to or lower than commissions charged by the majority of our competitors. And they are vastly lower than the 50 to 70 percent that software developers paid to distribute their work before we launched the App Store.' </p><p>The high-profile hearing was originally set for Monday but was postponed because Representative John Lewis will be lying in state until Wednesday.</p><p>The panel will question the companies as part of its sweeping probe into whether they actively work to harm and eliminate smaller rivals, while not always making the best choices for their customers. </p><p>It will be a key moment in the growing backlash against Big Tech in the United States and is likely to set up a face-off between the executives and skeptical lawmakers from both parties. </p><p>Many tech lobbying groups and industry critics say the hearing is unlikely to address core antitrust issues or bring new information to the table, however.</p><p>'There's not much tech CEOs can do to appease anti-tech critics... this hearing is not about finding truth but creating news stories,' said Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel at industry lobby group NetChoice. </p><p>The antitrust subcommittee is expected to release a report within weeks on their investigation into the companies.</p><p>The U.S. Justice Department is also probing the big four tech platforms. Facebook and Amazon are also facing inquiries by the Federal Trade Commission, while U.S. states attorneys general are looking at Google and Facebook.</p><p>READ THE TECH CEOS' OPENING STATEMENTS </p><p>AMAZON'S BEZOS: I'M LIVING THE AMERICAN DREAM AND WE'RE MAKING IT COME TRUE FOR MILLIONS OF OTHERS                   </p><p> Thank you, Chairman Cicilline, Ranking Member Sensenbrenner, and members of the Subcommittee. </p><p>I'm Jeff Bezos. I founded Amazon 26 years ago with the long-term mission of making it Earth's most customer-centric company. </p><p>My mom, Jackie, had me when she was a 17-year-old high school student in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p><p> Being pregnant in high school was not popular in Albuquerque in 1964. It was difficult for her. When they tried to kick her out of school, my grandfather went to bat for her. </p><p>After some negotiation, the principal said, 'OK, she can stay and finish high school, but she can't do any extracurricular activities, and she can't have a locker.' </p><p>My grandfather took the deal, and my mother finished high school, though she wasn't allowed to walk across the stage with her classmates to get her diploma.</p><p>Determined to keep up with her education, she enrolled in night school, picking classes led by professors who would let her bring an infant to class. She would show up with two duffel bags-one full of textbooks, and one packed with diapers, bottles, and anything that would keep me interested and quiet for a few minutes.</p><p>My dad's name is Miguel. He adopted me when I was four years old. He was 16 when he came to the United States from Cuba as part of Operation Pedro Pan, shortly after Castro took over. </p><p>My dad arrived in America alone. His parents felt he'd be safer here. His mom imagined America would be cold, so she made him a jacket sewn entirely out of cleaning cloths, the only material they had on hand. </p><p>We still have that jacket; it hangs in my parents' dining room. My dad spent two weeks at Camp Matecumbe, a refugee center in Florida, before being moved to a Catholic mission in Wilmington, Delaware. </p><p>He was lucky to get to the mission, but even so, he didn't speak English and didn't have an easy path. </p><p>What he did have was a lot of grit and determination. He received a scholarship to college in Albuquerque, which is where he met my mom. </p><p>You get different gifts in life, and one of my great gifts is my mom and dad. They have been incredible role models for me and my siblings our entire lives. </p><p>You learn different things from your grandparents than you do from your parents, and I had the opportunity to spend my summers from ages four to 16 on my grandparents' ranch in Texas. </p><p>My grandfather was a civil servant and a rancher-he worked on space technology and missile defense systems in the 1950s and '60s for the Atomic Energy Commission - and he was self-reliant and resourceful. </p><p>When you're in the middle of nowhere, you don't pick up a phone and call somebody when something breaks. You fix it yourself.</p><p>As a kid, I got to see him solve many seemingly unsolvable problems himself, whether he was restoring a broken-down Caterpillar bulldozer or doing his own veterinary work. </p><p>He taught me that you can take on hard problems. When you have a setback, you get back up and try again. You can invent your way to a better place. </p><p>I took these lessons to heart as a teenager, and became a garage inventor. I invented an automatic gate closer out of cement-filled tires, a solar cooker out of an umbrella and tinfoil, and alarms made from baking pans to entrap my siblings.</p><p> The concept for Amazon came to me in 1994.</p><p>The idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles - something that simply couldn't exist in the physical world - was exciting to me.</p><p>At the time, I was working at an investment firm in New York City. When I told my boss I was leaving, he took me on a long walk in Central Park. </p><p>After a lot of listening, he finally said, 'You know what, Jeff, I think this is a good idea, but it would be a better idea for somebody who didn't already have a good job.' </p><p>He convinced me to think about it for two days before making a final decision. </p><p>It was a decision I made with my heart and not my head. When I'm 80 and reflecting back, I want to have minimized the number of regrets that I have in my life. </p><p>And most of our regrets are acts of omission - the things we didn't try, the paths untraveled. Those are the things that haunt us. </p><p>And I decided that if I didn't at least give it my best shot, I was going to regret not trying to participate in this thing called the internet that I thought was going to be a big deal. </p><p>The initial start-up capital for Amazon.com came primarily from my parents, who invested a large fraction of their life savings in something they didn't understand. </p><p>They weren't making a bet on Amazon or the concept of a bookstore on the internet. They were making a bet on their son.</p><p>I told them that I thought there was a 70% chance they would lose their investment, and they did it anyway. </p><p>It took more than 50 meetings for me to raise $1 million from investors, and over the course of all those meetings, the most common question was, 'What's the internet?' </p><p>Unlike many other countries around the world, this great nation we live in supports and does not stigmatize entrepreneurial risk-taking.</p><p>I walked away from a steady job into a Seattle garage to found my startup, fully understanding that it might not work.</p><p> It feels like just yesterday I was driving the packages to the post office myself, dreaming that one day we might be able to afford a forklift. </p><p>Amazon's success was anything but preordained. Investing in Amazon early on was a very risky proposition. From our founding through the end of 2001, our business had cumulative losses of nearly $3 billion, and we did not have a profitable quarter until the fourth quarter of that year.</p><p>Smart analysts predicted Barnes &amp; Noble would steamroll us, and branded us 'Amazon.toast.'</p><p>In 1999, after we'd been in business for nearly five years, Barron's headlined a story about our impending demise 'Amazon.bomb.' </p><p>My annual shareholder letter for 2000 started with a one word sentence: 'Ouch.' </p><p>At the pinnacle of the internet bubble our stock price peaked at $116, and then after the bubble burst our stock went down to $6. Experts and pundits thought we were going out of business.</p><p> It took a lot of smart people with a willingness to take a risk with me, and a willingness to stick to our convictions, for Amazon to survive and ultimately to succeed. And it wasn't just those early years.</p><p>In addition to good luck and great people, we have been able to succeed as a company only because we have continued to take big risks. To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it's going to work, it's not an experiment. </p><p>Outsized returns come from betting against conventional wisdom, but conventional wisdom is usually right. </p><p>A lot of observers characterized Amazon Web Services as a risky distraction when we started. 'What does selling compute and storage have to do with selling books?' they wondered. </p><p>No one asked for AWS. It turned out the world was ready and hungry for cloud computing but didn't know it yet. </p><p>We were right about AWS, but the truth is we've also taken plenty of risks that didn't pan out. </p><p>In fact, Amazon has made billions of dollars of failures. Failure inevitably comes along with invention and risk-taking, which is why we try to make Amazon the best place in the world to fail.</p><p>Since our founding, we have strived to maintain a 'Day One' mentality at the company. By that I mean approaching everything we do with the energy and entrepreneurial spirit of Day One.</p><p>Even though Amazon is a large company, I have always believed that if we commit ourselves to maintaining a Day One mentality as a critical part of our DNA, we can have both the scope and capabilities of a large company and the spirit and heart of a small one. </p><p>In my view, obsessive customer focus is by far the best way to achieve and maintain Day One vitality. </p><p>Why? Because customers are always beautifully, wonderfully dissatisfied, even when they report being happy and business is great.</p><p>Even when they don't yet know it, customers want something better, and a constant desire to delight customers drives us to constantly invent on their behalf. </p><p>As a result, by focusing obsessively on customers, we are internally driven to improve our services, add benefits and features, invent new products, lower prices, and speed up shipping times - before we have to. </p><p>No customer ever asked Amazon to create the Prime membership program, but it sure turns out they wanted it.</p><p>And I could give you many such examples. Not every business takes this customer-first approach, but we do, and it's our greatest strength. </p><p>Customer trust is hard to win and easy to lose. When you let customers make your business what it is, then they will be loyal to you-right up to the second that someone else offers them better service. </p><p>We know that customers are perceptive and smart. We take as an article of faith that customers will notice when we work hard to do the right thing, and that by doing so again and again, we will earn trust. </p><p>You earn trust slowly, over time, by doing hard things well- delivering on time; offering everyday low prices; making promises and keeping them; making principled decisions, even when they're unpopular; and giving customers more time to spend with their families by inventing more convenient ways of shopping, reading, and automating their homes. </p><p>As I have said since my first shareholder letter in 1997, we make decisions based on the long-term value we create as we invent to meet customer needs.</p><p>When we're criticized for those choices, we listen and look at ourselves in the mirror. </p><p>When we think our critics are right, we change. When we make mistakes, we apologize. </p><p>But when you look in the mirror, assess the criticism, and still believe you're doing the right thing, no force in the world should be able to move you.</p><p>Fortunately, our approach is working. Eighty percent of Americans have a favorable impression of Amazon overall, according to leading independent polls. </p><p>Who do Americans trust more than Amazon 'to do the right thing?' </p><p>Only their primary physicians and the military, according to a January 2020 Morning Consult survey. </p><p>Researchers at Georgetown and New York University found in 2018 that Amazon trailed only the military among all respondents to a survey on institutional and brand trust. </p><p>Among Republicans, we trailed only the military and local police; among Democrats, we were at the top, leading every branch of government, universities, and the press. </p><p>In Fortune's 2020 rankings of the World's Most Admired Companies, we came in second place (Apple was #1). We are grateful that customers notice the hard work we do on their behalf, and that they reward us with their trust. </p><p>Working to earn and keep that trust is the single biggest driver of Amazon's Day One culture. </p><p>The company most of you know as Amazon is the one that sends you your online orders in the brown boxes with the smile on the side. </p><p>That's where we started, and retail remains our largest business by far, accounting for over 80% of our total revenue. The very nature of that business is getting products to customers. </p><p>Those operations need to be close to customers, and we can't outsource these jobs to China or anywhere else. </p><p>To fulfill our promises to customers in this country, we need American workers to get products to American customers. </p><p>When customers shop on Amazon, they are helping to create jobs in their local communities. </p><p>As a result, Amazon directly employs a million people, many of them entry-level and paid by the hour. </p><p>We don't just employ highly educated computer scientists and MBAs in Seattle and Silicon Valley. </p><p>We hire and train hundreds of thousands of people in states across the country such as West Virginia, Tennessee, Kansas, and Idaho.</p><p>These employees are package stowers, mechanics, and plant managers. For many, it's their first job. </p><p>For some, these jobs are a stepping stone to other careers, and we are proud to help them with that. We are spending more than $700 million to give more than 100,000 Amazon employees access to training programs in fields such as healthcare, transportation, machine learning, and cloud computing. </p><p>That program is called Career Choice, and we pay 95% of tuition and fees toward a certificate or diploma for in-demand, high-paying fields, regardless of whether it's relevant to a career at Amazon. </p><p>Patricia Soto, one of our associates, is a Career Choice success story. Patricia always wanted to pursue a career in the medical field to help care for others, but with only a high school diploma and facing the costs of post-secondary education, she wasn't sure she'd be able to accomplish that goal. </p><p>After earning her medical certification through Career Choice, Patricia left Amazon to start her new career as a medical assistant at Sutter Gould Medical Foundation, supporting a pulmonary medicine doctor. </p><p>Career Choice has given Patricia and so many others a shot at a second career that once seemed out of reach. </p><p>Amazon has invested more than $270 billion in the U.S. over the last decade. </p><p>Beyond our own workforce, Amazon's investments have created nearly 700,000 indirect jobs in fields like construction, building services, and hospitality. </p><p>Our hiring and investments have brought muchneeded jobs and added hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity to areas like Fall River, Massachusetts, California's Inland Empire, and Rust Belt states like Ohio. </p><p>During the COVID-19 crisis, we hired an additional 175,000 employees, including many laid off from other jobs during the economic shutdown. </p><p>We spent more than $4 billion in the second quarter alone to get essential products to customers and keep our employees safe during the COVID-19 crisis. </p><p>And a dedicated team of Amazon employees from across the company has created a program to regularly test our workers for COVID-19. We look forward to sharing our learnings with other interested companies and government partners.</p><p>The global retail market we compete in is strikingly large and extraordinarily competitive. </p><p>Amazon accounts for less than 1% of the $25 trillion global retail market and less than 4% of retail in the U.S. </p><p>Unlike industries that are winner-take-all, there's room in retail for many winners. </p><p>For example, more than 80 retailers in the U.S. alone earn over $1 billion in annual revenue. </p><p>Like any retailer, we know that the success of our store depends entirely on customers' satisfaction with their experience in our store. </p><p>Every day, Amazon competes against large, established players like Target, Costco, Kroger, and, of course, Walmart -a company more than twice Amazon's size. </p><p>And while we have always focused on producing a great customer experience for retail sales done primarily online, sales initiated online are now an even larger growth area for other stores. Walmart's online sales grew 74% in the first quarter. </p><p>And customers are increasingly flocking to services invented by other stores that Amazon still can't match at the scale of other large companies, like curbside pickup and in-store returns.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has put a spotlight on these trends, which have been growing for years.</p><p>In recent months, curbside pickup of online orders has increased over 200%, in part due to COVID19 concerns. </p><p>We also face new competition from the likes of Shopify and Instacart-companies that enable traditionally physical stores to put up a full online store almost instantaneously and to deliver products directly to customers in new and innovative ways-and a growing list of omnichannel business models.</p><p>Like almost every other segment of our economy, technology is used everywhere in retail and has only made retail more competitive, whether online, in physical stores, or in the various combinations of the two that make up most stores today. </p><p>And we and all other stores are acutely aware that, regardless of how the best features of 'online' and 'physical' stores are combined, we are all competing for and serving the same customers. </p><p>The range of retail competitors and related services is constantly changing, and the only real constant in retail is customers' desire for lower prices, better selection, and convenience. </p><p>It's also important to understand that Amazon's success depends overwhelmingly on the success of the thousands of small and medium-sized businesses that also sell their products in Amazon's stores. </p><p>Back in 1999, we took what at the time was the unprecedented step of welcoming third-party sellers into our stores and enabling them to offer their products right alongside our own. </p><p>Internally, this was extremely controversial, with many disagreeing and some predicting this would be the beginning of a long, losing battle. </p><p>We didn't have to invite third-party sellers into the store. We could have kept this valuable real estate for ourselves. </p><p>But we committed to the idea that over the long term it would increase selection for customers, and that more satisfied customers would be great for both third-party sellers and for Amazon. </p><p>And that's what happened. Within a year of adding those sellers, third-party sales accounted for 5% of unit sales, and it quickly became clear that customers loved the convenience of being able to shop for the best products and to see prices from different sellers all in the same store. </p><p>These small and medium-sized third-party businesses now add significantly more product selection to Amazon's stores than Amazon's own retail operation. </p><p>Third-party sales now account for approximately 60% of physical product sales on Amazon, and those sales are growing faster than Amazon's own retail sales.</p><p>We guessed that it wasn't a zero sum game. And we were right - the whole pie did grow, third-party sellers did very well and are growing fast, and that has been great for customers and for Amazon. </p><p>There are now 1.7 million small and medium-sized businesses around the world selling in Amazon's stores. More than 200,000 entrepreneurs worldwide surpassed $100,000 in sales in our stores in 2019. </p><p>On top of that, we estimate that third-party businesses selling in Amazon's stores have created over 2.2 million new jobs around the world. One of those sellers is Sherri Yukel, who wanted to change careers to be home more for her children. </p><p>She started handcrafting gifts and party supplies for friends as a hobby, and eventually began selling her products on Amazon. Today, Sherri's company employs nearly 80 people and has a global customer base. </p><p>Another is Christine Krogue, a stay-at-home mother of five in Salt Lake City. Christine started a business selling baby clothes through her own website before taking a chance on Amazon.</p><p>She has since seen her sales more than double, and she's been able to expand her product line and hire a team of part-time employees. Selling on Amazon has allowed Sherri and Christine to grow their own businesses and satisfy customers on their own terms. </p><p>And it is striking to remember how recent all of this is. We did not start out as the largest marketplace -eBay was many times our size. </p><p>It was only by focusing on supporting sellers and giving them the best tools we could invent that we were able to succeed and eventually surpass eBay. </p><p>One such tool is Fulfillment by Amazon, which enables our third-party sellers to stow their inventory in our fulfillment centers, and we take on all logistics, customer service, and product returns. </p><p>By dramatically simplifying all of those challenging aspects of the selling experience in a cost-effective way, we have helped many thousands of sellers grow their businesses on Amazon. </p><p>Our success may help explain the wide proliferation of marketplaces of all types and sizes around the world.</p><p>This includes U.S. companies like Walmart, eBay, Etsy, and Target, as well as retailers based overseas but selling globally, such as Alibaba and Rakuten. </p><p>These marketplaces further intensify competition within retail. The trust customers put in us every day has allowed Amazon to create more jobs in the United States over the past decade than any other company - hundreds of thousands of jobs across 42 states. </p><p>Amazon employees make a minimum of $15 an hour, more than double the federal minimum wage (which we have urged Congress to increase). We've challenged other large retailers to match our $15 minimum wage. </p><p>Target did so recently, and just last week so did Best Buy. We welcome them, and they remain the only ones to have done so. </p><p>We do not skimp on benefits, either. Our full-time hourly employees receive the same benefits as our salaried headquarters employees, including comprehensive health insurance starting on the first day of employment, a 401(k) retirement plan, and parental leave, including 20 weeks of paid maternity leave. </p><p>I encourage you to benchmark our pay and benefits against any of our retail competitors.</p><p>More than 80% of Amazon shares are owned by outsiders, and over the last 26 years - starting from zero - we've created more than $1 trillion of wealth for those outside shareholders. </p><p>Who are those shareowners? They are pension funds: fire, police, and school teacher pension funds. </p><p>Others are 401(k)s-mutual funds that own pieces of Amazon. University endowments, too, and the list goes on.</p><p>Many people will retire better because of the wealth we've created for so many, and we're enormously proud of this. </p><p>At Amazon, customer obsession has made us what we are, and allowed us to do ever greater things.</p><p>I know what Amazon could do when we were 10 people. I know what we could do when we were 1,000 people, and when we were 10,000 people. And I know what we can do today when we're nearly a million. </p><p>I love garage entrepreneurs-I was one.</p><p>But, just like the world needs small companies, it also needs large ones. There are things small companies simply can't do.</p><p>I don't care how good an entrepreneur you are, you're not going to build an all-fiber Boeing 787 in your garage. </p><p>Our scale allows us to make a meaningful impact on important societal issues. </p><p>The Climate Pledge is a commitment made by Amazon and joined by other companies to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement 10 years early and be net zero carbon by 2040. </p><p>We plan to meet the pledge, in part, by purchasing 100,000 electric delivery vans from Rivian - a Michigan-based producer of electric vehicles. </p><p>Amazon aims to have 10,000 of Rivian's new electric vans on the road as early as 2022, and all 100,000 vehicles on the road by 2030. </p><p>Globally, Amazon operates 91 solar and wind projects that have the capacity to generate over 2,900 MW and deliver more than 7.6 million MWh of energy annually - enough to power more than 680,000 U.S. homes. </p><p>Amazon is also investing $100 million in global reforestation projects through the Right Now Climate Fund, including $10 million Amazon committed in April to conserve, restore, and support sustainable forestry, wildlife and nature-based solutions across the Appalachian Mountains-funding two innovative projects in collaboration with The Nature Conservancy. </p><p>Four global companies-Verizon, Reckitt Benckiser, Infosys, and Oak View Group-recently signed The Climate Pledge, and we continue to encourage others to join us in this fight.</p><p>Together, we will use our size and scale to address the climate crisis right away.</p><p>And last month, Amazon introduced The Climate Pledge Fund, started with $2 billion in funding from Amazon. </p><p>The Fund will support the development of sustainable technologies and services that in turn will enable Amazon and other companies to meet The Climate Pledge. </p><p>The Fund will invest in visionary entrepreneurs and innovators who are building products and services to help companies reduce their carbon impact and operate more sustainably. </p><p>We recently opened the largest homeless shelter in Washington state-and it's located inside one of our newest headquarters buildings in downtown Seattle. </p><p>The shelter is for Mary's Place, an incredible Seattle-based nonprofit. </p><p>The shelter, part of Amazon's $100 million investment in Mary's Place, spans eight floors and can accommodate up to 200 family members each night. It has its own health clinic and provides critical tools and services to help families fighting homelessness get back on their feet. </p><p>And there is dedicated space for Amazon to provide weekly pro-bono legal clinics offering counsel on credit and debt issues, personal injury, housing and tenant rights. </p><p>Since 2018, Amazon's legal team has supported hundreds of Mary's Place guests and volunteered more than 1,000 pro-bono hours. </p><p>Amazon Future Engineer is a global childhood-to-career program designed to inspire, educate, and prepare thousands of children and young adults from underrepresented and underserved communities to pursue a computer science career. </p><p>The program funds computer science coursework and professional teacher development for hundreds of elementary schools, introductory and AP Computer Science classes for more than 2,000 schools in underserved communities across the country, and 100 four-year, $40,000 college scholarships to computer science students from low-income backgrounds. </p><p>Those scholarship recipients also receive guaranteed internships at Amazon. </p><p>There is a diversity pipeline problem in tech, and this has an outsized impact on the Black community. </p><p>We want to invest in building out the next generation of technical talent for the industry and expanding the opportunities for underrepresented minorities. </p><p>We also want to accelerate this change right now. To find the best talent for technical and non-technical roles, we actively partner with historically Black colleges and universities on our recruiting, internship, and upskilling initiatives. </p><p>Let me close by saying that I believe Amazon should be scrutinized. </p><p>We should scrutinize all large institutions, whether they're companies, government agencies, or non-profits. Our responsibility is to make sure we pass such scrutiny with flying colors. </p><p>It's not a coincidence that Amazon was born in this country. More than any other place on Earth, new companies can start, grow, and thrive here in the U.S. </p><p>Our country embraces resourcefulness and self-reliance, and it embraces builders who start from scratch. </p><p>We nurture entrepreneurs and start-ups with stable rule of law, the finest university system in the world, the freedom of democracy, and a deeply accepted culture of risk-taking. </p><p>Of course, this great nation of ours is far from perfect. Even as we remember Congressman John Lewis and honor his legacy, we're in the middle of a much-needed race reckoning. </p><p>We also face the challenges of climate change and income inequality, and we're stumbling through the crisis of a global pandemic. </p><p>Still, the rest of the world would love even the tiniest sip of the elixir we have here in the U.S. </p><p>Immigrants like my dad see what a treasure this country is-they have perspective and can often see it even more clearly than those of us who were lucky enough to be born here. </p><p>It's still Day One for this country, and even in the face of today's humbling challenges, I have never been more optimistic about our future. </p><p>I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today and am happy to take your questions. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-64816814</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G4-39W1-F021-62MY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9054\"/><timeReceived>6:34 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

If you want to hear the other side, change the channel.</p><p>Let listeners and viewers just choose which message and facts work for them. That is, after all, the theory of the First Amendment: in a marketplace of ideas truth will surface. We don't need the government to be chat room moderator.</p><p>But now, as the power of the Internet has ballooned, and as the egregious breaches of and dangers presented by Facebook, Twitter and Google increase daily, the cries for rules, regulations and the strong hand of a central government have increased.</p><p>\"The time has arrived for the United States to create its own regulatory infrastructure - a Data Protection Authority,\" writes Franklin Foer, the former editor of Slate magazine and a Silicon Valley veteran.</p><p>As much as I champion a regulated business marketplace and the need for government to stop the worst corporate abuses, Foer's logic doesn't work when it comes to media, even if they are big and bad at times. So here is my handy dandy list of why we should not regulate:</p><p>The Little Dutch Boy Syndrome</p><p>In an attempt to stem the flood of water that might overwhelm his country, The Little Dutch boy tried to plug leaks in a dam. He failed, as we would in trying to censor or regulate the 1.5 billion websites that sometimes seem to bring more evil than good. The days of control of content are over. Shut 'em down in one place, they pop up elsewhere. It is futile.</p><p>Let the marketplace of ideas work</p><p>Those guys who created our Constitution more than 225 years ago wanted to avoid government making rules to control our speech and press. Social media and the Internet are the marketplace now - and for a long time to come - and government can't touch the content. The Framers' idea was the government would not have to control speech. Other speakers would simply rebut wrongheaded or false ideas and they would flee in disgrace.</p><p>I know, I know. It's more complex today than a simple speaker in a town square or a lonely pamphleteer in the village. But the concept still works. And there are misdeeds we can go after because....</p><p>You already have the tools</p><p>If you are really worried about the might - and abuse - of the media, just look at the laws we already have. You can prosecute people for inciting violence; lock up pornographers if they dabble in kiddie porn; shut down those who truly threaten national security.</p><p>Not enough? You can sue for invasion of privacy (Hey Zuckerberg, are you still leering in on my conversations?) and for libel if someone defames your character or ruins your business with falsehoods. When someone steals your music, sue for copyright violation. The tools are there.</p><p>Did You Forget About the Constitution?</p><p>Despite Donald Trump's consistent trampling on the spirit of free speech, the 45 words of the First Amendment do stop the central authorities from trying to silence the opposition. But they also prevent us from going after what some see as the biggest menace of the day: hate speech.</p><p>The Nazis used to put out an occasional tattered newsletter with little money to even mail it. Now they have a regular \"news\" website where they can gather, rant and preach their poison. But the Supreme Court has been pretty clear: The government has no business regulating speech that even most of us agree is repulsive. (As if we could in the end agree on what speech that would include anyway. Just the Nazis? Maybe the KKK? Where does that slippery slope end anyway?)</p><p>The antidote is counter speech, more speech, an outing of the white nationalists and a loud and persistent shouting back: Your brand of thinking is just not welcome here! And we might even put that joker back in the box if the person at the top of our government were not so welcoming to \"good people\" on that side of the aisle.</p><p>How about going after monopolies?</p><p>There are some regulations we might use, however, if only to exert pressure on the Facebook-Amazon cabal to do the right thing. Congress has begun hearings on whether the social media companies are violating antitrust laws. You remember those archaic laws that prevent a company from gobbling up opposition and controlling the market. And they are especially important when it comes to media companies so they don't monopolize who we get to hear from and ensure a multitude of tongues continues to fill our universe.</p><p>\"The time has come to consider the consequences of the monopolies,\" Foer writes - the monopolies the Europeans call GAFA (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon).</p><p>What might keep the government off the backs of the big tech companies is if they do what they are beginning to realize they must do: take responsibility for their content. Stop lying that you're just an impartial platform for other people's voices and do what responsible media have always done: filter their speakers.</p><p>Keep out the Russian bots, of course; don't let suicide attempts go live; get rid of fake accounts; keep hatemongers off your channels; stop selling me to every advertiser.</p><p>Stop pretending you are not the gatekeeper of the largest media market ever assembled. Do what gatekeepers must do: filter out the poison. By the way, Twitter, you could boot the President off your channel if he keeps poking at a civil war possibility. You are private media and can do what government isn't allowed: control your messages.</p><p>Don't avoid doing it because you are largely untouchable. Do it because the democracy needs your help. Take responsibility. You all promise to \"do no harm.\" Be better than that: do some good. Become responsible editors not neutral carriers of poison. Self-regulate and we will leave you alone.</p><p>Rob Miraldi's writings on the First Amendment have won numerous state and national awards. He teaches journalism at SUNY Paltz.

Six years later, Mexico already has a legal framework in this regard, it is working on its implementation process, which is estimated to end in 2020. </p><p><br/> In this context, the National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV) has identified more than 500 platforms operating in Mexico, of which 201 operate under the figures recognized by the law to Regulate Financial Technology Institutions, or the Fintech Law. To date, two platforms have submitted their application to operate under the law and there are 10 more that have drafts of their application. <br/> In an interview, David Esa\u00fa L\u00f3pez Campos, technical vice president of the CNBV, spoke about the vision of this government regarding the law that has put the country as one of the leaders in the world in terms of fintech regulations, where, for the authority This regulation has two basic aspects: taking care of the resources of the users and the correct development of the Mexican financial system. <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">-It has been almost a year since the enactment of the law, what is the progress of its implementation?</emphasis><br/> The law regulates several issues, mainly to financial technology institutions (ITF), which are collective financing (crowdfunding) and electronic payment funds. In that matter, we have practically an advance of 85% of implementation of the law. What comes in the short term is the joint regulation issued by the CNBV with the Bank of Mexico (Banxico) on issues of cybersecurity, contracting of third parties, the use of electronic means, that is, how they authenticate clients to make transactions, transfers and others, and business continuity plan. In addition, we are working on other regulations related to the fintech topic, mainly in the digital onboarding part (remote opening of financial products and services), because we believe that it is something essential for the fintech, then it is another project that has been cooking and will come out in the next months. <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">-In September, the deadline for the fintechs contemplated by the law to request their authorization before the CNBV expires. How is the authorization process going and how many applications have they received?</emphasis><br/> It is a completely new sector, which is just becoming familiar with regulation, what we as CNBV do is have a full approach. We have meetings, at least with one fintech every day, to solve all the doubts that they have. In this context, in informal reviews we have 10 records, and we have two formally filed applications. Entities seeking authorization require approval from the Interinstitutional Committee, where the Ministry of Finance, the Banxico and the CNBV are, then also in these formal processes, as soon as we receive the formal requests, the files are sent in parallel to the SHCP and the Banxico. <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">-Requests seem few when international consulting radars handle more than 300 fintech in Mexico, do you worry?</emphasis><br/> I do not think there is anything to worry about, because, although the numbers seem few, the truth about the approach with fintech companies, we see another reality. For example, there are recent studies that show us how the ecosystem isfintech in Mexico, and what they indicate is that it is no longer in a stage of startups, of startups, but of consolidation, that is, that the fintech in the country are already in another state, they are in a serious growth and expansion and that It's very good, because the dynamism we have so far is not going to be lost. <br/> We as CNBV have an internal radar of fintech companies, where, even, other radars fall short: we have mapped 500 different fintech companies, of which, those that are going to enter the world regulated by the Fintech Law are 201. Of that number We have already sat with more than 150 and none have said that they do not want to be regulated, they are all trying. <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">- How will the CNBV act after September with the companies that, despite having to regulate themselves, operate outside the law?</emphasis><br/> There the law is very clear, to carry out crowdfunding activities or to issue funds for electronic payments an authorization from the CNBV is needed and the consequence of doing those activities without having authorization from the CNBV is a crime, as simple as that. What is going to happen is that all those companies that did not approach, or that do not obtain their authorization, in order not to infringe the law have to close operations. <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">-After the issuance of the first secondary laws, the fintech sector raised its voice for the possible restrictions of these, will the rules be relaxed?</emphasis><br/> There are some things that the last administration left that we consider to be a bit excessive and we are working on making certain modifications to the things that went a little further and that are not justified, but that does not mean that we are going to deregulate (...) After of the secondary regulation, there were voices that complained and others; we are in communication to show us with figures how they hurt (the provisions), but none has shown it. <br/> These two models of fintech that are regulated is because they receive massive resources from the public, the public is entrusting their patrimony to them and that is the thing that we have to protect. <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">-The Fintech Law was a benchmark in financial matters of the previous government, what is the vision of the new government?</emphasis><br/> This administration promotes the Fintech Law 100%, because it goes hand in hand with one of the current concerns of how to increase financial inclusion, how to inject competition into the financial sector, that is why the Fintech Law was created (...) give continuity and is one of the priority topics. <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">- In the Fintech Law, is there room for big tech?</emphasis><br/> If these big tech start doing activities, the reserved ones that the Fintech Law says, have to come to the regulated world. If they only provide services but around financial services, they do not really need authorization to be an ITF. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-7054599</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W6M-NTM1-F03R-W129-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1033\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 27, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DDUH</classCode><className>CROWDFUNDING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CL</classCode><className>PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES &amp;

The pundit conversation remains all about the Fed, but a new angle is getting more attention. The talking heads will not raise the question explicitly - sticking to personal ideas of what the Fed should be doing. The implication?</p><p>Are we witnessing a de facto expansion of the Fed's dual mandate? In last week's installment of WTWA[1], I guessed that, despite the economic data, the punditry would be focused Fed policy and how it might affect stock prices. That was indeed the headline for both news articles and TV segments. The speculation continued all week, and will no doubt continue this week as well.I always start my personal review of the week by looking at a great chart. This week I am featuring Investing.com's version[2]. If you click through to the site, you will be able to customize the view in many ways. Also, each of the 'N' symbols has an associated news event.The chart looks choppy, but the range on the week was only 1.25%. The overall gain was 0.47%. Despite the news, it was a quiet week. Our weekly Indicator Snapshot provides a handy history of both actual and implied volatility.Mrs. OldProf and I are enjoying a rare road trip. Since I ignored her today while writing this, she suggests (stron!!) that I take next week off. And I probably will. At the moment we are in Kentucky. This morning I saw our housekeeper in the hallway and told her that our room did not have any tissues. She looked at me quizzically and explained that she did not speak English. I found a crumpled example in my pocket. She said, 'Oh! Kleenex.' She produced a hotel brand box. Some words are universal.Check out this fascinating labor market spider chart, featured by The Daily Shot. Each week I break down events into good and bad. For our purposes, 'good' has two components. The news must be market friendly and better than expectations. I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news - and you should, too!New Deal Democrat's[3] high frequency indicators are an important part of our regular research. There are three different groups. This week the pattern is quite neat: Long-term is positive, the nowcast is neutral, and short term is negative. NDD himself is also pretty negative, writing as follows: As I have pointed out before, these metrics are good at forecasting the economy 'if left to its own devices.' At present, however, it's far from being left to its own devices, in particular because of chaotic trade and tariff policies. Even if one agrees with the trade objectives and the use of tariffs toward those objectives, however, the chaotic nature of their deployment is asymmetrically negative, as no one can be sure that even a fully agreed to trade deal can survive beyond the next tweet. Thus the near-term forecast is not better than, and may well be worse than, indicated by these indicators.The GoodInflation data. Both PPI (0.2% increase on the core) and CPI (0.1% increase on the core) were a touch lower than expected. Some incorrectly see this as bad news - results lower than the Fed target. What it means is that the Fed does not have to fight inflation with a rate hike. Markets shrugged off the news. Pundits saw what they wanted to. NFIB small business optimism increased to 105.0 (prior 103.5). This is close to a record. Here is an example of an important subgroup.Mortgage applications soared 26.8% versus last week's 1.5%. (Calculated Risk[4]). Retail sales increased 0.5%. While this missed expectations of a 0.7% increase, the April revision from -0.2% to an increase of more than 0.3% more than made up for the May 'miss.' This was in the face of falling gas prices. (Todd Sullivan[5]). Investor confidence is stuck at 2009 levels, supporting what Mike Williams (via Alan Steel[6]) calls 'the new fear trade.' Industrial production for May increased 0.4%, beating expectations of 0.2% and the April result, a decline of 0.4%). JOLTs showed continuing labor market strength. It is difficult to find an insightful account of this report. Most people just look at the number of job openings. I wrote an immediate analysis[7], covering the key points and illustrating what I look for. Here is just one of the charts. The BadInitial jobless claims edged higher to 222K (Prior 219K and Expected 220K) Calculated Risk[8] has a helpful post explaining his personal approach to use of this weekly data.University of Michigan preliminary consumer sentiment for June registered 97.9, a slight miss from the expected 98.1 and the final May report of 100.0.Hotel occupancy decreased year-over year. (Calculated Risk[9]).Rail traffic is flat overall, but down on Steven Hansen's (GEI[10]) economically intuitive sectors.LA area Port Traffic declined in May. Calculated Risk has the data, charts, and a discussion of the Panama Canal expansion effects. The UglyThe deterioration of air traffic control systems. This yet another in my accounts of neglecting important infrastructure in order to achieve short-term savings. If you fly, you will be fascinated by this story from The Economist[11]. We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance. Good luck with that! Second best is planning what to look for and how to react.The CalendarThe economic calendar is normal with an emphasis on housing news. Leading indicators are not expected to show only a small gain. The big news will be the FOMC decision on Wednesday. While some see a chance for a rate cut, most interest will focus on the accompanying statement. I also expect more China/US trade commentary in front of the G20 meetings, June 28-29. Briefing.com[12] has a good U.S. economic calendar for the week. Here are the main U.S. releases. Next Week's ThemeI expect a continuing focus on Fed policy. Last week's article[13] is still quite relevant. The punditry is taking a slightly different focus. Many are expecting the Fed to recognize and deal with all potential problems. Are we witnessing a de facto expansion of the Fed's dual mandate?BackgroundThe dual mandate is a Congressional requirement. Before 1977 the Fed was formally focused on price stability, although improving employment crept into the discussion starting in about 1940. It was formally added in 1977. The Chicago Fed[14] has a good explanation: Our two goals of price stability and maximum sustainable employment are known collectively as the 'dual mandate.'1[15]The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC),2[16]which sets U.S. monetary policy, has translated these broad concepts into specific longer run goals and strategies.3[17] Price StabilityThe Committee judges that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate. The Committee has also explicitly noted that the inflation target is symmetric and stated that it 'would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below this objective.' Maximum Sustainable EmploymentMany nonmonetary factors affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market, and these may change over time and may not be measurable directly. Accordingly, specifying an explicit goal for employment is not appropriate. Instead, the Committee's decisions must be informed by a wide range of labor market indicators. Information about FOMC participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment consistent with the employment mandate can be found in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).4[18]Most recently, the median Committee participant estimated this rate to be 4.3 percent. They also provide a pictorial view of current progress.The controversy over these mandates has led to an active debate for years. In the past, this has often taken the form that there is one mandate too many! The European Central Bank, for example, has only a price stability mandate. Investopedia[19] has a handy summary of central bank facts. Now, even two mandates are not enough for some. ViewpointsHere are some important viewpoints. Each represents a possible Fed responsibility. In each case there is disagreement about whether they reflect current Fed behavior as well as whether it should be a topic for consideration. I'll put these in table form. Instead of keeping my opinions to the Final Thought section, I will provide a column to keep them separate. Some readers have indicated that they like this approach, and some topics are especially suitable for it.The most important approach for investors is a sound analysis of what the Fed is actually doing and why. I recommend the work of Prof. Tim Duy for this purpose. Here is his latest post[20]. Tim sees inflation as a 'nonissue' with risks weighted toward persistence in recent economic weakness. He believes that the Fed will signal a rate cut in June, and follow through in July. I'll describe a few more ideas in today's Final Thought.I have a rule for my investment clients. Think first about your risk. Only then should you consider possible rewards. I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update, featuring the Indicator Snapshot.With last week's rally, the short-term technical health has improved to mildly bullish while the long-term remains neutral. The C-Score declined along with the flattening yield curve, but not enough to alter the recession estimate. It still signals the need for watchfulness concerning confirmation from other indicators.The Featured Sources:Bob Dieli[21]: Business cycle analysis via the 'C Score'. Brian Gilmartin[22]: All things earnings, for the overall market as well as many individual companies. Georg Vrba[23]: Business cycle indicator and market timing tools. The most recent update of Georg's business cycle index[24] does not signal recession, nor does his unemployment rate method.[25] RecessionAlert[26]: Strong quantitative indicators for both economic and market analysis Doug Short[27] and Jill Mislinski: Regular updating of an array of indicators. Great charts and analysis, especially the regular updates of the Big Four[28] indicators used by the NBER recession dating committee. With two new data points this week, let's look at the updated table and chart.Since a recession requires a substantial decline from the peak in these indicators, let's take a look at that as well. Guest CommentaryJames Picerno[29] has his regular helpful update on GDP nowcasts - now up from 1.8% two weeks ago to 2.0%.He also notes the current economic environment: Deciding how (or if) to factor Trump's comments into economic projections is open for debate. Despite the unclear guidelines for this analysis, the President's rapidly evolving and often surprising remarks to the media on crucial economic topics can be a volatile mix that change macro assumptions in a flash. Todd Sullivan and 'Davidson'[30] look at oil demand, refining, and production throughputs. Traders and pundits on a mission use oil prices as a measure of demand, often ignoring the supply. Most people are unaware of this important fact: U.S. oil demand jumped 500K bbl/dayto 20.46M bbl/day in 2018, the biggest increase in more than a decade and accelerating a trend of rising oil demand since a trough in 2009,BP said in its latestannual Statistical Review[31]. Rapidly rising demand lead to matching increases in production Our weekly 'Stock Exchange' series asked an important question: Do You Evaluate Your Trading Mistakes?[32] We began with advice from top experts and moved on to some recent picks from our own trading models. Felix ranked the top choices in the DJIA and Oscar the most liquid ETFs. Pulling it all together was our series editor, Blue Harbinger[33].Investors should understand and embrace volatility. They should join my delight in a well-documented list of worries. As the worries are addressed or even resolved, the investor who looks beyond the obvious can collect handsomely. The day-to-day market still reflects this pattern: Algorithms have learned key words and respond to the news or tweet language. Human traders pile on, perhaps taking the other side from the computers which are already cashing out. The punditry, charged with imposing meaning on chaos, exaggerates the effect of minor news. Mainstream media picks up these 'reasons' as the story of the day, even if markets move modestly. Investors who are observing casually become unduly frightened by the scary news and volatility.Best of the WeekIf I had to recommend a single, must-read article for this week, it would be Chuck Carnevale's Ignore Political And Economic Forecasts: Mind Your Owned Businesses[34]. As always he combines great advice with some well-chosen stock ideas. His key theme is drawn from a 1994 Warren Buffett shareholder letter advising readers to ignore political and economic forecasts. Chuck observes that most investors do exactly the opposite, using only the current market price. He sees that as a measure of liquidity rather than true value. Stated differently, market value often either overstates or understates the true value of the businesses that you own. Consequently, I consider it significantly more important and intelligent to assess the value of your businesses based on sound principles of business, economics and accounting (fundamental values). Therefore, by knowing the true worth of your holdings, you can make more intelligent decisions as to whether you should be buying more, selling, or holding in relation to the market value. To clarify, I do not believe in paying more for a business than it is worth, nor do I believe in selling a business for less than it's worth. Current market price rarely gives me the whole picture. There is much more, including some recession-resistant ideas.Stock IdeasKirk Spano fact-packed Here's Why Oil Stocks Are Priced For Armageddon[35] is interesting both for the analysis of trends and timing and also for some stock ideas. Among the many important concepts is the turning point for nuclear.And on the limited oil company possibilities: The only way for oil stocks to go up in price is that shale has to stop producing more oil. That either means a wave of wildcatter bankruptcies needs to happen or the big players need to cut back. The big players aren't going to cut back. Whether small-cap shale players go under is up to the bankers actually. Hopefully, the lack of profitability is waking up the commission and bonus happy bankers who are subsidizing the zombie companies. If the banks really have their self-interest at heart, they'll let the unprofitable oil stocks go bankrupt now, while there is still a future for oil and the assets are worth something. Let me make this clear. The banks are better off taking assets in liquidations than anything else. Beth Kindig explains[36] the divergence between Uber earnings and the stock price. Hint: They are losing money on every ride. A key point of timing for both traders and investors is the end of the lockup period in November. Anyone interested in this stock should read the entire analysis. Morningstar[37] has an update including a more gradual climb in housing starts. They also suggest four undervalued housing related picks. Here is their conclusion on Lennar (LEN): No-moat-rated Lennar, which is well positioned to benefit from increased demand from first-time buyers and its emerging multifamily business, has the widest margin of safety among our homebuilder coverage. A divestiture of narrow-moat-rated Masco's cabinets and window businesses, either through a sale or spin-off, has the potential to create shareholder value and could be a catalyst for the stock. We expect management to conclude its strategic review of these two businesses in June. Bhavneesh Sharma[38] reports on the Jefferies Healthcare Investors Conference with analysis of his top pick Xenon Pharmaceuticals (XENE). Barron's identifies[39] three big drug-distributor stocks that look like bargains. I own one of them, recently analyzed by Chuck Carnevale. Eddy Elfenbein analyzes[40] the big merger news of the week: Raytheon (RTN) and United Technologies (UTX). Morningstar reports[41] on the Electrical Products Group conference. See their five takeaways and top picks. Lyn Alden Schwartzer[42] takes a look at the details of the Beyond Meat (BYND) story. Combining a lesson on nutrition as well as stock valuation, she reaches this conclusion: Beyond Meat is only as good as its latest product, and has little moat to speak of. It does not have cost advantages or high switching costs, and will need to compete partially on price. All it has is its brand and know-how, and it currently is considered one of the top meat alternative products. Who knows what the competitive landscape will look like in 5-10 years, and which meat alternatives will be considered the tastiest or the healthiest. For now, Beyond Meat's product has no place in my fridge and the stock has no place in my portfolio. Maybe if they were to remove their highly-processed oils, or their stock price were to get cut in half, I would be more interested. All I can say is, tread carefully. Aswath Damodaran[43] does a comprehensive valuation analysis of Beyond Meat. As always, he shares his data in a downloadable spreadsheet. His basic conclusion is that it is a trading play. Here is a nice table showing the life cycle of a company and how it is viewed by traders and investors.Alternatively, there is Investing.com's summary. Personal FinanceAbnormal Returns always provides interesting ideas on a wide variety of topics. I am a subscriber, and I read it daily. Each Wednesday's edition[44] includes a post focused on personal finance. There are always several interesting and informative choices. My own favorite this week is J.D. Roth's advice on How to make better (and quicker) decisions[45]. Drawing on Barry Schwartz's The Paradox of Choice, he cites the need for simplicity. Here are the key themes, but there is much, much more. Schwartz argues that faced with so many options and decisions, we would be better off if we: Embraced certain voluntary constraints on our choices (instead of rebelling against limits). Opting for 'good enough' instead of always seeking the best. Lowering our expectations. Made our decisions non-reversible. Paid less attention to other people. See also Tadas's own article (I love it when he finds time to write as well as curate) On the Perils of Passive News Consumption[46]. He has great sources and great conclusions.Watch out forGrowing regulatory pressure on 'America's biggest tech juggernauts (Markets Insider[47]). Business development companies (BDCs). The yields are appealing, but the risks are difficult to evaluation. (Washington Post[48]).The Fed. I have been a Fed watcher for decades. In the old days, you had to watch at 'Fed time' each morning to see what the open-market operations were. If, for example, the NY Fed conducted system repos, you had to know the market conditions at the time to see if that size was expected. That was how the Fed signaled current policy. The expert commentary helped others interpret the Fed actions. The increase in visibility is generally desirable, but it has opened up the field to those with opinions unsupported by any knowledge. The provision of many words and the speeches from many participants have opened the field for spinning by an array of pseudo-experts. If you really want to understand Fed policy, read some of the transcripts. They are five years old but provide a clear record of the official basis for policy. In the absence of this sort of data, anyone can speculate on the 'real mission' of the Fed. The Overall Economy. David Templeton (HORAN) does a fine job of balancing current concerns and data, noting that it Seems All About The Fed At The Moment[49]. His conclusion is right on target: Current economic data is mixed and some of the weaker data is worth accounting for in ones analysis going forward. However, news headline sentiment seems to be projecting a more dire economic environment at this point in time. One concern is, collectively, we can talk ourselves into an economic slowdown in spite of strong economic underpinnings. The current environment though seems more like a 2015/2016 slowdown and not one where a full blown recession is on the horizon, but the environment is a more fluid and challenging one for sure. The overall economic data show a slowing to the current nowcast GDP rate of about 2% for Q219. Each week I recommend that as the baseline investors should consider. Some are alarmed by the speed of the decline in the pace of growth. I am not surprised and do not care as long as growth holds near the baseline. This has been a long recovery from a deep recession. Data were juiced a bit from the tax cuts, and some decline should be expected.These are the reasons that I monitor economic data and recession risk so carefully. I also report a consistent set of indicators, not searching for a sub-group that supports a pre-conceived viewpoint. If you have already made up your mind, you'll find some 'evidence' to support your conclusion.[If you are an investor who has exited stocks because of the incessant bearish headlines, you are not alone. Do not let ratings or commission-driven forces cause you to abandon your goals. We can help if you need it, but I provide many good ideas in each week's post. We also have a great program for those who need dependable income, meeting our 9% annualized yield goal continuously for over five years. It even permits you to buy more when the market is down, selling after it rebounds. Send an email to main at newarc dot com.

Brexit. A no-deal Brexit will not be as easy as some opine. (The Economist[51]).I'm less worried aboutThe emphasis on the mega cap tech names. The rotation away from these is completely normal. I wrote about this last week trying to be timely with this brief but important take. I was on this story before other sources. (Seeking Alpha readers need to go offsite. Their editorial team did not see the value until the complete series was completed. The updates will also be brief installments, no doubt. For busy authors, the choice between timeliness and a thorough analysis is a challenge. I try to get something out immediately and then elaborate. It was quite a change to be told by an editor that my article was too brief!)

Google, Twitter and Facebook are in the crosshairs for abusing private data, permitting fake accounts to peddle fraudulent products and disinformation and lax responses to foreign governments seeking to corrupt our elections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Each operates in a commercial space where the \"network effect\" applies. For example, in the days of landline telephones, one monopoly company was worth more than three competing businesses because a single subscriber could reach everyone in town.</p><p> These days, it's tough for manufacturers and retailers to rely only on conventional brick and mortar stores to attract consumers. With the lion's share of web commerce on its platforms, Amazon is the compelling choice.</p><p> That permits Amazon to just about dictate prices, and as it learns suppliers' business models, pick off business for new ventures of its own. Amazon Basics offers items ranging from ladies apparel to data analytic services mimicking those of its own cloud clients.</p><p>Google, Facebook and Twitter offer the most efficient means for keeping up with news, friends and family, spreading one's own views widely or reading directly the immediate ruminations of public figures like President Trump and Prime Minister May. Subscribers can't go elsewhere to get the same information, impact and immediacy, but those services must finance themselves \u2014 hence they mine personal data, and we have little leverage to limit how they use it.</p><p> The latter is not a bad bargain if they don't abuse it. However, as we have learned from episodes like Cambridge Analytica selling services to political campaigns, laxity in ferreting out fake Russian accounts in 2016 elections and the suppression of conservative commentators, social media can be callous and cavalier about its responsibilities and impose Silicone Valley liberal biases on what ideas Americans can most readily access.</p><p> Data privacy is not hard to solve. California is enacting safeguards similar to those recently imposed by the EU that requires internet companies to be clear about the data they collect and obtain permission to mine it. However, policing bad actors, and combating West Coast liberal piety are other matters altogether.</p><p> Rep. Maxine Waters, California Democrat, who encouraged activists to harass Trump administration officials, still has Twitter and Facebook accounts. Do you suppose I would still have either if I organized early morning demonstrations outside her residence with the specific intention of keeping her from her congressional duties or encouraging her resignation?</p><p> Even more menacing are proposals that the thought and speech police should be institutionalized \u2014 similar to syllabus and speech codes that are destroying the free exchange of ideas at America's universities.</p><p> In a well-meaning proposal, the director of the Personal Democracy Forum suggests that a multi-stakeholder content congress be privately organized \u2014 akin to the private bodies that manage internet protocols \u2014 to advise web companies about criteria for listing accounts and filtering content. You can bet that body would be stacked with the kind of liberal academics and legitimize the kind of content screening Google executives currently undertake but deny.</p><p> The bottom line is that Google and Amazon business practices should be subject to a thorough review by the Justice Department. To ensure their earnest intent when screening ads, these businesses should be required to bear some financial liability for third-party frauds using their networks.</p><p>Congress should require Amazon, Google, Facebook and Twitter to open their content algorithms to full public security, verify the identity of user accounts and ferret out fake accounts \u2014 especially those of foreign actors \u2014 whether they publish biblical passages or spread wholesale lies. After all, if someone wants to post material children or folks with limited time to verify content may read, he ought to sign it \u2014 with his real name and location.</p><p> Beyond these, Congress needs to resist the urge to act impulsively \u2014 our democracy is resilient. Americans are generally well-educated, and we profit from hearing the worst nuts and thoughtful views contrary to our own.</p><p> That's why we don't have prior government restraint of free speech, and we should not assign that power on the internet to private entities. Barring attempts to impede our government or incite violence \u2014 let people say what they like and consign censorship to libel laws.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMD-c7c8903d66f7904b706edaf1bbf42505a6210e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C5FFB38D3AE NWBKMD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T81-WYS1-JBCN-41YJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409144</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"770\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Herald-Mail.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

He is outstandingly well qualified and I warmly congratulate him on his appointment.\u00a0It is hard to imagine anyone better suited to take on the challenges in the broadcasting and telecommunications sectors at this challenging time of great change.\u00a0Minister Fletcher's thoughtful and considered approach to policy development will stand us all in good stead and Free TV looks forward to working closely with him in the years ahead on the important issues facing the broadcasting industry.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p>Laying it on a bit thick, wasn't she?

He is smart, pragmatic and has a deep understanding of our industry.\u00a0Paul is definitely the right person to be dealing with the big and complex issues that need to be sorted in this area.</p></bodyText></excerpt><p>How much \"dealing\" Fletcher can do is questionable. The most powerful media groups in Australia are beyond his control -- the mega-techs led by Facebook, Google and Amazon and the streaming giants\u00a0Netflix, Disney Now, CBS All Access, HBO, Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon. Locally, there's only Stan to compete.\u00a0The government can pass as many new laws as it wants to, it can try and curtail and punish big tech companies but they are beyond its true reach, and business in Australia isn't that vital to the giants. It's US and European regulation that keeps Facebook and Google executives up at night, not Australian.</p><p>[related-story id=\"614760\"]</p><p>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is about to hand down its Digital Platforms report, which is expected to recommend dramatic changes to regulations governing global online services including <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2019/02/19/facebook-regulation-digital-gangster/\">Google and Facebook</url>. It should also recommend changes that will affect local media groups such as News Corp, Nine/Fairfax and the national broadcasters. These changes could see all media platforms -- legacy, digital/social media and others -- captured in a new regulatory regime.</p><p>The megatechs will not worry. To use an old phrase, they interpret regulation as damage, and route around it accordingly.\u00a0And streaming business can't be pushed out of Australia, they can't be boxed in and regulated. Short of blocking the internet completely, they can't be stopped from eroding the legacy media companies (except AM radio, which is well-placed to resist the onslaught from outside).</p><p>The big decisions for Fletcher will involve the future of the legacy companies -- particularly Seven West Media and News Corp's Foxtel. Foxtel's financial state is weak. Management have made repeated mistakes that have undermined its financial structure and resources, and it continues to lose subscriber revenue to streaming. Meanwhile, Kerry Stokes may be looking to offload a problematic broadcasting asset that faces a future of declining revenue and ageing audiences.</p><p>[related-story id=\"666236\"]</p><p>Then there's the ABC. Here, Fletcher doesn't have a lot of work to do: the Coalition has already successfully gutted the broadcaster and cowed its management. It has installed a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2019/02/25/ita-buttrose-abc-chair/\">popular chair</url> to pretend to voters that all is well. Fletcher's task will be to trim the ABC's budget further and make sure that management and staff understand what must happen to any journalist who scrutinises the government too closely.\u00a0</p><p>Otherwise, Fletcher gets the best seat in the house at an extended funeral of the Australian media sector.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Disagree?

It's a new day. It's a new year. It's a new decade. And yes, I'm feeling good. 2020. This is a year all of us futurists have looked forward to for over two decades as, back in 2000, it became popular to talk about a 2020 vision. </p><p>I've made lots of presentations and films about 2020, as have others, but many were off the mark. For example, towards the end of 2019, I got reflective and thought about the last decade. In 2010, there was an iPhone and app store, but early days. Cloud was around, but not discussed. Bitcoin had arrived, but no one knew about it or crypto or anything. FinTech hadn't even appeared on the radar of most people and banking was all focused upon just that: getting back to being boring old banking and not basketcase banking, as had appeared in 2008. No one knew what 2020 would look like. 2020. How ten years has changed everything. Today, I cannot look a decade ahead. But someone did ask me to look a year ahead and asked what should we be talking about in 2020. So, I sat down and made a list of 11 things to think about in 2020 from a FinTech point of view. In no particular order, these are: Doing Digital: yes, this is the title of my next new book (out next month) but the focus is upon how banks are actually digitally transformation. Are they really doing digital or just talking digital? Do they get digital transformation as a restructuring or just think it's a project? Someone said to me the difference is changing your diet versus changing your clothes. The former can transform you. The latter just makes you look different. In 2020, are you really doing digital? Digital Currencies: with the launch of Libra last year, and the discussion of China and Sweden issuing central bank controlled digital currency, 2020 will focus on this much more. There may well be many currencies out there, and it is a threat to the more than 2,500 that are out there already. Reason being that most cryptocurrencies are backed by a white paper and a server somewhere you can't find. I'd rather trust a regulated body with my store of value than a coder, and 2020 will see that battle play out big time. Digital Identity: wrapped up with the whole digital thing is who can you trust? Without a trusted identity mechanism, anyone could fool you online and digital identity is more than just about security. It's about trust, again. The UN has a mandate to create a global identity scheme by 2030 for everyone on earth. That's only going to be achieved if we can start with baby steps today. 2020 will see a lot of countries focusing upon digital identities to go with their digital currencies. Digital Inclusion: digital inclusion is all about financial wellness, financial literacy and financial inclusion. Now that we have cheap networking over a mobile network that can reach the most remote consumer, we need to focus upon how we serve them, wherever they may be. Digital inclusion goes beyond just transactions by building upon microfinance and microlending. This is the hot space for the telecommunications firms, and should see 2020 seeing things happening everywhere, not just in a few African nations. Digital Society: a fourth major focus in 2020, building on the points above, will be the creation of digital societies. Governments are already hot on this space and I see this as the battle between Big Tech and Big Gov, where finance falls somewhere in between. As Liz Warren and Margrethe Vestager battle to break up the big Silicon Valley giants, their governmental programs may well build on these war cries and start focusing upon a governmental system for a digital society. If they do, they can learn a lot from India, where the unified stack and its components are already well on the way there. Cybersecurity: no one likes talking about online, mobile and digital, without mentioning that it must be secure. There you go. I've said it. Purpose-driven banking: this is a nascent topic that I started blogging about in earnest last year. I think in 2020 it will become an even stronger rally call. What is the purpose of a bank? To make profits for shareholders or to be useful to society and the planet? If it is purely the former, I claim that banking has a short future and may be extinct by 2030. If it is the latter, then that gets into a different dialogue and a far more meaningful one. What are banks here for? What is their purpose? Why do banks exist? We need to put far more socially useful context around those questions than just saying they are here to make a buck. Intelligent Banking: yes, of course I mean artificially intelligent, but I also mean emotionally intelligent, building on the last statement around a purpose. How can banks engage with customers at the head and heart? How can banks leverage data to not just use AI for fraud and risk but to use data for customer intelligent service and support. Banks that really reach the heart of their customers by building digital relationships through intelligent analytics will really win in this new decade. The obvious rider there is that banks that aren't intelligent will lose. Yep. Financial Ecosystems: 2019 is the first year I met a Head of Ecosystems at a bank. How many banks have such a person? In 2020, many more in my view as ecosystems, collaboration, partnerships and platforms are all the name of the game. If a bank doesn't have a Head of Ecosystems, then what are they doing? Everything on their own? Probably, but in the age of Banking-as-a-Service, being a lone cowboy is the way to become an outlaw. You need to engage with all, not ignore them. Quantum Leap Banking: that's my phrase for any of the many new technologies that banks should be looking at from quantum computing to facial biometrics to cloud-native everything to more. To be honest, there aren't many new, new technologies on the horizon - quantum is about it - but what about blockchain and crypto and stuff? We need to talk about these things in 2020. Maybe just not as much as we will talk about all the other stuff. Future Vision: I know that banks are focused upon the last quarter and the performance metrics, but I have also been surprised by how many banks are now focused upon the future. Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, HSBC, UBS and more all have visioning programs to try to see where the world will go. Does anyone know? Well, you can always hire Chris Skinner to find out. Anyways, there you go. Those are my 11 priorities to kick off 2020. What are yours?

In another Target, someone shouts down the aisle to a companion to pick up some Red Bull; on the ride home, Instagram serves a sponsored post for the beverage. A home baker wishes aloud for a KitchenAid mixer, and moments after there's an ad for one on his phone. Two friends are talking about recent trips to Japan, and soon after one gets hawked cheap flights there. A woman has a bottle of perfume confiscated at airport security, and upon arrival sees a Facebook ad for local perfume stores. These are just some of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gimletmedia.com/reply-all/109-facebook-spying\">many</url> discomforting coincidences that make today's consumers feel surveilled and violated. The causes are sometimes innocuous, and sometimes duplicitous. As more of them come to light, some will be cause for regulatory or legal remedy.</p><p><br/>But none of this is new, nor is it unique to big tech. Online services are only accelerating the reach and impact of data-intelligence practices that stretch back decades. They have collected your personal data, with and without your permission, from employers, public records, purchases, banking activity, educational history, and hundreds more sources. They have connected it, recombined it, bought it, and sold it. Processed foods look wholesome compared to your processed data, scattered to the winds of a thousand databases. Everything you have done has been recorded, munged, and spat back at you to benefit sellers, advertisers, and the brokers who service them. It has been for a long time, and it's not going to stop. The age of privacy nihilism is here, and it's time to face the dark hollow of its pervasive void.<br/><br/>Many people still think their smartphones are listening to them in secret-recording their conversations in the background, then uploading them to Facebook or Google surreptitiously. Facebook has been accused of the practice more than others, probably because its services (including Instagram) are so popular and ads are so easy to spot. The company <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-41776215\">denies doing so</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/h/facebook-does-not-use-your-phones-microphone-for-ads-or-news-feed-stories/\">every</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/zuckerberg-tells-congress-facebook-is-not-listening-to-you-through-your-phone/\">time</url>, and researchers       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://gizmodo.com/these-academics-spent-the-last-year-testing-whether-you-1826961188?rev=1530032109839&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow_gizmodo_twitter&amp;amp;utm_source=gizmodo_twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=socialflow\">have shown</url> it to be technically infeasible, too. But the idea still       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/wjbzzy/your-phone-is-listening-and-its-not-paranoia?utm_campaign=sharebutton\">persists</url>.<br/>It persists because it feels true, and also because it is true, by the spirit if not the letter. Facebook and Google might not literally be listening in on our conversations, but they are eavesdropping on our lives. These companies have so much data, on so many people, and they can slice and dice it in so many ways that they might as well be monitoring our conversations. Traveling out of town and searching for restaurants? It's not just that Facebook or Google knows where you are and what you're searching for, but also if you're a foodie or a cheapskate, if you've \"liked\" Korean hot pot or Polish pierogi, and what your demographics say about your income, and therefore your budget.   <br/>Tech companies do collect data in unexpected, and sometimes duplicitous, ways. Facebook's Cambridge Analytica       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/the-cambridge-analytica-scandal-in-three-paragraphs/556046/?utm_source=feed\">catastrophe</url>offers one example. More recently, a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://digitalcontentnext.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DCN-Google-Data-Collection-Paper.pdf\">report</url> based on research at Vanderbilt University suggests that Google collects or infers vast quantities of information about its users, based on their web browsing, media use, location, purchases, and more-sometimes even absent user interaction. Location data was particularly voluminous, with Android smartphones conveying a user's position in space more than 300 times in a 24-hour period-even if the user has turned off location history in the device's Google settings. The study also       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://adage.com/article/digital/incognito-web-browsing-private-google-study/314670/\">shows</url> that the \"incognito\" mode in Google's Chrome browser, which promises to hide a user's information from websites while browsing, still makes it possible for Google to connect those supposedly hidden visits to its own, internal profile of a user.<br/>Revelations like these       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/08/20/google-location-tracking-lawsuit-seeks-to-include-virtually-anyone-with-a-phone/\">have spawned</url> a class-action lawsuit against the company, and it's tempting to imagine that oversight, regulation, or legal repercussions might eventually discourage or even change the way tech companies collect and manage data. This hope jibes with the ongoing \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/01/20/the-techlash-against-amazon-facebook-and-google-and-what-they-can-do\">techlash</url>\" that has consumed the sector for the past year or more. But it also ignores the fact that Google and Facebook's data hunger takes place within the context of a widespread, decades-old practice of data intelligence.<br/>For years, companies slurped up, bought, and sold that data to hone their marketing and sales efforts. But with the rise of big tech firms, the stakes changed. Data collection's secret grift globalized, and centralized. Now a batch of computer dorks know everything you say, do, dream, and desire-even the stuff you're too ashamed to admit to yourself. Data brokering used to be a somewhat disgraceful, shadowy business. Now it's mainstream. The tech companies are not ashamed of the empires they have built, or the means by which they have done so. Instead, they relish the profits they reap from the remnants you have left behind, and they do so out in the open. The only thing worse than a bandit acting out of spite is one who feels nothing at all as he plunders your secrets.<br/><br/>Since it's been possible to keep records, companies have sought to use and benefit from the information they possess. The term \"business intelligence\" was first coined way back in 1865, in Richard Miller Devens's book Cyclopaedia of Commercial and Business Anecdotes-a title that feels like it should come with a top hat. Devens studied the ability of merchants and bankers, starting in the 17th century, to benefit from access to information (about war, about competition, about weather, and so on).<br/>Almost a century later, in 1958, the IBM engineer Hans Peter Luhn       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5392644/\">rekindled</url> the concept for the information age. By then, machines like the ones IBM manufactured had made business intelligence easier, but Luhn identified its intractable challenges: Acquiring and storing data was just the start; it also had to be retrieved and acted upon. Those problems would take another couple decades to resolve.<br/>The most important advance in the process came in 1969, when the computer scientist Edgar F. Codd, also working at IBM,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=362685\">developed</url> a new paradigm for data storage and processing. Codd's \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model\">relational model</url>\" was soon realized in software products, known as relational databases, which, starting in 1978, were commercialized by IBM and others. Relational databases made it easy to run \"queries\" against large, diverse data sets. Sales could be correlated against regions, or suppliers. Prospects could be connected to conversions. The individual actions of particular customers could be aggregated into patterns. And it could all be done quickly, using recently updated information.<br/>Almost every important enterprise-software program of the next decade-most of which ordinary people never thought about or saw-was built atop the idea of a relational database. Oracle has sold a popular one since 1979. It and other companies, including IBM, Microsoft, SAP, PeopleSoft, and Google, customized new enterprise products that used the relational database as a platform. These products are still important today. Enterprise resource-planning software tracks and manages business operations. Customer-relationship management software tracks sales and marketing activities. Supply-chain management systems help manage the flow of components and raw materials for manufacture and distribution. To this day, these systems make ordinary life operate. If you work a job with payroll, get products delivered from Amazon, or own a smartphone assembled from parts, you are a beneficiary of the relational-database industrial complex. And a victim of it, to Since the 1980s, companies have been using the systems to store and act on information about who you are and what you do.<br/><br/>But for a long time, that information was still scattered all over the place. Your bank or the manufacturer of your vehicle might know how much money you've got or what car you drive, but the data was isolated in in separate systems at discrete organizations. A supermarket chain might know how well a specific product line sold in a particular region, but it didn't know much about who bought it or why.<br/>But then organizations found ways to acquire and recombine information of all kinds. Credit-reporting services offered one way to get information about consumers. The nation's credit bureaus-Equifax, Experian, and Transunion-became one wellspring, selling access to such information for almost any purpose, including marketing (although legal and operational changes curtailed some of those practices over time). The rise of credit cards, debit cards, and electronic-payment systems made it easier to collect sales information, and to connect multiple purchases to specific customers. Club cards like the kind you use at the supermarket or drug store trade \"discounts\" on goods for a persistent trail of information tied to an address and a phone number. Guised as loyalty programs, these efforts       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/jun/08/supermarkets-get-your-data\">were only ever meant</url> to collect information.<br/>Data brokers also started collecting and selling specific types of data, like lists of sales prospects for particular categories of goods. Companies could purchase these lists, install them on their local enterprise systems, and then correlate the new, outside data with information they already possessed. All together, these factors shook privacy's foundation, and they did it long before Google and Facebook.<br/><br/>In 2012, Charles Duhigg published a watershed article, \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"applewebdata://1153207B-91B0-4866-9A18-646418566D98/You%E2%80%99d%20THINK%20that%20you%20and%20me%20and%20ellen%20and%20alana%20and%20ross\">How Companies Learn Your Secrets</url>,\" about how a team of statisticians at Target figured out how to predict customer behavior and capture their business preemptively. \"If we wanted to figure out if a customer is pregnant, even if she didn't want us to know, can you do that?\" the marketing team had asked-and in 2002, before Google had gone public and before Facebook even existed. The company started correlating any customer interaction-purchases, emails, surveys, coupon use, purchases-to a \"Guest ID.\" Target also purchased data from brokers, which might include consumer habits, political predilections, financial tendencies, and more, and attached them to those IDs. The result allowed the company to make predictions about future consumer habits, and to market to them accordingly. Target was hardly alone in this practice.<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/04/if-it-wasnt-the-pregnancy-tests-why-did-baby-catalogs-start-arriving-at-our-house/275072/?utm_source=feed\">If it wasn't the pregnancy tests, why did baby catalogs start arriving at our house?</url><br/>The results felt just as uncanny as today's supposed Facebook stalkings. More than five years ago, my Atlantic colleague Alexis Madrigal       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/04/if-it-wasnt-the-pregnancy-tests-why-did-baby-catalogs-start-arriving-at-our-house/275072/?utm_source=feed\">tried to figure out</url> why he started receiving baby catalogs in the mail, even before he and his wife had told anyone they had a child on the way. He traced the catalog to a data broker, which explained that Madrigal's previous purchases of gifts for nieces and nephews had flagged his household as consumers of children's apparel, merchandise, and toys. That was why the catalogs arrived; the fact that they were expecting was coincidence. \"There was no evil machine that was one step ahead of our own desires,\" Madrigal wrote.<br/>That's true of most of today's uncanny correlations, the ones people try to pin on a surveillance conspiracy. Someone shouting down the aisle for Red Bull has probably bought Red Bull before. Buying international flight tickets already marks someone as a traveler likely to do so again. Someone who goes to the trouble of making their own dough probably has made other purchases (or visited websites) that make a KitchenAid mixer an obvious match.<br/>The KitchenAid ad or the baby catalog feel different and new because a few things have changed in the data-privacy swamp. For one, data brokerage has expanded ceaselessly over the past few decades. In 2014, ProPublica published       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/everything-we-know-about-what-data-brokers-know-about-you\">an extensive investigation</url> of the various information about individual citizens that companies buy and sell. The results are so far-ranging that they seem almost fictional. Lists of romance-novel readers are for sale. Contributors to international charities. Divorcees. Equifax, the credit bureau, gets pay-stub data from many companies in exchange for employment-verification services. And on and on. If your brain can imagine it, there's probably a data source for it that someone can buy.<br/>But more importantly, the velocity of acquisition and correlation of information has increased dramatically. Web browsers and smartphones contribute to that, in volume and value. The granularity of location information like the kind Google appears to have been collecting on the sly allows the company to infer connections to specific places its users shop, seek medical treatment, or hang out. It also allows the company to correlate those places with other activities conducted before or after, like a web search before departure or a YouTube video watched on site. Facebook's entire business model is based on reaping the benefits of that information, and allowing the marketers who use it to cross-reference it with their own. The techlash fallout has forced the company to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/facebook-is-removing-ad-targeting-options-race-religion\">reassess</url> some of that practice, including facilitating discriminatory ad targeting, but that's a small detour on a long journey.<br/>The process of correlation has become more sophisticated, too. The venture capitalist Benedict Evans recently made a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2018/06/22/ways-to-think-about-machine-learning-8nefy\">convincing case</url> that machine learning, a type of computational data analysis currently enjoying a lot of confused hype, has the potential to become as important to the future of human life as the relational database was in the early 1970s. The connections that feel uncanny are actually the outliers, because they are the ones we notice. What about all the rest that go unobserved, linking behaviors in ways individuals haven't even thought to think? Those are the links that machine learning promises to bind.<br/>The centralization of information has also increased. With billions of users globally, organizations like Facebook and Google have a lot more data to offer-and from which to benefit. Enterprise services have also decentralized, and more data has moved to the Cloud-which often just means into the hands of big tech firms like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. Externalizing that data creates       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.com/law-products/news-views/corporate-counsel/flying-into-the-cloud-without-falling-understanding-the-intersection-between-data-privacy-laws\">data-privacy risk</url>. But then again, so does storing it locally, where it is susceptible to breaches       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/the-equifax-breach-marks-the-end-of-shame-over-data-security/539202/?utm_source=feed\">like the one Equifax experienced</url> last year.<br/><br/>The real difference between the old and the new ages of data-intelligence-driven consumer marketing, and the invasion of privacy they entail, is that lots of people are finally aware that it is taking place. The Cambridge Analytica scandal, the recent reports about Google, and related events have contributed to that knowledge, but not as much as the barrage of rapidly correlated advertising served in apps and on web pages. The postal mail comes once a day, but people see hundreds or thousands of new renditions of their own private information in the same time on online. It's easy to mistake the proximate cause-big, shadowy tech firms-for the ultimate one: over half a century of business-intelligence techniques that have been honed, productized, and weaponized out of sight. Google and Facebook are just the tip of an old, hardened iceberg.<br/>That means that easy answers, like       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-really-is-spying-on-you-just-not-through-your-phones-mic-1520448644\">limiting the information you give</url> to Facebook and Google, could help, but only somewhat. Certainly it appears that using an iPhone instead of an Android helps hide your physical location better. Regulation or legal action could also reverse some excesses of the data economy. But ultimately it's a losing battle. Are you really going to stop using Google? Or quit Facebook? Or stop browsing the web? Or leave your smartphone behind? Or disable location services in its hardware settings? Maybe some people will, for now, for a time, but then the reality of contemporary life will corral them back into these services. Eventually, it will become impossible. Unless you are independently wealthy, you can't opt out of the credit services. Even if you never use your credit card, your employer might be giving your data to the agencies that manage it anyway. You can't forego the supermarket, or the drug store, or the Target, where every purchase is stored and linked to every other. There is no escaping the machinery of actual life, no matter how many brows get furrowed over or tweets get sent about it.<br/>It's a shorthand comfort to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/21/technology/google-data-collection/index.html\">blame Google</url> for this state of affairs. It puts a face on the scourge, and it targets an enemy that feels worthy. But the opponent in the data-privacy invasion is not a comic-book enemy of fixed form, one that can be cornered, compromised, and defeated. Instead it's a hazy murk, a chilling, Lovecraftian murmur that can't be seen, let alone touched, let alone vanquished. Even \"the Cloud\" isn't the right metaphor, because pumping out its gaseous poison only draws in a new, cold draft of it from sources unseen. If not websites, pharmaceuticals. If not location data, household goods. If not likes or shares, bank balances and neighborhood demographics. Your data is everywhere, and nowhere, and you cannot escape it, or what it might yet do to you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-theageofprivacynihilismishere568198</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T3R-FFH1-JCG7-V28M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2832\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

Many of the owners of these fast-selling internet-connected gadgets, with 78 million bought worldwide last year alone, have wondered.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last week, we discovered the answer - quite possibly. And not by any accident. Because Alexa's owner, the giant retailer and tech firm Amazon, has thousands of staff who do nothing else.</p><p>Thanks to a Bloomberg news story, we now know that \"a mix of contractors and full-time Amazon employees who work in outposts from Boston to Costa Rica, India and Romania\" work through as many as 1000 voice recordings taken from homes and offices per person per day.</p><p>Most are banal. People ask Alexa for recipes, jokes, trivia, and \"she\" will reply. Or they ask Alexa to do things, like play music or operate connected devices to perform functions like turning off the lights, locking the door, adjusting the air conditioning, and so on.</p><p>And Alexa only activates when you call \"her\" name, or speak some other designated trigger word. So an Echo device would never record anything you didn't address to it directly, right? Not so.</p><p>The people listening for Amazon transcribe around 100 conversations a day where the Echo recorder switched itself on by mistake or for some other, unknown reason, according to Bloomberg.</p><p>And sometimes it picks up conversations that are anything but banal. Two of the staff said they heard what they believed to be a sexual assault in progress for instance. Amazon's policy in such cases is to not interfere.</p><p>Amazon says it needs all this monitoring to help improve its service. In a job ad it posted, seeking a quality assurance manager: \"This is big data handling like you've never seen it. We're creating, labelling, curating and analysing vast quantities of speech on a daily basis.\"</p><p>The company says that it carefully guards the confidentiality of its recordings of users' conversations. Trust us.</p><p>Of course, the human intercepts are in addition to the computerised monitoring and data extraction applied to all of these conversations.</p><p>And it's not just Amazon. Other virtual assistants, Google's Assistant speaking through its Home devices and Apple's Siri delivered through HomePod, also have staff listening in to their customers. Those firms also say that they carefully guard the privacy of customers. Trust us.</p><p>But make no mistake. The primary reason these digital assistants exist is not to assist you. They exist to make money for Amazon, Google and Apple. The big Japanese investment bank Mizuho predicts that these digital assistants will generate $US11 billion a year by next year.</p><p>And they are, in turn, just part of the enormous industry of extracting customers' personal data, the most valuable commodity in the world today.</p><p>\"Human experience,\" writes Shoshana Zuboff in her new book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, is the \"free raw material for hidden commercial practices of extraction, prediction and sales.\" It's free for the tech, advertising and other industries because, in our naivete, we feed it to them that way - for free, and freely.</p><p>Already, the extraction of personal data from Americans alone is yielding $US76 billion annually, up by 45 per cent over two years, according to a new study by the Democratic strategy group Future Majority. In three years it will yield more revenue than the entire US farm sector, on the current trend.</p><p>\"Data,\" Amazon's former chief scientist Andreas Weigend once said, \"are the new oil.\" Only better.</p><p>The world's most valuable companies, based on market capitalisation at the end of March, were Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Google's owner, Alphabet. Further down the top ten were Facebook and China's biggest two web-based businesses, Tencent and Alibaba. And oil? Only one oil company made it into the ten - Exxon Mobil came in at last place.</p><p>As we know from the bitter evidence of one outrage after another, these tech firms cannot be trusted to control themselves. Even when they try.</p><p>In the last few months Google has abandoned two efforts to set guidelines for itself on how to exploit artificial intelligence responsibly. The Wall Street Journal reports that they collapsed in disagreement.</p><p>But how do companies like Apple and Google and Amazon make money from the harmless speakers that sit on your living room table and answer your questions like helpful assistants?</p><p>Every clue you give your device is seized and processed by corporate HQ and while some is used to refine the service on offer, \"the rest are declared as proprietary 'behavioural suplus',\" writes Zuboff, of the Harvard Business School.</p><p>This is \"fed into machine intelligence and fabricated into prediction products that anticipate what you will do now, soon and later. Finally, these prediction products are are traded in a new kind of marketplace for behavioural predictions.\"</p><p>The aim is no longer merely to suck out data about us, says Zuboff, but to \"shape our behaviour at scale\" towards, naturally, \"profitable outcomes\". Many companies and groups are active buyers in this market. And we will never know exactly who is buying what in this marketplace, or how it will be used to shape our behaviour.</p><p>Unless, of course, government and regulators decide to take an active interest. On the current outlook, any such move will not be led by Australia, a country still trying to figure out an electric power policy and how to hook up a national broadband.</p><p>Unfortunately, here in the land of the Luddites, we are still struggling with the problems of the last century while Big Tech invisibly decides how we will live in the next. Alexa might know the answer, but \"she's\" not telling.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Hartcher is international editor.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520117771</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VWN-26X1-JBJ7-N136-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"950\"/><timeReceived>12:02 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The new \u201cTech Roundup Podcast\u201d has you covered.<br/>The Tech Roundup Podcast is part of the Federalist Society\u2019s Regulatory Transparency Project (RTP) \u201cFourth Branch Podcast Series.\u201d The goal of these podcasts is to highlight the many issues covered by the RTP\u2019s dozen working groups, which cover different aspects of administrative regulation. \u00a0<br/>I know what you\u2019re saying: Haven\u2019t we reached peak podcast? Do we really need another? Yes, we actually do! Both existing and emerging high-tech sectors are suddenly the focus of countless regulatory inquiries at the federal, state, and global level. The list of technologies and sectors coming under the political spotlight is growing: drones, driverless cars, micro-mobility options (like scooters), the Internet of Things and wearable health tech, artificial intelligence and machine-learning, big data, 3D printing, virtual reality, Bitcoin and cyptocurrencies, and so on.</p><p><br/>Our new Tech Roundup Podcast features leading policy experts debating the major legal issues surrounding various emerging technology sectors. Some of the key fault lines in today\u2019s tech policy debates include: privacy, online safety, digital free speech, cybersecurity, automation and the future of employment, intellectual property protection, competition and antitrust issues, and much more.<br/>We have already covered some of these issues in our first three shows. On the first installment of the Tech Roundup, William Rinehart, Director of Technology and Innovation Policy at the American Action Forum, hosted a conversation about \u201cThe Brave New World of\u00a0Deep\u00a0Fakes.\u201d The episode tackled the problematic issues associated with new machine learning algorithms that can be used to create synthetic videos and photos that are difficult to distinguish from reality.<br/>Will was joined on the show by Robert Chesney, Associate Dean for Academic Affairs at the University of Texas School of Law, who recently released\u00a0a major paper on this topic and its implications for policy. Matthew Feeney, Director of the Project on Emerging Technologies at the Cato Institute, also joined this episode. Both Will and Matthew are members of\u00a0the RTP working group on emerging technology, and I am the chair of that working group.<br/>Following that inaugural episode, I hosted the second and third installments of our new podcast.<br/>The second episode was on, \u201cThe Techlash: Big Tech and Antitrust.\u201d I moderated a fun debate between my old friends Hal Singer, Managing Director of Econ One, and Geoffrey A. Manne, President and Founder of the International Center for Law &amp;Economics;. Hal and Geoff engaged in a wide-raging discussion about the growing movement\u2014on both the political Left and Right\u2014to regulate or even breakup leading tech firms like Google, Facebook, and Amazon. We discussed the challenges associated with applying traditional antitrust remedies to fast-moving markets, as well as new proposals for how policymakers might intervene.<br/>Our third and most recent episode of the Tech Roundup Podcast then shifted gears to discuss the contentious world of modern privacy policy. This podcast featured a fascinating and instructive back-and-forth on the implications of California\u2019s new privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as well as efforts to expand it. I was joined on the show by privacy law gurus Ian Adams, Vice President of Policy at TechFreedom, and Joe Jerome, formerly of the Center for Democracy &amp;Technology;.<br/>Ian and Joe helped me explore the timeless question of just how much leeway should be granted to the states when it comes to regulation of technologies and markets that have a national reach. Is California setting the law of the land in the absence of federal action on privacy issues? What will this mean for interstate online commerce and speech rights? Even those of us who favor a healthy amount of devolution and state-based experimentation are a little uneasy about the growing patchwork of conflicting privacy regulatory regimes at the state level. Add to that the growing pressure from the European Union on this front and you have a recipe for a real regulatory headache. Federal action may be needed to address these conflicts of law, but federal preemption could be accompanied by a host of burdensome new mandates, as Neil Chilson pointed out in\u00a0a recent RTP white paper. \u00a0\u00a0<br/>In coming episode, we\u2019ll be expanding on these issues and also doing a\u00a0deep-dive\u00a0on many other topics, including efforts to modify Section 230, various advanced transportation policy fights (drones, driverless cars, scooters, and more), and the thorny legal and philosophical issues surrounding facial recognition tech and accusations of \u201calgorithmic bias\u201d in various AI systems.<br/>All that and much more is in the works, so I hope you will consider listening to our new Tech Roundup Podcast and subscribing to it on whatever podcast platform you use regularly. Finally, we would love to hear from you about what other topics we should be covering on the show and what we can do to make the podcast more useful to you.\u00a0\u00a0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <br/>                                 Permalink            <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://fedsoc.org/commentary/blog-posts/welcome-to-the-new-tech-roundup-podcast\">https://fedsoc.org/commentary/blog-posts/welcome-to-the-new-tech-roundup-podcast</url><br/>                                            Print                    <br/><br/>                                Email            <br/><br/>Facebook Share            <br/><br/>Twitter Share            <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-78558</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8V-SY01-DY1R-B41J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"966\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federalist Society, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Federalist Society</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 15, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Blog</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DMVO</classCode><className>EMERGING TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001960</classCode><className>PUBLIC POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX000100</classCode><className>ANTITRUST &amp;

In that time we have charted the course of the economy through the coalition government, a gruelling deficit-reduction plan, a fragile recovery from the financial crash, two referendums, two elections and now the prospect of Brexit with a new prime minister.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Our ambitions when we started this event were admittedly lofty: to help to shape an agenda for renewed prosperity in Britain. Each year we ask: how should the UK earn its living in the world, and are we on track? How can government support business better? What trends would business leaders be ill-advised to ignore?</p><p>As growth charts often show, the path to renewed prosperity is not always linear. UK employment is estimated at 76.1 per cent, the joint-highest figure on record. Unemployment is at a 45-year low. However, productivity is among the worst in Europe. And with an outlook buffeted by Brexit headwinds, business confidence is at its lowest since 2012.</p><p>What is clear, with a decade of hindsight, is that the pace of change is accelerating. Populism might have interrupted rampant globalisation, but the supranational digital revolution is exploding in terms of data generation and the sophistication of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Both cases - which are arguably interlinked - raise new, urgent questions about how we adapt and respond.</p><p>It's also clear that renewed prosperity in the UK needs to take on a very different form in the decades ahead. An inquiry into regional inequality by the UK 2070 commission warned that Britain's unbalanced economy - one of the most lopsided in the industrialised world - will harm north and south if not addressed. And a new \"millennial\" workforce is bringing cultural changes that demand to be taken seriously, including sustainability, inclusiveness and flexible working.</p><p>We will touch on many of these themes at our summit next week, which looks at reinvention through the lens of trust, talent, trade and tech. On the political front we will hear from Michael Gove and John McDonnell, and Nick Clegg makes a rare appearance from Silicon Valley to talk about regulating tech under his new Facebook guise.</p><p>Be sure to follow us for more insight from the business, policy and political leaders who have a huge impact on the way all of us live.</p><p>                   THE AGENDA                   TRUST                   The trust vacuum                                      </p><p>Our trust in traditional institutions has plummeted.

Roosevelt said of the Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza, \"but he's our son of a bitch.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just as Big Tech was beginning to reconcile itself to a swingeing regulatory crackdown, or even breakup, an even bigger supposed bogey has arrived on the scene to deflect attention from its alleged sins - China.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In answering their critics, the tech giants have long characterised themselves as an outstanding American success story; the growing standoff between the incumbent global hegemon of the US and the aspiring one of China has allowed a new way of playing the patriotic card.</p><p>Eight of the world's top twenty tech companies are now Chinese, suggesting a contest for global dominance in which the US ought to be protecting or even subsidising its own rather than breaking them up.</p><p>This line of argument has been widely deployed by Big Tech in recent months, but as it happens, it was not much in evidence during <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/07/29/mr-bezos-mute-tech-bosses-escape-marathon-washington-grilling/\">a marathon session of Congressional testimony this week</url> by the bosses of four of the US's biggest tech companies - Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/07/29/mr-bezos-mute-tech-bosses-escape-marathon-washington-grilling/\">And with good reason</url>.</p><p>Like most multinationals, the tech giants are as happy doing business with China as the US, prompting allegations of \"hypocrisy\" and \"treachery\" by one Congressman. But it is also because the argument is a red herring. </p><p>This is not to suggest that these companies should therefore be ritually dismembered in the American antitrust tradition, as some US lawmakers demand. There are many good arguments for leaving the tech giants be, not least the years of debilitating litigation that enforced breakup invariably involves-during which the market moves on and the original complaint becomes largely irrelevant. But China is the least compelling of them. </p><p>These are intensely competitive and innovative markets; Amazon, Apple and the rest would not be as successful as they are if they didn't serve consumers well. Despite the way they are demonised in the press, all of them have customer satisfaction levels which leave most older companies, never mind government-provided public services, in the shade.</p><p>They have been the big winners of the government-imposed lockdowns of the past six months. Like it or not, the economy would have struggled to cope without them. But it is not just that we need them, more so now than ever; it's also that the antitrust case against them is in truth pretty flimsy, based as it is as much on what they could potentially do as what they actually do.</p><p>For all those startups that claim to have been taken down by an abusive Big Tech, there are hundreds of others for which these platforms have been a godsend. </p><p>Big Tech neutralises the competition by buying it up, grandstanding Congressmen protested, citing Instagram, Whatsapp and YouTube as examples. Give us a break. These companies were in their infancy when bought. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg was ridiculed for the apparently extravagant price he paid for Instagram. Regulators waved the deal through without a care. Is Zuckerberg to be penalised for recognising the potential, and making such a success out of it? Much business would cease if we were to apply that logic widely.</p><p>It is an unfortunate characteristic of new industries that they tend quickly to become dominated by a small number of big players. This is particularly the case with tech, where powerful network effects are at work; the more people that use them, the more they attract others in search of compatibility. Monopoly is naturally occurring.</p><p>Yet to make the case for breakup, you have to demonstrate a positive benefit to consumers, competition, and innovation. This can only ever be supposition. It is not obvious, for instance, why separating Amazon's servers business from its retail operation, or Facebook from Instagram, would help these objectives.</p><p>But please, no more pleading the \"national champions\" cause. An idea I naively imagined had been put to bed by the debilitating experience of state directed industrial strategy in the immediate postwar period is regrettably making something of a comeback, not just as a defence of Big Tech in an age of superpower conflict, but as a desirable economic goal in itself.</p><p>Even in Britain, we see evidence of such thinking. That the UK should jeopardise a decent trade deal with the EU for the sake of remaining free to dole out state aid to political obsessions and favoured \"champions\", as Dominic Cummings, the Prime Minister's chief adviser, seems minded, is beyond ridiculous. Governments do not have a good record in backing winners. </p><p>Nor is it a good idea for governments to hitch their wagons to any particular corporate interest; to deliberately favour one over another is not just corrupt, it also discourages competition, and therefore innovation and diversity in the economy, ultimately making it less resilient.</p><p>Sometimes regulators need to step in to ensure markets remain open and honest. To maintain the public's trust, the tech giants must learn to self regulate and pay their taxes, or they will indeed end up going the same way as the railroad barons, AT&amp;T, IBM and other targets of America's penchant for taking down the economically overmighty.</p><p>With great power comes responsibility; most of the evidence is that Bezos, Zuckerberg et al have taken these lessons on board.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-64855695</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GG-1R21-F021-63PM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"885\"/><timeReceived>7:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

In the last few weeks, the discussion about \"interest free\" financing via credit card became news, but the measure is only a small sample of what is under discussion. In Brazil, banks are above all pragmatic. They defend their businesses and their gains, but when they realize that the tide is turning they let themselves be carried and embrace the new ideas as if they had been in favor of them since the beginning. </p><p>It was like that, for example, with payroll loans, which began at smaller banks, in Minas Gerais, with strong support at the time of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB). It was also like that with the recent growth of fintech firms. Today, the two largest private-sector banks, Ita\u00fa and Bradesco, maintain centers dedicated to startups and innovation companies, Cubo and Habitat. The tide showed banks that these tech companies would bring the new wave of competition in the sector, and not traditional financial institutions. Embracing innovative ideas and supporting smaller companies allowed the Brazilian banks to begin preparing for a much bigger fight on the horizon: the dispute with big tech companies, such as Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple. Just like media companies, which had to learn to work with these tech firms in a model of competition and partnership at the same time, so do these banks. Last week, for example, Bradesco announced its partnership with Google Pay for account holders who have Visa credit card. The Android app allows paying for purchases without the need of the plastic card or typing PIN. Enough putting the smartphone close to the merchant's point-of-sale terminal - the NFC connectivity allows wireless and secure communication between nearby devices. Apple is expected to launch its Apple Pay soon in Brazil - its website displays the logo of Ita\u00fa. The Central Bank is closely monitoring the technological evolution and has been making a series of changes in the rules to allow these advances not to be restricted to the banks' environment, but to reach consumers and companies. The card industry has been receiving special attention. The goal is to have the debit card in fact used as method of payment. To expand its use, it will be necessary to reduce the transaction fee, now a percentage on the value of the transaction that is divided into three components: the card brand's fee, an interchange fee charged by the banks and a cost charged by the merchant acquirer, the company that operates the terminals capturing the transactions. With the arrival of new companies in the acquiring market, such as Eleven and Stone, part of that fee was already reduced. But it is still necessary to discuss the interchange fee charged by banks and that is negotiated between the card brand and the financial institution. In countries such as the US, the fee charged in debit-card transactions is mixed, that is, it includes a fixed amount per transaction and a percentage over the volume of the transaction - $0.20 plus 0.05% of the transaction. The charge is regulated by the government. One expert explains there is room for the Brazilian Central Bank to put pressure on lenders to lower their fees because in a sale with debit card the money is available in the buyer's checking account. There is no credit risk. \"It makes no sense having fees for debit and credit so close if the risk of one method and the other is so different.\" In the case of credit card, there is a lot of controversy about a possible end of the interest-free card financing. The focus of the discussion, however, is of giving transparency to the interest that is included in the transaction - whether it is paid by the consumer to the merchant or to the bank, which would begin to offer a credit facility in the card. Just like the end of hyperinflation led to a cycle of adjustments in banks and retailers, the new phase of lower interest rates is also likely to cause a re-accommodation. Some large retail chains now have an important part of their gains linked to the charge of interest in financed sales, via credit card or not. It is natural, therefore, that big retailers and banks engage in an arms-wrestling to see who will keep that gain. The final design may be that of a purchase having a lower price for upfront payment and two prices for financing via card - one with the interest rate charged by the merchant and another with the rate charged by the bank that extended the credit. Nothing is defined yet. Several designs are being studied and in all the expectation is a reduction in the timeframe for payment to the retailer, now of 30 days. For companies, the government has been working since last year in formatting the electronic trade bill - which now entered the package of measures of President Michel Temer to replace the vacuum left by the pension reform. The trade bill will be linked to the tax databases of state finance secretariats. The goal is to match the physical transaction to the commercial and financial transaction, without the need of validation by notary offices. That lowers the bureaucracy and the cost (with expected reduction in rates charges for advances on receivables) and increases the transparency and the formality. The electronic trade bill will be optional - the traditional one will continue being accepted across the country. After all, as one source following the process says, technology has greatly advanced and continues advancing, but one can't forget that Brazil has large regional differences. It is not possible to compare the technological infrastructure of Faria Lima Avenue, the financial hub in S\u00e3oPaulo, with that of a city in the heart of the Amazon. What is possible to say is that in five years the relation of consumers and companies with methods of payment and credit will be totally different from the current one.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VALORI-5351171</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VALORI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RRY-52T1-DYNN-T0CC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433836</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1001\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Valor Economico S.A.

I thought reading history would give me better insights into the future. The trouble with sci-fi is that it always predicts 10 out of the next three technological innovations. The future is never as weird in reality as it is in sci-fi. Yet there was a flaw in my strategy. If the future is actually being made by sci-fi readers, ignorance of the genre may be a fatal blind spot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A couple of weeks ago I had dinner in San Francisco with a bright young crypto crowd. Crypto is short for crypto-currency, which is the best known use for blockchain, or distributed ledger, technology. The most famous crypto-currency is bitcoin. Crypto is the cool thing these days. The cool people who were at Facebook when it was cool and who before that were at Google when it was cool are now into crypto.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Steering the conversation away from blockchain and towards my uncool comfort zone, I asked if crypto people still read books. Yes, of course, but mostly science fiction. Such as? Well, obviously, Snow Crash, my host replied, in the way that I might once have said: \"Well, obviously, The Day of the Triffids\" - or Fahrenheit 451 or A Clockwork Orange, which were my favourite works of sci-fi when I was a kid.</p><p>I'd never heard of Snow Crash because it was published in 1992, long after I kicked the sci-fi habit. It turns out that the novel - by the American author Neal Stephenson - was once required reading for new Facebook recruits. I've now read it. So should you. And so should all those senators and representatives who wasted two days last week asking <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>questions that were either easy for him to answer or easy for him to duck.</p><p>Snow Crash is set in an unspecified but not too distant future, so perhaps around now, more than a quarter-century after its publication. As with all sci-fi, quite a bit of the predicted future hasn't come about (you guessed it: flying cars - still waiting). But an unusually large proportion has.</p><p>There are two worlds: reality and the Metaverse. Reality is a decaying, Balkanised America, a land in which the federal government has ceded much of its power to corporations, foreign interests (\"Mr Lee's Greater Hong Kong\") and organised crime. The rich inhabit fortified \"burbclaves\". The poor live in containers. The privatised highways are so clogged with traffic that deliveries are made by cyber-punks on skateboards. Everyone's armed to the teeth. There's even a character with a nuclear torpedo in his Harley-Davidson's sidecar.</p><p>The Metaverse, by contrast, is the next iteration of the internet: a multiplayer, virtual-reality mega-game populated by avatars, accessible through special goggles.</p><p>The defining characteristic of both worlds is that everybody's private information is readily available, not only to the CIC (Central Intelligence Corporation), the for-profit organisation formed by the CIA's merger with the Library of Congress, but also to whoever is willing to pay the CIC.</p><p>In other words, even if the highways of 2018 are not quite as Mad Max or Blade Runner as Stephenson imagined, much else about Snow Crash is eerily familiar. Globalisation having hollowed out most of the US economy, there are now \"only four things we do better than anyone else: music, movies, microcode (software), high-speed pizza delivery\".</p><p>With astounding prescience, Stephenson imagines not only virtual reality - those VR goggles now exist and are on sale from Facebook-owned Oculus - but also Google Earth: \"a piece of CIC software called, simply, Earth . . . [used] to keep track of every bit of spatial information that it owns - all the maps, weather data, architectural plans and satellite surveillance stuff\".</p><p>Artificial intelligence is here too. \"For the most part I write myself,\" explains an automated online search engine. \"That is, I have the innate ability to learn from experience. But this ability was originally coded into me by my creator.\"</p><p>The plot of Snow Crash hinges on the utter failure of the government to keep up with technology and the ability of bad actors to infect people's brains (not just their avatars) with malware.</p><p>The character of L Bob Rife personifies Big Tech unbound. \"Y'know, watching government regulators trying to keep up with the world is my favourite sport. Remember when they busted up Ma Bell [as the US telephone monopoly used to be known]? . . . They were in the same business as me. The information business. Moving phone conversations around on little tiny copper wires, one at a time. Government busted them up - at the same time when I was starting cable TV franchises in thirty states. Haw! Can you believe that? It's like if they figured out a way to regulate horses at the same time the [Ford] Model T and the airplane were being introduced.\"</p><p>L Bob's dastardly masterplan is to infect the minds of all network users with Snow Crash, which is the mental equivalent of a complete hard-drive failure. (Stephenson got the idea when his early Apple Mac \"crashed and wrote gibberish\", producing \"something that looked vaguely like static on a broken television set\".)</p><p>What exactly is Snow Crash, asks the lead male character, Hiro Protagonist. \"Is it a virus, a drug or a religion?\"</p><p>\"What's the difference?\" replies his former girlfriend.</p><p>I'm not saying that Zuckerberg is L Bob Rife. Nor am I saying Facebook is the CIC. I am saying that the people who questioned Zuckerberg so ineffectually on Capitol Hill last week need to read Snow Crash. And maybe they also need to stop taking campaign contributions from Facebook. Since 2014 Facebook has contributed a total of $641,685 to all but 16 of the 105 members of Congress that Zuckerberg faced last week.</p><p>Senator Orrin Hatch (Republican): \"How do you sustain a business model in which users don't pay for your service?\"</p><p>Zuckerberg: \"Senator, we run ads.\"</p><p>Senator Lindsey Graham (R): \"You don't feel like you have a monopoly?\"</p><p>Zuckerberg: \"It certainly doesn't feel like that to me.\" [Laughter.]</p><p>Well, duh.</p><p>Here are four reasons why much tougher questions were warranted last week. If you ever signed up for Facebook, hundreds of advertisers have your contact information, and Facebook has your entire contacts list, not to mention a complete list of all the times you logged in, which device you used and where you were. If you are an Android user, Facebook also logs your call and text history. If you log off Facebook, it can still track your browsing activity. And even if you never signed up for Facebook, the company may still have a \"shadow profile\" of you.</p><p>\"Congress is good at doing two things,\" Congressman Billy Long told Zuckerberg last week. \"Doing nothing and overreacting.\" He forgot about regulating horses.</p><p>In my naivety I thought last week that the game was finally up for Facebook. Having effectively turned a blind eye to the antics of both the Russians and Cambridge Analytica, Zuckerberg seemed certain to be roasted alive. Instead we got the political equivalent of Snow Crash.Niall Ferguson is the Milbank Family senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-43152766</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S3R-YY41-JCJY-G4SC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1175\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 15, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Talkington has managed several startups, including a medical-device company, for Red Bear Venture.</p><p>Now that Nanomoneao has found a supportive home, finding the talent it needs is a main concern for Talkington, The company is hiring Ph.D.-level research scientists and engineers with experience with sensors, programming, nanoparticles, and organic molecules.</p><p>The company has hired one research scientist and is in the process of hiring another, Talkington said.</p><p>To apply, send a resume and cover letter to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:amrtalk@nanomoneo.com\">amrtalk@nanomoneo.com</email>, or use the company\u2019s job posting on LinkedIn.</p><p>Nanomoneo also is looking to hire college and high school students as interns, Talkington said.</p><p>The company is taking internship applications from UA students at Handshake, an online platform that links college students to internships and jobs.</p><p>Meanwhile, Techletics is developing a patent-pending, mobile health application called MyPostureLife that uses the embedded sensors of a smartphone to track and improve posture \u2014 with no other additional device.</p><p>The founding members of Techletics are Nadav Gerson, CEO; Jan Halozan, chief technology officer; Mike Durham, chief strategy officer; and Nate McFall, chief marketing officer.</p><p>BIOSA SPONSORS OV INCUBATOR SPOT</p><p>In more news from UACI, the Biotechnology Industry Organization of Southern Arizona (BIOSA) will fund admission for one of the first members of its new biotech-focused incubator site in Oro Valley.</p><p>As winner of the \u201cUACI Sponsored Launch Fueled by BIOSA\u201d competition, one biotech startup company will receive a sponsored year\u2019s admission at the UACI at Oro Valley.</p><p>Included with entrance into the incubator program and space at the new location, the startup will also be awarded a cash prize of $5,000. The total package value is $15,000 and funded by BIOSA.</p><p>Application submissions are open through Oct. 14. After a review and interview process, the winning team will be announced on Nov. 2.</p><p>For more information and to apply, visit tucne.ws/1ft4.</p><p>TECH EXPO GOES VIRTUAL</p><p>Like many other events, the Southern Arizona Tech + Business Expo is going online for its eighth annual edition on Oct. 7.</p><p>Sponsored by the Arizona Technology Council and the Arizona Commerce Authority, the daylong program will be held via VirBELA, an online collaboration platform.</p><p>The event will include a keynote speech by Roy Donelson of Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense and feature exhibitors in optics, biotech, mining, aviation, defense, robotics, aerospace and information technology.</p><p>The cost to attend is $20 for Tech Council members and $40 for non-members; preregistration and a software download is required.

A well-known fact is a body of economic information which is pretty much known to all market participants and has been acted on by almost everyone with available capital. Former Intel (NASDAQ:INTC[1]) CEO Andy Grove use to say, 'when everyone knows something is so, nobody's knows nothin'.' Today there are several well-known facts that we believe are leading investors down a destructive path. Fact No. 1: Data mining and artificial intelligence will change the worldInvestors have been so jacked up about data mining and artificial intelligence that they have distorted nearly every major U.S. stock market sector. </p><p>Anybody who can walk while chewing gum knows that data mining and A.I. are in use, and the companies connected to it trade for 100 times profits (if they have any). The S...00 Index is loaded with tech stocks that would be at the heart of this phenomena, and Invesco is giving us nightmares with advertisements to invest in the QQQ exchange-traded fund. The QQQ is comprised of the 100 largest Nasdaq companies and gives a little purer heroin to tech-hungry buyers of the well-known fact. George Gilder, in his book, \"Life After Google,\" argues that data mining and A.I. should begin to suffer from diminishing marginal utility going forward. Regardless of whether he is right or not, the price you pay to be on the data mining and A.I. train make five to 10-year investment success unlikely. Fact No. 2: Home building is driven by affordability This might be the dumbest well-known fact the markets have ever bought into. Investments do well when purchased at an affordable moment. Stocks were affordable in 2009. Most investors were afraid of them and nobody had an urge to manufacture new ones via initial public offerings (IPOS). In 2018, common stocks as a group are very unaffordable. Despite the lack of affordability, there are the most low-quality IPOs this year as any year in the last 20 (See chart below) [1]:The same is true in houses. Standalone residences were the most affordable to buy in 2011 as in any year of my adult life. We built 320,000 in the year 2011. They were the least affordable in the 1970s and 1980s, and we built one million homes many of those years with 65% of the existing population base. There is an inverse correlation between home building and affordability. Fact No. 3: Big tech will avoid antitrust scrutiny There is a well-known fact that goes like this: 'Since search, social media and e-commerce delivery is basically free and is benefitting the consumer, the public doesn't need to be protected from the anti-competitive behavior.' Under this flawed and very selfish logic, controlling 80% of the profits in advertising through social media or search is acceptable to the masses. Selling things online and delivering them at a loss to drive traffic to your cloud business seems to be fine with those who aren't worried about the massive long-term dislocation it could cause in our economy. In the eyes of the kings and queens of tech, as long as they conquer the world, it is the job of our ever-inflated U.S. government bureaucracy to take care of everyone dislocated by these anticompetitive activities. The fallout from this well-known fact is all over the news. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB[2]) has used its monopoly in social media to brainwash the masses, violate the public's long-lost privacy and then claim to not have had any idea what they were doing. In effect, we are a nation of Ed Saverins, the buddy of Facebook's CEO who almost got swindled out of his share of the company. He had to go to court and so will the public to right the wrong. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG[3]) Google gets 80% of the profits in search and arguably knows more about you than your spouse or the federal government. They control your privacy and shut out competitors in every non-search business in which they operate. Expedia's (EXPE) largest expense item is Google advertising and their biggest competitor is Google themselves. I'm sure Google never uses what they know about Expedia to do more in travel commissions each year than Expedia does. Amazon has a massive market share in e-commerce and in cloud services, which we mentioned is not mutually exclusive. We assume their e-commerce business is among the nation's three largest users of the cloud (pornography, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX[4]) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN[5]) e-commerce). Therefore, who can compete in e-commerce when someone like Amazon can lose money on most deliveries? Amazon's AWS division gets a cut of each dollar of e-commerce revenue. The Wall Street Journal has weighed in on the activities of these three companies as follows: 'U.S. tech companies are increasingly facing a backlash from consumers, businesses and politicians about the widespread exploitation of personal data. In Europe the regulatory remediation has gone further, but action in the U.S. seems inevitable too.' [2] Fact No. 4: There is a recession out there which will hurt Main Street From 2000 to 2003, we had a recession in the U.S. when the dot-com technology bubble broke. We could do that again, but every region built around tech suffered while the rest of the country enjoyed continued economic growth. We believe a curse surrounds the expensive coastal cities and market readers are confusing a needed correction in Seattle, San Francisco, Boston, New York and Miami, with a national residential real estate correction. There is no correlation between affordability and home building in the last 60 years (see chart below) [3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/11/20/414172-15427371031943102_origin.png\">https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/11/20/414172-15427371031943102_origin.png</url> We believe the economy of the U.S. will be about what Steve Case calls, 'The Rise of the Rest.' Tech employees who see their parent company's stock decline will ask to move to affordable areas of the country where water and Wi-Fi are inexpensive and readily available. The well-known fact is that millennials want to be in the coastal cities even after they marry and have kids. Eventually, their stagnant paychecks and the need to own a home will send them elsewhere in the country. Home building will boom in the other 85% of the places people in America live. Welcome to the next big thing, a huge intra-country migration to the flyover states. In conclusion, we think the stock market is loaded with well-known facts and these facts are there to be taken advantage of by discerning, patient and long-duration investors! We are grateful for your attention and hope you all have a great Thanksgiving holiday. [1] The Wall Street Journal (IPO Market Has Never Been This Forgiving to Money-Losing Firms[6]).

There would also be 'very significant financial penalties'. The regulator's office would be similar to the Office of the Digital Safety Commissioner that Denis Naughten had, in January, promised would be established this year. But the Taoiseach is refusing to commit to it. Fianna F\u00e1il will introduce its social media regulator Bill after the D\u00e1il's summer recess.</p><p>The establishment of such an office will be one of a number of issues discussed with the Government in the upcoming Budget negotiations to ensure the money is there to fund it, said Mr Dooley.</p><p>The Government's target of an Office of the Digital Safety Commissioner for later this year was abandoned when ministers launched their coolly received Action Plan for Online Safety last week.</p><p>The Government said that setting up the office was more complex than expected and would require international cooperation.</p><p>But now Mr Dooley has said Fianna F\u00e1il will push the plan ahead amid demands for such an office by child safety groups horrified by the revelations about Facebook on Channel 4's Dispatches.</p><p>With a similar Bill to create a Digital Safety Commissioner having already been introduced by Sinn F\u00e9in - and the Labour Party and Social Democrats demanding such an office too - the Government is facing a surefire defeat in the D\u00e1il on the issue.</p><p>Mr Dooley said that while Fianna F\u00e1il supports the principles of Sinn F\u00e9in's Bill to establish a Digital Safety Commissioner, the party does not believe it goes far enough as it does not outline the financial penalties needed to bring 'those people to heel'.</p><p>Sinn F\u00e9in's Bill is based on a Law Reform Commission recommendation but Mr Dooley said his party wants to strengthen the watchdog so it can hit firms with substantial financial penalties if they are found in breach of the independent watchdog's rules.</p><p>he said.: 'We agree with the principles, He said: 'We agree with the principles, but it doesn't go far enough in terms of setting out fines and penalties.' The Fianna F\u00e1il Bill would establish the office of a social media regulator and give them 'very substantial powers to develop a regulatory regime which is appropriate, and then to regulate and police the industry'. 'And then to have available to them very significant financial penalties for failure to respect the independent rules that will be established by that office.' Fianna F\u00e1il is still working on its Bill but says these penalties would be a percentage of the social media company's turnover.</p><p>This is similar to what the European Commission does when it sanctions companies. 'They base it on percentage of turnover,' Mr Dooley said.</p><p>Minimum limits will be set but these fines could have the potential to run into the 'multiples of millions'.</p><p>The Sinn F\u00e9in Bill to establish a Digital Safety Commissioner passed the second of five stages in the D\u00e1il earlier this year and is to go to committee stage after the summer recess.</p><p>Mr Dooley said if that Bill reaches committee stage before Fianna F\u00e1il has the opportunity to introduce its own proposals to the House, Fianna F\u00e1il would table amendments to the Sinn F\u00e9in proposal so the office had the power to impose 'very significant fines and sanctions'.</p><p>'So we will either introduce our own, or bring forward amendments to that [Sinn F\u00e9in] Bill.' The pledge to force through a social media regulator comes after the Channel 4 Dispatches documentary showed Facebook moderators allowing videos of child assaults, bullying, animal cruelty and self-harm to remain on its site.</p><p>The Government has flipflopped on the establishment of a Digital Safety Commissioner here in recent months.</p><p>Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said last week he believed social media companies are mostly doing a good job of regulating their sites.</p><p>'I think, in fairness to the big tech companies that are active online, any time I meet them, they are very in tune to this issue.' On Wednesday, the Taoiseach described the Channel 4 documentary's findings as 'shocking and most unacceptable'. While he suggested the Government would examine whether 'legislative mechanisms' would allow a system of fines to be brought in, he stopped short of committing the Government to doing so or to recommencing the plan to create a Digital Safety Commissioner's Office.</p><p>Se\u00e1n Sherlock, Labour's justice spokesman, yesterday reiterated his call to the Government to proceed with the appointment of a Digital Safety Commissioner.</p><p>He told RT\u00c9 Radio: 'This is something that [Mr Naughten] promised in January of this year.</p><p>'They subsequently announced the Action Plan for Online Safety last week and he rowed back on that promise, and there is no mention to any great extent of a Digital Safety Commissioner.</p><p>'I think he needs to take that on board now. I think we need to provide for the regulation of the online space now.' Several figures from children's charities and organisations also backed these calls, and Tanya Ward of the Children's Rights Alliance said: 'I think the Channel 4 programme proves the reason we need a Digital Safety Commissioner.' Communications Minister Denis Naughten was due to meet Facebook chiefs in New York last night to discuss the scandal.</p><p>One source said last night: 'Everyone wants him to put it up to Facebook, but that is just not going to happen.</p><p>'They employ too many people and their growing presence in Ireland is just too important to want to be the man who puts that into doubt.</p><p>'However, he is going to have to at least go through the motions and ask the odd difficult question. He is also going to have to seek assurances.' After the Dispatches investigation, Mr Naughten said he is 'deeply concerned' about the revelations. He said: 'The programme\u2026 raises serious questions for the company in respect of the manner in which it handles reports of harmful or illegal content carried on its platform.' Mr Naughten also said it raises questions about the way it moderates content. He said: 'Clearly Facebook has failed to meet the standards the public rightly expects of it'.</p><p>Comment - Page 14 <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:emmajane.hade@dailymail.ie\">emmajane.hade@dailymail.ie</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Facebook's policy of regulator 'very substantial powers ...

He's the Chief Equity Strategist at Wells Fargo Funds. And, John, great to have you with us here in the middle of earning seasons, squarely in the middle of the second quarter earning season.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's take stock of where we are as the big tech companies reporting last week, some financial companies reporting as well. Just give us the lay of the land as you see it as these results to continue to come in.</p><p>MANLEY: All the way from benign to good. I think the numbers are coming in pretty well. The revenue numbers are starting to surprise, which is sort of interesting. And this is giving large to something that a lot of people thought that profits were so high, they couldn't go higher even if the economy got better.</p><p>Well, the revenues, Tom, we were seeing a better economy and the profit numbers are just what they. They're saying things are getting better.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. But, John, at the same, a lot of these aren't cost cuts. I know the revenue is a strong kind of indication that things are getting better. But what if we were loved in a false sense of security because it's all cost cuts and not actual growth?</p><p>MANLEY: Any sense of security in the stock market is a false sense of security. Of course, we have done this long this long enough. But ultimately, it will prove me false.</p><p>However, what you're seeing are just early stages. Ideally, what corporation should do is make themselves into very, very efficient machines. And that's what they've done. And then build it that way and the economy will come. This is the United States over here. We still have -- I wouldn't call pens up to me. We have natural exam.</p><p>People came to the United States. Our ancestors came from the United States to have more. We're willing to work for it in most cases. And I think what happens is we put the problems 10 years ago further and further behind us. And yes, a little bit of stimulation from the fed. You get yourself a pretty decent economy. And if that happens that just poured over an efficient machine, I mean, profits come out of it.</p><p>LACQUA: Is it really only a little bit of stimulus from the fed? What happens if they actually move too quickly? I mean, they telegraphed, right, that they are starting to normalize. But what happens if companies are not ready for it?</p><p>MANLEY: They'll stop -- they'll stop doing it. One of the things that I have a chat (ph), you know, says a few weeks ago was that she gets - - she's aware. She knows there's a risk in stimulating too quickly or not stimulating enough. She knows there's a risk in how they unwind the balance sheet. She knows the risk of inflation. She knows the risk of deflation.</p><p>Now, she may not know exactly the road or the path to follow down on the way to recovery, but she knows to look for any misstep on her part. Anything she's done that possibly could derail. So, I guess what I can say about Janet Yellen is sure, she may be wrong but she won't be wrong for long and that's really what matters to the markets.</p><p>GURA: John, what's your sense of the degree to which this Fed Reserve, this Federal Open Market Committee is paying attention to the market? How big a concern is that for them?</p><p>MANLEY: I think they read the papers and, obviously, they listen to some very good radio broadcast from time to time. They have to be aware. I mean, you know, it's like asking your doctor did he read the thermometer after he test you.</p><p>We're pretty didn't care to what's going on. We're not perfect. We bounce around in awful lot. But we're pretty good in here.</p><p>And now, I think it's also important to remember, the fed and the capital markets and the economy are linked, because when the fed wants to push money at the economy, it goes through us first. So then let's think of it as a pipe carrying out, in or out of the economy. They sort of look at us, they get an obvious sign as money headed the right direction And, you know, they see a meltdown in stock market a little bit, they know that's can't be good for the rest of the real world.</p><p>The same thing is true for housing and a few others things. Look at what wealth is doing. If wealth is being created or at least maintained, they've got to feel reasonably comfortable.</p><p>GURA: And look at the soft data, you look the surveys, how businesses feel, their willingness to hire, their willingness to expand. And it seems like there is still a gap between the soft data and the hard data.</p><p>As you look at these earnings reports, what's the sense that you have of when the two are going to meet? Where we're going to see companies try to invest more in CAPEX?</p><p>MANLEY: I think you're starting to see -- I think what you have to realize too is that when -- it probably happen quickly because we're still on a fairly competitive landscape. And so far, it's been better for corporations who are competing against other corporations to buyback shares, to reinvest in their businesses by buying into their businesses. That doesn't have capacity obviously.</p><p>But at some point in time, it's not because the companies want to do it, it's because their consumers are demanding more of their products. If you and I are competing and I see you beginning to pick up share because you expand a little bit, watch out quickly, I would start my CAPEX of them.</p><p>LACQUA: John, are market merger is good for evaluations or bad?</p><p>MANLEY: Well, it depends on merger it has.</p><p>LACQUA: I know, in the industry, but -- because, you know, in general, just full of desperation.</p><p>MANLEY: I think that merge is to create synergy without being tremendously destructive to jobs, to create more efficient, more logical corporations are generally good. You don't want restraining the trade. I don't want restraining the trade. You do want efficiencies. You do want logical structures to a degree they foster that, I think it's fine. You just always keep your eyes open. There's nothing wrong with regulation. It's just got to be done, you know, a fair, even-handed way.</p><p>LACQUA: John, you know, we went into 2017, looking at Brexit, looking at President Trump. And there was this wave of anti-populism of -- or populism anti-globalization. Should that do anything to stock markets?</p><p>MANLEY: Well, it hasn't. I mean, there's an old saying, expect the worse and you'll never be disappointed. And the things to market has not been disappointed this year.</p><p>People talk about the lack of downside volatility. The only explanation for that is there have been non-negative surprises or any consequence. Well, so many negative things that come out of Washington or (inaudible) or even Berlin or Paris, how can one say there aren't negative surprises? Of course, there are negative.</p><p>Well, the thing is it's not a surprise. I think investors have a fairly low expectation, maybe a very low expectation of what comes out of Washington or Berlin or Britain. And I think in that respect, it's going to be pretty hard to disappoint us.]</p><p>GURA: Let me ask about financials in particular. A number of banks have reported already. How enthusiastic are you about financial stocks at this point? And how radically have they sort of trigged around from where we're a few years back?</p><p>MANLEY: Well, 40 years ago, I made choices from my life amongst them, so --</p><p>GURA: Yes.</p><p>MANLEY: -- we're very intimate with financial stocks and financial corporations and all the big -- it can be the best business and the worst business in the world. And believe me, I've seen both.</p><p>I think what you have to look for is reasonable regulation. There is no way that banks or financial institutions should be wide open. On the other hand, regulation go too far. You look for just the amount of regulation that seems to be moving in the right direction.</p><p>Interest rates also have corporations when they're facing very, very low rates, have a very difficult time placing fees on things that should have fees on them. If that's the case, their earnings power is being starved. Higher rates to a degree, it doesn't represent real fed tightening allows financial corporations to charge those fees, right adjustable fees that tends to improve their profitability. I think that part still in front of them.</p><p>GURA: Let me ask you how much personality matters. We spent some time this morning on television talking about Stuart Gulliver who is outgoing head of HSBC. You look at who's heading up these banks now. You can say few more years left and a lot of these guys who are running these banks. And how worried are you about transition? How much do you associate performances, the big bangs in particular with the men, largely men who are running those companies?</p><p>MANLEY: That's really good question. I don't know the straight answer I can give you. I think a character. When I invest my money over the long term, I know I can't possibly know what's going to happen in 5, 10 years. But I can look at the corporate culture, I guess that's where giving else. A good corporate culture should have depth, strong managers, truly strong managers, shouldn't be afraid of having people alongside them from replacing. That's the whole idea.</p><p>And I think that's a good way to buy stocks. You might want to find a good industry. But find a good industry that's being run by good men and women, who bring up good men and women internally. And I think you have -- it could be a fair of good investment.</p><p>LACQUA: And so, you have that in financials done or are you just talking about another industry?</p><p>MANLEY: We're talking industries in general and some financials --</p><p>LACQUA: Right.</p><p>MANLEY: I'm not assuming bad that I don't believe you.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. So which industries do you think are doing better in terms of succession but also, you know, having fewer legacy issues?</p><p>MANLEY: Well, the fundamentals were -- I think the fundamentals will come through. I think health care is a great sort of hard (ph) parts had collision between an Asian population like myself, improving health care, technology, and representative markers that can vote the money towards the people who need it.</p><p>I think technology, which we've been talking about, business to business technology, I think you're going to see wage pressures in the next few years. And the only way to cheapskates around corporations are going to let that go through is that they can prove productivity somehow, and that means spending on technology.</p><p>We mentioned financials, and for sure down in our value, I still think, well it was pretty good place to be. I'm focused on the big high quality large paying dividend stocks in the oil industry.</p><p>LACQUA: And those are mainly, which ones?</p><p>MANLEY: Well, I can't name them.</p><p>LACQUA: No, I know you can't. But is it -- on which end, is it refinery or is it actually downstream?</p><p>MANLEY: Well, the ones that are integrated, say a little bit of both.</p><p>LACQUA: All right.</p><p>GURA: We'll leave it there, John Manley. We'll come back with John Manley here in a just a moment. Maybe talk a bit more about Washington, its effects on policy, a little bit more on central banking as well. John Manley, Chief Equities Strategist at Wells Fargo joining us here on Bloomberg 1130 studios on Bloomberg Surveillance.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>GURA: David Gura and Francine Lacqua, Tom Keene off today. This is Bloomberg Surveillance on Bloomberg Radio. Brought to you by Invesco for concise market and economic insights, delivered to your inbox weekly, count on Invesco Global Market Strategist, Kristina Hooper, invesco.com/hooper to learn more.</p><p>Continuing our conversation here with John Manley, Chief Equities Strategist at Wells Fargo Funds. And, John, let me just ask you about what we're seeing play out in Washington, D.C. The result of this optimism after the election after the inauguration, safe to say, some of that is anticipated. Why are we not seeing more of a market move as a result of that?</p><p>MANLEY: Well, fundamentals are getting better. I mean that -- ex Washington, you're seeing earnings expectations arise after a long period of time where they really went nowhere. Also, the fed is being beneficial I guess is the right word. The fed is being very careful about what they do there. Shown very, very strong high levels of awareness about what they do. And the valuations aren't that bad.</p><p>I think the -- how shall I put this? The intricacies of Donald Trump presidency were probably discounted the first 12 hours as president-elect. And after that, we probably didn't have much expectation. We may say things but I don't think we really believed or counted on him. So hence, no negative surprises.</p><p>GURA: How about the fed's balance sheet? We've got more detail from the fed on how that's going to unfold, when it does begin to unfold the last meeting relatively soon. It was the watch phrase that came out of the statement following it. How that's that going to play out in your world? How that's going to play in the equities space in particular?</p><p>MANLEY: Well, it's a risk and therefore I think it proceed slowly. Jenny Donell (ph) was on recently saying, you know, we don't really know exactly how this is going to play because we've never done something like this before. What does a wise person, what does a wise man or woman do when they're in an unknown territory? They move slowly and carefully and they check every step they make. And I think that's what's going to happen. I think a lot of lessons from the real world are going to be applied in the financial world.</p><p>No guarantees right. Maybe these are undoable but I think a lot of things that were supposedly undoable have gotten done in the last few years. So, I think this -- it will work. I'm optimistic. I think the fed will be very, very careful in how they proceed.</p><p>LACQUA: What do you mean by lessons, John? So, you're talking about lessons from the real world being transferred in the financial world.</p><p>MANLEY: Well, I mean -- I'm just taking at -- act the way you would in real life. If you're on a dark path and you don't know where you are, you don't take big steps, you take small steps and check your footing every single step along the way. That's what Janet Yellen will do the financial code (ph) enough in my opinion.</p><p>LACQUA: Right. But the problem is that then financial stocks are always on notaire, right? They're going from record high to record high. What about then pausing and having a look right, left and center?</p><p>MANLEY: Sure. I mean I think that's possible. I've learned enough to -- since I can't really predict 5 percent or 10 percent pullbacks with any sort of accuracy, I just sort of assumed they're a part, they're a cost of earning equities for the long term. I think it's a worthwhile cost which I think equities and the delivers as pure return over a long period of time to very patient investors.</p><p>But you cannot expect to know every little wiggle and twist is going to be. So it could easily be a 5 percent correction because of something that goes slightly wrong, a 10 percent correction. But I think it will be done right at the end of the day. And when it's done right, there's a lot of room for these stocks to be meaningfully higher.</p><p>GURA: John Manley, we've talked about financials a few minutes ago. Let me ask about a couple of other sectors. I'll start with technology. When you look at tech with large, do you think that it's fairly valued right now?</p><p>MANLEY: If I understood half of it, I'd probably say it was fairly -- you know, the really big ones are really expensive ones --</p><p>GURA: Yes.</p><p>MANLEY: -- there's a lesson to those. I learned this back in the late '90s. The valuations may be frightening. The valuations maybe frightening but evaluations at the end of the day isn't what's it. The valuations will not tell you. They may win you.</p><p>Every time I've seen a highly valued, high growth country or company or industry blow up solely because valuation, it was like watching a man fall down and up escalator. You may fall but you get pulled harder, almost always buying opportunities. And I saw that to the late '90s.</p><p>And it's because the surprise is -- if stock goes down and the earnings expectations go up, you sort of have a correction double click in the stock. All right, it was ahead of itself is now 30 percent cheaper. People buy into it. You go tweet this a few times. People become less ordered by valuations.</p><p>So, watch valuations always they can trip you up but I don't think it's more than a trip. Focus, I would say, on the business to business -- the real spending in tech over the next several years is going to be by business to make their workers more productive so they can pay them more.</p><p>GURA: And thank you very much there would be escalated. Let me ask you lastly about health care. We're a point where the government -- where the administration is evaluating whether or not to continue with a subsidies on some levels of insurance. Obviously, had the big debate over health care. Your keen on health care overall, when you look at this as a sector?</p><p>MANLEY: Right. You know, falling down and not escalate naturally leads to health care, I would say. Yes, I think too, it's a great story. To me, it is a business where you have rising demand, you have rising supply of things that can be done, and you have an electoral process. Let's people vote themselves into healthcare.</p><p>Health care is percent of GDP, I think, must or will have to rise. That's my opinion.</p><p>LACQUA: John, pretty quickly. Are you concerned about China? We seem to be in the benign belief that China is fine. What if it were and what is that do to U.S. stocks?</p><p>MANLEY: That's a lot of problems. And we still want to get too close to the Yellow River. That happened before I was born. Nothing good comes with that. Again, we have some slowly here -- the North Korean/China situation is one of the unknowables out there. And it is a big disconcerting at this point in time. It's heating up.</p><p>My guess is, is if we do anything, it will be decisive and very quick but you'll never know about these things as it's just the risk that you just have to live with the time being.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Thank you so much just for joining us. He is John Manley and he is a Chief Equities Strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

He's the Chief Equity Strategist at Wells Fargo Funds. And, John, great to have you with us here in the middle of earning seasons, squarely in the middle of the second quarter earning season.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's take stock of where we are as the big tech companies reporting last week, some financial companies reporting as well. Just give us the lay of the land as you see it as these results to continue to come in.</p><p>MANLEY: All the way from benign to good. I think the numbers are coming in pretty well. The revenue numbers are starting to surprise, which is sort of interesting. And this is giving large to something that a lot of people thought that profits were so high, they couldn't go higher even if the economy got better.</p><p>Well, the revenues, Tom, we were seeing a better economy and the profit numbers are just what they. They're saying things are getting better.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. But, John, at the same, a lot of these aren't cost cuts. I know the revenue is a strong kind of indication that things are getting better. But what if we were loved in a false sense of security because it's all cost cuts and not actual growth?</p><p>MANLEY: Any sense of security in the stock market is a false sense of security. Of course, we have done this long this long enough. But ultimately, it will prove me false.</p><p>However, what you're seeing are just early stages. Ideally, what corporation should do is make themselves into very, very efficient machines. And that's what they've done. And then build it that way and the economy will come. This is the United States over here. We still have -- I wouldn't call pens up to me. We have natural exam.</p><p>People came to the United States. Our ancestors came from the United States to have more. We're willing to work for it in most cases. And I think what happens is we put the problems 10 years ago further and further behind us. And yes, a little bit of stimulation from the fed. You get yourself a pretty decent economy. And if that happens that just poured over an efficient machine, I mean, profits come out of it.</p><p>LACQUA: Is it really only a little bit of stimulus from the fed? What happens if they actually move too quickly? I mean, they telegraphed, right, that they are starting to normalize. But what happens if companies are not ready for it?</p><p>MANLEY: They'll stop -- they'll stop doing it. One of the things that I have a chat (ph), you know, says a few weeks ago was that she gets - - she's aware. She knows there's a risk in stimulating too quickly or not stimulating enough. She knows there's a risk in how they unwind the balance sheet. She knows the risk of inflation. She knows the risk of deflation.</p><p>Now, she may not know exactly the road or the path to follow down on the way to recovery, but she knows to look for any misstep on her part. Anything she's done that possibly could derail. So, I guess what I can say about Janet Yellen is sure, she may be wrong but she won't be wrong for long and that's really what matters to the markets.</p><p>GURA: John, what's your sense of the degree to which this Fed Reserve, this Federal Open Market Committee is paying attention to the market? How big a concern is that for them?</p><p>MANLEY: I think they read the papers and, obviously, they listen to some very good radio broadcast from time to time. They have to be aware. I mean, you know, it's like asking your doctor did he read the thermometer after he test you.</p><p>We're pretty didn't care to what's going on. We're not perfect. We bounce around in awful lot. But we're pretty good in here.</p><p>And now, I think it's also important to remember, the fed and the capital markets and the economy are linked, because when the fed wants to push money at the economy, it goes through us first. So then let's think of it as a pipe carrying out, in or out of the economy. They sort of look at us, they get an obvious sign as money headed the right direction And, you know, they see a meltdown in stock market a little bit, they know that's can't be good for the rest of the real world.</p><p>The same thing is true for housing and a few others things. Look at what wealth is doing. If wealth is being created or at least maintained, they've got to feel reasonably comfortable.</p><p>GURA: And look at the soft data, you look the surveys, how businesses feel, their willingness to hire, their willingness to expand. And it seems like there is still a gap between the soft data and the hard data.</p><p>As you look at these earnings reports, what's the sense that you have of when the two are going to meet? Where we're going to see companies try to invest more in CAPEX?</p><p>MANLEY: I think you're starting to see -- I think what you have to realize too is that when -- it probably happen quickly because we're still on a fairly competitive landscape. And so far, it's been better for corporations who are competing against other corporations to buyback shares, to reinvest in their businesses by buying into their businesses. That doesn't have capacity obviously.</p><p>But at some point in time, it's not because the companies want to do it, it's because their consumers are demanding more of their products. If you and I are competing and I see you beginning to pick up share because you expand a little bit, watch out quickly, I would start my CAPEX of them.</p><p>LACQUA: John, are market merger is good for evaluations or bad?</p><p>MANLEY: Well, it depends on merger it has.</p><p>LACQUA: I know, in the industry, but -- because, you know, in general, just full of desperation.</p><p>MANLEY: I think that merge is to create synergy without being tremendously destructive to jobs, to create more efficient, more logical corporations are generally good. You don't want restraining the trade. I don't want restraining the trade. You do want efficiencies. You do want logical structures to a degree they foster that, I think it's fine. You just always keep your eyes open. There's nothing wrong with regulation. It's just got to be done, you know, a fair, even-handed way.</p><p>LACQUA: John, you know, we went into 2017, looking at Brexit, looking at President Trump. And there was this wave of anti-populism of -- or populism anti-globalization. Should that do anything to stock markets?</p><p>MANLEY: Well, it hasn't. I mean, there's an old saying, expect the worse and you'll never be disappointed. And the things to market has not been disappointed this year.</p><p>People talk about the lack of downside volatility. The only explanation for that is there have been non-negative surprises or any consequence. Well, so many negative things that come out of Washington or (inaudible) or even Berlin or Paris, how can one say there aren't negative surprises? Of course, there are negative.</p><p>Well, the thing is it's not a surprise. I think investors have a fairly low expectation, maybe a very low expectation of what comes out of Washington or Berlin or Britain. And I think in that respect, it's going to be pretty hard to disappoint us.]</p><p>GURA: Let me ask about financials in particular. A number of banks have reported already. How enthusiastic are you about financial stocks at this point? And how radically have they sort of trigged around from where we're a few years back?</p><p>MANLEY: Well, 40 years ago, I made choices from my life amongst them, so --</p><p>GURA: Yes.</p><p>MANLEY: -- we're very intimate with financial stocks and financial corporations and all the big -- it can be the best business and the worst business in the world. And believe me, I've seen both.</p><p>I think what you have to look for is reasonable regulation. There is no way that banks or financial institutions should be wide open. On the other hand, regulation go too far. You look for just the amount of regulation that seems to be moving in the right direction.</p><p>Interest rates also have corporations when they're facing very, very low rates, have a very difficult time placing fees on things that should have fees on them. If that's the case, their earnings power is being starved. Higher rates to a degree, it doesn't represent real fed tightening allows financial corporations to charge those fees, right adjustable fees that tends to improve their profitability. I think that part still in front of them.</p><p>GURA: Let me ask you how much personality matters. We spent some time this morning on television talking about Stuart Gulliver who is outgoing head of HSBC. You look at who's heading up these banks now. You can say few more years left and a lot of these guys who are running these banks. And how worried are you about transition? How much do you associate performances, the big bangs in particular with the men, largely men who are running those companies?</p><p>MANLEY: That's really good question. I don't know the straight answer I can give you. I think a character. When I invest my money over the long term, I know I can't possibly know what's going to happen in 5, 10 years. But I can look at the corporate culture, I guess that's where giving else. A good corporate culture should have depth, strong managers, truly strong managers, shouldn't be afraid of having people alongside them from replacing. That's the whole idea.</p><p>And I think that's a good way to buy stocks. You might want to find a good industry. But find a good industry that's being run by good men and women, who bring up good men and women internally. And I think you have -- it could be a fair of good investment.</p><p>LACQUA: And so, you have that in financials done or are you just talking about another industry?</p><p>MANLEY: We're talking industries in general and some financials --</p><p>LACQUA: Right.</p><p>MANLEY: I'm not assuming bad that I don't believe you.</p><p>LACQUA: OK. So which industries do you think are doing better in terms of succession but also, you know, having fewer legacy issues?</p><p>MANLEY: Well, the fundamentals were -- I think the fundamentals will come through. I think health care is a great sort of hard (ph) parts had collision between an Asian population like myself, improving health care, technology, and representative markers that can vote the money towards the people who need it.</p><p>I think technology, which we've been talking about, business to business technology, I think you're going to see wage pressures in the next few years. And the only way to cheapskates around corporations are going to let that go through is that they can prove productivity somehow, and that means spending on technology.</p><p>We mentioned financials, and for sure down in our value, I still think, well it was pretty good place to be. I'm focused on the big high quality large paying dividend stocks in the oil industry.</p><p>LACQUA: And those are mainly, which ones?</p><p>MANLEY: Well, I can't name them.</p><p>LACQUA: No, I know you can't. But is it -- on which end, is it refinery or is it actually downstream?</p><p>MANLEY: Well, the ones that are integrated, say a little bit of both.</p><p>LACQUA: All right.</p><p>GURA: We'll leave it there, John Manley. We'll come back with John Manley here in a just a moment. Maybe talk a bit more about Washington, its effects on policy, a little bit more on central banking as well. John Manley, Chief Equities Strategist at Wells Fargo joining us here on Bloomberg 1130 studios on Bloomberg Surveillance.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>GURA: David Gura and Francine Lacqua, Tom Keene off today. This is Bloomberg Surveillance on Bloomberg Radio. Brought to you by Invesco for concise market and economic insights, delivered to your inbox weekly, count on Invesco Global Market Strategist, Kristina Hooper, invesco.com/hooper to learn more.</p><p>Continuing our conversation here with John Manley, Chief Equities Strategist at Wells Fargo Funds. And, John, let me just ask you about what we're seeing play out in Washington, D.C. The result of this optimism after the election after the inauguration, safe to say, some of that is anticipated. Why are we not seeing more of a market move as a result of that?</p><p>MANLEY: Well, fundamentals are getting better. I mean that -- ex Washington, you're seeing earnings expectations arise after a long period of time where they really went nowhere. Also, the fed is being beneficial I guess is the right word. The fed is being very careful about what they do there. Shown very, very strong high levels of awareness about what they do. And the valuations aren't that bad.</p><p>I think the -- how shall I put this? The intricacies of Donald Trump presidency were probably discounted the first 12 hours as president-elect. And after that, we probably didn't have much expectation. We may say things but I don't think we really believed or counted on him. So hence, no negative surprises.</p><p>GURA: How about the fed's balance sheet? We've got more detail from the fed on how that's going to unfold, when it does begin to unfold the last meeting relatively soon. It was the watch phrase that came out of the statement following it. How that's that going to play out in your world? How that's going to play in the equities space in particular?</p><p>MANLEY: Well, it's a risk and therefore I think it proceed slowly. Jenny Donell (ph) was on recently saying, you know, we don't really know exactly how this is going to play because we've never done something like this before. What does a wise person, what does a wise man or woman do when they're in an unknown territory? They move slowly and carefully and they check every step they make. And I think that's what's going to happen. I think a lot of lessons from the real world are going to be applied in the financial world.</p><p>No guarantees right. Maybe these are undoable but I think a lot of things that were supposedly undoable have gotten done in the last few years. So, I think this -- it will work. I'm optimistic. I think the fed will be very, very careful in how they proceed.</p><p>LACQUA: What do you mean by lessons, John? So, you're talking about lessons from the real world being transferred in the financial world.</p><p>MANLEY: Well, I mean -- I'm just taking at -- act the way you would in real life. If you're on a dark path and you don't know where you are, you don't take big steps, you take small steps and check your footing every single step along the way. That's what Janet Yellen will do the financial code (ph) enough in my opinion.</p><p>LACQUA: Right. But the problem is that then financial stocks are always on notaire, right? They're going from record high to record high. What about then pausing and having a look right, left and center?</p><p>MANLEY: Sure. I mean I think that's possible. I've learned enough to -- since I can't really predict 5 percent or 10 percent pullbacks with any sort of accuracy, I just sort of assumed they're a part, they're a cost of earning equities for the long term. I think it's a worthwhile cost which I think equities and the delivers as pure return over a long period of time to very patient investors.</p><p>But you cannot expect to know every little wiggle and twist is going to be. So it could easily be a 5 percent correction because of something that goes slightly wrong, a 10 percent correction. But I think it will be done right at the end of the day. And when it's done right, there's a lot of room for these stocks to be meaningfully higher.</p><p>GURA: John Manley, we've talked about financials a few minutes ago. Let me ask about a couple of other sectors. I'll start with technology. When you look at tech with large, do you think that it's fairly valued right now?</p><p>MANLEY: If I understood half of it, I'd probably say it was fairly -- you know, the really big ones are really expensive ones --</p><p>GURA: Yes.</p><p>MANLEY: -- there's a lesson to those. I learned this back in the late '90s. The valuations may be frightening. The valuations maybe frightening but evaluations at the end of the day isn't what's it. The valuations will not tell you. They may win you.</p><p>Every time I've seen a highly valued, high growth country or company or industry blow up solely because valuation, it was like watching a man fall down and up escalator. You may fall but you get pulled harder, almost always buying opportunities. And I saw that to the late '90s.</p><p>And it's because the surprise is -- if stock goes down and the earnings expectations go up, you sort of have a correction double click in the stock. All right, it was ahead of itself is now 30 percent cheaper. People buy into it. You go tweet this a few times. People become less ordered by valuations.</p><p>So, watch valuations always they can trip you up but I don't think it's more than a trip. Focus, I would say, on the business to business -- the real spending in tech over the next several years is going to be by business to make their workers more productive so they can pay them more.</p><p>GURA: And thank you very much there would be escalated. Let me ask you lastly about health care. We're a point where the government -- where the administration is evaluating whether or not to continue with a subsidies on some levels of insurance. Obviously, had the big debate over health care. Your keen on health care overall, when you look at this as a sector?</p><p>MANLEY: Right. You know, falling down and not escalate naturally leads to health care, I would say. Yes, I think too, it's a great story. To me, it is a business where you have rising demand, you have rising supply of things that can be done, and you have an electoral process. Let's people vote themselves into healthcare.</p><p>Health care is percent of GDP, I think, must or will have to rise. That's my opinion.</p><p>LACQUA: John, pretty quickly. Are you concerned about China? We seem to be in the benign belief that China is fine. What if it were and what is that do to U.S. stocks?</p><p>MANLEY: That's a lot of problems. And we still want to get too close to the Yellow River. That happened before I was born. Nothing good comes with that. Again, we have some slowly here -- the North Korean/China situation is one of the unknowables out there. And it is a big disconcerting at this point in time. It's heating up.</p><p>My guess is, is if we do anything, it will be decisive and very quick but you'll never know about these things as it's just the risk that you just have to live with the time being.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. Thank you so much just for joining us. He is John Manley and he is a Chief Equities Strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Just give us the  lay of the land as you see it as these results to continue to come in.</p><p>MANLEY:  All the way from benign to good.  I think the numbers are  coming in pretty well.  The revenue numbers are starting to surprise, which  is sort of interesting.  And this is giving large to something that a lot  of people thought that profits were so high, they couldn't go higher even  if the economy got better.</p><p>Well, the revenues, Tom, we were seeing a better economy and the  profit numbers are just what they.  They're saying things are getting  better.</p><p>LACQUA:  Yes.  But, John, at the same, a lot of these aren't cost  cuts.  I know the revenue is a strong kind of indication that things are  getting better.  But what if we were loved in a false sense of security  because it's all cost cuts and not actual growth?</p><p>MANLEY:  Any sense of security in the stock market is a false sense of  security.  Of course, we have done this long this long enough.  But  ultimately, it will prove me false.</p><p>However, what you're seeing are just early stages.  Ideally, what  corporation should do is make themselves into very, very efficient  machines.  And that's what they've done.  And then build it that way and  the economy will come.  This is the United States over here.  We still have  -- I wouldn't call pens up to me.  We have natural exam.</p><p>People came to the United States.  Our ancestors came from the United  States to have more.  We're willing to work for it in most cases.  And I  think what happens is we put the problems 10 years ago further and further  behind us.  And yes, a little bit of stimulation from the fed.  You get  yourself a pretty decent economy.  And if that happens that just poured  over an efficient machine, I mean, profits come out of it.</p><p>LACQUA:  Is it really only a little bit of stimulus from the fed?   What happens if they actually move too quickly?  I mean, they telegraphed,  right, that they are starting to normalize.  But what happens if companies  are not ready for it?</p><p>MANLEY:  They'll stop -- they'll stop doing it.  One of the things  that I have a chat (ph), you know, says a few weeks ago was that she gets - - she's aware.  She knows there's a risk in stimulating too quickly or not  stimulating enough.  She knows there's a risk in how they unwind the  balance sheet.  She knows the risk of inflation.  She knows the risk of  deflation.</p><p>Now, she may not know exactly the road or the path to follow down on  the way to recovery, but she knows to look for any misstep on her part.   Anything she's done that possibly could derail.  So, I guess what I can say  about Janet Yellen is sure, she may be wrong but she won't be wrong for  long and that's really what matters to the markets.</p><p>GURA:  John, what's your sense of the degree to which this Fed  Reserve, this Federal Open Market Committee is paying attention to the  market?  How big a concern is that for them?</p><p>MANLEY:  I think they read the papers and, obviously, they listen to  some very good radio broadcast from time to time.  They have to be aware.   I mean, you know, it's like asking your doctor did he read the thermometer  after he test you.</p><p>We're pretty didn't care to what's going on.  We're not perfect.  We  bounce around in awful lot.  But we're pretty good in here.</p><p>And now, I think it's also important to remember, the fed and the  capital markets and the economy are linked, because when the fed wants to  push money at the economy, it goes through us first.  So then let's think  of it as a pipe carrying out, in or out of the economy.  They sort of look  at us, they get an obvious sign as money headed the right direction  And,  you know, they see a meltdown in stock market a little bit, they know  that's can't be good for the rest of the real world.</p><p>The same thing is true for housing and a few others things.  Look at  what wealth is doing.  If wealth is being created or at least maintained,  they've got to feel reasonably comfortable.</p><p>GURA:  And look at the soft data, you look the surveys, how businesses  feel, their willingness to hire, their willingness to expand.  And it seems  like there is still a gap between the soft data and the hard data.</p><p>As you look at these earnings reports, what's the sense that you have  of when the two are going to meet?  Where we're going to see companies try  to invest more in CAPEX?</p><p>MANLEY:  I think you're starting to see -- I think what you have to  realize too is that when -- it probably happen quickly because we're still  on a fairly competitive landscape.  And so far, it's been better for  corporations who are competing against other corporations to buyback  shares, to reinvest in their businesses by buying into their businesses.   That doesn't have capacity obviously.</p><p>But at some point in time, it's not because the companies want to do  it, it's because their consumers are demanding more of their products.  If  you and I are competing and I see you beginning to pick up share because  you expand a little bit, watch out quickly, I would start my CAPEX of them.</p><p>LACQUA:  John, are market merger is good for evaluations or bad?</p><p>MANLEY:  Well, it depends on merger it has.</p><p>LACQUA:  I know, in the industry, but -- because, you know, in  general, just full of desperation.</p><p>MANLEY:  I think that merge is to create synergy without being  tremendously destructive to jobs, to create more efficient, more logical  corporations are generally good.  You don't want restraining the trade.  I  don't want restraining the trade.  You do want efficiencies.  You do want  logical structures to a degree they foster that, I think it's fine.  You  just always keep your eyes open.  There's nothing wrong with regulation.   It's just got to be done, you know, a fair, even-handed way.</p><p>LACQUA:  John, you know, we went into 2017, looking at Brexit, looking  at President Trump.  And there was this wave of anti-populism of -- or  populism anti-globalization.  Should that do anything to stock markets?</p><p>MANLEY:  Well, it hasn't.  I mean, there's an old saying, expect the  worse and you'll never be disappointed.  And the things to market has not  been disappointed this year.</p><p>People talk about the lack of downside volatility.  The only  explanation for that is there have been non-negative surprises or any  consequence.  Well, so many negative things that come out of Washington or  (inaudible) or even Berlin or Paris, how can one say there aren't negative  surprises?  Of course, there are negative.</p><p>Well, the thing is it's not a surprise.  I think investors have a  fairly low expectation, maybe a very low expectation of what comes out of  Washington or Berlin or Britain.  And I think in that respect, it's going  to be pretty hard to disappoint us.]</p><p>GURA:  Let me ask about financials in particular.  A number of banks  have reported already.  How enthusiastic are you about financial stocks at  this point?  And how radically have they sort of trigged around from where  we're a few years back?</p><p>MANLEY:  Well, 40 years ago, I made choices from my life amongst them,  so --</p><p>GURA:  Yes.</p><p>MANLEY:  -- we're very intimate with financial stocks and financial  corporations and all the big -- it can be the best business and the worst  business in the world.  And believe me, I've seen both.</p><p>I think what you have to look for is reasonable regulation.  There is  no way that banks or financial institutions should be wide open.  On the  other hand, regulation go too far.  You look for just the amount of  regulation that seems to be moving in the right direction.</p><p>Interest rates also have corporations when they're facing very, very  low rates, have a very difficult time placing fees on things that should  have fees on them.  If that's the case, their earnings power is being  starved.  Higher rates to a degree, it doesn't represent real fed  tightening allows financial corporations to charge those fees, right  adjustable fees that tends to improve their profitability.  I think that  part still in front of them.</p><p>GURA:  Let me ask you how much personality matters.  We spent some  time this morning on television talking about Stuart Gulliver who is  outgoing head of HSBC.  You look at who's heading up these banks now.  You  can say few more years left and a lot of these guys who are running these  banks.  And how worried are you about transition?  How much do you  associate performances, the big bangs in particular with the men, largely  men who are running those companies?</p><p>MANLEY:  That's really good question.  I don't know the straight  answer I can give you.  I think a character.  When I invest my money over  the long term, I know I can't possibly know what's going to happen in 5, 10  years.  But I can look at the corporate culture, I guess that's where  giving else.  A good corporate culture should have depth, strong managers,  truly strong managers, shouldn't be afraid of having people alongside them  from replacing.  That's the whole idea.</p><p>And I think that's a good way to buy stocks.  You might want to find a  good industry.  But find a good industry that's being run by good men and  women, who bring up good men and women internally.  And I think you have --  it could be a fair of good investment.</p><p>LACQUA:  And so, you have that in financials done or are you just  talking about another industry?</p><p>MANLEY:  We're talking industries in general and some financials --</p><p>LACQUA:  Right.</p><p>MANLEY:  I'm not assuming bad that I don't believe you.</p><p>LACQUA:  OK.  So which industries do you think are doing better in  terms of succession but also, you know, having fewer legacy issues?</p><p>MANLEY:  Well, the fundamentals were -- I think the fundamentals will  come through.  I think health care is a great sort of hard (ph) parts had  collision between an Asian population like myself, improving health care,  technology, and representative markers that can vote the money towards the  people who need it.</p><p>I think technology, which we've been talking about, business to  business technology, I think you're going to see wage pressures in the next  few years.  And the only way to cheapskates around corporations are going  to let that go through is that they can prove productivity somehow, and  that means spending on technology.</p><p>We mentioned financials, and for sure down in our value, I still  think, well it was pretty good place to be.  I'm focused on the big high  quality large paying dividend stocks in the oil industry.</p><p>LACQUA:  And those are mainly, which ones?</p><p>MANLEY:  Well, I can't name them.</p><p>LACQUA:  No, I know you can't.  But is it -- on which end, is it  refinery or is it actually downstream?</p><p>MANLEY:  Well, the ones that are integrated, say a little bit of both.</p><p>LACQUA:  All right.</p><p>GURA:  We'll leave it there, John Manley.  We'll come back with John  Manley here in a just a moment.  Maybe talk a bit more about Washington,  its effects on policy, a little bit more on central banking as well.  John  Manley, Chief Equities Strategist at Wells Fargo joining us here on  Bloomberg 1130 studios on Bloomberg Surveillance.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>GURA:  David Gura and Francine Lacqua, Tom Keene off today.  This is  Bloomberg Surveillance on Bloomberg Radio.  Brought to you by Invesco for  concise market and economic insights, delivered to your inbox weekly, count  on Invesco Global Market Strategist, Kristina Hooper, invesco.com/hooper to  learn more.</p><p>Continuing our conversation here with John Manley, Chief Equities  Strategist at Wells Fargo Funds.  And, John, let me just ask you about what  we're seeing play out in Washington, D.C.  The result of this optimism  after the election after the inauguration, safe to say, some of that is  anticipated.  Why are we not seeing more of a market move as a result of  that?</p><p>MANLEY:  Well, fundamentals are getting better.  I mean that -- ex  Washington, you're seeing earnings expectations arise after a long period  of time where they really went nowhere.  Also, the fed is being beneficial  I guess is the right word.  The fed is being very careful about what they  do there.  Shown very, very strong high levels of awareness about what they  do.  And the valuations aren't that bad.</p><p>I think the -- how shall I put this?  The intricacies of Donald Trump  presidency were probably discounted the first 12 hours as president-elect.   And after that, we probably didn't have much expectation.  We may say  things but I don't think we really believed or counted on him.  So hence,  no negative surprises.</p><p>GURA:  How about the fed's balance sheet?  We've got more detail from  the fed on how that's going to unfold, when it does begin to unfold the  last meeting relatively soon.  It was the watch phrase that came out of the  statement following it.  How that's that going to play out in your world?   How that's going to play in the equities space in particular?</p><p>MANLEY:  Well, it's a risk and therefore I think it proceed slowly.   Jenny Donell (ph) was on recently saying, you know, we don't really know  exactly how this is going to play because we've never done something like  this before.  What does a wise person, what does a wise man or woman do  when they're in an unknown territory?  They move slowly and carefully and  they check every step they make.  And I think that's what's going to  happen.  I think a lot of lessons from the real world are going to be  applied in the financial world.</p><p>No guarantees right.  Maybe these are undoable but I think a lot of  things that were supposedly undoable have gotten done in the last few  years.  So, I think this -- it will work.  I'm optimistic.  I think the fed  will be very, very careful in how they proceed.</p><p>LACQUA:  What do you mean by lessons, John?  So, you're talking about  lessons from the real world being transferred in the financial world.</p><p>MANLEY:  Well, I mean -- I'm just taking at -- act the way you would  in real life.  If you're on a dark path and you don't know where you are,  you don't take big steps, you take small steps and check your footing every  single step along the way.  That's what Janet Yellen will do the financial  code (ph) enough in my opinion.</p><p>LACQUA:  Right.  But the problem is that then financial stocks are  always on notaire, right?  They're going from record high to record high.   What about then pausing and having a look right, left and center?</p><p>MANLEY:  Sure.  I mean I think that's possible.  I've learned enough  to -- since I can't really predict 5 percent or 10 percent pullbacks with  any sort of accuracy, I just sort of assumed they're a part, they're a cost  of earning equities for the long term.  I think it's a worthwhile cost  which I think equities and the delivers as pure return over a long period  of time to very patient investors.</p><p>But you cannot expect to know every little wiggle and twist is going  to be.  So it could easily be a 5 percent correction because of something  that goes slightly wrong, a 10 percent correction.  But I think it will be  done right at the end of the day.  And when it's done right, there's a lot  of room for these stocks to be meaningfully higher.</p><p>GURA:  John Manley, we've talked about financials a few minutes ago.   Let me ask about a couple of other sectors.  I'll start with technology.   When you look at tech with large, do you think that it's fairly valued  right now?</p><p>MANLEY:  If I understood half of it, I'd probably say it was fairly --  you know, the really big ones are really expensive ones --</p><p>GURA:  Yes.</p><p>MANLEY:  -- there's a lesson to those.  I learned this back in the  late '90s.  The valuations may be frightening.  The valuations maybe  frightening but evaluations at the end of the day isn't what's it.  The  valuations will not tell you.  They may win you.</p><p>Every time I've seen a highly valued, high growth country or company  or industry blow up solely because valuation, it was like watching a man  fall down and up escalator.  You may fall but you get pulled harder, almost  always buying opportunities.  And I saw that to the late '90s.</p><p>And it's because the surprise is -- if stock goes down and the  earnings expectations go up, you sort of have a correction double click in  the stock.  All right, it was ahead of itself is now 30 percent cheaper.   People buy into it.  You go tweet this a few times.  People become less  ordered by valuations.</p><p>So, watch valuations always they can trip you up but I don't think  it's more than a trip.  Focus, I would say, on the business to business --  the real spending in tech over the next several years is going to be by  business to make their workers more productive so they can pay them more.</p><p>GURA:  And thank you very much there would be escalated.  Let me ask  you lastly about health care.   We're a point where the government -- where  the administration is evaluating whether or not to continue with a  subsidies on some levels of insurance.  Obviously, had the big debate over  health care.  Your keen on health care overall, when you look at this as a  sector?</p><p>MANLEY:  Right.  You know, falling down and not escalate naturally  leads to health care, I would say.  Yes, I think too, it's a great story.   To me, it is a business where you have rising demand, you have rising  supply of things that can be done, and you have an electoral process.   Let's people vote themselves into healthcare.</p><p>Health care is percent of GDP, I think, must or will have to rise.   That's my opinion.</p><p>LACQUA:  John, pretty quickly.  Are you concerned about China?  We  seem to be in the benign belief that China is fine.  What if it were and  what is that do to U.S. stocks?</p><p>MANLEY:  That's a lot of problems.  And we still want to get too close  to the Yellow River.  That happened before I was born.  Nothing good comes  with that.  Again, we have some slowly here -- the North Korean/China  situation is one of the unknowables out there.  And it is a big  disconcerting at this point in time.  It's heating up.</p><p>My guess is, is if we do anything, it will be decisive and very quick  but you'll never know about these things as it's just the risk that you  just have to live with the time being.</p><p>LACQUA:  All right.  Thank you so much just for joining us.  He is  John Manley and he is a Chief Equities Strategist at Wells Fargo Asset  Management.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

He's the Chief Equity Strategist at Wells Fargo Funds.  And, John, great to  have you with us here in the middle of earning seasons, squarely in the  middle of the second quarter earning season.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Let's take stock of where we are as the big tech companies reporting  last week, some financial companies reporting as well.  Just give us the  lay of the land as you see it as these results to continue to come in.</p><p>  MANLEY:  All the way from benign to good.  I think the numbers are  coming in pretty well.  The revenue numbers are starting to surprise, which  is sort of interesting.  And this is giving large to something that a lot  of people thought that profits were so high, they couldn't go higher even  if the economy got better.</p><p>  Well, the revenues, Tom, we were seeing a better economy and the  profit numbers are just what they.  They're saying things are getting  better.</p><p>  LACQUA:  Yes.  But, John, at the same, a lot of these aren't cost  cuts.  I know the revenue is a strong kind of indication that things are  getting better.  But what if we were loved in a false sense of security  because it's all cost cuts and not actual growth?</p><p>  MANLEY:  Any sense of security in the stock market is a false sense of  security.  Of course, we have done this long this long enough.  But  ultimately, it will prove me false.</p><p>  However, what you're seeing are just early stages.  Ideally, what  corporation should do is make themselves into very, very efficient  machines.  And that's what they've done.  And then build it that way and  the economy will come.  This is the United States over here.  We still have  -- I wouldn't call pens up to me.  We have natural exam.</p><p>  People came to the United States.  Our ancestors came from the United  States to have more.  We're willing to work for it in most cases.  And I  think what happens is we put the problems 10 years ago further and further  behind us.  And yes, a little bit of stimulation from the fed.  You get  yourself a pretty decent economy.  And if that happens that just poured  over an efficient machine, I mean, profits come out of it.</p><p>  LACQUA:  Is it really only a little bit of stimulus from the fed?   What happens if they actually move too quickly?  I mean, they telegraphed,  right, that they are starting to normalize.  But what happens if companies  are not ready for it?</p><p>  MANLEY:  They'll stop -- they'll stop doing it.  One of the things  that I have a chat (ph), you know, says a few weeks ago was that she gets - - she's aware.  She knows there's a risk in stimulating too quickly or not  stimulating enough.  She knows there's a risk in how they unwind the  balance sheet.  She knows the risk of inflation.  She knows the risk of  deflation.</p><p>  Now, she may not know exactly the road or the path to follow down on  the way to recovery, but she knows to look for any misstep on her part.   Anything she's done that possibly could derail.  So, I guess what I can say  about Janet Yellen is sure, she may be wrong but she won't be wrong for  long and that's really what matters to the markets.</p><p>  GURA:  John, what's your sense of the degree to which this Fed  Reserve, this Federal Open Market Committee is paying attention to the  market?  How big a concern is that for them?</p><p>  MANLEY:  I think they read the papers and, obviously, they listen to  some very good radio broadcast from time to time.  They have to be aware.   I mean, you know, it's like asking your doctor did he read the thermometer  after he test you.</p><p>  We're pretty didn't care to what's going on.  We're not perfect.  We  bounce around in awful lot.  But we're pretty good in here.</p><p>  And now, I think it's also important to remember, the fed and the  capital markets and the economy are linked, because when the fed wants to  push money at the economy, it goes through us first.  So then let's think  of it as a pipe carrying out, in or out of the economy.  They sort of look  at us, they get an obvious sign as money headed the right direction  And,  you know, they see a meltdown in stock market a little bit, they know  that's can't be good for the rest of the real world.</p><p>  The same thing is true for housing and a few others things.  Look at  what wealth is doing.  If wealth is being created or at least maintained,  they've got to feel reasonably comfortable.</p><p>  GURA:  And look at the soft data, you look the surveys, how businesses  feel, their willingness to hire, their willingness to expand.  And it seems  like there is still a gap between the soft data and the hard data.</p><p>  As you look at these earnings reports, what's the sense that you have  of when the two are going to meet?  Where we're going to see companies try  to invest more in CAPEX?</p><p>  MANLEY:  I think you're starting to see -- I think what you have to  realize too is that when -- it probably happen quickly because we're still  on a fairly competitive landscape.  And so far, it's been better for  corporations who are competing against other corporations to buyback  shares, to reinvest in their businesses by buying into their businesses.   That doesn't have capacity obviously.</p><p>  But at some point in time, it's not because the companies want to do  it, it's because their consumers are demanding more of their products.  If  you and I are competing and I see you beginning to pick up share because  you expand a little bit, watch out quickly, I would start my CAPEX of them.</p><p>  LACQUA:  John, are market merger is good for evaluations or bad?</p><p>  MANLEY:  Well, it depends on merger it has.</p><p>  LACQUA:  I know, in the industry, but -- because, you know, in  general, just full of desperation.</p><p>  MANLEY:  I think that merge is to create synergy without being  tremendously destructive to jobs, to create more efficient, more logical  corporations are generally good.  You don't want restraining the trade.  I  don't want restraining the trade.  You do want efficiencies.  You do want  logical structures to a degree they foster that, I think it's fine.  You  just always keep your eyes open.  There's nothing wrong with regulation.   It's just got to be done, you know, a fair, even-handed way.</p><p>  LACQUA:  John, you know, we went into 2017, looking at Brexit, looking  at President Trump.  And there was this wave of anti-populism of -- or  populism anti-globalization.  Should that do anything to stock markets?</p><p>  MANLEY:  Well, it hasn't.  I mean, there's an old saying, expect the  worse and you'll never be disappointed.  And the things to market has not  been disappointed this year.</p><p>  People talk about the lack of downside volatility.  The only  explanation for that is there have been non-negative surprises or any  consequence.  Well, so many negative things that come out of Washington or  (inaudible) or even Berlin or Paris, how can one say there aren't negative  surprises?  Of course, there are negative.</p><p>  Well, the thing is it's not a surprise.  I think investors have a  fairly low expectation, maybe a very low expectation of what comes out of  Washington or Berlin or Britain.  And I think in that respect, it's going  to be pretty hard to disappoint us.]</p><p>  GURA:  Let me ask about financials in particular.  A number of banks  have reported already.  How enthusiastic are you about financial stocks at  this point?  And how radically have they sort of trigged around from where  we're a few years back?</p><p>  MANLEY:  Well, 40 years ago, I made choices from my life amongst them,  so --</p><p>  GURA:  Yes.</p><p>  MANLEY:  -- we're very intimate with financial stocks and financial  corporations and all the big -- it can be the best business and the worst  business in the world.  And believe me, I've seen both.</p><p>  I think what you have to look for is reasonable regulation.  There is  no way that banks or financial institutions should be wide open.  On the  other hand, regulation go too far.  You look for just the amount of  regulation that seems to be moving in the right direction.</p><p>  Interest rates also have corporations when they're facing very, very  low rates, have a very difficult time placing fees on things that should  have fees on them.  If that's the case, their earnings power is being  starved.  Higher rates to a degree, it doesn't represent real fed  tightening allows financial corporations to charge those fees, right  adjustable fees that tends to improve their profitability.  I think that  part still in front of them.</p><p>  GURA:  Let me ask you how much personality matters.  We spent some  time this morning on television talking about Stuart Gulliver who is  outgoing head of HSBC.  You look at who's heading up these banks now.  You  can say few more years left and a lot of these guys who are running these  banks.  And how worried are you about transition?  How much do you  associate performances, the big bangs in particular with the men, largely  men who are running those companies?</p><p>  MANLEY:  That's really good question.  I don't know the straight  answer I can give you.  I think a character.  When I invest my money over  the long term, I know I can't possibly know what's going to happen in 5, 10  years.  But I can look at the corporate culture, I guess that's where  giving else.  A good corporate culture should have depth, strong managers,  truly strong managers, shouldn't be afraid of having people alongside them  from replacing.  That's the whole idea.</p><p>  And I think that's a good way to buy stocks.  You might want to find a  good industry.  But find a good industry that's being run by good men and  women, who bring up good men and women internally.  And I think you have --  it could be a fair of good investment.</p><p>  LACQUA:  And so, you have that in financials done or are you just  talking about another industry?</p><p>  MANLEY:  We're talking industries in general and some financials --</p><p>  LACQUA:  Right.</p><p>  MANLEY:  I'm not assuming bad that I don't believe you.</p><p>  LACQUA:  OK.  So which industries do you think are doing better in  terms of succession but also, you know, having fewer legacy issues?</p><p>  MANLEY:  Well, the fundamentals were -- I think the fundamentals will  come through.  I think health care is a great sort of hard (ph) parts had  collision between an Asian population like myself, improving health care,  technology, and representative markers that can vote the money towards the  people who need it.</p><p>  I think technology, which we've been talking about, business to  business technology, I think you're going to see wage pressures in the next  few years.  And the only way to cheapskates around corporations are going  to let that go through is that they can prove productivity somehow, and  that means spending on technology.</p><p>  We mentioned financials, and for sure down in our value, I still  think, well it was pretty good place to be.  I'm focused on the big high  quality large paying dividend stocks in the oil industry.</p><p>  LACQUA:  And those are mainly, which ones?</p><p>  MANLEY:  Well, I can't name them.</p><p>  LACQUA:  No, I know you can't.  But is it -- on which end, is it  refinery or is it actually downstream?</p><p>  MANLEY:  Well, the ones that are integrated, say a little bit of both.</p><p>  LACQUA:  All right.</p><p>  GURA:  We'll leave it there, John Manley.  We'll come back with John  Manley here in a just a moment.  Maybe talk a bit more about Washington,  its effects on policy, a little bit more on central banking as well.  John  Manley, Chief Equities Strategist at Wells Fargo joining us here on  Bloomberg 1130 studios on Bloomberg Surveillance.</p><p>  (BREAK)</p><p>  GURA:  David Gura and Francine Lacqua, Tom Keene off today.  This is  Bloomberg Surveillance on Bloomberg Radio.  Brought to you by Invesco for  concise market and economic insights, delivered to your inbox weekly, count  on Invesco Global Market Strategist, Kristina Hooper, invesco.com/hooper to  learn more.</p><p>  Continuing our conversation here with John Manley, Chief Equities  Strategist at Wells Fargo Funds.  And, John, let me just ask you about what  we're seeing play out in Washington, D.C.  The result of this optimism  after the election after the inauguration, safe to say, some of that is  anticipated.  Why are we not seeing more of a market move as a result of  that?</p><p>  MANLEY:  Well, fundamentals are getting better.  I mean that -- ex  Washington, you're seeing earnings expectations arise after a long period  of time where they really went nowhere.  Also, the fed is being beneficial  I guess is the right word.  The fed is being very careful about what they  do there.  Shown very, very strong high levels of awareness about what they  do.  And the valuations aren't that bad.</p><p>  I think the -- how shall I put this?  The intricacies of Donald Trump  presidency were probably discounted the first 12 hours as president-elect.   And after that, we probably didn't have much expectation.  We may say  things but I don't think we really believed or counted on him.  So hence,  no negative surprises.</p><p>  GURA:  How about the fed's balance sheet?  We've got more detail from  the fed on how that's going to unfold, when it does begin to unfold the  last meeting relatively soon.  It was the watch phrase that came out of the  statement following it.  How that's that going to play out in your world?   How that's going to play in the equities space in particular?</p><p>  MANLEY:  Well, it's a risk and therefore I think it proceed slowly.   Jenny Donell (ph) was on recently saying, you know, we don't really know  exactly how this is going to play because we've never done something like  this before.  What does a wise person, what does a wise man or woman do  when they're in an unknown territory?  They move slowly and carefully and  they check every step they make.  And I think that's what's going to  happen.  I think a lot of lessons from the real world are going to be  applied in the financial world.</p><p>  No guarantees right.  Maybe these are undoable but I think a lot of  things that were supposedly undoable have gotten done in the last few  years.  So, I think this -- it will work.  I'm optimistic.  I think the fed  will be very, very careful in how they proceed.</p><p>  LACQUA:  What do you mean by lessons, John?  So, you're talking about  lessons from the real world being transferred in the financial world.</p><p>  MANLEY:  Well, I mean -- I'm just taking at -- act the way you would  in real life.  If you're on a dark path and you don't know where you are,  you don't take big steps, you take small steps and check your footing every  single step along the way.  That's what Janet Yellen will do the financial  code (ph) enough in my opinion.</p><p>  LACQUA:  Right.  But the problem is that then financial stocks are  always on notaire, right?  They're going from record high to record high.   What about then pausing and having a look right, left and center?</p><p>  MANLEY:  Sure.  I mean I think that's possible.  I've learned enough  to -- since I can't really predict 5 percent or 10 percent pullbacks with  any sort of accuracy, I just sort of assumed they're a part, they're a cost  of earning equities for the long term.  I think it's a worthwhile cost  which I think equities and the delivers as pure return over a long period  of time to very patient investors.</p><p>  But you cannot expect to know every little wiggle and twist is going  to be.  So it could easily be a 5 percent correction because of something  that goes slightly wrong, a 10 percent correction.  But I think it will be  done right at the end of the day.  And when it's done right, there's a lot  of room for these stocks to be meaningfully higher.</p><p>  GURA:  John Manley, we've talked about financials a few minutes ago.   Let me ask about a couple of other sectors.  I'll start with technology.   When you look at tech with large, do you think that it's fairly valued  right now?</p><p>  MANLEY:  If I understood half of it, I'd probably say it was fairly --  you know, the really big ones are really expensive ones --</p><p>  GURA:  Yes.</p><p>  MANLEY:  -- there's a lesson to those.  I learned this back in the  late '90s.  The valuations may be frightening.  The valuations maybe  frightening but evaluations at the end of the day isn't what's it.  The  valuations will not tell you.  They may win you.</p><p>  Every time I've seen a highly valued, high growth country or company  or industry blow up solely because valuation, it was like watching a man  fall down and up escalator.  You may fall but you get pulled harder, almost  always buying opportunities.  And I saw that to the late '90s.</p><p>  And it's because the surprise is -- if stock goes down and the  earnings expectations go up, you sort of have a correction double click in  the stock.  All right, it was ahead of itself is now 30 percent cheaper.   People buy into it.  You go tweet this a few times.  People become less  ordered by valuations.</p><p>  So, watch valuations always they can trip you up but I don't think  it's more than a trip.  Focus, I would say, on the business to business --  the real spending in tech over the next several years is going to be by  business to make their workers more productive so they can pay them more.</p><p>  GURA:  And thank you very much there would be escalated.  Let me ask  you lastly about health care.   We're a point where the government -- where  the administration is evaluating whether or not to continue with a  subsidies on some levels of insurance.  Obviously, had the big debate over  health care.  Your keen on health care overall, when you look at this as a  sector?</p><p>  MANLEY:  Right.  You know, falling down and not escalate naturally  leads to health care, I would say.  Yes, I think too, it's a great story.   To me, it is a business where you have rising demand, you have rising  supply of things that can be done, and you have an electoral process.   Let's people vote themselves into healthcare.</p><p>  Health care is percent of GDP, I think, must or will have to rise.   That's my opinion.</p><p>  LACQUA:  John, pretty quickly.  Are you concerned about China?  We  seem to be in the benign belief that China is fine.  What if it were and  what is that do to U.S. stocks?</p><p>  MANLEY:  That's a lot of problems.  And we still want to get too close  to the Yellow River.  That happened before I was born.  Nothing good comes  with that.  Again, we have some slowly here -- the North Korean/China  situation is one of the unknowables out there.  And it is a big  disconcerting at this point in time.  It's heating up.</p><p>  My guess is, is if we do anything, it will be decisive and very quick  but you'll never know about these things as it's just the risk that you  just have to live with the time being.</p><p>  LACQUA:  All right.  Thank you so much just for joining us.  He is  John Manley and he is a Chief Equities Strategist at Wells Fargo Asset  Management.</p><p>  (BREAK)</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Dow component, Goldman Sachs out in the last hour. The profit slips six percent. It did bait but the overall net income was down six percent but it still raises quarterly dividend from $0.85 to $1.25. And that is certainly helped power that stock higher.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Blue Chips, Johnson &amp; Johnson, JP Morgan reporting earlier, also beating expectations with JP Morgan Chase's stock is down more than 1.5 percent in premarket trading. But it is worth noting that stock while underperforming JP Morgan stock leading up to the report underperforming the financial sector. It's still up about 17 percent year-to-date before these earnings report.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This follows another day of records on Wall Street. The Futures right now are putting to a higher open. Yesterday's close fresh new all-time highs for all your major market gauges. In Europe, your buying across the board in England, France, and Germany. The biggest gainer there the CAC 40 France up more than half of one percent.</p><p>And in Asia overnight, mixed markets there. The Nikkei and shanghai lower, Hong Kong and South Korea higher. China's premiere just saying that downward pressure on China's economy is increasing. This follows the report that the economy grew at 6.2 percent in the most recent quarter. That is the weakest pace in the least 27 years.</p><p>High-tech threat, billionaire Peter Thiel warning that Google is a threat to national security. Google has worked with China. This a company that refused to work with Defense Department because of employ -- push back on the artificial intelligence initiative, Project Maven. President Donald Trump just responding saying his administration will take a look at these allegations.</p><p>I've got a fantastic panel here. Let me go to Ashley Webster with these Wells Fargo numbers. Ashley, what do you say?</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK OVERSEAS MARKETS EDITOR: All right. Hey, Dagen, we have a beat on top and bottom. Let's take a look at the earnings per share coming in 1.30. The estimate was for 1.15 so a beat on earnings. Then on the revenue side, coming at $21.6 billion, the estimate was for $20.93 billion so we have a nice beat on the earnings, and on the revenue side.</p><p>Just looking at the net interest income at 12.1 billion. Net interest margin, so-called NIM, the difference between interest they pay out to depositors and the interest they get back on loans. That's at 2.82 percent, a little less than was expected. Overall 6.2 billion in quarterly net income so again, that works out at $1.30 on the earnings per share.</p><p>Let's be honest, this is a company Wells Fargo that still looking for a CEO. The latest person to step down, of course, was back in March when we had Mr. Sloan, Tim Sloan step down after being with the company 31 years. That's a big issue. Of course, they have big sale scandal back in 2016, trying to rebuild its reputation.</p><p>But apparently, finding someone else to take over at Wells Fargo has been difficult. We're waiting to see what they say in this note about the progress in that whether they promote someone from the inside or whether they will try and persuade someone on outside to come in and take over at Wells Fargo. So this is a company that still does not have a CEO after that scandal.</p><p>Dagen, back to you. It's interesting to see the premarket up about half a percent, up $0.23 for Wells Fargo. And again, they beat on earnings and revenue.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There was a name that was being floated, someone who worked at Bank of America Cathy Bessant, but again, we're still waiting. And again, if you take this job, you're in -- and this is figuratively speaking, you are in the crosshairs of Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>Again, she has been quite vocal. She got into a tiff with the head of the office of the comptroller of the currency over Tim -- over Tim Sloan in the oversight of the bank. So again, everything financial is political, and everything political is financial.</p><p>WEBSTER: You are absolutely right, Dagen. If you want the job, good luck.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good luck and bring your suit of armor. Ashley Webster, thank you so much. Joining me now CFRA Director of Equity Research Ken Leon. Ken, so you've had some time to go over not Wells Fargo is just breaking but going over numbers that we've gotten out this morning,</p><p>If you look at the bank stocks particularly JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, what do you make of the picture that these financials are painting so far?</p><p>KEN LEON, RESEARCH DIRECTOR, CFRA RESEARCH: We're seeing strength where you would expect it which is in the consumer banking, card businesses. Capital markets, there's a wall of worry. This really relates to uncertainty with trade tariffs. That filters into CEO confidence which affects underwriting. And M&amp;A, big drops, across all banks.</p><p>That again is the question of getting those deals done where the removal of a large IPO in Asia related to Budweiser. So that creates an opportunity if we get some visibility of removal, things like China trade. You know, Wells Fargo, they're actually doing well. The wheels are not falling off the wagon. This bank not only probably had a good quarter today but they had great return of capital from the Fed.</p><p>Now, there's two areas, one is the CEO, the other is the lift. I think it's almost as big as the CEO of the concent to order. You go back two years ago, Federal Reserve, other agencies say, we're not going to let you grow your assets. That's a tough thing for banks and yet they're having pretty good results.</p><p>So I would say for this current management with an interim CEO, it's pretty good. And then we'll see it based on events ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: John, what do you make of all of this? And if we have a question --</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S CAPITAL MARKETS: Well, I think we're finding out I guess. As the trading front, banks are having difficulty. They're not getting enough volatility. You mention M&amp;A, that's down sharply. What we noticed that Moody's is that with this drop in M&amp;A volumes, we're seeing a deep drop by leveraged loan activity. That's dried up. So again banks don't necessarily hold on to these leveraged loans. For the most part they go out to CLOs and whatnot.</p><p>So I think on the market's front, the outlook remains murky depending upon the consumer. The consumer will come through for you as long as the unemployment rate drips lower. It's a different story however, once we finally reach that point where the recovery comes to an end and the unemployment rate begins to rise.</p><p>LEON: So trading today is different than the last 25 years. These banks particularly Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley wants stable recurring revenue. Trading is becoming less of an impact on their business and there's some areas tucked in there like client services which are generally more stable and doing better.</p><p>Interesting pie chart on Goldman Sachs release, 40 percent of their revenue comes from asset management and investing and lending. So those are areas they can control. You can't control the markets. And generally, that's why these stocks historically have had lower multiples.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to ask you a question because if you just read through Goldman Sachs -- and I want to -- I want to get to Goldman Sachs increasing its dividend which is a pretty big hike in its dividend, but there's uncertainty.</p><p>Again, you saw it in the trading activity among institutional clients, uncertainty over the trade fight, uncertainty over even the ratification of the trade deal with Mexico and Canada. Does that -- does that eventually translate into the consumer?</p><p>John says it's really based on the job market and when -- and when the expansion runs out but the consumers seem kind of immune impervious to this trade fight?</p><p>LEON: Well, the consumer so far has high confidence. That's terrific. I want to point out though that it's not Canada but its Europe. And the management, they are not going to be aggressive, but they have open field running to take market share in Europe. We have Deutsche Bank, we have other banks.</p><p>Again, back to my point of getting back to more stable businesses away from trading, away from high-risk investment banking, and certain products. These are good opportunities for Goldman, JP Morgan, later this week Morgan Stanley.</p><p>LONSKI: I have a question about demographic change. I can't help but notice, we've gone to a situation where nearly -- the number of people 65 and older in the U.S. growing by nearly two million people this year, big difference from the past, and this means a lot of 401k plans need to be managed. Is this helping banks?</p><p>LEON: It does help banks. And we're talking wealth management, we're talking about even with a lower rate environment, lower net interest income, maybe. But to your point, if you have increased investment accounts, higher assets of their management, all of a sudden we're saying that interest income this week flat to slightly up, absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You've seen moves. All of these banks know the importance of the consumer. Goldman Sachs has shifted to consumer banking money management in recent years, and I think and correct me if I'm wrong, Ken, JPMorgan has tried to go after the discount brokers by now offering this commission-free arrangement for its clients. These are all moves again to create more consistent revenue stream.</p><p>LEON: It's a question of whether you're the incumbent or you're the new disruptors. So for JPMorgan, Bank of America, or Wells Fargo, they're being thoughtful in terms of their branches or financial centers. They still pull in business.</p><p>Goldman Sachs is a disrupter. They are essentially using markets and leveraging that into a bigger picture of over $1 trillion asset management business for those tiers, high net worth, mass market, and retail. So it's very interesting to see what's playing out early but it's going to be over the next few years.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This is a big dividend increase though.</p><p>LEON: It is and I don't want to lose sight to the Federal Reserve approving the stress test capital returns. Goldman a year ago, there was a conditional approval, no dividend increase. This year they got it and it's big. And that's going to give confidence possibly to a value investor looking for yields.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It helps when the government gets out of the way, doesn't it?</p><p>LONSKI: You know, I want to point -- and one final point is that banks are much stronger financially. The capitalization now is so much deeper than it was back in 2006, 2007. I think that's a favorable development over time.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And that's a relief, John.</p><p>LEON: It's a relief and you're going from really 2015 to today to -- these are almost becoming normalized yield plays. Pay-out ratios are still high but they have way too much capital, and you sometimes hear analysts saying, well, is your pay-out ratio 90, you're 100 percent too high. They have too much capital obviously, we are seeing many of these banks get their earnings per share with eight to ten percent reduction of outstanding shares.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So I -- this is tease for coming up but I have a theory about the bank bailout is still playing out in politics today. It gave rise to the Tea Party and it's really the root of what Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are talking about, where is my bailout. That's what the root of it. Ken, it was great to see you.</p><p>LEON: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much for seeing the world, and being with us all morning long on earnings. Executives from Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple all on Capitol Hill today in the middle of antitrust investigation, and a pushback from Democrats to break up big tech. It's not just Democrats. Ed Lawrence is covering the story in Washington for us. Good morning, Ed.</p><p>ED LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Dagen. The big tech giants will be grilled here on Capitol Hill, on the House side. They are concerned with big companies like Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple and possible monopolies related to those companies there.</p><p>This as the Department of Justice has opened investigation into Google's Alphabet, the parent company of Google over possible antitrust there. All of this trying to wrap into a hearing on Senate side talking about Facebook and their plans to create a new cryptocurrency called Libra.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVE MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY, UNITED STATES: I'm not comfortable today. So let me just be careful. As I said, they and others have a lot of work to do before they get us comfortable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE: And for the past few months, the Treasury Secretary and his department has been having meetings with Facebook to work out currency and go forward, with their plans, for Libra. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MNUCHIN: They are a long way away from -- and again, part of it there's been a lot of public interest in this that is why I wanted to give the public the assurance before they or anyone else does this that we're going to make sure the financial system is protected. And as I said, there's a lot of illicit activity that will be shutting down for people using cryptocurrency for bad purposes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE: And he's worried about terrorists using the cryptocurrency or cartels using that anonymous currency there. This could happen within the next 12 months. Both Federal Reserve Chairman and Secretary Mnuchin say it's possibly not likely regulators will be on board within the next year. Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Ed. Ed Lawrence in Washington. We are waiting for June retail sales to come out, also import-export prices. We keep talking about how awesome the consumer is, how healthy Americans are financially. We'll see if that holds up at the bottom of the hour.</p><p>And going after Google, billionaire Peter Thiel, a Trump supporter says that the tech giant's relationship with China poses a national threat. The president responds ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A Stock alert for you. Shares of Blue Apron are soaring this morning. The company announcing that it will be adding Beyond Meats on its menu starting next month. Going vegan, there you go. Five, almost six percent gain on Blue Apron shares. Beyond Meat shares also gaining in premarket trading.</p><p>And it's not just the banks reporting this morning, Johnson &amp; Johnson also beating expectations. Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with more. Good morning, Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK PERSONAL FINANCE REPORTER: Hey, good morning, Dagen. That's right, a double beat for Johnson &amp; Johnson on top and the bottom lines. EPS coming in at 2.58 versus expectations of 2.46. They bump up their sales target and maintained EPS guidance. The CEO in a press release calling it a solid second quarter.</p><p>Meanwhile, the $17-billion lawsuit from the Oklahoma A.G. you've been talking about this morning, this is the result. The opioid crisis, J&amp;J is standing its ground here, two other pharmaceutical companies Purdue and (INAUDIBLE) has settled. And the company calling false to that story from Reuters that the Department of Justice has launched a criminal probe into talcum powder and possible link to cancer.</p><p>And the big headline today. Google shares down this morning after Peter Thiel said that the FBI and CIA should investigate if Google has been infiltrated by Chinese intelligence. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER THIEL, ENTREPRENEUR: The weird fact that's indisputable is that Google is working with communist China but not with the U.S. military on its breakthrough A.I. technology.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And why is that?</p><p>THIEL: Well that's the -- that's the question. I mean, I think -- I think one explanation is they figure they have to because if they don't give it to them through the front door, it will get stolen through backdoor. So first answer is they have to.</p><p>And then I think of course, it's probably going you know, a broad base of Google employees that are you know, ideologically super left-wing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS: So these comments are bringing those shares down today as you can see. The president tweets saying that this investigation should go forward. He said the Trump administration will take a look describing Thiel as a great and brilliant guy.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Department of Justice is declining comment on all of this. Fox Business reached out to the DOJ. They are not saying anything but a fascinating story with Peter Thiel at center and the president signing on. Dagen, back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Gerri, thank you. And General Jack Keane said earlier that he would assume that the FBI was already well aware of this on the case so to speak. Thank you so much, Gerri. We are waiting for June Retail Sales to come out due at about ten minutes from now. We will bring you those numbers as soon as they come out.</p><p>And saving for retirement. We tell you the Goldilocks number that you need in your bank account to retire, the magic digits, and Chris Hogan next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: President Trump on Twitter again, \"Our country is free, beautiful, and very successful. If you hate our country or if you're not happy here, you can leave.\" Welcome back, everybody. Saving for a retirement, what's the magic number? According to a new survey from Charles Schwab, Americans say is $1.7 million.</p><p>Joining me now the author of Everyday Millionaires, Ramsey Solutions Financial Expert Chris Hogan. And Chris, what do you make of this number? Is it is it too lofty to reach?</p><p>CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY SOLUTIONS: Well, big -- and first and foremost I look at this number and I say wow. They're just reaching out and just grabbing a number from anywhere and trying to tell people what they need. I personally know each person's retirement is going to look different. Everybody has different dreams and different goals.</p><p>So I think it's more of a matter of people not being told a magic digit but really starting to understand their dreams and the steps they need to take to get there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What can -- tell me how to stop worrying about my retirement savings.</p><p>HOGAN: Well, the best way to stop worrying is to have a plan, and that is starting to gain more insight and understanding exactly what retirement is. I think we've missed taken retirement for truly what it is. It's about you reaching your dreams.</p><p>What are the things you want to do later in life? Are you wanting to travel? Are you wanting to spend more time with family? Are you wanting to do more giving? But I think as we dig in and we start to understand what can we do to help ourselves get there? I show people if you get on a budget, you get yourself out of debt, and you start investing, you give yourself a chance to grow your money.</p><p>So don't listen and don't feel panicked but start to get serious. That's why I developed the RIQ, the Retire Inspired Quotient. It's a free tool at my Web site chrishogan360.com where you start to plug in the numbers, Dagen, and it starts to get personal for you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to travel now, not in retirement but before my hips give out, and I need hip replacement surgery.</p><p>HOGAN: Well, I think there's nothing wrong with that. You know, as you get yourself out of debt and you start to save toward those trips, we know you travel as it is right now. Other people can travel too. It is just matter of having the goal and having a plan.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So people struggling to pay off student loans, I want your reaction to this. They're often the target of scammers. What should people be looking out for?</p><p>HOGAN: Well, first and foremost, Dagen, you can't delegate the responsibility of debt. These companies that are out there that are promising to take care of things for people, and they don't have to worry about it, you and I both know if it sounds too good to be true, it is not real.</p><p>So people with request student loan debt, write down debt smallest to biggest, get intentional with budgeting, start to throw extra bonus money at debs. I am talking to people every day on my show, The Chris Hogan Show that are paying off debt so I want people to know it's possible. Don't fall for a scheme. Take responsibility and attack the debt yourself.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Chris, good to see you. I made you laugh.</p><p>HOGAN: Good to see you, too.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Hip replacement surgery, I got to wait until I'm on Medicare to get that taken care of. Thank you, Chris. Take care.</p><p>HOGAN: Take care.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We're waiting for June retail sales due out in just moments. Again, is the consumer happy and healthy? We bring in those numbers right after the break. And health care in America, new procedures now covered under Medicare. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar weighs in later this hour.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Tuesday, July 16th. Your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. We're 10 seconds away some -- from some breaking news on the economy. 28-point gain on the Dow Futures as we wait for retail sales to come out. Again, the health of the consumer, this is one of the critical engines that's still driving this economy deep into this record-long expansion. 38-point gain on the Dow Futures right now. This after another record close for all three major market gauges yesterday.</p><p>We've also had some strong earnings out from -- particularly from Goldman Sachs earnings were down 6 percent year-over-year, but you see that stock up one percent, the retail sales came out, I think this is a gain of 0.4 percent. That is above expectations. Lauren Simonetti, did I hear that right?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: You did, Dagen. This is a nice round better than expected number, June retail sale, a gain four- tenths of one percent as you noted. Both the main number and the ex-auto component of that. The market was looking for a gain of a tenth of one percent, so when you ask how is the American household holding up? How is the consumer holding up? And the answer is a-OK, this is the sixth gain in seven months that we've seen. The resiliency of the U.S. consumer amid a slowdown in global growth and trade concerns out there.</p><p>Also, June, you know, start of the summer, but it also kind of wraps up the first half of 2018. The market responds to this report, Dagen, dead flat. The Dow is up 27 points before the report, it's up 30 right now, and not much movement for the other major averages either.</p><p>MCDOWELL: About ex-autos, so we look at the top line --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- number, but auto sales expected to weaken as the year rolled on. So, top line number a gain of four-tenths of one percent, but what about ex-autos? Do you have that in front of you?</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes. It is also four-tenths of one percent of a gain where the expectation's also a gain of a tenth of one percent, so that, too, better than expected.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- good news.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And we like it. Maybe the market isn't reacting, but we will. Thank you. Lauren Simonetti so much. Joining me now, Wells Fargo Securities, Managing Director, Senior Economist, Mark Vitner. I'm in hog heaven. I've got you and John Lonski, so it's a sandwich, so to speak. Mark, this is great news on the economy, and is this what we need to keep, not only the economy moving forward, but to keep these stock prices elevated at these record levels?</p><p>MARK VITNER, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WELLS FARGO: Well, it's clearly good news. We were looking at a gain of two-tenths or three-tenths percent. It came in ahead of that at four-tenths. You take out autos, you're still at four- tenths, and you take out, you know, you take out food and gasoline and autos, and you get what's known as the control group retail sales, which give you a very good idea of what -- how consumer spending's going to hold up in the GDP numbers.</p><p>That was up seven-tenths a percent, and we had a small upward revision to the prior month's data. So, the consumer's in pretty good shape right now, and I think that should alleviate some of the fears that folks have that just because this expansion's now at a record territory, that we're somehow due for tough times.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What could get in the way of this consumer, I say optimism, but, again, consumers are putting their money where their hearts and heads are.</p><p>LONSKI: Well, if something was to go wrong with the --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Sorry. Go ahead, John. And I'll get back to you, Mark.</p><p>LONSKI: Something, you know, something goes wrong in the labor market, OK, because of trade frictions and whatnot, or weaker -- you don't have weaker- than-expected earnings, so I don't think we're going to see any problems with employment or income growth that otherwise might halt growth by consumer spending. It's interesting that in this sluggish world economy who comes to the rescue, but the American consumer, it seems, that's keeping the world economy afloat.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And one thing, Mark, I'll just point out, one of the things that helped people's spending was the dropping gasoline prices. Again, that's a, you know, that's -- puts more money in their pockets the way a tax cut would.</p><p>VITNER: Yes, and that's is one of the reasons we were looking for the headline number to be a little bit softer, is that lower gasoline prices actually reduced the headline retail sales, and that's why we look at that core category, but consumers are getting a little bit of a -- of a break there, and that's, you know, that's one more --on more thing in our favor. You know, one of the things that was a little surprising in the second quarter is that we saw the tax refunds lower than they were a year ago, and a lot of folks were looking for that, to slow consumer spending.</p><p>But with these data, it looks like consumer spending in the second quarter in terms of the GDP data. Rose, somewhere in neighborhood, at 3-1/2 percent, maybe a little bit better than that, so we're likely to have very solid GDP growth in the second quarter.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I'll just point out, that we were looking at import prices fell more than expected. They were down nine-tenths of a percent so we're not importing any inflation.</p><p>VITNER: Yes. The tariffs don't seem to be -- to be impacting inflation ere in the U.S. I know a lot of folks think that it's going to have a huge impact, but a lot of Chinese producers have actually eaten at least a portion of the tariff or maybe the entire tariff because they want to try to protect their market share.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jack Brewer has a question.</p><p>BREWER: Yes, Mark, Jack Brewer, it -- when you look at the political landscape right now, and, you know, you see the messaging coming out of the Democratic Party and it's all about, you know, this is a trickle down, it's not getting to the -- to the right folks, and we have a big segment on of our population that really are tight right now not feeling effects of the Trump tax cuts but when you look at the numbers, it says otherwise. At what point does the reality fit the messaging here?</p><p>VITNER: Yes. I mean, it's sort of like that old Richard Pryor, \"Who are you going to believe, me or your own lying eyes?\" I mean it is -- it is -- it is -- it is -- it is -- it's plainly evident that the economy is doing well, and I -- and I kind of feel bad for some of the politicians that are hoping that it does worse because that's a terrible thing to hope for. It is -- the economy is broadening. Parts of the economy that didn't get a boost earlier in the expansion are now being lifted.</p><p>And one of the things that I spent a lot of my time, visiting with customers, and a lot of those customers are in smaller towns, or rural areas, and for a long time, the recovery just wasn't there. But in the last couple of years, we've seen the population growth in those rural areas has actually started to grow again, because jobs are coming back and the unemployment rates have come down in those areas. So if anything, the expansion seems to be broadening.</p><p>The one thing that I'm concerned about is that with the global economy slowing --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.</p><p>VITNER: -- the dollar is strengthened a little bit and that's slowing manufacturing activity in the U.S. and if that continues, that could slow the economy, although that's something to worry about for next year, not in 2019.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Lee, I want to get you in here on this because this is something you were talking about earlier. I've said this for months, the Democrats have to be very careful that they don't seem like that they're rooting for a slowdown.</p><p>CARTER: Oh, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That they're rooting for what they would label The Trump Recession. But they can't -- they cannot run well on this economy as it stands right now.</p><p>CARTER: I don't think that they can. And I think that there was a big risk that they were going to turn into the boy who cried wolf that's saying now it's going to run out, the economic boom's going to run out. Oh, now, look at it, it's being propped up, it's not going to work, and we're seeing that it's continuing to work quarter after quarter.</p><p>And so I think the Democrats have switched strategies. We've seen them say no longer is this now, you know, doom and gloom right around the corner, now it's the -- this isn't the economy for everyone, it's the economy for the wealthy, it's economy for the big businesses for profiting, and I think that's also a dangerous strategy when you're seeing consumer confidence as high as it is right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And John Lonski, before we go and say goodbye to Mark Vitner, the Federal Reserve is trying to ensure. It's necessarily fear of a recession that Jay Powell and company are reacting to, it's to make sure, like in 1998, that this expansion continues that's why they would cut rates later this month.</p><p>LONSKI: Exactly what they intend to do and that's why we're getting this rate cut at the end of July despite growth by consumer spending and an ultralow unemployment rate, inflation is very well contained. So, there is room for lower interest rates and as a result, you know, we've been looking at significant increases by mortgage applications for the purchase of a home, applications for mortgage refinancings are up by a tremendous amount year-over-year.</p><p>Lower interest rates will help to extend this upturn by consumer spending, and as long as the U.S. consumer spends, a recession is not in sight.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I'll just point, before we go, Mark, I'll point this out, on the front page of The Wall Street Journal today, \"The Hispanics are experiencing the largest home ownership gains of any ethnic group in the U.S., and it is shoring up our housing market.\" So, again, that is a rising tide lifting many boats.</p><p>VITNER: Absolutely. And we're seeing more and more good news in more and more parts of the economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you. Mark Vitner, always a pleasure to see you, sir. Maybe in person next time. Let's hope. Thank you, Mark.</p><p>VITNER: We'll hope so.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, the economy under President Trump booming all cylinders. Stuart Varney weighs in. And the high cost of health care, new procedures now covered under Medicare. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar is here to weigh in.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Trump economy, booming, as earnings season kicks off. And look at these retail sales numbers, Stuart Varney.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\"</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, that's what I was about to say, you know. If you look at any news program in America today, what you're going to be hearing about is the feud between President Trump, the Squad, and Speaker Pelosi and all these tweets that are rattling around, that's all you ever hear about. But if you look beneath all of that, you look at our economy, it's really in very, very good shape. As you said, Dagen, a 0.4 percent rise in retail sales doesn't sound like very much, but it's spectacular. On an annual basis, that is a serious infusion of money going into our economy.</p><p>Ultralow unemployment, solid growth, probably around 1-1/2 to two percent in the second quarter and secretary improving in the year, a year later on. Look, we've got a great economy, you don't hear anything about it and I wish we did, that's why this stock market, is, what, a 27,360 on the Dow Industrials, record high on the S&amp;P, record high on the NASDAQ. You know, we should pay more attention to the economy, dull subject as it is, Dagen. What do you say?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I say I would much rather debate policy over personality, and I would much rather talk about things that we can quantify like numbers, like spending because I'm a nerd and I would much rather discuss that over feelings.</p><p>VARNEY: I'm with you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I don't mean to dismiss people's feelings --</p><p>VARNEY: I'm with you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- but numbers over feelings, things that are tangible, bit ephemeral.</p><p>VARNEY: That's pretty good, Dagen. That really is good. Yes, I'm with you all the way on that. It's not feelings, I'm too old for that, no, it's reality, it's a great economy, have a look at it, invest in it for heaven's sake. What's going on here?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. When you buy a share of stock, when you invest in even a stock mutual fund, you are owning part of America.</p><p>VARNEY: Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You're owning American greatness.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Now wouldn't you rather do that than loan money to the federal government by buying treasuries?</p><p>VARNEY: Oh, yes. Yes. I would. Yes, I would, and I'd rather have Amazon's free college deal than Bernie Sanders' free college deal no matter how it feels.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. I love you doing the feel things.</p><p>VARNEY: I'm sorry. I won't do it again.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's why I said did that. No, no, no, I mean when I love it, I mean what I say, I love it. Thank you, Stuart. Good to see you.</p><p>VARNEY: See you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We'll see you in a little bit less than 15 minutes, \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" every day at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Coming up, the high cost of healthcare, new procedures now covered under Medicare. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar joins me next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: New procedures covered under Medicare. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed yesterday to cover acupuncture for Medicare patients suffering from lower back pain enrolled in relevant clinical trials. Joining me now, Health and Human Services Secretary, Alex Azar. Mr. Secretary, good to see you. This is in part related to trying to combat the opioid crisis, is it not?</p><p>ALEX AZAR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY: Absolutely, Dagen. Thanks for having me. This reflects President Trump's deep commitment to tackling opioid crisis. You know, one of the most important things that we've got to do is provide either pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical alternatives to these legal opioids that 50 million Americans need because they suffer from chronic pain and they need something.</p><p>And we've seen some promise with acupuncture, but we need to generate more data, and so what we have proposed is that Medicare would pay for senior citizens who would enter in to clinical trials or other approved studies, to test whether acupuncture can be an effective means of treating chronic lower back pain.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Will this help drive down overall cost within Medicare? Because I say this over and over and over again, when say the Democratic candidates talk about Medicare for All, which is really Medicare for none based on these proposals, but the hospital trust fund in Medicare alone, runs out of money in 2026. So, about seven years from now and then benefits would automatically be cut, too. I believe $0.89 on the dollar based on trustee's report.</p><p>What is the like -- I mean this won't be enough even if it drives down costs. When can the nation and lawmakers get their arms around the kind of mushrooming cost, and the ultimate Medicare going broke here?</p><p>AZAR: Well, this is why President Trump is committed to protecting Medicare for America's seniors. 60 million Americans rely on Medicare, he will be the bulwark, the defender of Medicare against those (INAUDIBLE) who want to weaken (INAUDIBLE) or extended tell their people to hurt the rest of our system and undermine Medicare solvency.</p><p>You know, we've got a budget proposal for the last of couple years with ideas that would extend the life of the Medicare Program because, not only could benefits be cut, taxes will start to cover the cost of Medicare when the trust fund runs out of money in 2026. We've got to deal with this. It is not the time for us to be thinking about extending Medicare to 350 million Americans.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to move on because you have a lot on your plate in terms of what you handle under Health and Human Services, and congress did pass that humanitarian bill. The President signed it into law, it's $4.6 billion in humanitarian relief, and Health and Human Services received I think it was 2.8 billion of that to deal with children unaccompanied, illegal immigrant, minors, into this country. Can you give us an update of how that money so far is being put to use, say into update on how many available beds that Health and Human Services has right now for these children.</p><p>AZAR: Thank you very much, and we're really grateful to the congress, for on a bipartisan basis passing this emergency humanitarian relief package. It took too long for it to happen but we're glad we have that money now, and we are seeing the results, we were able to immediately restore education, legal services and recreation to facilities for our kids. We have been -- that gives us the financial security that we can now actually contract to add permanent bedded capacity. We have a funding announcement out and we're working on extending over 3,000 additional permanent beds just from that approach.</p><p>We currently have 4,000 open beds in our facilities, so we've been able to get all children out of DHS, the Department of Homeland Security's custody, who have been -- who are were able to be moved. Of course you always have some children who might be medically fragile, have the flu and can't be moved until they're -- until they're healthy, but we don't have any children at the Department of Homeland Security that are waiting over 72 house. We have very few who have even been there 48 hours. So, we're just delighted that we've been able to take all these kids in, and we are discharging children out to sponsors, usually family members here in the United States, at a historic rate.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So I want to get your reaction to Vice President Joe Biden. He was talking about his healthcare ideas. Again, it's not full Medicare for all or single payer, but it is a public option. And so I want to -- I want to get your reaction to the language that the Vice President used and how that kind of sounds familiar in what we heard from President Obama. So, if you can listen to this, Mr. Secretary, I'll get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Anyone who has their employer-based health insurance they like, they can keep it.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You've got health insurance, you like your doctor, you like your plan, you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, with the Affordable Care Act, that actually didn't happen because a lot of people actually got dumped off their existing insurance. Many Americans did. Vice President Biden is trying to combat the single payer notions from, say, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren with a public option. What do you say?</p><p>AZAR: Well, I don't want to comment on any particular candidate's proposals, but I can talk about plans that have been proposed in congress for say a public option or what they call a Medicare buy-in. Listen, this is Medicare for All, just painted with different colors on it. What happens with these Medicare buy-ins is you would buy into a plan that still pays providers, hospitals and doctors, the radically suppressed Medicare rates. What does that mean? It means that private insurance could simply not compete against those plans and private insurance would go away.</p><p>It also means doctors and hospitals would stop taking Medicare because they can't afford to make a go of it at these suppressed rates if they don't have the other higher commercial rates. So, we would end up with a two- tier system like Europe has, we would have the best doctors and hospitals to get out of the system. This is why the President is committed to protecting America's seniors, protect Medicare and make it better. Do not undermine Medicare. Mr. Secretary, Alex Azar. Thank you for being here.</p><p>There's so much more we could have covered so you have to come back very soon, sir.</p><p>AZAR: Love to.</p><p>MCDOWELL: All right. Take care. Still ahead, final thoughts from our all-star panel. Stay with us.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Final thoughts from our all-stars. I'm starting with you, John. What about these retail sales numbers?</p><p>LONSKI: Pleased with those numbers. And I think the big story going forward will be how low can this unemployment rate go before we really run into a problem with inflation? I'm expecting that we'll have that unemployment rate go to three percent, if not lower, and inflation will still be well-contained.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Whoo. Jack.</p><p>BREWER: Like he just said, stop talking about personality. Let's talk about policy. Let's get off of all these really racial issues and let's focus on the real things that are affecting the real people in our inner cities first.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Lee.</p><p>CARTER: President, stay away from Twitter. And apologize for what you said, please.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Not happening.</p><p>CARTER: I know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Not happening. Lee Carter, Jack Brewer, John Lonski, thank you so much. And, Stuart, I leave you with this, I'm quoting another individual but, \"Facts don't care about your feelings.\"</p><p>VARNEY: Facts don't care about your feelings.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019071603cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKC-YDD1-DXH2-63PV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6932\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 16, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0001UJF</classCode><className>WELLS FARGO &amp;

But sadly, gentler ways have already faded online.</p><p>For some, of course, virtual meetings have actually been an improvement. GPs have whizzed through the appointments. The bias towards remote consultations will stay - so much cheaper, more efficient, allowing more time for those that really need the in-person treatment.</p><p>My parents-in-law rhapsodise about the app they use to play Bridge remotely, no driving to and fro, no tedious shuffling cards or tallying points. Plenty of chance to chat over an open phone line.</p><p>The pandemic has even breached that previously impervious legislative barrier: the Highway Act 1835, in combination with the Road Traffic Act 1988, which made electric scooters illegal wherever you took them: road, cycle lane or pavement.</p><p>This very week, a 12-month trial has begun, sanctioned by the Government, to see how electric scooters fit into the urban transport mix. Surely they are here to stay, especially as suspicion of enclosed and often crowded public transport endures.</p><p>Indeed, tech generally has been the big winner this pandemic, as you will know if you follow the share prices of Silicon Valley's finest. Not only have the world's biggest companies stepped in to ensure personal connectivity, they have been swiftly ushered into state-like business - just look at the NHS partnering with big tech, or the deployment by nations of the Apple/Google tracing app.</p><p>There is little that now seems beyond the reach of the biggest companies. So the most significant question post-lockdown will be this: will there be a backlash against their pervasiveness and power? During lockdown, if anything, latitude was granted. The UK Information Commissioner's Office announced that firms would have longer than usual to fix data breaches. Corona concerns saw Amazon's investment in Deliveroo approved by the Competition and Markets Authority, which also shied away from a full investigation of the online advertising industry so dominated by Facebook and Google.</p><p>But now lockdown is easing, regulation may climb back up the political agenda. Too Big to Fail became a critical issue in the financial crisis. Too big to catch, to compete with, to scrutinise properly, to do without, may soon be the issue for big tech. If that is so, our corona love affair with technology may be heading for a big break-up.</p><p>I'M PERSISTING WITH\u2026 Video conferencing. With my parents down the road, or tech wizards in the US, it's staying.. What I hope never to do again is\u2026 Home schooling. The tech made it possible. But . What I'd love to keep doing but probably shouldn't\u2026 Working from home. I love it. But I suspect I'll drift back to the office when it opens again.</p><p>MICHAEL HOGAN ON THE T V MOMENTS THAT TRANSFIXED US You'll get square eyes,\" is what parents used to say to children who watched too much telly. If the old wives' tale is true, we'll all have emerged from lockdown square-eyed, stragglyhaired, slightly overweight and unaccustomed to social interaction. An accurate description of most TV critics at the best of times, as it goes.</p><p>Stats say that Britons have watched 51 per cent more TV than usual over these past four months - from government briefings to binge-worthy box sets, from sport in eerily empty stadiums to repeated reality <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shows.No\">www.shows.No</url> wonder there was a stampede to the pub at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>Lockdown's first water cooler hit - or with everybody working from home, \"kitchen tap hit\" might be more accurate - was Netflix true crime freak show Tiger King. This stranger-than-fiction tale of big cats, bad fashion and murder plots doesn't look like going away any time soon. A dramatised version is in the works, with Nicolas Cage playing redneck Joe Exotic. Purrfect casting.</p><p>The BBC's addictive adaptation of Sally Rooney's Normal People had us obsessing over the mumblings and fumbling of two lovestruck Irish teens. Daisy Edgar-Jones excelled as privileged-butdamaged Marianne but Paul Mescal, aka workingclass romantic Connell, became the breakout star. His silver chain necklace and short shorts trended on Twitter. With talk of him being the next James Bond, Mescal-mania looks here to stay.</p><p>Spring TV's ratings sensations were a pair of fact-based dramas. ITV's Quiz (bravely for 2020, a drama about coughing) and BBC One's The Salisbury Poisonings were both cleverly stripped across the schedules over three consecutive nights, became event TV, and duly pulled in 10 million viewers. A dramatisation called The Leicester Lockdown might be in the pipeline already.</p><p>With the shutters coming down on TV production, remote filming came into its own. We've had Zoom King, dramas (Staged, Isolation Stories, Talking Heads), Zoom chat shows (The Graham Norton Show, Loose Women, Later\u2026 with Jools Holland) and Zoom panel games (Have I Got News For You). Handy for nosing at famous people's houses but I suspect we'll be so sick of video-calls that we'll never want to see such stilted, glitching awkwardness again. Grayson Perry's Art Club was the only offering that might have legs after lockdown is lifted.</p><p>Perhaps pandemic TV's biggest surprise has been the reinvention of professional motormouth Piers Morgan. He's gone from shouty irritant on Good Morning Britain to Covid-19's inquisitor-in-chief. Even long-suffering co-host Susanna Reid has stopped rolling her eyes as much.</p><p>Fundraising funnyman Matt Lucas became a lockdown hero (thank you, baked potato) and as the new host of Bake Off, could soon become even more beloved. However, the glitterball stopped spinning for Sophie Ellis-Bextor's Friday night \"kitchen discos\" - in which she'd glam up and belt out floor-fillers while dodging her five dancing children - around the same time we stopped clapping for carers.</p><p>not People, Tiger DIY satire became the hot TikTok trend, thanks to Michael Spicer's \"room next door\" skits and the lipsync Trump spoofs by US comedian Sarah Cooper. She soon spawned a British equivalent in voice artist Meggie Foster. Skewering politicians with their own words somehow suited the absurdity of lockdown life, but let's hope these new talents stick around.</p><p>Another thing we certainly hope continues is the gatecrashing of live interviews by children. With home-working parents and homeschooled kids, it's become more frequent, and always makes us feel much better about our own chaotic lockdown lives.</p><p>In the immortal words of Sky News foreign affairs editor Deborah Haynes's son: \"Mummy, can I have two biscuits?\" With those bargaining skills, the boy will go far.</p><p>WE'LL KEEP ON WITH\u2026 Family films and board games every weekend.. What I hope never to do again is\u2026 Frantically gesticulate at someone to unmute themselves on Zoom.</p><p>. What I would love to keep doing but probably shouldn't\u2026 Crossing the street to avoid annoying people under the guise of \"social distancing\".</p><p>SHANE WATSON ON THE WAY W E WORE (AND SHOPPED) The thing about lockdown was it didn't matter what you wore. Some people had Zoom meetings and needed to make an effort on top, the rest of us had permission to go full Sunday slob and wear the same loose grey clothes, day after day. So what did we do, as soon as we were free to dress like bums? We started shopping.</p><p>First there was the exercise wear phase. Within days it became clear that lockdown was creating a new competitive environment: instead of being the busiest, youngestlooking, mother of minimum four, the trick was to be the fittest and the best cook, but mainly the fittest. And for that challenge we realised we required brand new exercise kit. (Also by now we had seen a young woman going through her routine in the park wearing a black Nike racing back T and three-quarter leggings and decided that while we couldn't wear the shorts her friend was wearing, we could certainly give that look a whirl). I'm still wearing my Nike gear, because it makes me feel like the sort of Californian yuppie who would never dream of getting stuck into the pinot grigio at three minutes past six, and might, in fact, go for a run instead. Before the lockdown I hooted at the idea of smart exercise wear; now I'm a believer in its motivational powers.</p><p>Then in early April, phase two kicked in: the \"Mustn't Turn into A Bloke\" phase. Remember in 30 Rock when Jack Donaghy tells Lemon to get out of her sporty clothes and go and buy some \"from a womenswear store\"? Well, that's roughly what we told ourselves, partly because we were starting to feel like leathery old cat burglars and partly because it was hot, the blossom was out, and we felt the need of a flippy dress. It must be said that the dresses we ordered in P2 were a lot prettier than our usual and there was, in hindsight, an element of escapism going on. Fairly sure (since I haven't worn them) that the purchase of the yellow one with puffed sleeves, and the pink flowery one, was brought on by the springtime-in-Rome weather. The drop earrings, same thing.</p><p>Phase three was \"Let's Make This a 1970s Summer\". Was it all the rainbows in the windows? Was it the summer of '76 weather, the shaggy untended hair and working in the garden with a cup of tea and the radio on (which did feel a lot like O-level revision week)? Whatever, there was something 1970s in the air, and in May our thoughts turned to denim skirts (ordered! Worn!). Clogs (ordered! Worn!) A maxi skirt in Indian cotton blockprint (ordered! Not worn). And dungarees (ordered. Sent back on account of the fit).</p><p>doing lockdown (but could)\u2026</p><p>old dress in Meanwhile thousands of women are lockdown dungaree converts and it's not just because they're comfy.</p><p>They make you feel the way we want to feel now - resourceful, practical, not precious, and free - like Meryl Streep in Mamma Mia. Will I be wearing the 1970s stuffout in the new world? Oh yes.</p><p>This is going to be a slow, Scrabble and sou'westers, 1970s kind of summer.</p><p>Phase four - the one we're in - is the Hope Chest phase. It started at the beginning of June, about the time we'd accepted that we were going nowhere on holiday, and went shopping anyway - for swimming costumes, sunglasses, the sort of top you can only wear in a place with ceiling fans and mosquito nets.</p><p>They turned up one after the other in hot pink tissue paper looking bright and cheering and that was half the point. The swimsuit (Boden Santorini, works like Spanx) will come in useful, the rest we can stuffunder a hoodie and a waterproof poncho and we're good to go.</p><p>I'LL STILL BE WEARING\u2026Clogs. What I hope never to do again is\u2026 Wear high heels. The thing I won't be able to carry on doing now lockdown has ended (but wish I could)\u2026 Wear an old cotton dress that's ripped in six places.</p><p>JOEL SNAPE ON THE F ITNESS TRENDS THAT F LOORED US Dedicated gymjunkies have known for years what the rest of the country has come to realise over the last few months: that finding time to train is more about mental health than shedding pounds or adding them to the bar. In lockdown, that's become even more important - for thousands of people, carving out even 20 minutes a day to have a brisk run, a leisurely stroll or a few horrible rounds of burpees, has become a way to set everything else aside and focus on your own well-being, and I hope that's a trend that will continue as commutes creep back and hangovers kick in.</p><p>I'LL \"Crazy that my hangs as I do dogs flow. What never again the to make get at Leading the charge for feelgood fitness, of course, was Joe Wicks, a man so enthusiastic about the benefits of exercise that he somehow made doing lunges in a Scooby-Doo suit - at 9am every day, for months - look a bit like fun. Wicks, and the rest of YouTube's most personable trainers, are likely to be some of the biggest beneficiaries of lockdown - they've seen their followings grow, and some people are unlikely to go back to the gym for months, if at all. Bespoke options are becoming more globalised, as Zoom yoga classes allow anyone to jump in and gyms live-stream classes for anyone who wants them.</p><p>Impersonal offline trainers - the ones who don't do much more than repcount and cheerlead - are likely to suffer, as their clients realise they can find cheaper, more cheerful alternatives online. Proper personal trainers, who provide the sort of feedback on form and targeted training that you can't get from generic plans, will, hopefully, thrive.</p><p>What will the other long-lasting effects be? With luck, some of the people who bought up the entire European stock of kettlebells and pull-up bars will actually use them. Moving outdoors, the reputation of joggers might never recover: they've often been stereotyped as pavement-hogs, and the way most of them ignored social distancing, panting and droplet-spraying their way past slower park users, hasn't helped. Top tip, runners: you can run sideways a bit without ruining your gait or your gains. It might even help your ankle stability! If Couch to 5K has helped you rediscover the joy of bounding around the park, great. Just spare a thought for the pensioners and pram-pushers who do not care about your PB.</p><p>Still on selfishness, what remains to be seen is how gyms are going to fare in a post-lockdown world: it's likely only places in touch with their clientele will survive. Pre-Covid, a solid 20 per cent of gymgoers wouldn't even deign to put their dumbbells back, so expecting them to wipe down treadmills, benches and bars, unsupervised, seems like a forlorn hope.</p><p>Boutique gyms may do better: many already have protocols for cleaning kit between classes, and as hygiene remains top-ofmind that'll be key. Whether group fitness classes will resurge is tricky to predict - there's something about competing in a group that's tough to match at home, but since it's currently impossible to watch people shake hands in a period drama without a twinge of horror, holding someone's legs while they do crunches feels a long way off.</p><p>Still, if there's one positive fitness effect, let it be an end to the creeping ubiquity of post-class high-fives, chest-bumps and bro-hugs, in favour of the fist-bump, bow, or Vulcan salute.</p><p>I'LL KEEP ON PLAYING\u2026 \"Crazy Horse\", that game where my toddler hangs on to me as I do pressups, downward dogs and animal flow moves.. What I hope never to do again is\u2026 Go to the shops at 6am to make sure I get at least some fresh veg for the week.. What I would love to keep doing but probably shouldn't\u2026 Leave my pull-up rig up in the background of Zoom calls. The gym rings just prompt too many questions.</p><p>regular joe Wicks, the nation's favourite trainer, is loved. Joggers, above, are often not DEBORA ROBERTSON ON OUR FASCINATING FOOD FADS As we emerge into the sunlight, many of us having been confined to our four walls these past months, some of us are left pondering - as we ease our way back into proper clothes - how we allowed the hour-long health walk to become downgraded so quickly to the waddle to the fridge. Daily meditation became standing in its cold, cruel light, wondering what to eat next. Goodbye kimchi my old friend, I hope to eat with you again.</p><p>I'M CARRY Certainly, food - the getting of it, the cooking of it, the eating of it - has sustained us in more ways than one during this crisis.</p><p>Shopping order ingredients. really finding producers middle this and good to you are to support British companies, many of are having hard. What At the beginning, at the height of the supermarket slot panic, we became adept at finding new sources to replace our usual supermarket deliveries, from one-stopalternative-shop places such as Farmdrop or Farm Direct, to specialists selling one perfect thing, from mutton, to lobsters, goat, or asparagus.</p><p>Where I live in London, our local shops stepped up. My neighbourhood bakery, The Spence, provided the highlight of my Wednesday mornings, when I would wake to find a brown paper bag of bread, croissants, sausage rolls, various flours and fresh yeast on my doorstep. My butcher, Meat N16, turned its hand to local drop-offs. A bloke on a bike started delivering eggs by the dozen, usually within the hour. This return to the way our grandmothers shopped, with their favoured suppliers making regular weekday deliveries, for many of us reignited our loyalty to those local traders who were there when we needed them.</p><p>We also developed an excellent strand of greedy altruism. As restaurants closed, suppliers began to struggle to find outlets for their produce. Pioneering cheesemonger Neal's Yard Dairy and others created mail order boxes of cheeses to help keep suppliers going. Fighting the good fight, one slab of Kirkham's Lancashire at a time.</p><p>Having food delivered turned every day into a mini-Christmas, especially if, like me, you ordered things then instantly forgot you had. Lo, a beautiful box of Isle of Wight tomatoes in all shapes and sizes and every shade from golden through scarlet to almost black; a box of garlicky salamis; half a case of wine - move over gold, frankincense and myrrh, there are new gifts in town.</p><p>And then of course there was all the cooking. In shapeless days, meals formed the only highlight. Every night was Friday night. Simple was replaced by elaborate. If you ever fancied trying your hand at making your own biang biang noodles or chocolate babka, or perfecting your roast chicken, what better time than the endless now? For those who missed restaurants too much, many turned their hands to posh make-at-home ready meals that you could enjoy over your are-we-having-fun-yet Zoom dinner dates. And of course, we all became enormously wholesome. Social media posts about our sourdough, banana bread, kombucha and kefir replaced our actual social lives.</p><p>Then, just when the air was feeling a little rarefied up there in gourmetlockdown land, we reignited our love for that snack of snacks: crisps. What else could power us so well through those endless Netflix marathons (apart perhaps from buckets of gourmet popcorn)? Of course we need to talk about drink. At the beginning, when time meant nothing, the cocktail hour frequently nudged its way into tea time.</p><p>Christmas every day Food deliveries became a source of great excitement Some of us may have thought we were creating our very own Roaring Twenties with our frostyglassed gimlets, Martinis, greyhounds, and aviators. The rest of us were making hasty assemblies from the back of the drinks cabinet, suddenly finding a use for that 12-year-old bottle of blue cura\u00e7ao that came with the house. The latter-day lockdown cocktail of choice though has become a mocktail, as smart non-alcoholic drinks like those from Seedlip, Dash and Punchy have gained ground. We've also bought more and better wine, as we've shopped just to please ourselves, rather than guests who don't necessarily know the difference between Vimto and Viognier.</p><p>What, if anything, will we take with us into our new \"old\" lives? With any luck, that feeling of how food has the power to anchor us as it nurtures us, and how if you do it right, every day can be made to feel like Christmas.</p><p>I'M GOING TO CARRY ON\u2026 Shopping mail order for special ingredients. I've really enjoyed finding new producers in the middle of all of this and it feels good to know you are helping to support British companies, many of which are having a hard time.. What I hope never to do again is\u2026 Set my alarm for 5am to see if I can bag an Ocado slot.. What I would love to keep doing but probably shouldn't as it feels lazy is\u2026 To have bread, meat and eggs delivered from my local shops - I could do with the walk.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>normal, and not Normal People,top, and Tiger King,below</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUTELE-161482907</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUTELE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60BD-8P81-DYTY-C4NX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334988</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3534\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"58170\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 12, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001804</classCode><className>VIDEO CONFERENCING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000DBAE</classCode><className>HIGHWAY TRANSPORTATION LAW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000731</classCode><className>FLEXTIME</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000515</classCode><className>DISTANCE LEARNING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0008X6L</classCode><className>RELOCATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX002188</classCode><className>TRANSPORTATION LAW</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI</classCode><className>Transportation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000DOD1</classCode><className>BIKE LANES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001804</classCode><className>VIDEO CONFERENCING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000DBAE</classCode><className>HIGHWAY TRANSPORTATION LAW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000161</classCode><className>BANDWIDTH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N510000CC</classCode><className>MEDIA &amp;

How was it for you? And what did it all mean? Was it really only three months ago that we were binge-watching Tiger King? Did we really buy so much mail-order cheese? Did we need to buy so many clothes, and will we ever stop hating joggers, or Zoom meetings? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We asked Telegraph writers to reveal the fads and fixes that got them through the strangest few months that - we hope - we will ever have to experience.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                                            Debora Robertson &amp;#x2028;on our fascinating food fads                                        </p><p>As we emerge into the sunlight, many of us having been confined to our four walls these past months, some of us are left pondering - as we ease our way back into proper clothes - how we allowed the hour-long health walk to become downgraded so quickly to the waddle to the fridge. Daily meditation became standing in its cold, cruel light, wondering what to eat next. Goodbye <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recipes/0/kombucha-kefir-kimchi-kraut-ferment-way-cultured-2019/\">kimchi</url> my old friend, I hope to eat with you again.</p><p>Certainly, food - the getting of it, the cooking of it, the eating of it - has sustained us in more ways than one during this crisis.</p><p>At the beginning, at the height of the supermarket slot panic, we became adept at finding new sources to replace our usual supermarket deliveries, from one-stop-alternative-shop places such as Farmdrop or Farm Direct, to specialists selling one perfect thing, from mutton, to lobsters, goat, or asparagus.</p><p>Where I live in London, our local shops stepped up. My neighbourhood bakery, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recipes/0/kombucha-kefir-kimchi-kraut-ferment-way-cultured-2019/\">The Spence</url>, provided the highlight of my Wednesday mornings, when I would wake to find a brown paper bag of bread, croissants, sausage rolls, various flours and fresh yeast on my doorstep. My butcher, Meat N16, turned its hand to local drop-offs. A bloke on a bike started delivering eggs by the dozen, usually within the hour. This return to the way our grandmothers shopped, with their favoured suppliers making regular weekday deliveries, for many of us reignited our loyalty to those local traders who were there when we needed them.</p><p>We also developed an excellent strand of greedy altruism. As restaurants closed, suppliers began to struggle to find outlets for their produce. Pioneering cheesemonger <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recipes/0/kombucha-kefir-kimchi-kraut-ferment-way-cultured-2019/\">Neal's Yard Dairy</url> and others created mail order boxes of cheeses to help keep suppliers going. Fighting the good fight, one slab of Kirkham's Lancashire at a time.</p><p>Having <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recipes/0/kombucha-kefir-kimchi-kraut-ferment-way-cultured-2019/\">food delivered</url> turned every day into a mini-Christmas, especially if, like me, you ordered things then instantly forgot you had. Lo, a beautiful box of Isle of Wight tomatoes in all shapes and sizes and every shade from golden through scarlet to almost black; a box of garlicky salamis; half a case of wine - move over gold, frankincense and myrrh, there are new gifts in town.</p><p>And then of course there was all the cooking. In shapeless days, meals formed the only highlight. Every night was Friday night. Simple was replaced by elaborate. If you ever fancied trying your hand at making your own biang biang noodles or chocolate babka, or perfecting your roast chicken, what better time than the endless now?</p><p>For those who missed restaurants too much, many turned their hands to posh make-at-home ready meals that you could enjoy over your are-we-having-fun-yet Zoom dinner dates. And of course, we all became enormously wholesome. Social media posts about our sourdough, banana bread, kombucha and kefir replaced our actual social lives.</p><p>Then, just when the air was feeling a little rarefied up there in gourmet-lockdown land, we reignited our love for that snack of snacks: crisps. What else could power us so well through those endless Netflix marathons (apart perhaps from buckets of gourmet popcorn)?</p><p>Of course we need to talk about drink. At the beginning, when time meant nothing, the cocktail hour frequently nudged its way into tea time. Some of us may have thought we were creating our very own Roaring Twenties with our frosty-glassed gimlets, Martinis, greyhounds, and aviators. The rest of us were making hasty assemblies from the back of the drinks cabinet, suddenly finding a use for that 12-year-old bottle of blue cura\u00e7ao that came with the house. The latter-day lockdown cocktail of choice though has become a mocktail, as smart non-alcoholic drinks like those from Seedlip, Dash and Punchy have gained ground. We've also bought more and better wine, as we've shopped just to please ourselves, rather than guests who don't necessarily know the difference between Vimto and Viognier.</p><p>What, if anything, will we take with us into our new \"old\" lives? With any luck, that feeling of how food has the power to anchor us as it nurtures us, and how if you do it right, every day can be made to feel like &amp;#x2028;Christmas.</p><p>                                            I'm going to &amp;#x2028;carry on...                                        </p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Shopping mail order for special ingredients.

If the old wives' tale is true, we'll all emerge from lockdown square-eyed, straggly-haired, slightly overweight and unaccustomed to social interaction. An accurate description of most TV critics at the best of times, as it goes.Stats say that Britons have watched 51 per cent more TV than usual over these past four months - from government briefings to binge-worthy box sets, from sport in eerily empty stadiums to repeated reality shows. No wonder there was a stampede to the pub at the earliest opportunity.Lockdown's first water cooler hit - or with everybody working from home, \"kitchen tap hit\" might be more accurate - was Netflix true crime freak show <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recipes/0/kombucha-kefir-kimchi-kraut-ferment-way-cultured-2019/\">Tiger King.</url> This stranger-than-fiction tale of big cats, bad fashion and murder plots doesn't look like going away any time soon. A dramatised version is in the works, with Nicolas Cage playing redneck Joe Exotic. Purrfect casting.The BBC's addictive adaptation of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recipes/0/kombucha-kefir-kimchi-kraut-ferment-way-cultured-2019/\">Sally Rooney's Normal People</url> had us obsessing over the mumblings and fumbling of two lovestruck Irish teens. Daisy Edgar-Jones excelled as privileged-but-damaged Marianne but Paul Mescal, aka working-class romantic Connell, became the breakout star. His silver chain necklace and short shorts trended on Twitter. With talk of him being the next James Bond, Mescal-mania looks here to stay.Spring TV's ratings sensations were a pair of fact-based dramas. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recipes/0/kombucha-kefir-kimchi-kraut-ferment-way-cultured-2019/\">ITV's Quiz</url> (bravely for 2020, a drama about coughing) and BBC One's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recipes/0/kombucha-kefir-kimchi-kraut-ferment-way-cultured-2019/\">The Salisbury Poisonings</url> were both cleverly stripped across the schedules over three consecutive nights, became event TV, and duly pulled in 10 million viewers. A dramatisation called The Leicester Lockdown might be in the pipeline already.With the shutters coming down on TV production, remote filming came into its own. We've had Zoom dramas (Staged, Isolation Stories, Talking Heads), Zoom chat shows (The Graham Norton Show, Loose Women, Later... with Jools Holland) and Zoom panel games (Have I Got News For You). Handy for nosing at famous people's houses but I suspect we'll be so sick of video-calls that we'll never want to see such stilted, glitching awkwardness again. Grayson Perry's Art Club was the only offering that might have legs after lockdown is lifted.Perhaps pandemic TV's biggest surprise has been the reinvention of professional motormouth Piers Morgan. He's gone from shouty irritant on Good Morning Britain to Covid-19's inquisitor-in-chief. Even long-suffering co-host Susanna Reid has stopped rolling her eyes as much.Fundraising funnyman Matt Lucas became a lockdown hero (thank you, baked potato) and as the new host of Bake Off, could soon become even more beloved. However, the glitterball stopped spinning for Sophie Ellis-Bextor's Friday night \"kitchen discos\" - in which she'd glam up and belt out floor-fillers while dodging her five dancing children - around the same time we stopped clapping for carers.DIY satire became the hot <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recipes/0/kombucha-kefir-kimchi-kraut-ferment-way-cultured-2019/\">TikTok</url> trend, thanks to Michael Spicer's \"room next door\" skits and the lipsync Trump spoofs by US comedian Sarah Cooper. She soon spawned a British equivalent in voice artist Meggie Foster. Skewering politicians with their own words somehow suited the absurdity of lockdown life, but let's hope these new talents stick around.Another thing we certainly hope continues is the gatecrashing of live interviews by children. With home-working parents and homeschooled kids, it's become more frequent, and always makes us feel much better about our own chaotic lockdown lives. In the immortal words of Sky News foreign affairs editor Deborah Haynes's son: \"Mummy, can I have two biscuits?\" With those bargaining skills, the boy will go far.We'll keep on with... <list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Family films and board games every weekend.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>What I hope never to do again is...

Crossing the street to avoid annoying people under the guise of \"social distancing\".</p></bodyText></listItem></list>Shane Watson &amp;#x2028;on our fashion passionsThe thing about lockdown was it didn't matter what you wore. Some people had Zoom meetings and needed to make an effort on top, the rest of us had permission to go full Sunday slob and wear the same loose grey clothes, day after day. So what did we do, as soon as we were free to dress like bums? We started shopping.First there was the exercise wear phase. Within days it became clear that lockdown was creating a new competitive environment: instead of being the busiest, youngest-looking, mother of minimum four, the trick was to be the fittest and the best cook, but mainly the fittest. And for that challenge we realised we required brand new exercise kit. (Also by now we had seen a young woman going through her routine in the park wearing a black Nike racing back T and three-quarter leggings and decided that while we couldn't wear the shorts her friend was wearing, we could certainly give that look a whirl). I'm still wearing my Nike gear, because it makes me feel like the sort of Californian yuppie who would never dream of getting stuck into the pinot grigio at three minutes past six, and might, in fact, go for a run instead. Before the lockdown I hooted at the idea of smart exercise wear; now I'm a believer in its motivational powers.Then in early April, phase two kicked in: the \"Mustn't Turn into A Bloke\" phase. Remember in 30 Rock when Jack Donaghy tells Lemon to get out of her sporty clothes and go and buy some \"from a womenswear store\"? Well, that's roughly what we told ourselves, partly because we were starting to feel like leathery old cat burglars and partly because it was hot, the blossom was out, and we felt the need of a flippy dress.It must be said that the dresses we ordered in P2 were a lot prettier than our usual and there was, in hindsight, an element of escapism going on. Fairly sure (since I haven't worn them) that the purchase of the yellow one with puffed sleeves, and the pink flowery one, was brought on by the springtime-in-Rome weather. The drop earrings, same thing.Phase three was \"Let's Make This a 1970s Summer\". Was it all the rainbows in the windows? Was it the summer of '76 weather, the shaggy untended hair and working in the garden with a cup of tea and the radio on (which did feel a lot like O level revision week)? Whatever, there was something 1970s in the air, and in May our thoughts turned to denim skirts (ordered. Worn!). Clogs (ordered! Worn!) A maxi skirt in Indian cotton blockprint (ordered! Not worn). And dungarees (ordered. Sent back on account of the fit).Meanwhile thousands of women are lockdown dungaree converts and it's not just because they're comfy. They make you feel the way we want to feel now - resourceful, practical, not precious, and free - like Meryl Streep in Mamma Mia. Will I be wearing the 1970s stuff out in the new world? Oh yes. This is going to be a slow, Scrabble and sou'westers, 1970s kind of summer.Phase four - the one we're in - is the Hope Chest phase. It started at the beginning of June, about the time we'd accepted that we were going nowhere on holiday, and went shopping anyway - for swimming costumes, sunglasses, the sort of top you can only wear in a place with ceiling fans and mosquito nets.They turned up one after the other in hot pink tissue paper looking bright and cheering and that was half the point. The swimsuit (Boden Santorini, works like Spanx) will come in useful, the rest we can stuff under a hoodie and a waterproof poncho and we're good to go.I'll still be wearing...<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Clogs</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>What I hope never to do again is...

In lockdown, that's become even more important - for thousands of people, carving out even 20 minutes a day to have a brisk run, a leisurely stroll or a few horrible rounds of burpees, has become a way to set everything else aside and focus on your own well-being, and I hope that's a trend that will continue as commutes creep back and hangovers kick in.Leading the charge for feelgood fitness, of course, was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recipes/0/kombucha-kefir-kimchi-kraut-ferment-way-cultured-2019/\">Joe Wicks</url>, a man so enthusiastic about the benefits of exercise that he somehow made doing lunges in a Scooby-Doo suit - at 9am every day, for months - look a bit like fun. Wicks, and the rest of YouTube's most personable trainers, are likely to be some of the biggest beneficiaries of lockdown - they've seen their followings grow, and some people are unlikely to go back to the gym for months, if at all. Bespoke options are becoming more globalised, as Zoom yoga classes allow anyone to jump in and gyms live-stream classes for anyone who wants them.Impersonal offline trainers - the ones who don't do much more than rep-count and cheerlead - are likely to suffer, as their clients realise they can find cheaper, more cheerful alternatives online. Proper personal trainers, who provide the sort of feedback on form and targeted training that you can't get from generic plans, will, hopefully, thrive.What will the other long-lasting effects be?&amp;#x2028; With luck, some of the people who bought up the entire European stock of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recipes/0/kombucha-kefir-kimchi-kraut-ferment-way-cultured-2019/\">kettlebells and pull-up bars</url> will actually use them. Moving outdoors, the reputation of joggers might never recover: they've often been stereotyped as pavement-hogs, and the way most of them ignored social distancing, panting and droplet-spraying their way past slower park users, hasn't helped. Top tip, runners: you can run sideways a bit without ruining your gait or your gains. It might even help your ankle stability!<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recipes/0/kombucha-kefir-kimchi-kraut-ferment-way-cultured-2019/\">If Couch to 5K has helped you rediscover the joy</url> of bounding around the park, great. Just spare a thought for the pensioners and pram-pushers who do not care about your PB.Still on selfishness, what remains to be seen is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recipes/0/kombucha-kefir-kimchi-kraut-ferment-way-cultured-2019/\">how gyms are going to fare</url> in a post-lockdown world: it's likely only places in touch with their clientele will survive. Pre-Covid, a solid 20 per cent of gymgoers wouldn't even deign to put their dumbbells back, so expecting them to wipe down treadmills, benches and bars, unsupervised, seems like a forlorn hope.Boutique gyms may do better: many already have protocols for cleaning kit between classes, and as hygiene remains top-of-mind that'll be key. Whether group fitness classes will resurge is tricky to predict - there's something about competing in a group that's tough to match at home, but since it's currently impossible to watch people shake hands in a period drama without a twinge of horror, holding someone's legs while they do crunches feels a long way off.Still, if there's one positive fitness effect, let it be an end to the creeping ubiquity of post-class high-fives, chest-bumps and bro-hugs, in favour of the fist-bump, bow, or Vulcan salute.I'll keep on playing...<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>\"Crazy Horse\", that game where my toddler hangs on to me as I do press-ups, downward dogs and animal flow moves.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>What I hope never to do again is...

Who imagined there could be so many, jostling for screen space and disk space, desperately claiming to be Numero Uno at keeping you face to face with your office/your chums/your children's virtual birthday party invitees...?Skype we knew. And FaceTime too. But <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recipes/0/kombucha-kefir-kimchi-kraut-ferment-way-cultured-2019/\">then came Zoom</url>. Don't forget Hangouts. Or Slack. Or Teams. Did you get round to GoToMeeting?Will Houseparty, that blazing star of lockdown's early days, downloaded 17 million times in March, continue to soar across the virtual firmament now that measures are easing? I'm not sure.But in general all those tools that allowed us effortlessly to toil and play remotely are staying, as the long-term impacts of the pandemic - smaller offices, genuine flexitime, distance learning and working - make themselves felt.The limiting factor will not be desire but internet speeds. How many happy hipsters relocating from Hackney to Hampshire will find that the new virtual tools of their trade require more than piddling rural bandwidth? As for that mobile signal...Social media, we know already, will go unreformed. How quickly the solidarity of those early days broke down into the usual political bickering and point-scoring.On Instagram, there were perhaps marginally fewer humblebrag pictures - \"just relaxing in the amazing Highland landscape\" - as urbanites hunkered down and realised that rubbing their lockdown escape in other people's faces was not the done thing, indeed was potentially illegal. \"We're all in this together\" is the very antithesis of the bitter spirit that fuels some social media envy-engines. But sadly, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recipes/0/kombucha-kefir-kimchi-kraut-ferment-way-cultured-2019/\">gentler ways have already faded online</url>.For some, of course, virtual meetings have actually been an improvement. GPs have whizzed through the appointments. The bias towards remote consultations will stay - so much cheaper, more efficient, allowing more time for those that really need the in-person treatment.My parents-in-law rhapsodise about the app they use to play Bridge remotely, no driving to and fro, no tedious shuffling cards or tallying points. Plenty of chance to chat over an open phone line.The pandemic has even breached that previously impervious legislative barrier: the Highway Act 1835, in combination with the Road Traffic Act 1988, which made electric scooters illegal wherever you took them: road, cycle lane or pavement.This very week, a 12-month trial has begun, sanctioned by the Government, to see how <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recipes/0/kombucha-kefir-kimchi-kraut-ferment-way-cultured-2019/\">electric scooters</url> fit into the urban transport mix. Surely they are here to stay, especially as suspicion of enclosed and often crowded public transport endures.Indeed, tech generally has been the big winner this pandemic, as you will know if you follow the share prices of Silicon Valley's finest. Not only have the world's biggest companies stepped in to ensure personal connectivity, they have been swiftly ushered into state-like business - just look at the NHS partnering with big tech, or the deployment by nations of the Apple/Google tracing app.There is little that now seems beyond the reach of the biggest companies. So the most significant question post-lockdown will be this: will there be a backlash against their pervasiveness and power?During lockdown, if anything, latitude was granted. The UK Information Commissioner's Office announced that firms would have longer than usual to fix data breaches. Corona concerns saw Amazon's investment in Deliveroo approved by the Competition and Markets Authority, which also shied away from a full investigation of the online advertising industry so dominated by Facebook and Google.But now lockdown is easing, regulation may climb back up the political agenda. Too Big to Fail became a critical issue in the financial crisis. Too big to catch, to compete with, to scrutinise properly, to do without, may soon be the issue for big tech. If that is so, our corona love affair with technology may be heading for a big break-up.I'm persisting with...<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Video conferencing.

He is sitting, wide-eyed, intense, in his office in a co-working space in downtown San Francisco.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Unless you've felt it, unless you've cried over the fact that we really thought we were making the world a better place with the internet...\" He pauses. \"We 100 per cent believed that.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Humanity, he says, is living through \"two super old stories. One: be careful what you wish for, because you'll get it... And two: creators losing control of their creations.\"\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He should know, because he is one of those Dr Frankensteins. As the son of Silicon Valley royalty (or at least nobility), he spent years merrily building technology that he believed was changing the world. It did, but not in the way that he hoped.</p><p>Now he is now at the heart of the backlash against Big Tech as one of the public faces of the Centre for Humane Technology, a non-profit group that he founded with former Google product manager Tristan Harris ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/25/social-media-like-heroin-children-silicon-valley-engineers/\">whom the Telegraph interviewed last year</url> ) and \"social impact\" consultant Randy Fernando. Though the Centre was only founded last February,\u00a0its influence is growing throughout the industry that it is trying to reform.</p><p>\"There are two types of dystopias and we missed one of them,\" Mr Raskin tells the Telegraph.\u00a0\"There's the Orwell dystopia\" - referencing George Orwell's 1984 - \"and the Huxley dystopia\" - a reference to Aldous Huxley's altogether stranger and more subtle 1932 novel\u00a0Brave New World.\u00a0</p><p>\"In the Orwell dystopia people don't read books because they're banned,\" he says.\u00a0\"In The Huxley dystopia people don't read books because they're distracted... In the Orwell dystopia, the things that we fear will get us. And in the Huxley dystopia things that we desire will get us.\"</p><p>                   'The end of human agency'                   </p><p>This cause has already notched up one victory, albeit a partial one. In 2013, Mr Harris <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/25/social-media-like-heroin-children-silicon-valley-engineers/\">spread around a presentation inside Google</url> warning that its design practices were exploiting people's psychology to steal their time. He urged his colleagues instead to use their power over millions of Android phones and Chrome web browsers to \"minimise distractions\" and create \"calmer states of mind\".</p><p>Google made him a \"design ethicist\", but he did not feel he was making a difference, and by 2016\u00a0he had left Google to campaign full-time under the slogan of \"time well spent\". Two years later, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/25/social-media-like-heroin-children-silicon-valley-engineers/\">Mark Zuckerberg had adopted the motto for himself</url>, proclaiming it the new goal of Facebook's news feed algorithms, while Google and Apple       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/25/social-media-like-heroin-children-silicon-valley-engineers/\">added new time management feature</url> s features to their smartphones.\u00a0It was hardly the revolution Mr Harris had hoped for, but it was a start. \u00a0</p><p>So now he and Mr Raskin are preaching a new gospel, which they call \"human downgrading\". The phrase is the fruit of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/25/social-media-like-heroin-children-silicon-valley-engineers/\">a series of manic brainstorming sessions</url> in San Francisco and at the Esalen Institute, a new age retreat on the California coastline. Unlike \"time well spent\", it is a dark and ominous vision.\u00a0</p><p>At a jazz hall in San Francisco last month, the pair gathered an audience of celebrities (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), activists (Wael Ghonim, a computer engineer who helped kickstart the Arab Spring in Egypt) and tech luminaries, from powerful industry figures (Rob Goldman, Facebook's vice president of advertising) to longtime critics (Justin Rosenstein, the disenchanted inventor of the like button). Then they issued a warning: tech giants are creating the cultural equivalent of climate change.</p><p>Addiction, distraction, disinformation, polarisation and radicalisation; all these \"hurricanes\", Mr Raskin and Mr Harris argue, have one common cause. They come from the fact that we now spend large portions of our lives inside artificial social systems, which are run by private companies for profit.</p><p>That would be fine \u00a0if their profits came from making us better human beings, but instead they are part of an \"extractive attention economy\", where money is made through the capture of time and attention. The phrase recalls the work of Shoshana Zuboff, a sociologist who argued in her book\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/25/social-media-like-heroin-children-silicon-valley-engineers/\">Surveillance Capitalism</url> \u00a0that social networks are more like strip-miners than service providers, using data as \"raw material\" for their real products.</p><p>These factors together have created a \"race to the bottom of the brainstem\", in which increasingly \"overwhelming\" and sophisticated AI tools are devoted to exploiting what Mr Raskin calls the \"soft underbelly of our animal minds\".\u00a0</p><p>They even propose something more sinister: that these AIs have learned to make us more anxious and more confused, because these qualities make us better customers (or rather, more lucrative eyeballs). That, says Mr Harris, puts us at \"a civilisational moment\" - a crossroads where the wrong turn could mean \"the end of human agency\".\u00a0</p><p>                   From faith into despair                   </p><p>That was not what Mr Raskin imagined when he first started fooling around with computers as a child, growing up in a playfully unorthodox Jewish household with the father of the Apple Macintosh.</p><p>Aza Raskin was raised in Silicon Valley, for his dad. Jef Raskin,\u00a0was a pioneer of computer interface design. Working at Apple, he led the Macintosh project in its early days and\u00a0skirmished with Steve Jobs over whether the new machine should be capable of displaying bitmap images. Raskin senior was adamant it should; he wanted users to be able to compose music.</p><p>\"I've always been a recreational weirdo,\" says Aza. He credits his dad with the teaching that interesting things are always \"at the edges of fields\", and with an urge to think deeply about what technology is really for. (Jef Raskin passed away in 2005.)</p><p>Aza followed in his father's footsteps. He co-founded Humanized, an interface design company, which was acquired by Mozilla, the makers of the Firefox browser, where he then worked for several years. He founded Songza, an early music streaming service that now powers Google Music's playlists.</p><p>He also co-founded Massive Health, which aimed to help users develop healthier habits through many of them same psychological tricks he now thinks are turning the world upside down.</p><p>\"Always there was a vision to make the world a better place,\" he says. \"The assumption [was that] if you want to change the world and make it better, the best way to do that is to make an app or a start-up.\"</p><p>Massive, for instance, used \"streaks\" - rewards for continuous app use, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/25/social-media-like-heroin-children-silicon-valley-engineers/\">for which Snapchat has been roundly criticised</url> - and \"aspirational\" social groups, like those which inspire such jealousy and longing on Instagram. He says the app drove an\u00a011pc increase in users' exercise. Slowly, however, his doubts \"snuck up behind\" him like a shadow.</p><p>\"The realisation started to hit that these techniques are very powerful,\" he says. \"They're agnostic to what kind of goal they're pointed at... we're like, 'oh no. This could be used for all sorts of other things.'\"</p><p>It was in 2017, running a new venture,\u00a0a messaging company called Post Social, that he finally lost faith. Even though he was trying to fix some of the problems of social media, he found himself being sucked into the same metrics of success: how many users, how long they spend, how often they come back. \"I was stuck running a company where I no longer believed in the mission,\" he says. \"[It was] Kierkegaardian despair: your past has been robbed of its meaning.\"\u00a0</p><p>One element of his past that now looked very different was his invention of the infinite scroll. Older readers may remember a distant time when you actually had to click \"next\" when you got to the bottom of a web page. Mr Raskin, inspired by the smooth movements of Google Maps, fixed all that (though others have claimed credit too).</p><p>\"Don't force the user to ask for more content,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/25/social-media-like-heroin-children-silicon-valley-engineers/\">he wrote in a blog post on the Humanized website</url> in 2006. \"Just give it to them.\" He even gave talks at other companies evangelising the feature.</p><p>His wish was granted, and swiftly \"weaponised\" to keep us endlessly refreshing our apps like gamblers desperately tugging the lever of a slot machine. Today Mr Raskin calculates, conservatively, that the infinite scroll wastes an extra 200,000 human lifetimes every day.\u00a0</p><p>                   How Silicon Valley lost its way                   </p><p>The story that Mr Raskin tells is one of blind faith and idealism. \"The open source movement, the fact that we were removing gatekeepers, letting people decentralise creativity\u00a0and have voice where there wasn't voice - you remember! That was super exciting!\" he says.</p><p>What changed was that tech companies' incentives began to drift away from this vision. The way he tells it, the techopalypse was a process of highly focused intelligences - human, artificial and corporate - spinning out of control as they attempted to maximise what they had been told to maximise.</p><p>Founders optimised their companies to make profit. Companies built AI systems that were optimised for keeping people's attention. Those AI systems then selected content that was optimised for shock and high emotion.</p><p>\"It came down to a misunderstanding of the word 'want',\" he says. \"When you talk to [Mark] Zuckerberg and the other executives, they say 'look what do you want us to do'? Make people read the Wall Street Journal, the Times, the Telegraph?\"</p><p>\"They're like, 'no, these are\u00a0people's revealed preferences, this is what they really want. But\u00a0that's not what they really want. It's what people can't help but look at.\"</p><p>Just look, he says, at the crisis of self-esteem on social media. He and Mr Harris blame social networks for a huge rise in teenage depression, though debate is still ongoing ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/25/social-media-like-heroin-children-silicon-valley-engineers/\">a\u00a0recent study of 12,000 British teenagers</url> concluded\u00a0that the effect is \"tiny\").</p><p>\"If I want to keep you as a user coming back, its' a lot of work to grab your attention every time,\" Mr Raskin explains. \"But if I could modify your identity so you do it for me, that's way more efficient. How would I do that?</p><p>\"If I could undermine your self-esteem so that you need the validation, and you're\u00a0addicted to the attention, that would be neat. How about if I showed you every day that people liked you better if only you looked a little different?\"</p><p>No wonder, he says, that 55pc of American plastic surgeons say they have seen patients who say they want to look better in selfies.\u00a0</p><p>Or take YouTube's recommendation engine. What is the idea that you would expect a human to promote\u00a0if they were trying to make people spend more time on YouTube? That users cannot trust the mainstream media, and that only YouTubers tell the real truth. Funnily enough, such videos are often exactly what YouTube recommends.</p><p>The implication is that AI, in its blind quest to maximise the numbers, has hit upon strategies which modify our own brains.\u00a0Mr Raskin admits this isn't a claim he can easily prove, but he finds the proliferation of conspiracy theories and fake expos\u00e9s suggestive. It's not wildly implausible, because AI regularly discovers patterns that are invisible to humans: one system, called Deep Patient, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/25/social-media-like-heroin-children-silicon-valley-engineers/\">can sometimes predict schizophrenia, but nobody knows how</url> \u00a0it does so.</p><p>But doesn't this story give\u00a0Silicon Valley too much credit? Not all of its leaders were innocent child geniuses who had no idea what the were creating. Sean Parker, an early Facebook executive, tells it differently, saying that he, Mark Zuckerberg and friends knew exactly what they were doing - \"and did it anyway\".</p><p>\"I completely agree!\" says Mr Raskin. \"There is so\u00a0much culpability, do not get me wrong.\" But the tech industry contains all sorts, he argues, and what really matters are the incentives they work under.</p><p>\"Even if you had a different Facebook and a different YouTube, they'd still be focused on the same kinds of forces,\" he says. Just as the human cultures that were willing to see animals as resources outcompeted those which refused to farm or slaughter, the companies that \"learn to treat human beings as resources to exploit\" will outcompete those that take a higher road.</p><p>                   What can be done?                   </p><p>How, then, can all of this actually be stopped? Mr Harris's speech at the jazz club was mocked by some viewers for being vague on this point. He asked the audience to meditate and be aware of their breathing, and mentioned that CHT would soon launch a podcast. Bookmarks were given out calling on software designers to be \"sophisticated about human nature\". He mentioned roles for designers, journalists, politicians and voters, but gave little detail.</p><p>\"In the end the only things that will make a substantive difference to the way these companies operate are damage to the bottom line (via bad PR or losing customers) or law and regulation,\" tweeted Tom Coates, a veteran tech blogger and friend of Mr Raskin.</p><p>\"If you don't engage with those questions, if you argue for a better world but don't get involved in the gritty fights... then I thank you for your lovely dream, but that's all it is.\"</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">And ethical AI that is supportive to people will only be paid for if it makes more money than unethical AI, and even then we won't necessarily get rid of it because there'll always be a niche of money somewhere for a bottom feeder to exploit.- Tom Coates (@tomcoates) <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/tomcoates/status/1120852413429080065?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwApril\">https://twitter.com/tomcoates/status/1120852413429080065?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwApril</url> 24, 2019</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Speaking to the Telegraph, though Mr Raskin is more specific. He welcomes <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/25/social-media-like-heroin-children-silicon-valley-engineers/\">US regulators' expected $3-5bn (\u00a32.3-3.8bn) fine against Facebook for the Cambridge Analytica scandal</url>, but says it is treating the symptom, not the cause. Instead, systemic problems require a systemic approach, making the practices that cause social harm too expensive to be worthwhile.</p><p>One way would be to modify safe harbour rules, which protect social networks for liability for the content their users post. Instead of making them fully liable like a newspaper is, Mr Raskin suggests they should be liable for any content that they algorithmically \"promote\". \"That really starts to change the incentive landscape,\" he says.</p><p>Another proposal is to give tech firms a fiduciary duty towards their users, even stricter than the duty of care for which the Telegraph has been campaigning. Just as doctors and stockbrokers are bound to act in their clients' best interests, on pain of being sued, so tech firms should be held to a higher standard of good faith.</p><p>The power of their AI systems, Mr Raskin says, has become so great that there is an inescapable asymmetry between them and their users. Since that AI is powered by our data - the digital equivalent of our \"toenail clippings and hair\" - its makers should be punished for betraying our trust.</p><p>Such top-down solutions, he freely admits, are a necessary part of the puzzle, but the will require public pressure. \"That only happens when enough people care about it and can articulate what they care about and can ask for it from the government,\" he says.\u00a0That is one reason why he and Mr Harris spent so much time coming up with the phrase \"human downgrading\". They consider it a banner people can rally around.</p><p>                   Converting tech workers, one soul at a time                   </p><p>Most of all, though, Mr Raskin believes there must be cultural, even spiritual change in Silicon Valley.</p><p>He has mixed feelings about the success of \"time well spent\": on the one hand, it was the first time companies really accepted responsibility, \"and that's positive and great\"; on the other hand, he is not impressed by the smartphone makers' new time-management features.</p><p>\"For them it was a PR problem, and they gave a PR solution,\" he says. \"It almost feels like they're gaslighting us: we've made this thing that's hyper-addictive, and it's your fault if you use it. It's like, 'we're going to put a calendar inside of every cigarette box where you can check off how many days you didn't smoke.\"\u00a0</p><p>Nevertheless, it showed that tech firms can be pressured into changing their behaviour from the inside as well as the outside. \"Pressure isn't a physical object, right?\" he says. \"It means you're Zuckerberg and you're walking down the hall and three people mention something to you, 'time well spent'. Somebody on the board mentioning it to you, seeing a news article mentioning it to you, and all of a sudden you're like 'oh, I'm sort of surrounded. This is a thing people care about.'\"</p><p>He quotes Margaret Read's aphorism: \"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.\" In his view, tech workers are that small group, and by changing their minds he can \"ship a product to a billion phones without writing a single line of code\".</p><p>That means more tech workers will have to go through the moral crisis that he did. \"Every mourns in a different way,\" he says. \"But... some process like that, people need to go through.\" He sees encouraging signs of this, citing \"whistleblowers\" such as Guillaume Chaslot, who helped build YouTube's recommendation engine and is now at war with it.</p><p>A change in culture would mean a change in design practices. For example, companies could deliberately slow down web pages and buttons at certain points in order to \"give our brains a chance to catch up\". Mr Raskin cites an experiment performed by Amazon, which found that for every 100 milliseconds slower its web page loaded, it lost 1pc of its sales.</p><p>A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/25/social-media-like-heroin-children-silicon-valley-engineers/\">design guide</url> put out by the Centre for Humane Technology urges designers to be far more cautious of a range of specific features, such as \"artificial scarcity\", \"urgency signalling\", \"over-personalised filters\" and \"quantified social status\". It suggests that they avoid \"implied obligation\", limit viral sharing and insert \"cues\" into their systems which give their users regular opportunities to stop their browsing.</p><p>                   Not everyone is convinced                   </p><p>While many tech workers have warmed to Mr Raskin's mission, others remain sceptical. He and Mr Harris have been criticised not only by Valley insiders but by people who should in theory be his natural allies.</p><p>One criticism is that the pair seem ignorant of earlier attempts to rein in Big Tech. Activists and scholars have been warning for years that Facebook had grown too large, that Google had grown too powerful, that algorithms were a ticking time bomb of disinformation and corruption of public debate.</p><p>Evgeny Morozov, a reliably grumpy scholar of the internet originally born in censorship-ridden Belarus, wrote The Net Delusion,\u00a0his landmark critique of \"cyber-utopianism\",\u00a0in 2011.\u00a0Neil Postman (who, to be fair, Mr Raskin cites approvingly) warned that \"every technology has a philosophy\" in 1998. Michael Goldhaber coined the term \"attention economy\" in 1997.</p><p>Maybe if tech workers had been paying attention in 2005 or even in 2010, the critics say, none of this would have happened.</p><p>A bigger objection is that Mr Raskin's mission represents an attempt to dismantle Big Tech using the tools of Big Tech. Both he and Mr Harris are\u00a0technologists through and through; they speak that language and share that worldview.\u00a0Mr Harris even called for a \"full-stack understanding\" of human nature - a piece of engineering jargon usually applied to the suite of tools used to build a given product.</p><p>So isn't this just another example of tech-savvy, affluent white men believing they can change the world with systems thinking? Mark Hurst, a product consultant, put it this way: \"The scandalous truth is that we need to use tech less, put our faith in tech less, and ultimately assign less power to Silicon Valley.\u00a0Tech is not going to solve this mess.\"</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Tech insiders diagnosing how tech is designed wrong: helpful!

He is sitting, wide-eyed, intense, in his office in a co-working space in downtown San Francisco.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Unless you've felt it, unless you've cried over the fact that we really thought we were making the world a better place with the internet...\" He pauses. \"We 100 per cent believed that.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Humanity, he says, is living through \"two super old stories. One: be careful what you wish for, because you'll get it... And two: creators losing control of their creations.\"\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He should know, because he is one of those Dr Frankensteins. As the son of Silicon Valley royalty (or at least nobility), he spent years merrily building technology that he believed was changing the world. It did, but not in the way that he hoped.</p><p>Now he is now at the heart of the backlash against Big Tech as one of the public faces of the Centre for Humane Technology, a non-profit group that he founded with former Google product manager Tristan Harris ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/25/social-media-like-heroin-children-silicon-valley-engineers/\">whom the Telegraph interviewed last year</url> ) and \"social impact\" consultant Randy Fernando. Though the Centre was only founded last February,\u00a0its influence is growing throughout the industry that it is trying to reform.</p><p>\"There are two types of dystopias and we missed one of them,\" Mr Raskin tells the Telegraph.\u00a0\"There's the Orwell dystopia\" - referencing George Orwell's 1984 - \"and the Huxley dystopia\" - a reference to Aldous Huxley's altogether stranger and more subtle 1932 novel\u00a0Brave New World.\u00a0</p><p>\"In the Orwell dystopia people don't read books because they're banned,\" he says.\u00a0\"In The Huxley dystopia people don't read books because they're distracted... In the Orwell dystopia, the things that we fear will get us. And in the Huxley dystopia things that we desire will get us.\"</p><p>                   'The end of human agency'                   </p><p>This cause has already notched up one victory, albeit a partial one. In 2013, Mr Harris <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/25/social-media-like-heroin-children-silicon-valley-engineers/\">spread around a presentation inside Google</url> warning that its design practices were exploiting people's psychology to steal their time. He urged his colleagues instead to use their power over millions of Android phones and Chrome web browsers to \"minimise distractions\" and create \"calmer states of mind\".</p><p>Google made him a \"design ethicist\", but he did not feel he was making a difference, and by 2016\u00a0he had left Google to campaign full-time under the slogan of \"time well spent\". Two years later, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/25/social-media-like-heroin-children-silicon-valley-engineers/\">Mark Zuckerberg had adopted the motto for himself</url>, proclaiming it the new goal of Facebook's news feed algorithms, while Google and Apple       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/25/social-media-like-heroin-children-silicon-valley-engineers/\">added new time management feature</url> s features to their smartphones.\u00a0It was hardly the revolution Mr Harris had hoped for, but it was a start. \u00a0</p><p>So now he and Mr Raskin are preaching a new gospel, which they call \"human downgrading\". The phrase is the fruit of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/25/social-media-like-heroin-children-silicon-valley-engineers/\">a series of manic brainstorming sessions</url> in San Francisco and at the Esalen Institute, a new age retreat on the California coastline. Unlike \"time well spent\", it is a dark and ominous vision.\u00a0</p><p>At a jazz hall in San Francisco last month, the pair gathered an audience of celebrities (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), activists (Wael Ghonim, a computer engineer who helped kickstart the Arab Spring in Egypt) and tech luminaries, from powerful industry figures (Rob Goldman, Facebook's vice president of advertising) to longtime critics (Justin Rosenstein, the disenchanted inventor of the like button). Then they issued a warning: tech giants are creating the cultural equivalent of climate change.</p><p>Addiction, distraction, disinformation, polarisation and radicalisation; all these \"hurricanes\", Mr Raskin and Mr Harris argue, have one common cause. They come from the fact that we now spend large portions of our lives inside artificial social systems, which are run by private companies for profit.</p><p>That would be fine \u00a0if their profits came from making us better human beings, but instead they are part of an \"extractive attention economy\", where money is made through the capture of time and attention. The phrase recalls the work of Shoshana Zuboff, a sociologist who argued in her book\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/25/social-media-like-heroin-children-silicon-valley-engineers/\">Surveillance Capitalism</url> \u00a0that social networks are more like strip-miners than service providers, using data as \"raw material\" for their real products.</p><p>These factors together have created a \"race to the bottom of the brainstem\", in which increasingly \"overwhelming\" and sophisticated AI tools are devoted to exploiting what Mr Raskin calls the \"soft underbelly of our animal minds\".\u00a0</p><p>They even propose something more sinister: that these AIs have learned to make us more anxious and more confused, because these qualities make us better customers (or rather, more lucrative eyeballs). That, says Mr Harris, puts us at \"a civilisational moment\" - a crossroads where the wrong turn could mean \"the end of human agency\".\u00a0</p><p>                   From faith into despair                   </p><p>That was not what Mr Raskin imagined when he first started fooling around with computers as a child, growing up in a playfully unorthodox Jewish household with the father of the Apple Macintosh.</p><p>Aza Raskin was raised in Silicon Valley, for his dad. Jef Raskin,\u00a0was a pioneer of computer interface design. Working at Apple, he led the Macintosh project in its early days and\u00a0skirmished with Steve Jobs over whether the new machine should be capable of displaying bitmap images. Raskin senior was adamant it should; he wanted users to be able to compose music.</p><p>\"I've always been a recreational weirdo,\" says Aza. He credits his dad with the teaching that interesting things are always \"at the edges of fields\", and with an urge to think deeply about what technology is really for. (Jef Raskin passed away in 2005.)</p><p>Aza followed in his father's footsteps. He co-founded Humanized, an interface design company, which was acquired by Mozilla, the makers of the Firefox browser, where he then worked for several years. He founded Songza, an early music streaming service that now powers Google Music's playlists.</p><p>He also co-founded Massive Health, which aimed to help users develop healthier habits through many of them same psychological tricks he now thinks are turning the world upside down.</p><p>\"Always there was a vision to make the world a better place,\" he says. \"The assumption [was that] if you want to change the world and make it better, the best way to do that is to make an app or a start-up.\"</p><p>Massive, for instance, used \"streaks\" - rewards for continuous app use, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/25/social-media-like-heroin-children-silicon-valley-engineers/\">for which Snapchat has been roundly criticised</url> - and \"aspirational\" social groups, like those which inspire such jealousy and longing on Instagram. He says the app drove an\u00a011pc increase in users' exercise. Slowly, however, his doubts \"snuck up behind\" him like a shadow.</p><p>\"The realisation started to hit that these techniques are very powerful,\" he says. \"They're agnostic to what kind of goal they're pointed at... we're like, 'oh no. This could be used for all sorts of other things.'\"</p><p>It was in 2017, running a new venture,\u00a0a messaging company called Post Social, that he finally lost faith. Even though he was trying to fix some of the problems of social media, he found himself being sucked into the same metrics of success: how many users, how long they spend, how often they come back. \"I was stuck running a company where I no longer believed in the mission,\" he says. \"[It was] Kierkegaardian despair: your past has been robbed of its meaning.\"\u00a0</p><p>One element of his past that now looked very different was his invention of the infinite scroll. Older readers may remember a distant time when you actually had to click \"next\" when you got to the bottom of a web page. Mr Raskin, inspired by the smooth movements of Google Maps, fixed all that (though others have claimed credit too).</p><p>\"Don't force the user to ask for more content,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/25/social-media-like-heroin-children-silicon-valley-engineers/\">he wrote in a blog post on the Humanized website</url> in 2006. \"Just give it to them.\" He even gave talks at other companies evangelising the feature.</p><p>His wish was granted, and swiftly \"weaponised\" to keep us endlessly refreshing our apps like gamblers desperately tugging the lever of a slot machine. Today Mr Raskin calculates, conservatively, that the infinite scroll wastes an extra 200,000 human lifetimes every day.\u00a0</p><p>                   How Silicon Valley lost its way                   </p><p>The story that Mr Raskin tells is one of blind faith and idealism. \"The open source movement, the fact that we were removing gatekeepers, letting people decentralise creativity\u00a0and have voice where there wasn't voice - you remember! That was super exciting!\" he says.</p><p>What changed was that tech companies' incentives began to drift away from this vision. The way he tells it, the techopalypse was a process of highly focused intelligences - human, artificial and corporate - spinning out of control as they attempted to maximise what they had been told to maximise.</p><p>Founders optimised their companies to make profit. Companies built AI systems that were optimised for keeping people's attention. Those AI systems then selected content that was optimised for shock and high emotion.</p><p>\"It came down to a misunderstanding of the word 'want',\" he says. \"When you talk to [Mark] Zuckerberg and the other executives, they say 'look what do you want us to do'? Make people read the Wall Street Journal, the Times, the Telegraph?\"</p><p>\"They're like, 'no, these are\u00a0people's revealed preferences, this is what they really want. But\u00a0that's not what they really want. It's what people can't help but look at.\"</p><p>Just look, he says, at the crisis of self-esteem on social media. He and Mr Harris blame social networks for a huge rise in teenage depression, though debate is still ongoing ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/25/social-media-like-heroin-children-silicon-valley-engineers/\">a\u00a0recent study of 12,000 British teenagers</url> concluded\u00a0that the effect is \"tiny\").</p><p>\"If I want to keep you as a user coming back, its' a lot of work to grab your attention every time,\" Mr Raskin explains. \"But if I could modify your identity so you do it for me, that's way more efficient. How would I do that?</p><p>\"If I could undermine your self-esteem so that you need the validation, and you're\u00a0addicted to the attention, that would be neat. How about if I showed you every day that people liked you better if only you looked a little different?\"</p><p>No wonder, he says, that 55pc of American plastic surgeons say they have seen patients who say they want to look better in selfies.\u00a0</p><p>Or take YouTube's recommendation engine. What is the idea that you would expect a human to promote\u00a0if they were trying to make people spend more time on YouTube? That users cannot trust the mainstream media, and that only YouTubers tell the real truth. Funnily enough, such videos are often exactly what YouTube recommends.</p><p>The implication is that AI, in its blind quest to maximise the numbers, has hit upon strategies which modify our own brains.\u00a0Mr Raskin admits this isn't a claim he can easily prove, but he finds the proliferation of conspiracy theories and fake expos\u00e9s suggestive. It's not wildly implausible, because AI regularly discovers patterns that are invisible to humans: one system, called Deep Patient, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/25/social-media-like-heroin-children-silicon-valley-engineers/\">can sometimes predict schizophrenia, but nobody knows how</url> \u00a0it does so.</p><p>But doesn't this story give\u00a0Silicon Valley too much credit? Not all of its leaders were innocent child geniuses who had no idea what the were creating. Sean Parker, an early Facebook executive, tells it differently, saying that he, Mark Zuckerberg and friends knew exactly what they were doing - \"and did it anyway\".</p><p>\"I completely agree!\" says Mr Raskin. \"There is so\u00a0much culpability, do not get me wrong.\" But the tech industry contains all sorts, he argues, and what really matters are the incentives they work under.</p><p>\"Even if you had a different Facebook and a different YouTube, they'd still be focused on the same kinds of forces,\" he says. Just as the human cultures that were willing to see animals as resources outcompeted those which refused to farm or slaughter, the companies that \"learn to treat human beings as resources to exploit\" will outcompete those that take a higher road.</p><p>                   What can be done?                   </p><p>How, then, can all of this actually be stopped? Mr Harris's speech at the jazz club was mocked by some viewers for being vague on this point. He asked the audience to meditate and be aware of their breathing, and mentioned that CHT would soon launch a podcast. Bookmarks were given out calling on software designers to be \"sophisticated about human nature\". He mentioned roles for designers, journalists, politicians and voters, but gave little detail.</p><p>\"In the end the only things that will make a substantive difference to the way these companies operate are damage to the bottom line (via bad PR or losing customers) or law and regulation,\" tweeted Tom Coates, a veteran tech blogger and friend of Mr Raskin.</p><p>\"If you don't engage with those questions, if you argue for a better world but don't get involved in the gritty fights... then I thank you for your lovely dream, but that's all it is.\"</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">And ethical AI that is supportive to people will only be paid for if it makes more money than unethical AI, and even then we won't necessarily get rid of it because there'll always be a niche of money somewhere for a bottom feeder to exploit.- Tom Coates (@tomcoates) <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/tomcoates/status/1120852413429080065?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwApril\">https://twitter.com/tomcoates/status/1120852413429080065?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwApril</url> 24, 2019</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Speaking to the Telegraph, though Mr Raskin is more specific. He welcomes <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/25/social-media-like-heroin-children-silicon-valley-engineers/\">US regulators' expected $3-5bn (\u00a32.3-3.8bn) fine against Facebook for the Cambridge Analytica scandal</url>, but says it is treating the symptom, not the cause. Instead, systemic problems require a systemic approach, making the practices that cause social harm too expensive to be worthwhile.</p><p>One way would be to modify safe harbour rules, which protect social networks for liability for the content their users post. Instead of making them fully liable like a newspaper is, Mr Raskin suggests they should be liable for any content that they algorithmically \"promote\". \"That really starts to change the incentive landscape,\" he says.</p><p>Another proposal is to give tech firms a fiduciary duty towards their users, even stricter than the duty of care for which the Telegraph has been campaigning. Just as doctors and stockbrokers are bound to act in their clients' best interests, on pain of being sued, so tech firms should be held to a higher standard of good faith.</p><p>The power of their AI systems, Mr Raskin says, has become so great that there is an inescapable asymmetry between them and their users. Since that AI is powered by our data - the digital equivalent of our \"toenail clippings and hair\" - its makers should be punished for betraying our trust.</p><p>Such top-down solutions, he freely admits, are a necessary part of the puzzle, but the will require public pressure. \"That only happens when enough people care about it and can articulate what they care about and can ask for it from the government,\" he says.\u00a0That is one reason why he and Mr Harris spent so much time coming up with the phrase \"human downgrading\". They consider it a banner people can rally around.</p><p>                   Converting tech workers, one soul at a time                   </p><p>Most of all, though, Mr Raskin believes there must be cultural, even spiritual change in Silicon Valley.</p><p>He has mixed feelings about the success of \"time well spent\": on the one hand, it was the first time companies really accepted responsibility, \"and that's positive and great\"; on the other hand, he is not impressed by the smartphone makers' new time-management features.</p><p>\"For them it was a PR problem, and they gave a PR solution,\" he says. \"It almost feels like they're gaslighting us: we've made this thing that's hyper-addictive, and it's your fault if you use it. It's like, 'we're going to put a calendar inside of every cigarette box where you can check off how many days you didn't smoke.\"\u00a0</p><p>Nevertheless, it showed that tech firms can be pressured into changing their behaviour from the inside as well as the outside. \"Pressure isn't a physical object, right?\" he says. \"It means you're Zuckerberg and you're walking down the hall and three people mention something to you, 'time well spent'. Somebody on the board mentioning it to you, seeing a news article mentioning it to you, and all of a sudden you're like 'oh, I'm sort of surrounded. This is a thing people care about.'\"</p><p>He quotes Margaret Read's aphorism: \"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.\" In his view, tech workers are that small group, and by changing their minds he can \"ship a product to a billion phones without writing a single line of code\".</p><p>That means more tech workers will have to go through the moral crisis that he did. \"Every mourns in a different way,\" he says. \"But... some process like that, people need to go through.\" He sees encouraging signs of this, citing \"whistleblowers\" such as Guillaume Chaslot, who helped build YouTube's recommendation engine and is now at war with it.</p><p>A change in culture would mean a change in design practices. For example, companies could deliberately slow down web pages and buttons at certain points in order to \"give our brains a chance to catch up\". Mr Raskin cites an experiment performed by Amazon, which found that for every 100 milliseconds slower its web page loaded, it lost 1pc of its sales.</p><p>A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/25/social-media-like-heroin-children-silicon-valley-engineers/\">design guide</url> put out by the Centre for Humane Technology urges designers to be far more cautious of a range of specific features, such as \"artificial scarcity\", \"urgency signalling\", \"over-personalised filters\" and \"quantified social status\". It suggests that they avoid \"implied obligation\", limit viral sharing and insert \"cues\" into their systems which give their users regular opportunities to stop their browsing.</p><p>                   Not everyone is convinced                   </p><p>While many tech workers have warmed to Mr Raskin's mission, others remain sceptical. He and Mr Harris have been criticised not only by Valley insiders but by people who should in theory be his natural allies.</p><p>One criticism is that the pair seem ignorant of earlier attempts to rein in Big Tech. Activists and scholars have been warning for years that Facebook had grown too large, that Google had grown too powerful, that algorithms were a ticking time bomb of disinformation and corruption of public debate.</p><p>Evgeny Morozov, a reliably grumpy scholar of the internet originally born in censorship-ridden Belarus, wrote The Net Delusion,\u00a0his landmark critique of \"cyber-utopianism\",\u00a0in 2011.\u00a0Neil Postman (who, to be fair, Mr Raskin cites approvingly) warned that \"every technology has a philosophy\" in 1998. Michael Goldhaber coined the term \"attention economy\" in 1997.</p><p>Maybe if tech workers had been paying attention in 2005 or even in 2010, the critics say, none of this would have happened.</p><p>A bigger objection is that Mr Raskin's mission represents an attempt to dismantle Big Tech using the tools of Big Tech. Both he and Mr Harris are\u00a0technologists through and through; they speak that language and share that worldview.\u00a0Mr Harris even called for a \"full-stack understanding\" of human nature - a piece of engineering jargon usually applied to the suite of tools used to build a given product.</p><p>So isn't this just another example of tech-savvy, affluent white men believing they can change the world with systems thinking? Mark Hurst, a product consultant, put it this way: \"The scandalous truth is that we need to use tech less, put our faith in tech less, and ultimately assign less power to Silicon Valley.\u00a0Tech is not going to solve this mess.\"</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Tech insiders diagnosing how tech is designed wrong: helpful!

Andrew Carnegies \u00d6fen schmolzen den Stahl, der das R\u00fcckgrat des Schienennetzes und der St\u00e4dte bildete. John D. Rockefeller raffinierte 90 Prozent des amerikanischen Roh\u00f6ls, das in den vorelektrischen Zeiten die Nation mit Licht versorgte. Bill Gates entwickelte eine Software, ohne die man keinen Computer anschalten konnte.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mit seinen 55 Jahren beherrscht Bezos noch keinen bedeutenden Markt mit einer vergleichbaren Dominanz wie die eben erw\u00e4hnten, und obwohl er derzeit der reichste Mann auf Erden sein d\u00fcrfte, besitzt er weniger Verm\u00f6gen als Gates auf dem H\u00f6hepunkt seiner Karriere. Rockefeller begn\u00fcgte sich mit \u00d6lquellen, Pumpstationen und Wagons; Gates' Reichtum basierte auf einem Betriebssystem. Das Reich, das der Gr\u00fcnder und Firmenchef von Amazon aufgebaut hat, ist in der langen Geschichte des amerikanischen Kapitalismus jedoch ohne Beispiel.</p><p>Heute kontrolliert Bezos etwa 40 Prozent des gesamten E-Commerce in den Vereinigten Staaten. Auf Amazon wird h\u00e4ufiger nach Produkten gesucht als \u00fcber Google, was Bezos den Aufbau eines Werbegesch\u00e4fts erm\u00f6glichte, das allein bereits so wertvoll ist wie IBM. Man sch\u00e4tzt, dass Amazon Web Services etwa die H\u00e4lfte der Cloud-Computing-Industrie beherrscht - und solch unterschiedliche Institutionen wie General Electric, Unilever und sogar die CIA verlassen sich auf dessen Server. 42 Prozent der (Papier-)Buchverk\u00e4ufe und ein Drittel des Marktes f\u00fcr Streamingdienste werden von seiner Firma kontrolliert; Twitch, eine bei Gamern beliebte Videoplattform, erreicht Tag f\u00fcr Tag 15 Millionen Nutzer. F\u00fcgt man diesem Portfolio nun noch die Washington Post hinzu, die Bezos 2013 erwarb, ist er vermutlich auch der m\u00e4chtigste Mann im amerikanischen Kulturbereich.</p><p>Vor f\u00fcnf Jahren kamen mir zum ersten Mal Bedenken \u00fcber Amazons Machtf\u00fclle. Ich war besorgt dar\u00fcber, wie das Unternehmen die Buchbranche schikanierte, um immer mehr aus den Verlagen herauszupressen, die inzwischen ohnehin von Amazon abh\u00e4ngig waren. Als die Unternehmensgruppe Hachette, bei der ich einmal ein Buch ver\u00f6ffentlicht hatte, sich weigerte, Amazons Verlangen nachzugeben, wurde der Verlag bestraft: Amazon verschleppte die Auslieferung von Hachette-Titeln, und wenn Kunden nach B\u00fcchern aus dem Hause Hachette suchten, wurden sie augenblicklich zu \u00e4hnlichen Titeln anderer Verlage weitergeleitet. 2014 schrieb ich die Titelgeschichte f\u00fcr The New Republic unter der rei\u00dferischen \u00dcberschrift: \"Amazon muss gestoppt werden\". Unter Bezug auf meinen Artikel beendete das Unternehmen kurz darauf eine Werbekampagne f\u00fcr ihre Polit-Comedyserie \"Alpha House\", die bis dahin in The New Republic geschaltet worden war.</p><p>Seit dieser Zeit ist Bezos' Reichweite noch weiter gewachsen. F\u00fcr den amerikanischen Pr\u00e4sidenten ist er der Erzfeind, f\u00fcr viele US-B\u00fcrger hingegen der wohlt\u00e4tige Hexenmeister der Bequemlichkeit und des \u00dcberflusses. Allein im Verlauf des Jahres 2018 hat Amazon angek\u00fcndigt, folgende Unternehmungen anzugehen: Es will potenzielle Hausk\u00e4ufer mit Immobilienmaklern zusammenbringen und die neuen H\u00e4user mitAmazon-Ger\u00e4ten ausstatten; es will den Sprachassistenten Alexa so erweitern, dass er Zugriff auf Gesundheitsdaten bekommt; es will f\u00fcr alle Mitglieder seines Prime-Service die Lieferung am n\u00e4chsten Tag zum Standard machen; es will eine neue Lebensmittelkette gr\u00fcnden, als Erg\u00e4nzung zu Whole Foods, das Amazon bereits geh\u00f6rt; es will mehr als 3000 Satelliten in den Weltraum schie\u00dfen, um die Welt mit Highspeed-Internet zu versorgen.</p><p>Bezos' Projekte sind inzwischen so zahlreich und unterschiedlich, dass es schwerf\u00e4llt, die wahre Natur seines Firmenreichs oder auch die finale Absicht hinter all seinen Planungen zu verstehen. Was genau will Jeff Bezos? Woran glaubt er? Angesichts seiner Macht \u00fcber die Welt sind dies keine unbedeutenden Fragen. Und doch beh\u00e4lt er seine Absichten f\u00fcr sich. Viele Kollegen, die schon seit Jahren mit ihm arbeiten, k\u00f6nnen sich an keine einzige politische \u00c4u\u00dferung von ihm erinnern. Und schaut man sich die in dem Vierteljahrhundert von Amazons Existenz entstandenen Interviews mit ihm an, so wiederholt er nur ein ums andere Mal dieselben, nichtssagenden Anekdoten.</p><p>Um ihn besser verstehen zu lernen, sprach ich in einem Zeitraum von mehr als f\u00fcnf Monaten mit aktuellen und ehemaligen Amazon-F\u00fchrungskr\u00e4ften, aber auch mit Konkurrenten und Beobachtern aus der Wissenschaft. Bezos selbst verweigerte eine Mitarbeit an dieser Untersuchung, und aktuelle Amazon-Angestellte sprachen nur bei ausgeschaltetem Mikrofon mit mir. Selbst viele ehemalige Mitarbeiter wollten anonym bleiben, da sie vermuten, eines Tages wieder f\u00fcr ein Unternehmen zu arbeiten, das irgendwie mit Bezos' weiterwachsendem Firmennetzwerk verbunden sein k\u00f6nnte.</p><p>Bezos liebt das Wort \"relentless\" (unerbittlich) - es taucht in seinen viel beachteten j\u00e4hrlichen Briefen an die Aktion\u00e4re immer wieder auf - , und ich hatte immer angenommen, sein Ziel sei die Dominanz um ihrer selbst willen. In einer Zeit, in der man gigantische Firmen liebt, schien er entschlossen, der Gr\u00f6\u00dfte von allen zu werden. Doch zu behaupten, Bezos' letztendliches Ziel sei die Dominanz \u00fcber unseren Planeten, w\u00e4re ein Missverst\u00e4ndnis. Seine Ambitionen beschr\u00e4nken sich nicht auf den Bereich, in dem die Anziehungskraft der Erde wirkt.</p><p>Bezos bekennt sich ungeniert zu seinem Fanatismus f\u00fcr \"Star Trek\" und dessen zahlreiche Spin-offs. Er besa\u00df ein Unternehmen mit dem Namen Zefran, was die Figur ehrt, die den Warp-Antrieb erfand. Er \u00fcberredete die Macher des Filmes \"Star Trek Beyond\", ihm einen Cameo-Auftritt als Sternenflotten-Funktion\u00e4r zu geben. Er nannte seinen Hund Kamala, nach einer Frau, die in einer Folge als Picards \"perfekte\", aber auch \"hoffnungslose\" Partnerin erscheint. Im Laufe der Zeit haben sich Bezos und Picard physisch angen\u00e4hert: Wie der von Patrick Stewart dargestellte Weltraum-Erforscher hat auch Bezos sich die letzten Haare auf dem gl\u00e4nzenden Sch\u00e4del abrasiert und sich eine eiserne Mimik zugelegt. Ein Freund sagte einmal, Bezos habe sein anstrengendes Fitnessprogramm als Vorbereitung f\u00fcr den Tag begonnen, an dem auch er seine Reise ins Weltall starten werde.</p><p>Als Journalisten Bezos' Freundin aus High-School-Zeiten auftrieben, gab sie zu Protokoll: \"Er verdient deshalb so viel Geld, weil er ins All m\u00f6chte.\" Dies zu glauben, verlangt nicht allzu viel Vorstellungskraft. Schon als Redner bei der Schulabschlussfeier 1982 an der Miami Palmetto Senior High School entwickelte Bezos seine Vision f\u00fcr die Menschheit. Er tr\u00e4umte von jenem Tag, an dem Millionen seiner Mit-Erdlinge auf Kolonien im Weltall umgesiedelt w\u00fcrden. Eine Lokalzeitung schrieb, sein Ziel sei es, \"alle Menschen von der Erde abzuziehen, um diese dann in einen riesigen Nationalpark zu verwandeln\".</p><p>Die meisten Sterblichen legen irgendwann ihre Teenagertr\u00e4ume ab, doch Bezos bleibt den seinen leidenschaftlich verpflichtet. Kritiker tadelten ihn f\u00fcr seinen philanthropischen Geiz, zumindest wenn man sein Engagement ins Verh\u00e4ltnis zu seinem Verm\u00f6gen setzt. Doch das, was Bezos als seinen wichtigsten humanit\u00e4ren Beitrag ansieht, ist nicht gemeinn\u00fctzig im eigentlichen Sinne des Wortes. Es ist eine profitorientierte Firma mit Namen Blue Origin, die sich um die Umsetzung seiner Prophezeiung als Abschlussredner bem\u00fcht. Er finanziert dieses Unternehmen - das Raketen, Raumfahrzeuge und die Infrastruktur entwickelt, damit Reisen jenseits der Erdatmosph\u00e4re m\u00f6glich werden - aus dem j\u00e4hrlichen Verkauf von Amazon-Anteilen im Wert von einer Milliarde Dollar. Im Gegensatz zur F\u00fchrung seines Riesenunternehmens oder der Washington Post - und auch im Gegensatz zu den zwei Milliarden Dollar, die er mildt\u00e4tigen Projekten zum Kampf gegen Obdachlosigkeit oder f\u00fcr die Bildung von einkommensschwachen Amerikanern spendet - , nennt Bezos Blue Origin seine \"wichtigste Arbeit\".</p><p>Was Bezos Sorgen bereitet, ist, dass die Energienachfrage zuk\u00fcnftiger Generationen die begrenzten Ressourcen der Erde \u00fcberschreiten k\u00f6nnte. \"Es droht nicht unbedingt die Ausl\u00f6schung\", so erkl\u00e4rte er, aber es k\u00f6nne doch zu einem Stillstand kommen: \"Wir werden das Wachstum einstellen m\u00fcssen, was in meinen Augen eine sehr schlechte Zukunft bedeutet.\" W\u00e4hrend andere davon \u00fcberzeugt sind, dass der Klimawandel unseren Planeten in absehbarer Zeit unbewohnbar werden l\u00e4sst, macht sich der mehrfache Milliard\u00e4r Sorgen \u00fcber die Aussichten von abgeschw\u00e4chtem Wirtschaftswachstum. Allerdings ist das von ihm entworfene Szenario tats\u00e4chlich d\u00fcster: Ohne ausreichend Energie wird es zu Rationierungen und Hungersn\u00f6ten kommen. Im Laufe der Jahre ist es Bezos zwar gelungen, den Fragen der Journalisten nach Amazon zu entkommen. Doch seinen Glauben an die Kolonisierung des Weltraums tr\u00e4gt er mit dem Eifer eines Predigers vor: \"Wir m\u00fcssen ins All, um die Erde zu retten.\"</p><p>Im Zentrum dieser \u00dcberzeugung steht ein Text, den Bezos als Jugendlicher gelesen hat. 1976 schrieb der Princeton-Physiker Gerard K. O'Neill mit \"Unsere Zukunft im Raum\" eine popul\u00e4rwissenschaftliche Studie \u00fcber die Besiedlung des Weltalls, die bei Sci-Fi-Freaks, Nasa-Funktion\u00e4ren und in die Jahre gekommenen Hippies \u00e4u\u00dferst beliebt war. Als Student in Princeton besuchte Jeff Bezos die Seminare von O'Neill und leitete die \u00f6rtliche Niederlassung von Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (Studenten f\u00fcr die Erkundung und Entwicklung des Weltraums). Mit Blue Origin kann Bezos nun detaillierte Pl\u00e4ne entwickeln, um O'Neills Vision Wirklichkeit werden zu lassen.</p><p>Der Professor dachte an Kolonien, die in kilometerlangen zylindrischen R\u00f6hren zwischen der Erde und dem Mond schweben. Diese R\u00f6hren sollten ein Scheinbild des Lebens auf der Erde aufrechterhalten, mit einem Gartenboden, sauerstoffhaltiger Atmosph\u00e4re, frei fliegenden V\u00f6geln und \"von Wellen \u00fcbersp\u00fclten Str\u00e4nden\". Wenn Bezos diese Kolonien beschreibt - und Entw\u00fcrfe von K\u00fcnstlern dazu vorstellt - , klingt er beinahe verz\u00fcckt: \"Das ist Maui zu seinen besten Zeiten, das ganze Jahr \u00fcber. Kein Regen, kein Sturm, keine Erdbeben.\" Da ohne all die Beschr\u00e4nkungen der Erde die Kolonien der Menschheit unbegrenztes Wachstum erm\u00f6glichen w\u00fcrden, k\u00f6nnte unsere Spezies aufbl\u00fchen wie nie zuvor: \"Wir k\u00f6nnten Trillionen Menschen im Sonnensystem haben, was bedeuten w\u00fcrde, es g\u00e4be Tausende Mozarts und Tausende Einsteins. Dies w\u00e4re eine unglaubliche Zivilisation.\"</p><p>Bezos erfreut das Publikum mit leidenschaftlichen Vortr\u00e4gen und \u00fcberzeugender Kenntnis bis ins Detail. Allerdings bleiben in seiner Darstellung einige menschliche Fragen offen: Wer soll diese neue Welt regieren? Wer erl\u00e4sst ihre Gesetze? Wer entscheidet, welche Erdlinge zu den Kolonien zugelassen werden? Diese Fragen beantwortet er nicht ausdr\u00fccklich, sieht man einmal von seinem feurigen Glauben an die Unternehmer ab, die nach Bezos' eigenem Vorbild die Zukunft formen werden. Mit seinem Reichtum und dem ihm dadurch zur Verf\u00fcgung stehenden Megafon m\u00f6chte Bezos die Bedingungen f\u00fcr die Zukunft unserer Spezies festlegen, damit seine Utopie Wirklichkeit werden kann.</p><p>In gewisser Weise hat er bereits einen Prototypen der von Millionen bev\u00f6lkerten zylindrischen R\u00f6hre gebaut und sie Amazon.com genannt. Seine Kreation ist weniger ein Unternehmen als vielmehr ein umfassendes System. W\u00e4re sie nur ein Shop, der praktisch alle verk\u00e4uflichen Dinge anb\u00f6te (und sie innerhalb von 48 Stunden ausliefert), w\u00e4re sie zwar noch immer die beeindruckendste Sch\u00f6pfung in der Geschichte der amerikanischen Wirtschaft. Doch Amazon ist sowohl diese konkrete Firma als auch eine Abstraktion von etwas weitaus M\u00e4chtigerem.</p><p>Bezos' Unternehmen kippt lange f\u00fcr g\u00fcltig gehaltene Annahmen \u00fcber die grundlegende Natur des Kapitalismus - vor allem eine Idee, die auf den gro\u00dfen \u00f6sterreichischen \u00d6konomen Friedrich Hayek zur\u00fcckgeht. Am Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs ver\u00f6ffentlichte Hayek den Aufsatz \"Die Anwendung von Wissen in der Gesellschaft\", eine wegweisende Anklage der zentralen Planung. Hayek argumentierte, dass keine Beh\u00f6rde es jemals mit den Wundern der M\u00e4rkte aufnehmen k\u00f6nne, die spontan und effizient das Wissen einer Gesellschaft vereinen. Wenn M\u00e4rkte kollektiv einen Preis festlegen, dann spiegelt dieser Preis das unter F\u00fchrungskr\u00e4ften, Arbeitern und Konsumenten aufgeteilte individuelle Teilwissen wider. Jeder Versuch von Regierungsseite, diesen organischen Apparat zu ersetzen (etwa, indem man Preise festlegt), sei reine Hybris.</p><p>Amazon jedoch hat jene gott\u00e4hnliche Position \u00fcber die Wirtschaft erreicht, von der Hayek sich nicht vorstellen konnte, dass eine einzelne Einheit sie je w\u00fcrde einnehmen k\u00f6nnen. In jedem Augenblick bietet die Amazon-Webseite mehr als 600 Millionen Produkte von mehr als drei Millionen Verk\u00e4ufern an. Zusammen mit der Aufzeichnung der fr\u00fcheren K\u00e4ufe verf\u00fcgt es damit \u00fcber den weltweit umfassendsten Katalog von Kundenw\u00fcnschen, was es ihm erlaubt, sowohl individuelle als auch kollektive Bed\u00fcrfnisse zu antizipieren. Dank seines Logistikzweigs - und dessen wachsendem Netzwerk aus Lastwagen und Flugzeugen - besitzt Amazon ein Verst\u00e4ndnis vom Warenfluss rund um den Erdball. Mit anderen Worten: Sollten marxistische Revolution\u00e4re eines Tages in den USA an die Macht kommen, m\u00fcssten sie nur Amazon verstaatlichen und k\u00f6nnten dann schon wieder Feierabend machen.</p><p>Was Amazon in den Augen seiner Kritiker so furchtbar aussehen l\u00e4sst, ist nicht nur seine schiere Gr\u00f6\u00dfe, sondern seine Bewegungsbahn. Amazons Wissensspeicher gibt ihm die M\u00f6glichkeit, seine eigene gewinnbringende Version von einer erstaunlich gro\u00dfen Anzahl an Wirtschaftszweigen aufzubauen. Angesichts von Amazons Wachstum erwachen lange vergessene \u00c4ngste vor Monopolen - und Amazon fand sich angeblich unter Beobachtung der Federal Trade Commission und des Justizministeriums wieder. Anders als Facebook, das ebenfalls beh\u00f6rdlich gepr\u00fcft wird, besitzt Bezos' Firma allerdings weiterhin das volle Vertrauen der \u00d6ffentlichkeit. Eine Umfrage der Georgetown University ergab, dass Amazon 2018 mehr Vertrauen entgegengebracht wurde als jeder anderen amerikanischen Institution. Trotz aller Angriffe von Donald Trump gilt dieser weitgehende Glaube an die Firma f\u00fcr Anh\u00e4nger beider gro\u00dfen amerikanischen Parteien, auch wenn sich die befragten Demokraten noch ein wenig begeisterter zeigten als die Republikaner: Sie beurteilten Amazon sogar als noch vertrauensw\u00fcrdiger als das US-Milit\u00e4r. Amazon gilt als Verk\u00f6rperung von Kompetenz, als eine der wenigen Institutionen, die routiniert funktionieren.</p><p>JE \u00c4LTER AMAZON WURDE, umso mehr hat es sich das Aussehen von etwas gegeben, das mehr ist als nur ein Privatunternehmen. Es stellt sich zunehmend als soziale Institution dar, die dem \u00f6ffentlichen Wohl verpflichtet sei. Nachdem das Unternehmen wegen seines vermeintlichen Umgangs mit seinen Angestellten kritisiert worden war - einige Lagerarbeiter gaben an, mit Produktivit\u00e4tszielen derart unter Druck gesetzt worden zu sein, dass sie es nicht mehr wagten, auf die Toilette zu gehen - , erh\u00f6hte Amazon in den USA den Mindestlohn auf 15 Dollar pro Stunde und versuchte dann, Mitbewerber blo\u00dfzustellen, die diesem Schritt nicht folgten. Da technische Neuerungen seinen Bedarf an Personal ver\u00e4nderten, legte Amazon 700 Millionen Dollar beiseite, um etwa ein Drittel seiner US-Mitarbeiter auf neue Aufgaben vorzubereiten.</p><p>Diese Gesten sind Teil des Versuchs, den Ruf der Firma vor Klagen \u00fcber dessen Habgier zu bewahren. Aber sie verweisen auch auf ein schon \u00e4lteres Verst\u00e4ndnis von Unternehmen. In seiner derzeitigen Form greift Amazon zur\u00fcck auf das Big Business, wie es in den Jahren nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg aufgekommen war. Als Charles E. Wilson, der Pr\u00e4sident von General Motors, 1953 f\u00fcr den Posten des Verteidigungsministers nominiert wurde, sagte er vor dem Senatsausschuss den ber\u00fchmt gewordenen Satz: \"Ich dachte, was gut ist f\u00fcr unser Land, ist auch gut f\u00fcr General Motors und umgekehrt.\" Gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils wird dieser Aphorismus als ernst gemeintes Statement von Gutgl\u00e4ubigkeit verstanden. Um den Klassenkampf zu vermeiden, erkannten die damaligen Wirtschaftstitanen die Gewerkschaften an; sie gew\u00e4hrten ihren Angestellten eine Krankenversicherung und Renten. Liberale Eminenzen wie John K. Galbraith zollten den Unternehmen Anerkennung daf\u00fcr, dass sie die Basis einer g\u00fctigen sozialen Ordnung bildeten. Galbraith lobte die soziale N\u00fctzlichkeit der Firmen auch deshalb, weil er glaubte, sie z\u00e4hmen und nutzbar machen zu k\u00f6nnen, damit sie andere Interessen verfolgten als nur ihre Gewinnmaximierung. Er war \u00fcberzeugt, dass Firmen sich mildt\u00e4tig verhalten w\u00fcrden, sobald ihren Eigeninteressen eine \"ausgleichende Macht\" gegen\u00fcberstand - in Form der organisierten Arbeiterschaft und der Regierung.</p><p>Nat\u00fcrlich sind diese M\u00e4chte schw\u00e4cher geworden. Die Gewerkschaften, deren organisatorische Bem\u00fchungen Amazon immer wieder konterkariert hat, sind nur noch anspruchslose Schatten ihrer fr\u00fcheren Selbst; der regulatorisch eingreifende Staat ist ziemlich au\u00dfer \u00dcbung gekommen. W\u00e4hrend man Amazon also vertraut, hat keine ausgleichende Macht die Neigung oder Kraft dazu, das Unternehmen in die Schranken zu weisen. Und auch wenn sich Macht in einem deutlich \u00fcbleren Charakter als Jeff Bezos konzentrieren k\u00f6nnte, so lindert diese Einsicht nicht die Gefahr, die durch eine solche Konzentration entsteht. Amazon mag ein gro\u00dfes Firmengeflecht mit mehr als 600 000 Angestellten sein, doch es ist auch die Verl\u00e4ngerung eines einzigen, brillanten Mannes mit einer unglaublichen F\u00e4higkeit, die Welt nach seinen Werten umzugestalten.</p><p>Nachdem Jeffs Mutter Jacklyn ihre Ehe mit einem Mitglied einer fahrenden Einrad-Akrobatentruppe aufgel\u00f6st hatte, widmete sie sich ihrem einzigen Nachkommen. Und die noch sehr junge Frau aus Albuquerque, New Mexico, k\u00e4mpfte f\u00fcr die Bildung ihres Sohnes. Sie fuhr ihn jeden Tag mehr als 60 Kilometer weit, damit er in Houston die Grundschule f\u00fcr hoch begabte Sch\u00fcler besuchen konnte. Als eine Warteliste ihn daran hinderte, den Begabungszweig einer weiterf\u00fchrenden Schule zu besuchen, machte Jacklyn den \u00c4mtern so lange Druck, bis f\u00fcr Jeff eine Ausnahme gemacht wurde. Im Laufe von Bezos' unsteter Kindheit, in der seine Familie den Sun Belt der siebziger Jahre durchquerte, unterst\u00fctzte Jacklyn das Interesse ihres Sohnes an T\u00fcfteleien, indem sie ihn immer wieder zu einem Gesch\u00e4ft f\u00fcr Elektronikbastler brachte.</p><p>\"Ich bin schon immer wissenschaftlich klug gewesen\", erkl\u00e4rte Bezos 2018 einem Publikum in Washington, D. C. Diese \u00c4u\u00dferung war in der Praxis best\u00e4tigt worden, als er sich in der Leistungsgesellschaft nach oben arbeitete. In Princeton hatte er noch \u00fcberlegt, theoretische Physik zu studieren. An der Wall Street schloss er sich D. E. Shaw an, dem vermutlich kl\u00fcgsten und abenteuerlustigsten Hedgefonds der neunziger Jahre. Die Firma schickte unaufgefordert Briefe an die besten Studenten der Top-Universit\u00e4ten, in denen es hie\u00df: \"Wir suchen auf elit\u00e4re Weise unseren Nachwuchs und entschuldigen uns daf\u00fcr nicht.\"</p><p>Der Gr\u00fcnder des Finanzunternehmens, der Computerwissenschaftler David E. Shaw, hatte sich w\u00e4hrend der achtziger Jahre im entstehenden Internet versucht. Dadurch sah er die kommende Revolution und die damit verbundenen kommerziellen M\u00f6glichkeiten mit erstaunlicher Klarheit voraus. Er beauftragte Bezos damit, Investitionsm\u00f6glichkeiten im neu privatisierten Medium zu sondieren - eine Untersuchung, die Bezos auf seine eigene gro\u00dfe Idee brachte.</p><p>Als er 1994 Amazon gr\u00fcndete, wollte er eine Institution erschaffen, die jenen \u00e4hnelte, die ihn durch die ersten drei Jahrzehnte seines Lebens getragen hatten. Er wollte seine eigene Aristokratie kluger K\u00f6pfe aufbauen, einen Ort, an dem sich Intelligenz bis ganz nach oben durchsetzen konnte. Der f\u00fcnfte Angestellte der Firma, Nicholas Lovejoy, erz\u00e4hlte dem Magazin Wired sp\u00e4ter, dass Jobinterviews die Form eines sokratischen Tests annahmen. Bezos testete die logische Scharfsinnigkeit der Kandidaten mit Fragen wie \"Warum sind Kanaldeckel rund?\" Lovejoy weiter: \"Eines seiner Mottos war, dass jede Neueinstellung das Niveau f\u00fcr den darauffolgenden Bewerber noch etwas weiter anheben sollte, damit sich insgesamt das Level der Begabung immer weiter steigerte.\"</p><p>Vor allem in der Anfangszeit des Unternehmens war Bezos alles andere als ein g\u00fctiger Chef. Um die Firma nach seinen Vorstellungen zu formen, setzte er immer wieder all jene vor die T\u00fcr, die seinen hohen Anspr\u00fcchen nicht gerecht wurden. Doch Bezos' reizbare Intelligenz und Aufmerksamkeit f\u00fcr Details erzeugten neben Furcht auch Bewunderung. \"Steht ein Meeting mit Bezos an, sollte man sich besser so vorbereiten, als st\u00fcnde die Welt kurz vor dem Untergang\", erkl\u00e4rte mir ein ehemaliger leitender Angestellter. Das Wachstum der Firma, die im siebten Jahr ihres Bestehens bereits drei Milliarden Dollar Gewinn machte, spornte Bezos an, seine Methoden anzupassen. Er schuf eine neue Stelle, den technischen Berater, um den Top-Managern seine Ansichten einzufl\u00f6\u00dfen; die technischen Berater mussten ihrem Herrn und Meister f\u00fcr mindestens ein Jahr folgen und wurden dann zu etwas, was F\u00fchrungskr\u00e4fte scherzhaft als \"Jeff-Bots\" bezeichneten. Sein h\u00f6chst personalisierter Managementstil war in Systeme und Abl\u00e4ufe kodifiziert</p><p>Das erm\u00f6glichte es ihm, seine Gegenwart so zu vergr\u00f6\u00dfern, dass er in einem Meeting, bei dem er pers\u00f6nlich gar nicht anwesend war, doch als pr\u00e4sent wahrgenommen wurde.</p><p>2002 fasste Amazon Bezos' Empfindlichkeiten in einer Reihe von F\u00fchrungsprinzipien zusammen. Von allen Prinzipien ist das wichtigste wohl der Vorsatz \"100 Prozent kundenorientiert\" - ein Gebot, wonach alle Entscheidungen immer mit dem Blick auf den Konsumenten getroffen werden sollen anstatt mit einem Auge auf die Konkurrenz. Dieser Glaubensgrundsatz zeigt sich am besten im Great-Lube-Scandal: Vor etwa zehn Jahren bemerkte Bezos, dass Amazon seinen Kunden eine E-Mail schickte, in der ihnen der Kauf von Gleitgel (Lube) vorgeschlagen wurde. Er tobte vor Wut. W\u00fcrde ein Kunde eine solche Nachricht im B\u00fcro bekommen, k\u00f6nnte wom\u00f6glich sein Chef darauf sto\u00dfen. W\u00fcrde sie zu Hause eintreffen, k\u00f6nnte wom\u00f6glich ein Kind unangenehme Fragen stellen. Bezos ordnete an, dass das Problem gel\u00f6st werden m\u00fcsse, und drohte damit, Amazons E-Mail-Werbung komplett einzustellen, sollte dies nicht gelingen. Kristi Coulter, die damals als Chefin des Webseiten-Merchandisings agierte, sa\u00df einer Gruppe vor, die wochenlang eine Liste von verbotenen Produkten zusammenstellte, welche Bezos' Top-Stellvertreter dann durchsahen. Sie sagte mir: \"Es ging nicht nur um, sagen wir, H\u00e4morrhoiden-Creme oder Gleitmittel, es ging um Haart\u00f6nungen, jede Art von Retinol. Sie waren unglaublich konservativ mit dem, was sie f\u00fcr potenziell peinlich hielten.\"</p><p>Die organisatorische Spitze bei Amazon bildet das sogenannte S-Team, das Senior Team. Es besteht aus 17 F\u00fchrungskr\u00e4ften, die sich regelm\u00e4\u00dfig mit Bezos beraten, um die wichtigsten Entscheidungen des Unternehmens zu treffen. Bezos behandelt das S-Team mit famili\u00e4rer Zuneigung; seine Mitglieder sind so nah an seinen Gedanken wie niemand sonst. Die Gruppe hat Bezos' Methode absorbiert und wendet sie auch in jenen Winkeln der Firma an, die er nicht erreicht. James Thomson, ein Manager, der beim Aufbau von Amazon Marketplace half, wo jeder neue oder gebrauchte G\u00fcter \u00fcber die Amazon-Webseite verkaufen kann, erkl\u00e4rte: \"Bei den meisten Unternehmen bem\u00fchen sich die F\u00fchrungskr\u00e4fte zu zeigen, was sie alles wissen. Bei Amazon liegt der Fokus auf dem Stellen der richtigen Frage. Eine F\u00fchrungspers\u00f6nlichkeit muss L\u00f6cher in die Daten bohren.\"</p><p>Hat es ein Manager einmal bis in das S-Team geschafft, bleibt er dort auch. Die Stabilit\u00e4t dieser Gruppe vermittelt Bezos zweifellos ein angenehmes Gef\u00fchl, aber sie zementiert eben auch diese oberste F\u00fchrungsebene und ihre antiquierte Sicht auf die Diversit\u00e4t der Gesellschaft. Im S-Team sitzt kein Afroamerikaner; die einzige Frau ist f\u00fcr Human Ressources zust\u00e4ndig. Auch eine Stufe unterhalb dieser Ebene sieht es nicht viel anders aus. Ein ehemaliger Manager, ein Schwarzer, erl\u00e4uterte mir, dass die Top-F\u00fchrungskr\u00e4fte unter dem Wort Diversit\u00e4t vor allem das \"Absenken der Standards\" verstehen.</p><p>Ihren Namen hat die Firma vom wasserreichsten Fluss der Erde, doch ihre Nebenfl\u00fcsse breiten sich in alle Richtungen aus. Der Begriff \"Einzelh\u00e4ndler\" beschreibt das Unternehmen kaum noch, da es auch ein Filmstudio, ein Entwickler f\u00fcr k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz, ein Hardwareproduzent und ein Anbieter f\u00fcr Web-Services ist. Amazon als Konglomerat zu bezeichnen, trifft es auch nicht recht, da gro\u00dfe Teile seiner Gesch\u00e4ftsfelder eng miteinander verzahnt sind oder es eines Tages sein werden. Die Expansion der Firma kennt keinerlei Grenzen; kein Wirtschaftssektor liegt jenseits von Amazons Kernkompetenzen.</p><p>ENDE 2012 BEREITETE Donald Graham den Verkauf seines Erbes, der Washington Post vor. Er wollte die Zeitung an jemanden \u00fcbergeben, dessen Taschen tief genug sind, um auch die n\u00e4chste Rezession zu \u00fcberstehen; jemand mit ausreichend technischem Verstand, um den \u00dcbergang der Zeitung ins Digitale zu vervollst\u00e4ndigen. Vor allem suchte er jemanden, der die tiefere Bedeutung von Produktverantwortung erfasste. Graham stellte eine Shortlist mit idealen neuen Eigent\u00fcmern auf, darunter der Finanzier David M. Rubenstein, der fr\u00fchere New Yorker B\u00fcrgermeister Michael Bloomberg, der Gr\u00fcnder von eBay, Pierre Omidyar - und Jeff Bezos.</p><p>Vor allem der letzte Name lockte Graham. Im Januar traf er sich mit seinem Freund und Berater Warren Buffett, der zuf\u00e4llig auch Anteilseigner der Washington Post ist, zu einem Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck. Buffett erw\u00e4hnte, er halte Bezos f\u00fcr \"den besten CEO in den Vereinigten Staaten\" - was wahrlich keine au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnliche Meinung ist, doch Graham hatte sie zuvor noch nie von Buffett geh\u00f6rt. Nach dem Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck machte Graham sich daran, mehr \u00fcber Bezos' Einstellungen herauszufinden. \"Ich suchte seinen Namen im Internet und fand nichts; so gut wie gar nichts f\u00fcr jemanden, der derart reich ist. Ich hatte keine Ahnung, wie seine politischen Pr\u00e4ferenzen aussahen\", berichtete er mir. Diese Leere schien aus Grahams Sicht der ideale Zustand f\u00fcr einen Zeitungseigent\u00fcmer zu sein.</p><p>Graham schickte einen Boten los, der einen Anfang machen sollte: Es kam zu einem h\u00f6flichen, aber wenig vielversprechenden Gespr\u00e4ch. Bezos lehnte es zwar nicht grunds\u00e4tzlich ab, f\u00fcr die Washington Post zu bieten, zeigte andererseits aber auch wenig greifbare Begeisterung f\u00fcr die Idee. Die Tatsache, dass er die Angelegenheit hinterher mehrere Monate lang nicht mehr aufgriff, schien f\u00fcr sein mangelndes Interesse zu sprechen.</p><p>Insofern war es eine \u00dcberraschung, als Bezos nach Monaten des Schweigens eine aus drei S\u00e4tzen bestehende Mail an Graham schickte, mit der er sein Interesse an der Zeitung ausdr\u00fcckte. Graham schlug ein gemeinsames Mittagessen in Sun Valley, Idaho, vor, wo beide an einer Konferenz teilnahmen. Bei ein paar Sandwiches, die Graham in seine Mietwohnung mitgebracht hatte, hielt der Alteigent\u00fcmer seinem bevorzugten Bieter einen unerwarteten Vortrag: Er erl\u00e4uterte ihm alle Gr\u00fcnde, weshalb es schwierig sei, eine Zeitung zu besitzen. Das Gespr\u00e4ch wurde zu einem Tutorium \u00fcber die Verantwortung der Elite, gehalten von einem der herausragenden Praktiker.</p><p>Graham musste Bezos nicht m\u00fchsam \u00fcberreden. In Sun Valley feilschten sie kaum \u00fcber die genauen Bedingungen eines Kaufes. \"Wir a\u00dfen zwei Mal zusammen, und am Ende sch\u00fcttelten wir uns die H\u00e4nde, was so ganz anders war als alle anderen Gesch\u00e4fte, die ich jemals gemacht hatte\", erz\u00e4hlte mir Graham.</p><p>Finanziell gesehen war der Kauf der Washington Post kein bedeutender Moment in Bezos' Leben. Doch f\u00fcr seine Reputation war die Kaufentscheidung ein Wendepunkt - und sie richtete sein Gesp\u00fcr f\u00fcr seinen Platz in der Welt neu aus. Vor dem Erwerb war Amazons Verh\u00e4ltnis zu den New Yorker Verlegern vergiftet. Der freundliche Typ, der von seiner Liebe zu den Romanen von Kazuo Ishiguro sprach, hatte eine neue Art des B\u00fccherkaufs entwickelt, die in einigen Kreisen inzwischen als Feind der literarischen Kultur aufgefasst wurde. Auch wenn er den Kauf der Washington Post nie als Reaktion auf seine \u00c4ngste vor einem schlechten Image von Amazon - und nat\u00fcrlich seines eigenen - rechtfertigte, so wird dies bei seinen \u00dcberlegungen sicherlich eine Rolle gespielt haben. Eine derart b\u00fcrgerlich gesinnte Institution wie die Washington Post zu retten, war seine Chance, selbst ein anderes Verm\u00e4chtnis zu hinterlassen.</p><p>Bezos h\u00e4lt die Washington Post organisatorisch von Amazon getrennt - sein Familienb\u00fcro \u00fcberwacht die Gesch\u00e4fte der Zeitung. Aber er f\u00fchrt sie mit demselben expansionistischen Stil wie sein Hauptunternehmen. Er hatte sich verpflichtet, jeden Dollar Gewinn wieder in die Zeitung zu investieren. In den sechs Jahren, die er sie nun besitzt, ist der Newsroom der Washington Post von 500 auf \u00fcber 850 Mitarbeiter angewachsen.</p><p>Trotz seiner Investition in diese Zeitung war Bezos' \u00dcbergang nach Washington, D. C. z\u00f6gerlich und ungeschickt. Es dauerte Monate, bis er zum ersten Mal die Redaktionsr\u00e4ume besuchte, um die Sorgen der einfachen Mitarbeiter \u00fcber die Absichten des neuen Eigent\u00fcmers zu zerstreuen. Seine Bindung an die Washington Post schien bis zu dem Augenblick ohne emotionale Tiefe zu sein, als er seinen Privatjet losschickte, um den Journalisten Jason Rezaian aus dem Iran zur\u00fcckzuholen, wo dieser 18 Monate lang gefangen gewesen war. Die Presse lobte Bezos in den h\u00f6chsten T\u00f6nen f\u00fcr dessen starkes Interesse am Schicksal des Reporters.</p><p>ES MAG EINE WEILE gedauert haben, bis ihm deutlich wurde, dass Washington der neue Mittelpunkt seines Lebens werden w\u00fcrde. Denn nicht nur Bezos richtete sich in Washington ein, auch seine Firma tat dies, allerdings auf ihre eigene Weise. Die Obama-Jahre brachten einen Boom f\u00fcr \"Big Tech\", dessen Top-Manager sich im Wei\u00dfen Haus die Klinke in die Hand gaben. Das Besucherverzeichnis verr\u00e4t, dass keine andere amerikanische Firma derart h\u00e4ufig vorbeikam wie Google. W\u00e4hrend die Tech-Firmen sich politisch stark engagierten, schloss Amazon aber nur selten Koalitionen mit ihnen. Die meiste Zeit \u00fcber verhielt es sich indifferent. Amazon gab nicht so viel Geld f\u00fcr Lobbyisten aus wie viele andere Big-Tech-Br\u00fcder dies taten, zumindest nicht bis in die letzten Obama-Jahre. Amazon schien sich weniger mit dem Abstecken politischer Ziele als mit dem Abschlie\u00dfen lukrativer Vertr\u00e4ge zu besch\u00e4ftigen. Es trat an die Regierung heran, als w\u00e4re diese nur ein weiterer Kunde.</p><p>Schaut man sich an, wie sehr die Demokraten heute auf \"Big Tech\" einschlagen, kann man kaum glauben, mit welch offenen Armen Barack Obama die Industrie einst willkommen gehei\u00dfen hat und wie freundlich die Technologiekonzerne dies mit Wahlkampfspenden honorierten. F\u00fcr diese Allianz gab es einen guten Grund: Wie das Debakel um healthcare. gov deutlich zeigte, brauchte Obama dringend eine Truppe von Computerfreaks. Die 2013 lancierte Webseite rund um die staatliche US-Krankenversicherung hatte jahrelang technische Probleme, wurde deutlich teurer als geplant und in der \u00d6ffentlichkeit scharf kritisiert. Also berief der Pr\u00e4sident den ersten Chief Technology Officer ins Amt, und seine Regierung dr\u00e4ngte die Bundesverwaltung dazu, Cloud-Dienste zu nutzen, was Geld sparen sollte und einen besseren Schutz f\u00fcr sensibles Material versprach.</p><p>Der offizielle Name f\u00fcr diese Politik lautete \"Cloud First\". Amazon hatte mit der Gr\u00fcndung dieses Programms nichts zu tun, verdiente aber Milliarden damit, schlie\u00dflich hatte das Unternehmen schon deutlich fr\u00fcher als seine Konkurrenten mit dem Cloud-Computing-Gesch\u00e4ft begonnen. Amazon Web Services (AWS) ist im Kern ein Zusammenschluss von Server-Farmen rund um die Welt, auf denen es zu geringen Kosten gut gesicherten Datenspeicherplatz vermietet. Apple, der Instant-Messaging-Dienst Slack und Unmengen von Start-ups sind Kunden von AWS.</p><p>War der Einzelhandel ein Gesch\u00e4ftsmodell mit unglaublich niedrigen Gewinnmargen, so war AWS nahe am Reingewinn. Und Amazon hatte den Markt ganz f\u00fcr sich allein: \"Sieben Jahre lang hatten wir keinen Konkurrenten mit einer vergleichbaren Gesch\u00e4ftsidee\", prahlte Bezos 2018. AWS war derart dominant, dass sogar Amazons Wettbewerber aus anderen Gesch\u00e4ftsbereichen, etwa Netflix, dort Speicherplatz buchten.</p><p>Nicht wenige Big-Tech-Firmen hatten Bedenken, sich auf Gesch\u00e4ftsbeziehungen zu Institutionen der nationalen Sicherheit einzulassen. Bezos kannte keine derartige Zur\u00fcckhaltung. Sein Gro\u00dfvater hatte Raketenabwehrsysteme f\u00fcr das Pentagon entwickelt und Nuklearlabors \u00fcberwacht. In seiner Kindheit wurde Bezos durchdrungen von der Romantik der Weltraum\u00e4ra, einer Zeit, in der Big Business und Big Government Hand in Hand gingen, um die gro\u00dfen Ziele der Nation zu erreichen. Und \u00fcberhaupt: Dass Amazonmit den sensibelsten Daten von Amerikas geheimster Beh\u00f6rde betraut wurde, verschaffte ihm einen enormen Vorteil bei jedem weiteren Verkaufsgespr\u00e4ch. Denn einem solchen Empfehlungsschreiben folgt doch jeder weitere K\u00e4ufer von Regierungsseite bereitwillig.</p><p>Eine von Amazons gr\u00f6\u00dften St\u00e4rken ist seine Lernf\u00e4higkeit, und so gew\u00f6hnte es sich schlie\u00dflich doch noch an den Washingtoner Klientelismus: Es hat drei ehemalige Kongressmitglieder als Lobbyisten angeheuert; seit 2012 sind Amazons Ausgaben f\u00fcr das Lobbying um fast 470 Prozent gestiegen. Au\u00dferdem begann es damit, Staatsbedienstete einzustellen, die ihren Posten verlassen hatten: Als Anne Rung, Obamas oberste Verantwortliche f\u00fcr das Beschaffungswesen, aus dem Amt schied, wurde sie augenblicklich von Amazon \u00fcbernommen.</p><p>Denn Amazon zielte nicht mehr nur darauf ab, Vertr\u00e4ge f\u00fcr das Cloud-Computing abzuschlie\u00dfen und Gesichtserkennungssoftware an Strafverfolgungsbeh\u00f6rden zu verkaufen. Es ging nun auch darum, zu einem Portal zu werden, durch das die Regierungsb\u00fcros Heftklammern, St\u00fchle, Kaffeebohnen und Elektroger\u00e4te kaufen. Das ist kein kleines Gesch\u00e4ft; die US-Regierung gibt jedes Jahr mehr als 50 Milliarden Dollar f\u00fcr Konsumg\u00fcter aus.</p><p>Dabei ist die immer enger werdende Beziehung zwischen Amazon und der Regierung von einer bitteren Ironie gepr\u00e4gt. Denn 2018 zahlte Amazon keinen einzigen Cent an Bundessteuern. Die Firma beherrscht alle Tricks der Steuervermeidung, indem sie ausl\u00e4ndische Steuerparadiese bevorzugt und mit schlafwandlerischer Sicherheit durch all die Steuerschlupfl\u00f6cher tanzt, die ihre Buchhalter ausfindig machen. Amazon tr\u00e4gt nichts zum nationalen Steueraufkommen bei, daf\u00fcr flie\u00dfen reichlich \u00f6ffentliche Gelder auf Amazon-Konten. Amazon ist unter anderem deshalb so gro\u00df geworden, weil es seine Steuerverantwortung immer kleiner werden lie\u00df. Und die Regierung honoriert das alles auch noch mit umfangreichen Vertr\u00e4gen, die das Unternehmen weiter wachsen lassen.</p><p>Der amtierende Pr\u00e4sident der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika ist auf Jeff Bezos allerdings \u00fcberhaupt nicht gut zu sprechen. Schon etliche Male schlug Donald Trump gnadenlos auf ihn ein: Er zerst\u00f6re kleine Firmen, treibe die Post in den Ruin und nutze seine Zeitung, um Gesch\u00e4ftsziele durchzusetzen. W\u00e4hrend des Wahlkampfs 2016 schwor Trump, den Staatsapparat einzusetzen, um Amazon die Haut vom Leibe abzuziehen: \"Wenn ich Pr\u00e4sident werde, dann, oh, dann werden sie Probleme bekommen.\" Don Grahams Warnungen \u00fcber die negativen Aspekte eines Zeitungsbesitzes wirkten mit einem Mal prophetisch.</p><p>Dabei ist es nicht so, dass Bezos diese Attacken jedes Mal unkommentiert an sich abprallen lassen w\u00fcrde. In einer Reaktion auf Twitter k\u00fcndigte er einmal scherzhaft an, Donald Trump ins All zu schie\u00dfen. Doch angesichts von Bezos' Gesch\u00e4ftsinteressen - sowohl in Bezug auf die Regierung als auch auf Konsumenten in von republikanisch dominierten Bundesstaaten - versucht er, jeder Feindseligkeit mit dem Pr\u00e4sidenten aus dem Wege zu gehen. Amazon heuerte sogar den Lobbyisten Jeff Miller an, der sich zuvor als sehr erfolgreicher Fundraiser f\u00fcr Trump erwiesen hatte. Und Bezos tauscht sich mit Jared Kushner aus, dem Schwiegersohn des Pr\u00e4sidenten. Eine ehemalige Mitarbeiterin des Wei\u00dfen Hauses erkl\u00e4rte mir: \"Wenn Trump w\u00fcsste, wie oft Bezos mit Leuten im West Wing kommuniziert, w\u00fcrde er wahnsinnig werden.\"</p><p>W\u00e4hrend der - sp\u00e4ter abgebrochene - Versuch Amazons, nach Long Island City zu ziehen, alle Aufmerksamkeit auf sich gezogen hatte, war der Aufbau eines \u00e4hnlichen Komplexes am Stadtrand von Washington, D. C. deutlich heikler. Nat\u00fcrlich gibt es viele gute Gr\u00fcnde, weshalb eine Firma eine Niederlassung am Regierungssitz er\u00f6ffnen sollte. Aber man kann sich kaum vorstellen, dass Amazon angesichts seiner angehenden Gesch\u00e4fte mit der Regierung nicht auch Hintergedanken hatte.</p><p>Das Unternehmen folgte dem Vorbild seines Eigent\u00fcmers. Genau wie Bezos sich der Verbr\u00fcderung mit der Macht in Washington hingegeben hat - er vergn\u00fcgt sich in den elit\u00e4ren Clubs Alfalfa und Gridiron - , d\u00fcrften bald Tausende von Amazon-Implantaten von Washington aufgesaugt werden. Manager schicken ihre Kinder in die gleichen angesagten Schulen wie Journalisten, Mitarbeiter von Thinktanks und hochrangige Regierungsmitarbeiter. Amazonier werden sich in ihrer neuen Nachbarschaft zu Dinnerpartys einladen lassen. Das aufnahmef\u00e4hige Establishment wird die neuen Million\u00e4rsmigranten aus dem anderen Washington schnell assimilieren. Das Interesse des Staates und das Interesse eines riesigen Unternehmens werden sich weiter vermischen. Und genau so etwas hat Demokratien in der Vergangenheit noch nie gutgetan.</p><p>AMAZON WIRD 2019 gesch\u00e4tzte f\u00fcnf bis sechs Milliarden Dollar f\u00fcr Serien und Filme ausgegeben haben. Schon als Bezos einst ank\u00fcndigte, sein Unternehmen werde sich k\u00fcnftig auch in Hollywood engagieren, hatte er ganz offen von seinen revolution\u00e4ren Absichten gesprochen, eine \"g\u00e4nzlich neue Art des Filmemachens\" zu begr\u00fcnden. Amazon richtete eine Webseite ein, auf der jeder, ob mit oder ohne Erfahrung, ein Drehbuch zur Pr\u00fcfung einreichen konnte.</p><p>Es versprach, dass nur die ausgewerteten Daten entscheiden w\u00fcrden, welches Projekt man in Auftrag gibt. Manche in der Firma beschrieben dies als die \"Hochzeit von Kunst und Wissenschaft\".</p><p>Wie sich sp\u00e4ter herausstellte, entsprach das Get\u00f6se \u00fcber Amazons unorthodoxe Herangehensweise nicht der Realit\u00e4t. Als Amazon 2014 seinen zweiten Satz von Pilot-Sendungen streamte, analysierte es zun\u00e4chst die Sehmuster, nur um dann alle wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnisse \u00fcber Bord zu werfen. Bezos nahm an der entscheidenden Sitzung teil und k\u00fcndigte an, man m\u00fcsse mit der am wenigsten beliebten Pilot-Folge fortfahren: \"Transparent\", der Geschichte \u00fcber Transgender-Eltern dreier erwachsener Kinder. Bezos hatte die \u00fcberschw\u00e4nglichen Kritiken gelesen und dann seine Meinung ge\u00e4ndert.</p><p>Der Erfolg von \"Transparent\" bildete die Blaupause f\u00fcr das weitere Vorgehen der Amazon-Studios. In den fr\u00fchen 2010er-Jahren arbeiteten die besten K\u00f6nner der Branche noch immer lieber bei den Kabelsendern. Damit eine neue Plattform diese Talente abwerben und Zuschauer anlocken konnte, musste sie Aufmerksamkeit generieren, ein ger\u00e4uschvolles Angebot vorweisen. Anstatt auf den Massengeschmack zu setzen, definierte Amazon sich selbst lieber als Independent-Studio, das den st\u00e4dtischen Geschmack der oberen Mittelschicht bediente, auch wenn die Manager in Seattle selbst alles andere als Hipster waren.</p><p>Liest man heute Interviews mit Bezos aus der Zeit seines rapiden Aufstiegs, ist es schwer vorstellbar, dass er sich jemals ausgemalt hat, ein m\u00e4chtiger Mann in Hollywood zu werden. Oder dass Stars wie Matt Damon ihm den Arm um die Schulter legen und f\u00fcr ein Foto posieren w\u00fcrden, als w\u00e4ren sie beste Freunde.</p><p>Als Bezos 2013 bei der Oscar-Party des Magazins Vanity Fair erschien, war an seinem Verhalten nicht abzulesen, dass ihm der ganze Raum geh\u00f6rte. Und doch: W\u00e4hrend Google-Mitbegr\u00fcnder Sergey Brin den Abend fest verwurzelt in einer Ecke verbrachte, drehten Bezos und seine (inzwischen von ihm getrennte) Frau MacKenzie ihre Runden durch die Menge. Sie blieben stets zusammen, wandten sich aber tapfer jedem zu, der sich ihnen n\u00e4herte. MacKenzie erkl\u00e4rte gegen\u00fcber der Vogue einmal, ihre Introvertiertheit mache sie bei solchen Anl\u00e4ssen nerv\u00f6s, ihren Mann hingegen beschrieb sie als \"sehr sozialen Typen\".</p><p>Bezos rechtfertigte das Engagement von Amazon in Hollywood mit einer spa\u00dfigen Bemerkung: \"Wenn wir einen Golden Globe gewinnen, verkaufen wir mehr Schuhe.\" So l\u00e4sst er auf geschickte Weise erkennen, worin Amazon sich von seinen Wettbewerbern unterscheidet. Es ist eben nicht nur ein Streaminganbieter (wie Netflix) oder ein Unternehmen, das mehrere Kan\u00e4le bespielt (wie Comcast). Amazon ist ein geschlossenes \u00d6kosystem, und es setzt darauf, dass seine Videoangebote sich als relativ g\u00fcnstige Methode erweisen, um Menschen davon zu \u00fcberzeugen, nur mehr innerhalb dieses \u00d6kosystems zu leben.</p><p>Amazons Ziel l\u00e4sst sich an einer der Kennzahlen ablesen, die es f\u00fcr die Beurteilung des Erfolgs seiner Programmplanung nutzt. Es untersucht die Sehgewohnheiten der Nutzer, die sich f\u00fcr die kostenlose Testphase von Amazon Prime anmelden, und rechnet dann aus, wie viele neue Kunden des Dienstes ein bestimmtes Programmelement liefert. Bei der Entscheidung \u00fcber das Schicksal einer Serie setzt Amazon die Produktionskosten ins Verh\u00e4ltnis zur Anzahl der durch sie neu gewonnenen Abonnenten. Zur Anfangszeit des Studios reichten noch positive Rezensionen aus, um eine solche Berechnung unwirksam werden zu lassen. Doch inzwischen hat Amazon bewiesen, dass eine Serie (selbst wenn sie wie \"I Love Dick\" f\u00fcr einen Golden Globe nominiert wurde) auch dann abgesetzt wird, wenn die Zahlen nicht stimmen.</p><p>Amazon begann 2005 mit Prime, und von Anfang an bestand Bezos darauf, dass der Preis so hoch sein m\u00fcsse, dass sich eine Mitgliedschaft wirklich wie eine echte Verpflichtung anf\u00fchlt. Die Konsumenten w\u00fcrden sich dann bem\u00fchen, diese betr\u00e4chtlichen Ausgaben durch treues Konsumieren auf der Amazon-Plattform wieder auszugleichen. Rund 100 Millionen Prime-Abonnenten sp\u00e4ter beweist sich dieses Konzept als Meisterst\u00fcck der Verhaltens\u00f6konomie: Laut einer Studie gibt jeder Prime-Kunde in den Vereinigten Staaten durchschnittlich rund 1400 Dollar im Jahr bei Amazon aus, wohingegen Nichtkunden bei nur etwa 600 Dollar landen. Es stellte sich ebenfalls heraus, dass 93 Prozent der Prime-Abonnenten auch nach dem ersten Jahr dabei bleiben, nach dem zweiten Jahr halten sogar 98 Prozent an der Mitgliedschaft fest. Mit Prime hat Bezos eine wahre Geldgrube aufgetan: An dem Tag, an dem sich jedes Jahr die Mitgliedschaft automatisch um ein weiteres Jahr verl\u00e4ngert, sammelt das Unternehmen Milliarden ein. Bezos hat seine Website in eine Gewohnheit verwandelt, der man fast ohne nachzudenken folgt</p><p>Indem wir uns von Amazon abh\u00e4ngig machen, gewinnt das Unternehmen immer mehr an Macht \u00fcber uns. Wer \u00fcber die Seite etwas verkaufen will, muss sich einem System der Disziplin und Bestrafung unterwerfen. Amazon bestimmt sehr effektiv die Anzahl von Gegenst\u00e4nden, die ein Verk\u00e4ufer in ein Paket packen darf, sowie die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe dieser Pakete. Um Amazons strengen Auflagen zu entsprechen, reduzierte ein Hersteller von Tiernahrung k\u00fcrzlich sein Verpackungsmaterial um 34 Prozent. Wer sich nicht an die Regeln h\u00e4lt, wird finanziell abgestraft. Und sollte eine Firma, die \u00fcber Amazon Marketplace verkauft, sich ungerecht behandelt f\u00fchlen, kann sie nur wenig dagegen unternehmen, weil sie beim Unterzeichnen der Vertr\u00e4ge das Klagerecht aufgegeben hat. So sind die Teilnahmebedingungen.</p><p>HAT MAN \u00dcBERHAUPT NOCH eine Wahl mitAmazon? Diese Frage treibt die Gesch\u00e4ftswelt noch weit mehr um als die Kunden. Unternehmen wie Nike haben Amazon jahrelang widerstanden; sie haben viel Geld in die Hand genommen, um eigene E-Commerce-Webseiten aufzubauen. Doch selbst als Nike seine Produkte nicht \u00fcber Amazon anbot, wurden mehr Nike-Artikel \u00fcber die Website verkauft als von jeder anderen Marke. Jeder kann \u00fcber Amazonmit Nike-Schuhen hausieren gehen, ohne erkl\u00e4ren zu m\u00fcssen, woher er seinen Lagerbestand hat.</p><p>Ben Thompson, der Gr\u00fcnder von Stratechery, einer Webseite, die Unternehmen aus dem Silicon Valley genau unter die Lupe nimmt, hat Amazons Masterplan pr\u00e4gnant beschrieben. Er ist der Meinung, dass das Unternehmen die Logistik \"f\u00fcr im Grunde alles und jeden\" bereitstellen m\u00f6chte. Denn l\u00e4uft erst einmal alles \u00fcber Amazon, hat das Unternehmen die Macht, eine \"Steuer\" auf eine verbl\u00fcffende Anzahl von Transaktionen zu erheben. Wenn Amazon Abonnements von Premium-Kabelanbietern wie Showtime und Starz verkauft, beh\u00e4lt es daf\u00fcr einen Anteil von 15 bis zu 50 Prozent f\u00fcr sich, wie es hei\u00dft. Solange ein Produkt in einer Amazon-Lagerhalle auf seinen Verkauf wartet, muss der Verk\u00e4ufer eine Mietgeb\u00fchr daf\u00fcr entrichten. Amazon erlaubt es Verk\u00e4ufern, sich durch Bezahlung eine bessere Platzierung bei den Suchergebnissen zu sichern (und verweist bei diesen Ergebnissen auf ein Sponsoring). Und es hat seine Seiten so gestaltet, dass man auf ihnen Werbepl\u00e4tze mieten kann. Wenn ein Unternehmen darauf hofft, \u00fcber Amazons Gr\u00f6\u00dfenvorteile Geld zu verdienen, muss es daf\u00fcr zahlen. Der Mann, der sich selbst als der heroische Jean-Luc Picard stilisiert, entwarf ein Gesch\u00e4ftsmodell, das viel eher zu Picards Erzfeinden passt, den Borg - ein Gesellschaften verschlingendes Volk, das seine Opfer nur noch wissen l\u00e4sst: \"Sie werden assimiliert werden, Widerstand ist zwecklos.\"</p><p>BEI PERSONALGESPR\u00c4CHEN werden Amazon-Mitarbeiter gebeten, ihre \"Superkraft\" zu benennen. Ein Arbeitgeber sollte eigentlich nicht die Erwartung sch\u00fcren, seine Angestellten w\u00fcrden \u00fcber quasi au\u00dferirdische Qualit\u00e4ten verf\u00fcgen. Doch ich vermute, Bezos selbst d\u00fcrfte mit dieser Frage an seine F\u00e4higkeit zum vision\u00e4ren Denken erinnern. Er k\u00fcmmert sich um die Details, ohne daf\u00fcr seinen klaren Blick auf das gro\u00dfe, endg\u00fcltige Ziel zu vernachl\u00e4ssigen. So kann er ein Unternehmen dazu bringen, den Markt f\u00fcr Lebensmittel zu beherrschen - und gleichzeitig daran arbeiten, Astronauten bis 2024 auf den Mond zu schicken, um dort nach den f\u00fcr eine Kolonisierung ben\u00f6tigten Ressourcen zu graben. Bezos hegt \u00fcbrigens keinerlei Hoffnung, diese Kolonien irgendwann einmal selbst zu erleben, die erst lange nach seinem Tod entstehen d\u00fcrften. Und doch \u00e4ndert dies nichts an seinem Entschluss, dieses Projekt tatkr\u00e4ftig voranzutreiben.</p><p>DIE EROSION DER DEMOKRATIE kann auf ganz unterschiedliche Weise geschehen. Private Macht scheint nicht die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Bedrohung zu sein, solange die \u00f6ffentliche Macht ihr etwas entgegensetzen kann. Doch Gemeinwesen m\u00fcssen es wie Bezos halten und an das lange Ende der Geschichte denken, bevor sie einer einzelnen Person derart gro\u00dfe Verantwortung \u00fcbertragen. Einer Person, die nie auch nur eine einzige W\u00e4hlerstimme bekommen hat, aber Funktionen \u00fcbernimmt, die einst dem Staat zukamen. Jeff Bezos' Firma hat die Teilung der nationalen Infrastruktur erm\u00f6glicht; sie formt mit ihren Robotern die Zukunft der Arbeitspl\u00e4tze; sie wird den Himmel mit ihren Drohnen bev\u00f6lkern; ihre Webseite legt fest, welche Industrie aufbl\u00fcht und welche abstirbt. Bezos' Investment in die Weltraumfahrt k\u00f6nnte den Himmel neu gestalten. Die Unf\u00e4higkeit des politischen Systems, seine Machtf\u00fclle zu problematisieren geschweige denn sie zu kontrollieren, ist sein Erfolgsgarant.</p><p>Jeff Bezos ist deshalb von der Zukunft so fasziniert, weil er wei\u00df, dass sie ihm geh\u00f6rt.</p><p>Aus dem Englischen von J\u00f6rn Pinnow</p><p>Seinen Glauben an die Kolonisierung des Weltraums tr\u00e4gt Bezos mit dem Eifer eines Predigers vor</p><p>Was Amazon in den Augen seiner Kritiker so furchtbar aussehen l\u00e4sst, ist au\u00dfer der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe auch seine Bewegungsbahn</p><p>Amazon ist auch die Verl\u00e4ngerung eines brillanten Mannes, der die Welt nach seinen Werten umgestaltet</p><p>Finanziell kein gro\u00dfes Ding - aber f\u00fcr die Reputation von Jeff Bezos war der Kauf der Washington Post ein Wendepunkt in seinem Leben</p><p>Dank Amazons Lernf\u00e4higkeit gew\u00f6hnte es sich doch noch an den Washingtoner Klientelismus</p><p>Mit 100 Millionen Abonnenten beweist sich das Konzept als Meisterst\u00fcck der Verhaltens\u00f6konomie</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Amazon-Erfinder Jeff Bezos in Seattle anno 1998, vier Jahre nach Gr\u00fcndung seines Unternehmens</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Franklin Foer Jahrgang 1974, ist Mitarbeiter des amerikanischen Magazins The Atlantic und Autor mehrerer Sachb\u00fccher, darunter \"Welt ohne Geist - Wie das Silicon Valley freies Denken und Selbstbestimmung bedroht\" (Blessing-Verlag, 2018).

There would be no compromise on fisheries, on alignment with European directives and regulation, and no oversight role within the UK for the European Court of Justice. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Prime Minister Johnson, it seems, is taking a leaf from his hero Churchill's book. \"If you're going through hell\", Churchill is quoted as saying at the time of the fall of France, \"keep going\". </p><p> Related articles</p><p>It is as well to remind ourselves that since the Brexit vote of June 23, 2016, the EU's position has been maximalist. The two favoured EU options for the UK were to remain as four provinces in an EU state, or a vassal outside it. Mrs May tried to get the package through parliament, but failed.</p><p>We have been here before. In 1806, the Emperior Napoleon announced his Berlin Decree, also known as the Continental System, to impose a large scale embargo on British trade. Barnier's assumption was the same: as the smaller entity, the UK had to submit. We didn't then. It looks like we won't now. </p><p>Just as Chancellor Merkel stated in dulcet tones that the EU should prepare for a no-deal, the UK government announced that it would nominate former Cabinet Minister Dr Fox, and prominent Brexiteer, as its candidate to replace Roberto Azevedo, the current Director General of the WTO, who is stepping down early from the role at the end of August. </p><p>The incentive for Boris to keep to his word on this issue and to deliver on his promise is overwhelming. The mandate is for the UK to take control of its waters, rekindle her once great maritime economy, create free trade zones, re-onshore manufacturing, and make the UK's physical and intellectual infrastructure the foundation for being the best place in the world to live and to do business.</p><p>This also involves updating the principles of the Glorious Revolution and the Bill of Rights, and reaching a new constitutional settlement for the whole of the United Kingdom.</p><p>The prize is a permanent Northern blue wall and stronger Union. The United Kingdom's much needed renewal will only happen if Boris and team shun half measures, tinkering at the edges and the framework inherited in from Heath, Blair, Brown and Cameron. </p><p>Boris's strength and power, as obvious as it might sound, comes from the United Kingdom electorate. Ambition, delivery and \"Glory\" - in the language of Imran Khan, Wakefield's charismatic new Tory MP - are what will drive the country forwards.</p><p> Strategy on the global chess board will henceforth be implemented here in the UK by people whose interest is wedded to the future of our country - not by people in Brussels, Paris, Berlin, Beijing or Washington.</p><p>The power of Boris' opponents, by contrast, is much less obviously dependent on the UK voting public. Indeed, just as David Frost stood up for the United Kingdom, Sir Keir Starmer \"took the knee\" because he felt \"under pressure\" from the mob. He announced that he would sign up for \"unconscious racial bias training\" because he had deviated from one of Black Live Matter's key aims - Defunding the Police. </p><p>In addition, Starmer was reprimanded by Momentum's new co-Chairmen Miss Sriskanthan and Mr Scattergood and ordered to \"get Labour's house in order over Race\".</p><p>Incidentally, Gaya Sriskanthan, one of Momentum's new co-Chairmen is a New York-based climate activist. As well as being in charge of the group, she is also an active member of the Democratic Socialists of America. The detail is of great importance due to the umbilical cord linking Black Lives Matter to the US Democratic Party. BLM is a fund-raising arm of would-be President Biden.</p><p>In appointing Miss Sriskanthan as co-Chairman of its grassroots organisation, Momentum is making explicit its link to Black Lives Matter, the Democratic Party, the Democratic Socialists of America and the British Labour Party. We are witnessing the setting up of a modern version of the old International. However, instead of taking orders from Moscow, the Labour Party will beproposing instead to take them from Washington or New York. </p><p>Sir Keir Starmer has a long history of bowing and kneeling to supranational organisation and pressure groups. He bowed to the European Union when May was the EU's Governor in its province of London, and now indirectly kneels to the Democratic Party in the United States. </p><p>His power base, however, is potent and uncompromising. It bring together an unholy alliance, as journalist Sohrab Ahmari would say, of \"academe, media, large corporations, 'experts', Big Tech\", whose understanding of the world is no longer anchored in substance and logic but instead floats in post-modern and nihilistic relativism.</p><p>Intellectually, however, this powerful alliance is trapped. It declares itself post-modern, but in effect is reviving the politics of race in a new guise. And it does so in a country where 85% of the population is white, and half of the population is working class.</p><p>Its political antennae dance to the likes of Cambridge University Professor Priyamvada Gopal, who believes that \"White Lives Don't Matter\" and that \"It's about abolishing a race hierarchy where whites are on top\". </p><p>Try to sell that to the British working man and you get an inkling of what Starmer means when he says he has a mountain to climb to get Labour elected. . </p><p>The rays of light in the current political darkness are easy to identify: Boris has everything to gain by standing firm with the EU, and the Labour Party is taking the knee to a radical and unhinged US Democratic Party.</p><p>Further, Boris and team have been given the monopoly over our flag, patriotism, history, sovereignty and the British people. The Party has been granted its power by the people, there is no need to pander or to compromise with a Woke establishment, whose grip on power is real but tenuous and illegitimate. In short, drop identity politics in its entirety. </p><p>The Labour Party by contrast has chosen to turn everyone who cherishes the UKs inheritance into an enemy of the new International. The danger, of course, is that having backed certain defeat at the ballot box yet again, the Labour Party, being hungry for power, will try to cement its power by extra-parliamentary means. The stakes could not be higher.</p><p> Related articles Kay Burley loses it as she orders Brexiteer to 'STOP IT' in clash Let the grassroots Conservatives pick their next leader, says NEWARK Brexit simplified - where we are now and whether we will EVER LEAVE</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EXPONL-64366226</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EXPONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60BF-K561-JCJY-G363-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408506</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1091\"/><timeReceived>6:49 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Northern and Shell Media Publications All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Express Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12327\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 12, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Calling privacy a human right, Nadella told ET in an interview that Microsoft would conform to India's proposed privacy rules. He also said the company's success was defined by its economic impact and not because of its high market capitalisation. Edited Excerpts:Two of the large technology companies with trillion-dollar market caps are headed by Indians. </p><p>Is that number important to you?(Amod Malviya), co-founder of Udaan, put it well: What is more important to us is the overall surplus and economic value that gets created in every country and in every community we work in.When I come to India, I make sure we're talking about our technology. (Take) Apollo Hospitals, they created a new AI model for the South Asian population with cardiac issues...A unicorn like Udaan was able to achieve success with just 17-18 people.If you're creating that local surplus, we (Microsoft) will even have the permission to operate. That is true in every country - in India, the United States and in the UK.To me that is what is most important.If you just celebrate your own market cap and you don't see success broadly around the world, then I think that market cap is going to be very transitory.You have said that we need to build technologies in areas such as health, agriculture and education, not just focused on consumer tech. How can India build for the world?There is nothing wrong with the consumer economy getting lots of innovation. After all, the mobile revolution along with consumer internet companies have really changed the lives of people, in terms of their access to services.The question now is, can we make it broader?Here is a company that says electric vehicles are going to be our future, let us completely create a new grid effectively for batteries. That's a startup here that's relevant everywhere. Or, take this company that says I can build an exoskeleton device for anybody with spinal cord injuries, and they're already taking it to North America.Those are all very innovative ideas coming out of India that have global relevance.You have spoken about being open to regulation and about ethics in Artificial Intelligence. Yet, there has been a pushback from local teams every time governments try to bring new policies on data localisation or digital tax. As technology becomes much more pervasive, just like we have regulation in food safety, like we have the Federal Aviation Authority for air traffic (in the United States) and so on, we will always have regulation for things that are very mission critical in our lives and society.Privacy is a human right. We implemented the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, but (also) took the subject rights and implemented them all over the world. In India, there will be equivalent legislation and we will conform to it.Even around AI and AI ethics, it's ultimately a tool. How the tool gets used is something every country and society will need some norms around...one issue with overregulating anything means you fragment things, you increase transaction costs. The last thing you want to do is increase the cost of doing business for successful entrepreneurs from here.Your remarks on the Citizenship Amendment Act recently were seen as controversial. Were you taken aback?I think every country is going to define their own policies around immigration and national security. In democracies, it's the people and governments that decide. I mostly speak from being someone who grew up here...proud of my heritage of a multicultural India and as an immigrant, my hope is that this country continues to be a progressive democracy that really helps more people find that this is the land of their dreams. I think this is what is true about India today and I am very confident that it will be true of India in future.The political discourse in the US recently has been anti-big business. One (Democratic Party) candidate has talked about breaking big tech companies like Facebook. What is your view?Ultimately, every company effectively has the moral licence to operate in any community because what it creates, empowers and enables. Just because you are big doesn't mean anything. One of the things that we all have to re-acquaint ourselves with is, perhaps, what's the social contract of a corporation. It is about finding profitable solutions to the challenges of people on the planet.In your book, you talk about the Gini coefficient, but you are not obviously a believer in extreme equality...Would you like to expound on that?I am not a political scientist or an economist. I get enthusiastic when some of the cutting-edge technologies like HoloLens is being used by first-line workers in a manufacturing (unit) to basically tame the learning curve, which means they are getting better wage support. That's a fantastic use of technology and its implication, even taking broader job creation and wage support. Ultimately, that's what needs to happen.Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani talked about a very deep partnership. What are its main elements?Fundamentally, they have really bet on our platform. They are big users (of our products). They're also looking at how they can use the cloud infrastructure to build new types of solutions for some of the ambitious (plans) they have around small and medium-sized businesses... our identity there is to give them the technology and help them realize their ambitions.You transformed Microsoft's culture. Is that here to stay?Nothing gives any company a God given right to stay. It comes down to staying true to your mission every day and a culture that allows you to stay relevant and express your mission with changing technology. I feel really good about the cultural meme we picked around growth mindset...you have to confront your fixed mindset each day. Will it stay? It is a function of each day - whether you wake up and say, I am not perfect and what can I learn, and the day you feel you have even achieved a growth mindset means you don't have a growth mindset. That is the paradox. It applies to human beings, it applies to organisations.

This post makes a critically important point that the UK press has largely ignored, by instead treating the Government's claim that Brexit is all about the UK achieving national sovereignity. As Chris Grey has often pointed out on his Brexit Blog, the UK is too small to go it alone and will have to be affiliated with a major trade bloc. And that is the result of Dani Rodrik's trade trilemma which we highlighted in 2007. From Rodrik's website[1]: Sometimes simple and bold ideas help us see more clearly a complex reality that requires nuanced approaches. I have an 'impossibility theorem' for the global economy that is like that. It says that democracy, national sovereignty and global economic integration are mutually incompatible: we can combine any two of the three, but never have all three simultaneously and in full. Here is what the theorem looks like in a picture: </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb.gif\">http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/WindowsLiveWriter/image_thumb.gif</url> To see why this makes sense, note that deep economic integration requires that we eliminate all transaction costs traders and financiers face in their cross-border dealings. Nation-states are a fundamental source of such transaction costs. They generate sovereign risk, create regulatory discontinuities at the border, prevent global regulation and supervision of financial intermediaries, and render a global lender of last resort a hopeless dream. The malfunctioning of the global financial system is intimately linked with these specific transaction costs.. So I maintain that any reform of the international economic system must face up to this trilemma. If we want more globalization, we must either give up some democracy or some national sovereignty. Pretending that we can have all three simultaneously leaves us in an unstable no-man's land. As this post stresses, the Government theatrics about tossing aside its trade ties to the EU and depicting doing a series of deals with other countries, above all the US, as some sort of liberation is a con. The Tories instead are seeking to move toward a more neoliberal, less regulated economic model. Author Nick Dearden argues that this realignment will result in a greater loss of national sovereignity than remaining in the EU.  By Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now. Originally published at openDemocracy[2] The Johnson government is sabre-rattling once again over what it will accept in a trade deal with the EU. The details of the arguments appear technical and arcane, while the media like to portray it as a bitter dispute between a divorcing couple. Sadly, this obscures the real nature of what's at stake, which is no less than the future of Britain - what sort of country we become after Brexit, and what role we play in the world. That's because modern trade deals set so many of the rules by which we live our lives. They have huge implications for our society and economy. Britain has a choice about the standards and rules it wants to live by. But it can't have both European and American standards. Drawing closer to one bloc pushes us further from the other. For many on the right of the Tory Party there is no contest - tilting towards the US will embed a big business, low regulation model. Signing any sort of significant deal with the EU makes this harder to achieve. In this piece, I look at what is at stake and how we can stop Johnson's government using these parallel talks to change Britain for the worst. The article is taken from my new book, 'Trade Secrets: the truth about the US trade deal and how we stop it', which also includes full referencing and is available for free here[3].  There is a part of Britain's establishment which has always looked to the United States for leadership. For these Atlanticists, Britain's 'special relationship' with the USA is about much more than a shared history or culture. Rather, they look longingly at the US as a model economy in which big business can behave as it sees fit and rich individuals are free from irritating 'burdens' like public healthcare and redistributive taxes. For such people, the referendum to leave the EU presented an opportunity to unleash a long\u2011cherished dream. One important vehicle to achieve this would be a trade deal with the USA. That's because trade deals today go well beyond negotiations around duties on imports. They affect how we regulate food production, how we provide public services, how we're allowed to regulate big business and foreign investment, and how much we are charged for our medicines. Particularly since the high point of corporate globalisation in the mid-1990s, trade deals have increasingly shaped what sort of society we live in, promoting a model of free market economics, together with tools to discipline governments that step away from this model. The US trade deal is not really about importing more American products. It's about importing the American economic and regulatory model. It is not about whether we trade with the US or not but whether we capitulate to a set of policies that enshrine the power of the market and big business. In many ways there is nothing special about the US-UK trade deal. Rather, the deal is likely to reflect all that is wrong with our global trading system, a system which has played a key role in the creation of an unsustainable, anti\u2011social economy which has handed the major decisions over our lives to a super\u2011rich elite. The political crisis we are now living through is an inevitable product of this system. It is possible to build something better. Trade does not have to be a problem, the important thing is the rules that govern trade and, relatedly, international business and capital flows. But that requires a significantly different set of trade rules to the ones we have today. How do we create a different trade system? For us, in Britain, the defeat of a US trade deal is an essential first step, throwing a major obstacle in the path of our government's Atlanticist vision, and opening up a long-overdue debate on what sort of society we want, and the role we play in the world. From here, we can join with campaigners across the world who are fighting against similar trade rules, and begin to rebuild a movement capable of overcoming the 'market knows best' global economy. Chlorine Chickens  Trade deals today are less about reducing tariffs, already at very low levels, and more about ridding the world economy of regulations that supposedly 'interfere' with trade. The argument runs like this: I make lightbulbs and I want to export them into another country. The lightbulbs are safe, but they don't meet the safety standards of the country I want to export to, so that country blocks imports of my lightbulbs. As an exporter, this higher safety standard looks like a trade barrier. Modern trade deals spend a lot of effort trying to level (or 'harmonise') such standards. They do this by judging different regulations that achieve the same goal as 'equivalent'. You can trade such goods because they're produced in a way which achieve the same goals, even if the means by which they do this is different. The problem with this approach is that goods are very often not 'equivalent' at all, and by treating them as such, we risk undermining what are often hard\u2011fought\u2011for environmental, animal welfare and consumer protections. Take food. US food standards are radically different to Britain's. US agriculture is dominated by massive corporations[4], farming on an industrial scale, with intensive use of antibiotics[5], hormones and steroids to promote rapid growth of animals and prevent illness in what are often extremely unpleasant and unhealthy conditions, along with an excess of chemicals, and allowances for stomach\u2011churning things to end up in the food we eat. The US uses what it call a 'science\u2011based' approach, and demands it aggressively in trade talks. 'Science-based' is a shorthand for a system which allows business to develop and market products as it wants, and only when harm is proven can action be taken against that produce - an incredibly difficult task when big business is so well resourced. Boris Johnson and his lead trade negotiator to the EU have both endorsed the 'science\u2011based' approach, which means throwing caution to the wind when it comes to embracing technologies like genetic modification. Britain currently embraces the 'precautionary principle', a different approach which puts the emphasis on ensuring no harm. Perhaps ironically this approach tries to build genuine scientific certainty before allowing businesses to produce and market products. In farming it translates into a method of food production where risks to health, welfare and sustainability, at least in theory, are minimised from 'farm\u2011to\u2011fork'. The final product might or might not taste similar, and might or might not be as safe (US food poisoning rates are much higher than European rates), but the products are certainly not 'equivalent'. The US is forceful in its demand that US food made to different standards should be allowed onto British supermarket shelves. This would certainly mean more genetically modified foods. It would mean chlorine-washed chicken, the now\u2011famous symbol of a US trade deal. The problem is less the chlorine than what the chlorine is hiding. The washes essentially remove bacteria which has accumulated over a lifetime in which chickens can barely move, cluck or eat, never see sunlight, regularly suffer heart attacks because of their unnatural size, and are covered in sores. Much other US meat is also produced using hormones, steroids and antibiotics to make animals grow bigger faster and to prevent them getting ill in the unnaturally close conditions in which they live. Some never see sunlight, or eat grass. The use of many of these chemicals is bad for humans too - antibiotic overuse is threatening to make these drugs useless as bacteria develop resistance to them, which would take away one of the most crucial tools of modern medicine. US pigs regularly contain ractopamine, which makes pigs collapse, tremble, suffer liver and kidney dysfunction, and even die. No wonder over 160 countries, including Russia and China, have banned it. Proponents of allowing these types of food into our markets often argue that it's consumer choice: 'If you don't like it, don't buy it!' But the argument is disingenuous, not least because the same big business lobbies pushing to cut food standards are also arguing against our labelling standards[6]. But there's a deeper problem too. By forcing producers into competition with those practising lower standards, they make higher standards unsustainable. Farmers would have little choice but to push for lower standards here too. It's a classic example of how modern trade rules push down standards and regulations around the world. Food is newsworthy, but the issue is much wider. The 'regulatory harmonisation' agenda stretches across the economy and encompasses other disciplines on governments too, like forcing governments to prove their regulations are no more burdensome than necessary on business. This is a path already well-trodden by decision-makers[7] in recent years, a trade deal would lock it into place. It's a subjective criteria which leaves governments at constant threat of being challenged. And it's at the heart of talks around the US trade deal. Taxing Big Tech In the late nineteenth century, a small group of businessmen captured the American economy, using new technologies like railways to build monopolies which brought them unprecedented levels of wealth and power. They were labelled the 'robber barons' and became synonymous with obscene levels of inequality and the capture of politics by private interests. Today, a new group of corporations has risen, monopolising technologies which have become central to our society, using their power to amass unimaginable fortunes. Big Tech titans like Amazon, Google and Facebook have become more powerful and wealthy than most governments, and in coming decades their power will grow, as more of our economy becomes 'digital'. In order to cement their power on the global stage, these corporations are pushing for the development of new rules in trade deals. The US and Britain are among the countries pushing these rules the hardest, meaning there is certain to be a far\u2011reaching digital trade chapter in a US trade deal. And while it's true that countries need to find ways to regulate the power of Big Tech, these trade 'rules' are not intended to do that - in fact they achieve the very opposite. A digital trade chapter in a US trade deal could severely constrain the ability of governments to make these technologies work in the public interest. For instance, the British government has introduced a 'digital services tax' to help ensure effective taxation of these corporations. The US has made clear that such a tax would be incompatible with the any trade deal[8], and Big Tech lobbying groups for Amazon, Google and Facebook have demanded such a tax be made impossible under the deal. It could also lower privacy standards. Britain is currently signed up to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), regarded as a gold standard agreement for online privacy. The US dislikes these regulations. Moreover, the many issues posed by the expansion of the online world into every area of our lives are complex. There is a need for public debate and exploration of ideas by policymakers. Trade rules must not be used to shut that debate down. For instance, politicians are now looking at ways of holding corporations to account for failing to tackle fake news online. But Trump has been clear that he wants to make such action impossible under a US deal. There's a wider issue with these more 'intangible' aspects of the economy which have become so much more profitable in recent decades, and one which could fundamentally threaten the NHS. Today, many big corporations see their 'intellectual property' as one of their most important assets. They use it to build monopoly power and to shift (and thereby minimise) their tax responsibilities around the world. Copyright, trademarks and patents became a part of trade rules in 1995 with the passing at the WTO of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). During the 1990s, at the height of the HIV epidemic, countries were prevented from rolling out HIV medication because it was covered by these rules, which kept prices of key medicines very high. Campaigners fought for exemptions, which allowed countries to override the rules in certain circumstances. However, Big Pharma has fought back, persuading western governments, especially the US, to close these exemptions in new trade deals. In a US-UK deal, the focus on Big Pharma's wrath will be NICE - the regulator that sets guidelines for which medicines are cost effective for the NHS to provide. Given the NHS's size, this has a powerful influence how much US pharmaceutical firms can get away with charging not just the UK, but other countries that take the UK as their source of 'reference pricing'. Donald Trump has vowed to make pharmaceutical pricing a 'top priority' in trade. US drug prices are eye\u2011watering, averaging more than four times the price paid in the UK. Such large increases in prices under a US trade deal would pose an existential threat to the NHS - driving costs for new drugs well beyond the health system's ability to afford them. Corporate Courts In the days leading up to Christmas 2001, Argentina was engulfed by one of the worst crises in its history. A decade of economic liberalisation had seen poverty soar. Large parts of Argentina's public sector had been privatised on terms which were great for international corporations, but terrible for the people relying on the services. As a debt crisis grew, protests toppled the government. In less than two weeks Argentina went through five presidents, defaulted on its debt and then devalued its currency to put the country on a long path to recovery. Part of this recovery involved protecting Argentinians' access to basic services. The government froze the price of water and energy. But big business howled in protest that this broke their privatisation contracts. They claimed they'd been treated unfairly, and sued Argentina in a 'corporate court' made possible under the terms of investment treaties the country had signed. Over fifty cases were lodged, claiming an astronomical $80 billion from the government. British company Anglian Water was a party to one of the claims. Having been part of a consortium that took over the Buenos Aires water system - and despite claims of atrocious service, lack of investment and a rise in waterborne diseases - Anglian and partners claimed the price freeze breached their 'rights'. Argentina countered that the rights of its citizens should surely be the paramount concern, but the tribunal decided human rights should not override investor rights and found in favour of Anglian. What does this have to do with a US trade deal? Well, the same mechanism that saw Argentina hauled over the coals by big business is likely to be included in the deal, leaving governments exposed to cases brought by US\u2011based multinationals in secret courts. Investor\u2011State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) - the formal name for these 'corporate courts' - was invented back in the 1950s, when it started to be inserted in investment deals, reflecting western countries' suspicion of how their corporations would be treated in newly independent countries in the global south. But it's really in the last 20 years that they have become a major problem. Corporate courts allow foreign investors to sue governments in special tribunals when they believe their 'rights' have been infringed. The basis for such cases has been expanded to an almost ludicrous degree by City law firms. A foreign investor today might claim pretty much any government action that damages their future profits is 'unfair' or 'expropriation', even though the rest of us might regard the measure as a reasonable response to the harm a corporation is causing. Putting cigarettes in plain packaging, forcing toxic mines to put better environmental standards in place, or the controlling of water prices might well damage corporate profits, but the idea that they have infringed some fundamental right directly threatens a government's ability to enact regulation. Yet these are all real ISDS cases. Britain already has many ISDS agreements with countries around the world, but while these have been a huge problem for those countries, for the most part Britain is the more powerful partner. Establishing an ISDS agreement with the US would put the boot on the other foot: it would open Britain up to challenge by tens of thousands of US\u2011based multinationals. Action on climate change would be particularly difficult. Currently the Dutch government is facing an ISDS case by energy company Uniper, which runs power plants in the country. Uniper is unhappy at the policy of banning coal\u2011based power generation by 2030. What's interesting is that Uniper's plant is fairly new, so the company can hardly claim it wasn't aware of the growing movement to phase out coal power. In fact, Uniper's strategy appears to be to carry on as usual and claim compensation from governments when the inevitable phase\u2011outs happen. ISDS is becoming a business model in itself - removing pressure for corporations to take environmental measures. Democracy and Resistance  How do we defeat this frightening deal? Despite a heroic fight to secure greater power over trade deals on the part of many MPs, the government has failed to transfer the powers of democratic oversight developed within the EU to Britain. MPs do not have a right to vote or debate the government's trade objectives, they don't have a right to effectively scrutinise the government, and they are not guaranteed a debate or vote once the trade bill is complete. Even if they are granted a vote, they cannot stop the trade deal coming into effect. But we shouldn't despair. Most trade deals which have been defeated - and there are plenty - have been defeated on the streets, by campaigners undaunted by the odds they were up against. From the defeat of TTIP, and its forerunner the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, to the victory over the Free Trade Area of the Americas and removal of water sector liberalisation from WTO rules, there is much to draw lessons from. A wide coalition has already been formed to oppose the US deal. TTIP activists have been joined by new allies. On the day he was made secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, George Eustice was booed by farmers when he mentioned the US trade deal. Even pro\u2011government newspapers like the Mail on Sunday are running regular columns on the problems of a US trade deal. This can reach beyond the 'Brexit divide'. True, the politicians who led the Leave campaign want to use Brexit to deregulate and liberalise the British economy, but many of their voters want something entirely different. A recent survey shows high levels of support among young Leave voters in the north of England for environmental and animal welfare regulation. There is every reason to hope that the US deal can be defeated if we build a sufficiently large and diverse movement. By doing so, we will not only prevent the government signing a terrible deal, but will throw a spanner into the works of their attempts to push Britain down the path of further deregulation and liberalisation.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/09/we-must-defeat-the-us-trade-deal.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;#38;utm_medium=feed&amp;#38;utm_campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/09/we-must-defeat-the-us-trade-deal.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;#38;utm_medium=feed&amp;#38;utm_campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> This entry was posted in Brexit[9], Europe[10], Free markets and their discontents[11], Globalization[12], Guest Post[13], Income disparity[14], Politics[15], TPP[16], UK[17] on September 22, 2020[18] by Yves Smith[19].

This post makes a critically important point that the UK press has largely ignored, by instead treating the Government\u2019s claim that Brexit is all about the UK achieving national sovereignity. As Chris Grey has often pointed out on his Brexit Blog, the UK is too small to go it alone and will have to be affiliated with a major trade bloc. And that is the result of Dani Rodrik\u2019s trade trilemma which we highlighted in 2007. From Rodrik\u2019s website :    Sometimes simple and bold ideas help us see more clearly a complex reality that requires nuanced approaches. I have an \u201cimpossibility theorem\u201d for the global economy that is like that. It says that democracy, national sovereignty and global economic integration are mutually incompatible: we can combine any two of the three, but never have all three simultaneously and in full.    Here is what the theorem looks like in a picture:   To see why this makes sense, note that deep economic integration requires that we eliminate all transaction costs traders and financiers face in their cross-border dealings. Nation-states are a fundamental source of such transaction costs. They generate sovereign risk, create regulatory discontinuities at the border, prevent global regulation and supervision of financial intermediaries, and render a global lender of last resort a hopeless dream. The malfunctioning of the global financial system is intimately linked with these specific transaction costs\u2026..    So I maintain that any reform of the international economic system must face up to this trilemma. If we want more globalization, we must either give up some democracy or some national sovereignty. Pretending that we can have all three simultaneously leaves us in an unstable no-man\u2019s land.    As this post stresses, the Government theatrics about tossing aside its trade ties to the EU and depicting doing a series of deals with other countries, above all the US, as some sort of liberation is a con. The Tories instead are seeking to move toward a more neoliberal, less regulated economic model. Author Nick Dearden argues that this realignment will result in a greater loss of national sovereignity than remaining in the EU.    By Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now. Originally published at openDemocracy    The Johnson government is sabre-rattling once again over what it will accept in a trade deal with the EU. The details of the arguments appear technical and arcane, while the media like to portray it as a bitter dispute between a divorcing couple. Sadly, this obscures the real nature of what\u2019s at stake, which is no less than the future of Britain \u2013 what sort of country we become after Brexit, and what role we play in the world.     That\u2019s because modern trade deals set so many of the rules by which we live our lives. They have huge implications for our society and economy. Britain has a choice about the standards and rules it wants to live by. But it can\u2019t have both European and American standards. Drawing closer to one bloc pushes us further from the other. For many on the right of the Tory Party there is no contest \u2013 tilting towards the US will embed a big business, low regulation model. Signing any sort of significant deal with the EU makes this harder to achieve.    In this piece, I look at what is at stake and how we can stop Johnson\u2019s government using these parallel talks to change Britain for the worst. The article is taken from my new book, \u2018Trade Secrets: the truth about the US trade deal and how we stop it\u2019, which also includes full referencing and is available for free here .      There is a part of Britain\u2019s establishment which has always looked to the United States for leadership. For these Atlanticists, Britain\u2019s \u2018special relationship\u2019 with the USA is about much more than a shared history or culture. Rather, they look longingly at the US as a model economy in which big business can behave as it sees fit and rich individuals are free from irritating \u2018burdens\u2019 like public healthcare and redistributive taxes.    For such people, the referendum to leave the EU presented an opportunity to unleash a long\u2011cherished dream. One important vehicle to achieve this would be a trade deal with the USA. That\u2019s because trade deals today go well beyond negotiations around duties on imports. They affect how we regulate food production, how we provide public services, how we\u2019re allowed to regulate big business and foreign investment, and how much we are charged for our medicines. Particularly since the high point of corporate globalisation in the mid-1990s, trade deals have increasingly shaped what sort of society we live in, promoting a model of free market economics, together with tools to discipline governments that step away from this model.    The US trade deal is not really about importing more American products. It\u2019s about importing the American economic and regulatory model. It is not about whether we trade with the US or not but whether we capitulate to a set of policies that enshrine the power of the market and big business.    In many ways there is nothing special about the US-UK trade deal. Rather, the deal is likely to reflect all that is wrong with our global trading system, a system which has played a key role in the creation of an unsustainable, anti\u2011social economy which has handed the major decisions over our lives to a super\u2011rich elite. The political crisis we are now living through is an inevitable product of this system.    It is possible to build something better. Trade does not have to be a problem, the important thing is the rules that govern trade and, relatedly, international business and capital flows. But that requires a significantly different set of trade rules to the ones we have today. How do we create a different trade system? For us, in Britain, the defeat of a US trade deal is an essential first step, throwing a major obstacle in the path of our government\u2019s Atlanticist vision, and opening up a long-overdue debate on what sort of society we want, and the role we play in the world. From here, we can join with campaigners across the world who are fighting against similar trade rules, and begin to rebuild a movement capable of overcoming the \u2018market knows best\u2019 global economy.    Chlorine Chickens      Trade deals today are less about reducing tariffs, already at very low levels, and more about ridding the world economy of regulations that supposedly \u2018interfere\u2019 with trade. The argument runs like this: I make lightbulbs and I want to export them into another country. The lightbulbs are safe, but they don\u2019t meet the safety standards of the country I want to export to, so that country blocks imports of my lightbulbs. As an exporter, this higher safety standard looks like a trade barrier.    Modern trade deals spend a lot of effort trying to level (or \u2018harmonise\u2019) such standards. They do this by judging different regulations that achieve the same goal as \u2018equivalent\u2019. You can trade such goods because they\u2019re produced in a way which achieve the same goals, even if the means by which they do this is different.    The problem with this approach is that goods are very often not \u2018equivalent\u2019 at all, and by treating them as such, we risk undermining what are often hard\u2011fought\u2011for environmental, animal welfare and consumer protections.    Take food. US food standards are radically different to Britain\u2019s. US agriculture is dominated by massive corporations , farming on an industrial scale, with intensive use of antibiotics , hormones and steroids to promote rapid growth of animals and prevent illness in what are often extremely unpleasant and unhealthy conditions, along with an excess of chemicals, and allowances for stomach\u2011churning things to end up in the food we eat.    The US uses what it call a \u2018science\u2011based\u2019 approach, and demands it aggressively in trade talks. \u2018Science-based\u2019 is a shorthand for a system which allows business to develop and market products as it wants, and only when harm is proven can action be taken against that produce \u2013 an incredibly difficult task when big business is so well resourced. Boris Johnson and his lead trade negotiator to the EU have both endorsed the \u2018science\u2011based\u2019 approach, which means throwing caution to the wind when it comes to embracing technologies like genetic modification.    Britain currently embraces the \u2018precautionary principle\u2019, a different approach which puts the emphasis on ensuring no harm. Perhaps ironically this approach tries to build genuine scientific certainty before allowing businesses to produce and market products. In farming it translates into a method of food production where risks to health, welfare and sustainability, at least in theory, are minimised from \u2018farm\u2011to\u2011fork\u2019. The final product might or might not taste similar, and might or might not be as safe (US food poisoning rates are much higher than European rates), but the products are certainly not \u2018equivalent\u2019.    The US is forceful in its demand that US food made to different standards should be allowed onto British supermarket shelves. This would certainly mean more genetically modified foods. It would mean chlorine-washed chicken, the now\u2011famous symbol of a US trade deal. The problem is less the chlorine than what the chlorine is hiding. The washes essentially remove bacteria which has accumulated over a lifetime in which chickens can barely move, cluck or eat, never see sunlight, regularly suffer heart attacks because of their unnatural size, and are covered in sores.    Much other US meat is also produced using hormones, steroids and antibiotics to make animals grow bigger faster and to prevent them getting ill in the unnaturally close conditions in which they live. Some never see sunlight, or eat grass.    The use of many of these chemicals is bad for humans too \u2013 antibiotic overuse is threatening to make these drugs useless as bacteria develop resistance to them, which would take away one of the most crucial tools of modern medicine. US pigs regularly contain ractopamine, which makes pigs collapse, tremble, suffer liver and kidney dysfunction, and even die. No wonder over 160 countries, including Russia and China, have banned it.    Proponents of allowing these types of food into our markets often argue that it\u2019s consumer choice: \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t buy it!\u201d But the argument is disingenuous, not least because the same big business lobbies pushing to cut food standards are also arguing against our labelling standards . But there\u2019s a deeper problem too. By forcing producers into competition with those practising lower standards, they make higher standards unsustainable. Farmers would have little choice but to push for lower standards here too. It\u2019s a classic example of how modern trade rules push down standards and regulations around the world.    Food is newsworthy, but the issue is much wider. The \u2018regulatory harmonisation\u2019 agenda stretches across the economy and encompasses other disciplines on governments too, like forcing governments to prove their regulations are no more burdensome than necessary on business. This is a path already well-trodden by decision-makers in recent years, a trade deal would lock it into place. It\u2019s a subjective criteria which leaves governments at constant threat of being challenged. And it\u2019s at the heart of talks around the US trade deal.    Taxing Big Tech     In the late nineteenth century, a small group of businessmen captured the American economy, using new technologies like railways to build monopolies which brought them unprecedented levels of wealth and power. They were labelled the \u2018robber barons\u2019 and became synonymous with obscene levels of inequality and the capture of politics by private interests.    Today, a new group of corporations has risen, monopolising technologies which have become central to our society, using their power to amass unimaginable fortunes. Big Tech titans like Amazon, Google and Facebook have become more powerful and wealthy than most governments, and in coming decades their power will grow, as more of our economy becomes \u2018digital\u2019.    In order to cement their power on the global stage, these corporations are pushing for the development of new rules in trade deals. The US and Britain are among the countries pushing these rules the hardest, meaning there is certain to be a far\u2011reaching digital trade chapter in a US trade deal. And while it\u2019s true that countries need to find ways to regulate the power of Big Tech, these trade \u2018rules\u2019 are not intended to do that \u2013 in fact they achieve the very opposite.    A digital trade chapter in a US trade deal could severely constrain the ability of governments to make these technologies work in the public interest. For instance, the British government has introduced a \u2018digital services tax\u2019 to help ensure effective taxation of these corporations. The US has made clear that such a tax would be incompatible with the any trade deal , and Big Tech lobbying groups for Amazon, Google and Facebook have demanded such a tax be made impossible under the deal.    It could also lower privacy standards. Britain is currently signed up to the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), regarded as a gold standard agreement for online privacy. The US dislikes these regulations. Moreover, the many issues posed by the expansion of the online world into every area of our lives are complex. There is a need for public debate and exploration of ideas by policymakers. Trade rules must not be used to shut that debate down. For instance, politicians are now looking at ways of holding corporations to account for failing to tackle fake news online. But Trump has been clear that he wants to make such action impossible under a US deal.    There\u2019s a wider issue with these more \u2018intangible\u2019 aspects of the economy which have become so much more profitable in recent decades, and one which could fundamentally threaten the NHS. Today, many big corporations see their \u2018intellectual property\u2019 as one of their most important assets. They use it to build monopoly power and to shift (and thereby minimise) their tax responsibilities around the world.    Copyright, trademarks and patents became a part of trade rules in 1995 with the passing at the WTO of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). During the 1990s, at the height of the HIV epidemic, countries were prevented from rolling out HIV medication because it was covered by these rules, which kept prices of key medicines very high. Campaigners fought for exemptions, which allowed countries to override the rules in certain circumstances. However, Big Pharma has fought back, persuading western governments, especially the US, to close these exemptions in new trade deals.    In a US-UK deal, the focus on Big Pharma\u2019s wrath will be NICE \u2013 the regulator that sets guidelines for which medicines are cost effective for the NHS to provide. Given the NHS\u2019s size, this has a powerful influence how much US pharmaceutical firms can get away with charging not just the UK, but other countries that take the UK as their source of \u2018reference pricing\u2019. Donald Trump has vowed to make pharmaceutical pricing a \u201ctop priority\u201d in trade. US drug prices are eye\u2011watering, averaging more than four times the price paid in the UK. Such large increases in prices under a US trade deal would pose an existential threat to the NHS \u2013 driving costs for new drugs well beyond the health system\u2019s ability to afford them.    Corporate Courts     In the days leading up to Christmas 2001, Argentina was engulfed by one of the worst crises in its history. A decade of economic liberalisation had seen poverty soar. Large parts of Argentina\u2019s public sector had been privatised on terms which were great for international corporations, but terrible for the people relying on the services. As a debt crisis grew, protests toppled the government. In less than two weeks Argentina went through five presidents, defaulted on its debt and then devalued its currency to put the country on a long path to recovery.    Part of this recovery involved protecting Argentinians\u2019 access to basic services. The government froze the price of water and energy. But big business howled in protest that this broke their privatisation contracts. They claimed they\u2019d been treated unfairly, and sued Argentina in a \u2018corporate court\u2019 made possible under the terms of investment treaties the country had signed.    Over fifty cases were lodged, claiming an astronomical $80 billion from the government. British company Anglian Water was a party to one of the claims. Having been part of a consortium that took over the Buenos Aires water system \u2013 and despite claims of atrocious service, lack of investment and a rise in waterborne diseases \u2013 Anglian and partners claimed the price freeze breached their \u2018rights\u2019. Argentina countered that the rights of its citizens should surely be the paramount concern, but the tribunal decided human rights should not override investor rights and found in favour of Anglian.    What does this have to do with a US trade deal? Well, the same mechanism that saw Argentina hauled over the coals by big business is likely to be included in the deal, leaving governments exposed to cases brought by US\u2011based multinationals in secret courts.    Investor\u2011State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) \u2013 the formal name for these \u2018corporate courts\u2019 \u2013 was invented back in the 1950s, when it started to be inserted in investment deals, reflecting western countries\u2019 suspicion of how their corporations would be treated in newly independent countries in the global south. But it\u2019s really in the last 20 years that they have become a major problem.    Corporate courts allow foreign investors to sue governments in special tribunals when they believe their \u2018rights\u2019 have been infringed. The basis for such cases has been expanded to an almost ludicrous degree by City law firms. A foreign investor today might claim pretty much any government action that damages their future profits is \u2018unfair\u2019 or \u2018expropriation\u2019, even though the rest of us might regard the measure as a reasonable response to the harm a corporation is causing. Putting cigarettes in plain packaging, forcing toxic mines to put better environmental standards in place, or the controlling of water prices might well damage corporate profits, but the idea that they have infringed some fundamental right directly threatens a government\u2019s ability to enact regulation. Yet these are all real ISDS cases.    Britain already has many ISDS agreements with countries around the world, but while these have been a huge problem for those countries, for the most part Britain is the more powerful partner. Establishing an ISDS agreement with the US would put the boot on the other foot: it would open Britain up to challenge by tens of thousands of US\u2011based multinationals.    Action on climate change would be particularly difficult. Currently the Dutch government is facing an ISDS case by energy company Uniper, which runs power plants in the country. Uniper is unhappy at the policy of banning coal\u2011based power generation by 2030. What\u2019s interesting is that Uniper\u2019s plant is fairly new, so the company can hardly claim it wasn\u2019t aware of the growing movement to phase out coal power. In fact, Uniper\u2019s strategy appears to be to carry on as usual and claim compensation from governments when the inevitable phase\u2011outs happen. ISDS is becoming a business model in itself \u2013 removing pressure for corporations to take environmental measures.    Democracy and Resistance      How do we defeat this frightening deal? Despite a heroic fight to secure greater power over trade deals on the part of many MPs, the government has failed to transfer the powers of democratic oversight developed within the EU to Britain. MPs do not have a right to vote or debate the government\u2019s trade objectives, they don\u2019t have a right to effectively scrutinise the government, and they are not guaranteed a debate or vote once the trade bill is complete. Even if they are granted a vote, they cannot stop the trade deal coming into effect.    But we shouldn\u2019t despair. Most trade deals which have been defeated \u2013 and there are plenty \u2013 have been defeated on the streets, by campaigners undaunted by the odds they were up against. From the defeat of TTIP, and its forerunner the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, to the victory over the Free Trade Area of the Americas and removal of water sector liberalisation from WTO rules, there is much to draw lessons from.    A wide coalition has already been formed to oppose the US deal. TTIP activists have been joined by new allies. On the day he was made secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, George Eustice was booed by farmers when he mentioned the US trade deal. Even pro\u2011government newspapers like the Mail on Sunday are running regular columns on the problems of a US trade deal.    This can reach beyond the \u2018Brexit divide\u2019. True, the politicians who led the Leave campaign want to use Brexit to deregulate and liberalise the British economy, but many of their voters want something entirely different. A recent survey shows high levels of support among young Leave voters in the north of England for environmental and animal welfare regulation.    There is every reason to hope that the US deal can be defeated if we build a sufficiently large and diverse movement. By doing so, we will not only prevent the government signing a terrible deal, but will throw a spanner into the works of their attempts to push Britain down the path of further deregulation and liberalisation.

It is now time to say clearly and unequivocally that these are no longer allegations-they are observable facts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A case in point being <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jERxPhrY_18\">a recent discussion with Peter Hitchens on my YouTube show</url>, TRIGGERnometry, in which he criticised the lockdown. Unlike a recent       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jERxPhrY_18\">interview with Professor Karol Sikora on the website UnHerd</url>, which was simply deleted by YouTube before being reinstated amid public outcry, the tech giant's response to our video was far more insidious.</p><p>Instead of deleting it and allowing us the right of appeal, they simply \"hid\" the interview from searches on YouTube and Google. Technically, the interview is still there - you just can't find it. While many will be surprised and outraged by this blatant interference in our ability to discuss the most important issue of our lifetimes, the reason our society finds itself muzzled is that we have ignored Big Tech bias and censorship for far too long.</p><p>We need not mention that the Twitter team which makes decisions about what constitutes fake news is headed by a man who publicly described Donald Trump as a \"racist tangerine\" and reacted to the 2016 election result by tweeting \"ACTUAL NAZIS IN THE WHITE HOUSE'\". We no longer have to bring up the leaked video which showed Google employees in tears following Trump's election, with company CFO Ruth Porat committing to \"use the great strength, resources and reach we have to continue to advance important values\" in response.</p><p>This sort of circumstantial evidence is no longer necessary because after the events of recent days Big Tech's editorialising and double standards are in plain sight. Consider that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jERxPhrY_18\">Twitter attached fact-checking warnings to Donald Trump's recent tweet</url> about mail voting fraud. Whatever your views of the President or his claims, it is not the job of a neutral platform to fact-check our politicians - we have the free press for that. Twitter cannot pretend to be an impartial forum while meddling in our democracy.</p><p>This is a crucial issue because of the exemptions Big Tech companies enjoy under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which explicitly prevent them from being treated as a publisher and therefore liable for content posted on their platforms. In response, President Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at revising these exemptions and investigating allegations of bias and censorship.</p><p>Taking a leaf out of Trump's book, the reaction from Twitter seems to have been to double down: when the President threatened to bring in the military to deal with riots in Minneapolis following the horrific death of George Floyd at the hands of police officers, the company flagged his comment as 'glorification of violence' and prevented the messaged from being shared. In the meantime, numerous tweets which instructed rioters how to avoid being caught and celebrated the large-scale destruction of property and looting were shared millions of times without impediment.</p><p>YouTube has also engaged in censorship on an industrial scale over the Covid-19 pandemic. It has proceeded to delete any dissenting opinions about the disease or our response which contradict the recommendations made by the World Health Organisation. This includes deleting discussions and interviews with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jERxPhrY_18\">Michael Levitt, Professor of Structural Biology at Stanford</url> and winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize for Chemistry, Knutt Wikowski, former Head of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Research Design at Rockefeller University, Drs. Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi and many others. Karol Sikora, too, is a former director of the WHO Cancer Programme and Dean of Medicine at the University of Buckingham</p><p>Some of these were reinstated following heavy criticism, others remain banned. While these are astonishing developments, I believe they are the opening salvos in a conflict over the future of our political discourse that some have been predicting for some time. Six months ago, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jERxPhrY_18\">I wrote about YouTube taking down an interview</url> on my YouTube show in which women's rights campaigner Posie Parker claimed that \"trans women are not women\". The company called this \"hate speech which promotes or encourages violence\" and deleted the video, later reinstating it due to a public outcry.</p><p>As I said then, \"open communication about difficult subjects is the only way to resolve the major issues facing our societies today. Big tech companies must embrace this reality or face the consequences.\"</p><p>Tech companies cannot pretend to be neutral forums and enjoy the benefits that brings while banning, hiding and undermining content and opinions they don't like. Whether the solution comes in the form of government regulation or the emergence of viable alternative platforms that offer genuine neutrality, the battle for online freedom is fully underway and those of us who believe in free expression are outflanked and outnumbered by T-shirt wearing billionaires who want to protect us from wrongthink. We must fight back while we still can.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-63321377</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:601R-M6Y1-JCJY-G4BJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"859\"/><timeReceived>6:30 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 1, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

We can't turn back time, but we have to wonder: what if governments had put the brakes on the successive acquisitions of these companies, to better manage their unbridled growth? Moreover, what if the VC cowboys of the 1990s had not only required significant monetary returns for their seed funding, but also significant social returns?</p><p>That horse has bolted, but there are new tech thoroughbreds lining up at the barriers, and seeking investor support, every day. This represents important opportunities now to ensure technology is harnessed for good.</p><p>There is no question the internet has brought immense benefits to the way we socialise, play and work - including in financial markets, where the productivity gains have continued to be prodigious. But along with these economic benefits have come new forms of harm. As the world's first dedicated online safety regulator, eSafety sees all too much of the dark side of the astonishing rise of the internet, including many forms of abuse and bullying, as well as online sexual exploitation of children and the spread of abhorrent violent material.</p><p>What strikes me most - after three years heading eSafety, and 25 years before that in the tech industry - is how preventable many of these harms would be, if only online platforms and services were safe to use at the point of release, and did not inadvertently harm their users.</p><p>This is why we have been championing \"safety by design,\" a policy initiative that puts responsibility for user-safety back onto technology companies themselves. Just as auto manufacturers install seatbelts and airbags into cars, I believe that technology companies should be embedding safety protections into their design, development and deployment processes.</p><p>Just as the VC pioneers of the late 20th century spurred on the growth of the big tech behemoths, the investment and financial sector has an important role to play here today. As funders of new technology ventures, and also as institutions that deploy technology for their own banking and financial services, the sector could serve as an important lever in ensuring that early-stage technology companies and their founders are putting safety and ethical considerations at the heart of their design processes. </p><p>In the early stages of a new online platform or product, members of the investment and venture capital community are sometimes the \"grown-ups in the room\" and stand the best chance of quelling, or at least moderating, an outbreak of irrational exuberance.</p><p>Bolting on retroactive safety fixes after the reputational, revenue or regulatory risks manifest themselves has proven time and again to be more costly and complex than engineering out potential misuse at the outset.</p><p>Therefore, clear evidence that a potential start-up has incorporated safety into its design should be the first principle for responsible technology investment followed by VC firms, financial institutions, and institutional investors such as superannuation funds. Just a few of the questions that should be asked: </p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Does the product provide users with the right tools and features to allow them to manage their safety?</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Does it have discoverable and intuitive mechanisms for the reporting of harm?</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Are their moderation practices already in place to manage behaviour on the platform or service?</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Is there a team, or responsible individual, with safety defined as a key part of their role?</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Safety by design provides a clear pathway and easy set of standards to help support the sector's responsible investment and business decisions. At eSafety we are developing a framework of resources, including a set of dynamic and interactive assessment tools for early-stage technology companies, and mid- to top- tier companies. This includes a comprehensive investment toolkit for funders of these companies.</p><p>We want to make it as easy as possible for companies to adopt and implement safety by design, and for potential investors to have visibility on whether they are doing so.</p><p>These are incredible technologies that transform the way we live. Those who take on the initial risk of investing in them have a key role to play in ensuring they make our lives better, rather than exposing us and our children to toxicity and harm.</p><p>\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Julie Inman Grant is eSafety Commissioner for Australia</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

However, the digital revolution is not all good. Most of us are much more distracted than we used to be. Our ability to focus on a task is surely diminished if we are constantly checking our smartphones.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whole generations are growing up addicted to digital media - constantly exposed to superficial images, inconsequential news, gossip and so forth, much of it irrelevant to our lives, and probably, at some level, harmful. Various research has shown that millennials are more anxious, depressed and even more lonely than previous generations, probably because they spend too much time online.</p><p>I fear that information overload and too much choice may almost be worse than the world before the web arrived. I grew up having to undertake school and undergraduate research in libraries using books and journals. Such resources were rationed and not always available. However, in certain respects, scarcity of information - or, at least, limited access - had advantages. Perhaps it made us more thoughtful, and able to concentrate better.</p><p>Attention spans have generally reduced, be it our willingness to read a book from cover to cover, listen to a whole speech or lecture, write a proper letter or memorise a poem. People are naturally lazy and enjoy convenience, so will always avoid intellectual effort if possible. It is good to test the brain, just as physical exercise is good for the musculature, but clever software helps to undermine willpower.</p><p>Of course, the online universe can be a tremendous tool for learning. Teachers can reach countless students and deliver academic courses at zero cost once the material is prepared. However, it is hard to believe that clips such as the video memes from YouTube, which make up the bulk of shared online content, are really imparting wisdom across the globe. Unfortunately, Gresham's law applies to web traffic - the lowest common denominator wins.</p><p>As Kingsley Amis wrote in 1960 about university expansion: \"More will mean worse.\" We all have limited time and brain power, and our capacity to absorb the avalanche of data is constantly overwhelmed. This can interfere with productivity, and leave us feeling indecisive and despairing, busy fools trying to sort through the dross.</p><p>Our smartphones can be cameras, gaming consoles, health trackers, maps, shopping tools and more. This versatility is brilliant in a practical sense - mobiles feel an essential accessory for modern life. However, they cannot begin to replace genuine human interaction, or authentic experiences. Tourists now seem more intent on taking photos of the place they're visiting than actually enjoying the moment of being in a historic location. It seems to me they have completely lost the point of travel.</p><p>Addiction to smartphones can damage personal and professional relationships. Having a huge virtual network of connections cons you into thinking that these are real friends and genuine contacts. Excessive screen time makes us more solitary, not more social. Deep friendships and real partnerships are what matter - for one's happiness and probably one's career, too.</p><p>Most success comes from intensive deliberation - a single-minded approach. Original thought and genuine relationships are more likely to flourish away from the digital clutter and noise. Business and personal meetings are best with no mobile devices or laptops and, instead, maximum engagement with the people in the room.</p><p>I could not conduct my work without digital communications, yet the downsides are real, from cyber-crime to fake news, from job losses in disrupted industries to privacy threats, from digital monopolies to smartphone addiction.</p><p>Society isn't going to dump digital technology and revert to more traditional communication and entertainment habits, but we should try to restrict our screen exposure and seek to better understand its insidious influence.</p><p>Big tech companies must become significantly more responsible, otherwise they will face onerous regulation and harsher taxation. Unquestioning adoption of every new device and app is the road to madness.</p><p>Contentment is about selection, simplicity and priorities. I'm not sure the online jungle offers those.</p><p>Luke Johnson is chairman of Risk Capital Partners and the Institute of Cancer Research. <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:luke@riskcapitalpartners.co.uk\">luke@riskcapitalpartners.co.uk</email> @LukeJohnsonRCP</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-152720750</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X0R-7YV1-JCBW-N505-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"746\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 8, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N4494111M</classCode><className>INTERNET RETAILING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DJLY</classCode><className>SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009HPZ</classCode><className>STUDENTS &amp;

In many regards, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has become a \"captured agency\" as a result of decisions made decades ago -- with the full blessing of both the White House and Congress -- to pretty much let health care providers determine how -- and how much -- they will be paid.<br/><br/>A previous investigation by the Center revealed how in the 1990s CMS effectively turned over many of its payment policy decisions to an obscure committee of the AMA, despite the obvious conflict of interest. In doing so, CMS officials fell for the argument that no one knows better how to set rules that will affect special interests than representatives of those same special interests. I have seen this play out in the same way regarding insurance company regulation. Many state insurance commissioners come straight from the insurance companies they are charged with regulating. <br/><br/>This week's series, \"Cracking the Codes,\" makes clear some of the consequences of this state of affairs. Another sort of billing scale for doctors, involving so-called Evaluation and Management codes, was unveiled two decades ago as part of a secretive deal between Medicare officials and the AMA. The doctors' group wanted Medicare to reimburse doctors for the \"thinking part\" of medicine, or their skill in diagnosing and treating illness, as well as the time required. Medicare administrators believed the new system would reduce billing abuses and save taxpayers cash by setting measurable standards that physicians would follow. <br/><br/>The Center's review of a decade's worth of data shows that those coding standards have been subject to widespread abuse and manipulation to make doctors more money. And it is not that lawmakers and regulators have been in the dark about this. Year after year, audit after audit, government oversight officials have found blatant stealing from the treasury and yet CMS has done nothing about it -- other than to make excuses.<br/><br/>Many of the abuses appear to involve a practice known as \"upcoding,\" in which health care providers use codes with higher levels of reimbursement than is appropriate for the care they really provided to patients. The Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services recognizes that upcoding is a chronic and costly problem. But it has largely done nothing either, primarily because it is under-resourced to combat fraud and seems to believe that upcoding is not as costly as other abuses, particularly in the area of medical durable equipment.<br/><br/>The government is also not doing anywhere close to an adequate job of monitoring the use of electronic health records (EHRs), even though a big chunk of money from the economic stimulus bill -- some $30 billion -- is being doled out to help doctors and hospitals pay for the technology to use EHRs. The government, mainly the Office of National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, never imposed any controls over the IT industry as technology companies scrambled to rake in billions of dollars from taxpayers.<br/><br/>As the Center's series points out, many experts have argued that the lack of any fraud controls in EHR software would likely spawn a new wave of billing fraud and abuse. But those critics have been shouted down by a chorus of health IT doctors and geeks, big tech companies and others who argued, not without some justification, that EHRs are needed to get medicine into the modern age.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that, left to their own devices and without adequate oversight, doctors and hospitals can and do charge more for less. Much has been made of the argument that patients are largely to blame for skyrocketing health care costs because of their unhealthy lifestyles and overuse of medical services. The Center's investigation shows how doctors and hospitals are also to blame by cranking up their billing without increasing care.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AOLB10331013485150581322136900</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AOLB-5176</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:56N5-T921-F03R-N1B6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"819\"/><timeReceived>7:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politics Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>September 24, 2012 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>CENTERS FOR MEDICARE &amp;

But is each side prepared for the other's unconventional diplomacy? I'm joined by the former U.S. nuclear negotiator on North Korea and Iran, Wendy Sherman.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, my conversation with the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, on his rocky relationship with President Trump, the problem with populism and why he's come to America with a word of warning for big tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening, everyone. Welcome to the program. I'm Christiane Amanpour in New York. Still no word from North Korea about the potentially historic meeting between Kim Jong-un and President Trump. Three days after Trump accepted Kim's invitation which came through South Korean officials.</p><p>Seoul says Pyongyang's radio silence probably means it's approaching this matter with caution. But if the summit actually does happen by the end of May, North Korea is bound to be looking closely at whether Mr. Trump abandons the Iran nuclear deal, which he calls a disaster as a way to test the waters before it jumps into any kind of nuclear talks.</p><p>I've been speaking to someone who's negotiated on both issues. Wendy Sherman, the lead U.S. negotiator on the Iran deal for President Obama and the special North Korea advisor under the Clinton administration, and she joined me from London.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Wendy Sherman, welcome to the program.</p><p>WENDY SHERMAN, FORMER SPECIAL ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT CLINTON ON NORTH KOREA: Great to be here. Thank you, Christiane.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, from a purely negotiating and negotiators point of view, with your experience in both North Korea and Iran on these issues, what are the pros and cons, the possible pitfalls or the opportunities of a presidential meeting even before negotiations are underway?</p><p>SHERMAN: Well, it's actually quite extraordinary, as you know, in the annals of diplomacy. Nonetheless, I'm glad that we're getting into talks. Even if we start off with the meeting and not formal negotiations because talk is certainly better than war and we need to give diplomacy a chance where it should be the last resort, not the first.</p><p>I think the president has to be extraordinarily well prepared. I know he likes to shoot from the hip and has tremendous confidence in his ability does Kim Jong-un, and if there was ever a symmetry between leaders it is here. Not that the President Trump is an autocratic dictator in the way that Kim Jong-un is, he is president of a democracy.</p><p>But these are two men who believe that their choices, their decisions are the only things that matter, but all of that said, this is a very, very complicated, very difficult negotiation, much more difficult than the Iran negotiation because North Korea has nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them. So, this is a very uphill climb.</p><p>AMANPOUR: We wish Iran didn't and I will come to the whole Iran, North Korea, symmetry, and President Trump's disdain of the Iran nuclear deal in a moment, but first, I want to pick up on what you just said that the president has to be very well prepared.</p><p>So, a couple questions on that, there is no US ambassador to South Korea. The main State Department North Korea advisor has retired, resigned. There doesn't seem to be the officialdom the infrastructure of the key advisors around the president.</p><p>They have obviously gone through the national security review and North Korea featured at the top of that. Do you think that he will be well enough prepared by the time he goes into a meeting if it should happen?</p><p>SHERMAN: Well, it worried me to hear that he wanted to do it as soon as possible and that the South Koreans and those around him pushed him to at least after the South Korean-North Korean Summit, which pushes this to May because you've got to put a team together.</p><p>Whatever comes out of this meeting for good or for ill, someone's going to need to follow up. The president will not be able to do it all. This is a highly technical negotiation usually before you start these things to figure out where you want to go.</p><p>You might even draft a kind of agreement you would hope you get to at the end just to give you a sense of all of the elements that have to be on the table. All of the things you have to think about.</p><p>It also involves a lot of pre-consultation because it's not just our interests that are at stake. Of course, that's what the president is most and should be most concerned about, but we have allies with South Korea, with Japan.</p><p>We certainly want China to be in the mix. There Russia had interest they want to build a gas pipeline through North Korean to the South. So, we have to not only have a range of consultations but understand everybody's interest because this negotiation is about denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.</p><p>[15:05:07] But it is also about the future of Asia and Northeast Asia and who is going to decide what that's going to be.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Should we at this moment be taking any warning signals or be cautious that North Korea itself has as yet not confirmed that it has offered this presidential meeting or at least it's not confirmed it publicly.</p><p>SHERMAN: Yes, I think that is of concern. I think we certainly need to be wary. I don't know whether the message that the South Koreans conveyed was in writing. I believe that it was, which certainly helps, but we would want to hear from North Korea and I would hope that there would be a direct channel between North Korea and the United States as the logistics and the substance and the agenda of this meeting is put together.</p><p>I appreciate our South Korean colleagues work in this regard. It's critical that we be shoulder to shoulder with South Korea, but we need a direct line of communication as well.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Now, you said, the endgame must be denuclearization, but I put it to you that first and foremost, the North Koreans, as you mentioned, are way ahead of Iran which doesn't have nuclear weapons. North Korea has anyway, according to the community of 20 to 60 warheads.</p><p>As we've scene is perfecting the delivery mechanism, the ballistic missile technology. Is North Korea really going to denuclearize and I'd like to play for you these two portions of interviews that I've done with experts on this precise question.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEFFREY LEWIS, MIDDLEBURY INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES AT MONTERY: What's going to have to happen is were going to have to learn to live with this. Just as we learn to live with China having your weapons that could target the United States and the Soviet Union before that. That's a very unusual thing. You know, we haven't gone through this in decades and so it's a very jolting and bracing thing, particularly in Washington, D.C. for people to come to grips with it.</p><p>MICHAEL HAYDEN, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: Let me give you what I think is a truth very, a very, very sad truth. The truth nonetheless, it is my judgment that it would be more dangerous to prevent North Korea from getting to that state that it would be for us to try to cope with the North Korea in that state.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, Wendy Sherman, you've heard what these experts are saying. What is the best that the United States can expect total denuclearization really?</p><p>SHERMAN: Well. I certainly think denuclearization should stay as the objective because we don't want to encourage other countries to take the nuclear weapons path. That said, certainly, stabilizing the situation, making sure it doesn't go further, containment of this situation having an open channel to manage what's going on, hopefully getting the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency back into North Korea.</p><p>All of these things are steps along the way and I agree with your experts to the extent that full denuclearization is certainly a long ways off, but we need to get going, because ultimately we all hope there is a world without nuclear weapons including ours and Russia's.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I want to ask you about what you might think lies behind the North Korean objective or its movies, reach out right now. You've been there. You've been a special advisor on North Korea.</p><p>You've been with Madeleine Albright as secretary of state in that last time just before the Clinton administration ended to try to push forward on these deals that would make the whole peninsula, the United States, and everyone safer.</p><p>What is it like negotiating with them? What do they really want? What is their mindset? We asked because we don't really know what goes on inside the hermit kingdom.</p><p>SHERMAN: It's hard to fathom from time to time, but I do believe that Kim Jong un is a rational actor within his paradigm. I do believe that he is not in any rush to denuclearize even though he may say OK, we can talk about that, but let's see how we go from here to there.</p><p>I think his objectives are several. One, he is in the driver seat at the moment. He has been able to get the present. The United States most powerful leader in the world to sit in the same room with him as if he is in equal.</p><p>So, we've already achieved a major objective from his perspective. He ultimately wants reunified the careers, but under North Korean leadership, which is certainly not something the United States is going to agree to, I certainly hope not, and he wants to hold on to his nuclear weapons because he does not trust the United States.</p><p>He doesn't believe there's any guarantee for his security and his regime security and he's well aware that there are many people in the United States that are pushing for regime change and there are even hints that the president may bring out in and outside envoy, and one who believes in regime change.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Who might that be? I assumed that you know who that might be?</p><p>SHERMAN: Well, I think the word that has been reported in the press is there some consideration of having John Bolton come in in that envoy. I think that would be quite an unusual and quite a difficult circumstance.</p><p>[15:10:09] AMANPOUR: Well, many people of your -- people who have actually sat down and had these negotiations may be equally worried. I wonder if you can speak then to the worry about in your community, around Europe and elsewhere.</p><p>The President Trump's disdain and also John Bolton's disdain for the Iran nuclear deal. I have been talking to many world leaders, whether it's Emmanuel Michael, France, European needed others, not to mention Americans, who believe that if the president pulls out and discards the Iran nuclear deal.</p><p>There is absolutely no way North Korea would have any incentive to enter negotiations or to believe a deal that was ever offered and done by the United States.</p><p>SHERMAN: Well, I agree with that assessment. However, having a bit of appreciation for how President Trump operates, having watched him over the election in this last year, I think he may believe that if he says to North Korea, I pulled out of this deal because I'm going to negotiate the kinds of deal that we really need that he may indeed do that.</p><p>I think that would be disastrous and it would make sense for him because then he would have to nuclear crises at the same time. It's difficult enough to manage one. It would be nearly impossible to manage two.</p><p>AMANPOUR: You know, many people, including yourself, many of the pundits on television have questioned President Trump's bluster towards North Korea. All the words that have been hurled around by Twitter in speeches at the U.N. podium and elsewhere.</p><p>Likewise, Kim Jong-un's responses, very blustery, very difficult, and all very scary frankly, but do you think that this tone has actually led to where we are right now, this potential diplomatic opening?</p><p>And do you think President Trump backing the South Koreans sort of, you know, Winter Olympic diplomacy, their desire to pursue diplomacy has helped.</p><p>SHERMAN: I think there's no doubt that the pressure campaign which was begun under President Obama and has continued and accelerated under the Trump administration, particularly if the United Nations has helped. I think our military posturing to a point has helped.</p><p>I'm not sure about the rhetoric on all sides as being helpful, but all of this should be in service of diplomacy. You always need a credible threat of force in service of diplomacy. A pressure campaign is important, but none of that matters.</p><p>If you end up as the only option being war because you haven't really given diplomacy a chance. I hope that the president can put together the team that's necessary. I hope he puts in the persistent effort that will be needed here.</p><p>He's going to have to have patience which isn't his strong suit, because this is going to take a lot of time, as I said it's highly technical. The Iran agreement was 154 pages long. The most extensive verification and monitoring system ever put in place in such a situation.</p><p>And that's where we know where the enrichment was going, the plutonium production was going on. We don't know where everything is in North Korea. The IAEA has not been inside of North Korea for some time. So, this is a very daunting undertaking.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And there is another crucial aspect of this and that is that in certain courses in the United States, including with the president, they appear to believe that negotiation and compromise is a sign of weakness.</p><p>That it has to be all. It has to be a zero-sum game. That the United States has to come out with all the chips. What is the reality and are people in the U.S., important people, who have to sign off and agreed to these negotiations, going to be acclimatized to the fact that it's a give- and-take situation?</p><p>SHERMAN: Well, this is I think the greatest risk here, Christiane, which is that the president and his team, give this an effort, but because they don't get every single thing that they want that they say it's hopeless and really create the prerequisite for war, the pretense of war.</p><p>And that I think is the most dangerous road that we are on. It is not that we should not achieve the objectives that will protect our national security and the national security of our allies and partners, we absolutely should, and that should be the common ground on which we all work.</p><p>But between that and an agreement, there are lots of choices that there have to be made, and if the president feels that they all have to go the way the United States wants them to go, we probably won't get to an agreement and we probably will find ourselves at war.</p><p>AMANPOUR: It's terrifying.</p><p>SHERMAN: It is terrifying.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Wendy Sherman, let us hope that this leads in the right direction. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>SHERMAN: Thank you, Christiane.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, invaluable insights on the way to this summit between the two presidents, should it happen now.</p><p>[15:15:12] Now, one of President Trump's most frequent target isn't here in America but thousands of miles away in London where he's the mayor. Sadiq Khan became the first Muslim mayor of a Western capital in 2016. It was a rare break from the politics of fear in that year when Britain voted to leave the European Union and America elected Trump as president.</p><p>Khan is now in America pushing his progressive vision while at the same time, Donald Trump's erstwhile (inaudible) Steven Bannon is actually touring Europe to champion right-wing nativism. I caught up with Sadiq Khan in Austin, Texas, where he told the techy South by South West Conference that Silicon values fueling division and the politicians have failed to stop it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Mayor Khan, welcome to the program from Austin.</p><p>SADIQ KHAN, LONDON MAYOR: Good to be with you, Christiane.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, you are there at this very innovative tech conference and your speech is taking on the tech giants in no uncertain terms. Tell me what you mean precisely on what you're calling for.</p><p>KHAN: The point I'm making to people here in Austin is actually, you know what, social media, the tech revolution has been a source of massive benefits. We can keep in touch with our loved ones. We can access the information. We can make new friends and it's wonderful.</p><p>But actually, I think politicians and policymakers have taken the ire of the bull when it comes to making sure our regulation evolves with the tech revolution. The point I make today is, you know, if they don't act responsibly and take action, then don't be surprised if this pressure on politicians to regulate like Germany has done.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, let me ask you then because you have obviously supported the transport for London campaign against Uber in your city and you are a mayor who believes in pragmatic action rather than ideological warfare. How do you spread the needle between trying to restrict and ban certain aspects of a tech giant like Uber and actually being, as you declare yourself, the home for tech innovation and all the rest of it for London?</p><p>KHAN: Well, you raise a very important point and I want to challenge the premise in your question. The question of wanting to ban Uber for the sake of banning Uber is actually there are rules in relation to operation in London. In fact, you've got an app to provide services and change in fact the regulations apply to you.</p><p>It doesn't matter how many lawyers you employ, PR experts that you employ, the rules ae there for everyone to abide by and the good news is the (inaudible) global CEO of Uber recognizes this, unlike his predecessor, who wants to play by the rules of the game and is engaging with crossbow for London.</p><p>So, that shows an example of, you know, regulation when it's enforced properly leading to a race the bottom in relation to security and safety concerns, but actually (inaudible) has been improved.</p><p>I think cities and mayors are uniquely placed to take advantage of the tech revolution making sure that we design systems that can complement with the tech revolution with consumers and the citizens.</p><p>In London, we have a program called skills for Londoners twinned with a digital tech program to skill up Londoners to have these jobs that are being created by the tech sector. That's why I want London to be a byword for small cities.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I'm talking to from the United States where cities, mayors, and even states and governors are trying to enact policies and perhaps doesn't get looked at or doesn't get enacted on a federal level.</p><p>But I want to ask you because your profile has now been raised to a global level, in part due to the constant Twitter warfare between yourself and the president of the United States, Donald Trump. How do you deal with that and at the same time, how do you deal with the lift that's given you to put forth your politics and policies on a global stage?</p><p>KHAN: I'm a reluctant participant and this Twitter fisticuffs (inaudible) speaking with the president of the great (inaudible) of the United States of America, and look, I'm not going to apologize for standing up to the values that Londoners have. We are the most diverse city in the world.</p><p>More than (inaudible) language is spoken in my city. I think diversity is a strength, but I say this the context is that we London, we my country love America. We love Americans. We, you know, enjoy your films, your music, your culture, your fashion, there's CNN.</p><p>But, you know, one of the advantages of having a best friend is not simply to stand shoulder to shoulder at times diversity and to be an ally, but when your best friend who is very different from an acquaintance, or a friend you've hardly ever see, those things you disagree with, you got to call them out and I won't apologize for calling out things that our best friend says or tweets.</p><p>[15:20:12] AMANPOUR: Well, your best friend, the president of the United States, his now departed chief advisor, Steve Bannon is in Europe right now taking this very nativist nationalist populist message around to France, to Italy and elsewhere, and this is what he said, I'm going to play you a little bit of what he said this weekend, talking at a La Pen rally in France.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST: Let them call you racist. Let them call you xenophobes. Let them call you nativists. Wear it as a badge of honor.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Wear it as a badge of honor, Mr. Mayor, what do you say to that?</p><p>KHAN: The idea of dividing communities, protectionism, seeking to try to wedge between nation states in Europe is the long-term solution is ridiculous. I think what we are going to be careful of is people like this man seeking to drive communities in Europe like he's clearly done in parts of America as well.</p><p>And those of us who are progressives, proud social Democrats, have got to think carefully about addressing the fears people have. One of the roles I think that politicians have failed to do in the recent past and I say it's a non-patronizing way is to be teachers, to be educators, to explain the complex challenges we face, and to realize we've got to be cool, calm, and collected in addressing the concerns of people.</p><p>There are no short cuts, gimmicks to some of role challenges that people face in France. We saw the elections a couple weeks ago in my country and the U.S.A., dare I say it.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I just wonder how you explained, for instance, your own victory amid a very ugly campaign in Britain when you were running for mayor where your conservative opponent sort of insinuated that you backed extremists and was trying to sort of, you know, divide and conquer there.</p><p>And we also saw in France, Le Pen, tried to say the same thing about Emmanuel Macron and yet he also won with a centrist globalist agenda. So how -- what is your advice to fighting political battles from the center?</p><p>KHAN: The campaign that I saw in 2016 is one where we've been optimistic, positive, but also has been honest with the electorate. I'd rather under promise and over deliver. But also, I was unapologetic and proud of who I am as a Muslim. I'm of Asian origin. I'm a Londoner. I'm an Englishman. I'm British. I'm European. I'm a husband. I'm a father. That's who I am.</p><p>(Inaudible) campaign, but also explaining to fix the housing crisis is a marathon not a sprint as taken as a result of successive governments playing down Londoners. (Inaudible) of immigrants through affordable homes in London to make sure that we got a decent public transport system.</p><p>We got to invest in a public transport. It's not (inaudible) of foreigners coming to London. The public transport is overfull in the London. But, you know, I say this in a respectful way to people who vote in countries all around the world, analyze, examine, look at carefully on what you are being sold by the salesman or saleswoman from that critical policy. Be careful on short term fixes. It's too good to be true and this is not true.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I wonder whether you can comment on some of the promises that were made by the Brexiteers. You obviously voted to remain part of the E.U., but they told British people that they would be heading for the (inaudible) plans and meantime, we see the United States potentially slapping steel tariffs on E.U. and on Britain.</p><p>We see already a word that that air roots for airlines, Britain will be put to the back of the queue for favorable airline routes. What do you have to say that and also a major bank, UBS, talking about moving several hundred employees out?</p><p>KHAN: Our ability as country of 65 million to do a good deal with these big nation states is made very, very hard because why would they bend over backwards to have low tariff deals with us. If we are member of a club, the European Union, our abilities to a deal is strengthened and my worry is the British voters who voted to leave the European Union have been the phrase we use is soda pop.</p><p>They'd been given as promised that simply can't be met. The promise that was made by the Brexiteers campaign was once we -- the vote was taken, we would benefit from 350 million pounds each week invested in the NHS.</p><p>If you're made the offer, you'd a fool to turn it down. Lo and behold, we voted to leave the European Union. You're not seeing this investment in the NHS. This is what turns people to be cynical and saying all politicians are the same.</p><p>[15:25:02] You know what? I'm going to give up on politics, not to vote in elections, and that's why you showed a clip off Mr. Berman in France. It's interesting the election results in Italy in the last two weeks. What is the case that the amount of milk and honey doesn't arise in Italy in the next few weeks.</p><p>And those very people who voted the way they did will say, hold on a second, refer to the way we did what's left us, why we have responsibilities, Democrats will be, to explain to people, to educate people about some of the challenges we have, the opportunities around the corner and how we can, you know, serve that way.</p><p>And that's why in Austin today, I'm saying, look, (inaudible) all doom and gloom with this tech revolution or social media. There are other opportunities here is what we if we embrace them.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Indeed, challenges and opportunities ahead. Mayor Sadiq Khan of London, thanks for joining us from Austin.</p><p>And so, two important issues for America and the world and our focus today and that is it for our program tonight. And remember you can always listen to our podcast and you can see un online in amanpour.com. And of course, you can follow me on Facebook and Twitter.</p><p>Thank you for watching and goodbye from New York.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2018031201cbk28</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RVS-JHT1-JB20-G4X6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4231\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 12, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>North Korea</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Wendy Sherman</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sadiq Khan</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

But is each side prepared for the other's unconventional  diplomacy?  I'm joined by the former U.S. nuclear negotiator on North Korea  and Iran, Wendy Sherman.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, my conversation with the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, on his rocky  relationship with President Trump, the problem with populism and why he's  come to America with a word of warning for big tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening, everyone.  Welcome to the program.  I'm Christiane Amanpour  in New York.  Still no word from North Korea about the potentially historic  meeting between Kim Jong-un and President Trump.  Three days after Trump  accepted Kim's invitation which came through South Korean officials.</p><p>Seoul says Pyongyang's radio silence probably means it's approaching this  matter with caution.  But if the summit actually does happen by the end of  May, North Korea is bound to be looking closely at whether Mr. Trump  abandons the Iran nuclear deal, which he calls a disaster as a way to test  the waters before it jumps into any kind of nuclear talks.</p><p>I've been speaking to someone who's negotiated on both issues.  Wendy  Sherman, the lead U.S. negotiator on the Iran deal for President Obama and  the special North Korea advisor under the Clinton administration, and she  joined me from London.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Wendy Sherman, welcome to the program.  </p><p>WENDY SHERMAN, FORMER SPECIAL ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT CLINTON ON NORTH KOREA:   Great to be here.  Thank you, Christiane.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, from a purely negotiating and negotiators point of view,  with your experience in both North Korea and Iran on these issues, what are  the pros and cons, the possible pitfalls or the opportunities of a  presidential meeting even before negotiations are underway?</p><p>SHERMAN:  Well, it's actually quite extraordinary, as you know, in the  annals of diplomacy.  Nonetheless, I'm glad that we're getting into talks.   Even if we start off with the meeting and not formal negotiations because  talk is certainly better than war and we need to give diplomacy a chance  where it should be the last resort, not the first.</p><p>I think the president has to be extraordinarily well prepared.  I know he  likes to shoot from the hip and has tremendous confidence in his ability  does Kim Jong-un, and if there was ever a symmetry between leaders it is  here.  Not that the President Trump is an autocratic dictator in the way  that Kim Jong-un is, he is president of a democracy.</p><p>But these are two men who believe that their choices, their decisions are  the only things that matter, but all of that said, this is a very, very  complicated, very difficult negotiation, much more difficult than the Iran  negotiation because North Korea has nuclear weapons and the means to  deliver them.  So, this is a very uphill climb.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  We wish Iran didn't and I will come to the whole Iran, North  Korea, symmetry, and President Trump's disdain of the Iran nuclear deal in  a moment, but first, I want to pick up on what you just said that the  president has to be very well prepared.</p><p>So, a couple questions on that, there is no US ambassador to South Korea.   The main State Department North Korea advisor has retired, resigned.  There  doesn't seem to be the officialdom the infrastructure of the key advisors  around the president.</p><p>They have obviously gone through the national security review and North  Korea featured at the top of that.  Do you think that he will be well  enough prepared by the time he goes into a meeting if it should happen?</p><p>SHERMAN:  Well, it worried me to hear that he wanted to do it as soon as  possible and that the South Koreans and those around him pushed him to at  least after the South Korean-North Korean Summit, which pushes this to May  because you've got to put a team together.</p><p>Whatever comes out of this meeting for good or for ill, someone's going to  need to follow up.  The president will not be able to do it all.  This is a  highly technical negotiation usually before you start these things to  figure out where you want to go.</p><p>You might even draft a kind of agreement you would hope you get to at the  end just to give you a sense of all of the elements that have to be on the  table.  All of the things you have to think about.</p><p>It also involves a lot of pre-consultation because it's not just our  interests that are at stake. Of course, that's what the president is most  and should be most concerned about, but we have allies with South Korea,  with Japan.</p><p>We certainly want China to be in the mix.  There Russia had interest they  want to build a gas pipeline through North Korean to the South.  So, we  have to not only have a range of consultations but understand everybody's  interest because this negotiation is about denuclearization of the Korean  Peninsula.</p><p>[15:05:07] But it is also about the future of Asia and Northeast Asia and  who is going to decide what that's going to be.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Should we at this moment be taking any warning signals or be  cautious that North Korea itself has as yet not confirmed that it has  offered this presidential meeting or at least it's not confirmed it  publicly.</p><p>SHERMAN:  Yes, I think that is of concern.  I think we certainly need to be  wary.  I don't know whether the message that the South Koreans conveyed was  in writing.  I believe that it was, which certainly helps, but we would  want to hear from North Korea and I would hope that there would be a direct  channel between North Korea and the United States as the logistics and the  substance and the agenda of this meeting is put together.</p><p>I appreciate our South Korean colleagues work in this regard.  It's  critical that we be shoulder to shoulder with South Korea, but we need a  direct line of communication as well.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Now, you said, the endgame must be denuclearization, but I put  it to you that first and foremost, the North Koreans, as you mentioned, are  way ahead of Iran which doesn't have nuclear weapons.  North Korea has  anyway, according to the community of 20 to 60 warheads.</p><p>As we've scene is perfecting the delivery mechanism, the ballistic missile  technology.  Is North Korea really going to denuclearize and I'd like to  play for you these two portions of interviews that I've done with experts  on this precise question.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEFFREY LEWIS, MIDDLEBURY INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES AT MONTERY:   What's going to have to happen is were going to have to learn to live with  this. Just as we learn to live with China having your weapons that could  target the United States and the Soviet Union before that. That's a very  unusual thing.  You know, we haven't gone through this in decades and so  it's a very jolting and bracing thing, particularly in Washington, D.C. for  people to come to grips with it.</p><p>MICHAEL HAYDEN, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR:  Let me give you what I think is a  truth very, a very, very sad truth.  The truth nonetheless, it is my  judgment that it would be more dangerous to prevent North Korea from  getting to that state that it would be for us to try to cope with the North  Korea in that state.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, Wendy Sherman, you've heard what these experts are saying.   What is the best that the United States can expect total denuclearization  really?</p><p>SHERMAN:  Well. I certainly think denuclearization should stay as the  objective because we don't want to encourage other countries to take the  nuclear weapons path.  That said, certainly, stabilizing the situation,  making sure it doesn't go further, containment of this situation having an  open channel to manage what's going on, hopefully getting the IAEA, the  International Atomic Energy Agency back into North Korea.</p><p>All of these things are steps along the way and I agree with your experts  to the extent that full denuclearization is certainly a long ways off, but  we need to get going, because ultimately we all hope there is a world  without nuclear weapons including ours and Russia's.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I want to ask you about what you might think lies behind the  North Korean objective or its movies, reach out right now.  You've been  there.  You've been a special advisor on North Korea.</p><p>You've been with Madeleine Albright as secretary of state in that last time  just before the Clinton administration ended to try to push forward on  these deals that would make the whole peninsula, the United States, and  everyone safer.</p><p>What is it like negotiating with them?  What do they really want?  What is  their mindset?  We asked because we don't really know what goes on inside  the hermit kingdom.</p><p>SHERMAN:  It's hard to fathom from time to time, but I do believe that Kim  Jong un is a rational actor within his paradigm.  I do believe that he is  not in any rush to denuclearize even though he may say OK, we can talk  about that, but let's see how we go from here to there.</p><p>I think his objectives are several.  One, he is in the driver seat at the  moment.  He has been able to get the present.  The United States most  powerful leader in the world to sit in the same room with him as if he is  in equal.</p><p>So, we've already achieved a major objective from his perspective. He  ultimately wants reunified the careers, but under North Korean leadership,  which is certainly not something the United States is going to agree to, I  certainly hope not, and he wants to hold on to his nuclear weapons because  he does not trust the United States.</p><p>He doesn't believe there's any guarantee for his security and his regime  security and he's well aware that there are many people in the United  States that are pushing for regime change and there are even hints that the  president may bring out in and outside envoy, and one who believes in  regime change.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Who might that be?  I assumed that you know who that might be?</p><p>SHERMAN:  Well, I think the word that has been reported in the press is  there some consideration of having John Bolton come in in that envoy.  I  think that would be quite an unusual and quite a difficult circumstance.</p><p>[15:10:09] AMANPOUR:  Well, many people of your -- people who have actually  sat down and had these negotiations may be equally worried.  I wonder if  you can speak then to the worry about in your community, around Europe and  elsewhere.</p><p>The President Trump's disdain and also John Bolton's disdain for the Iran  nuclear deal.  I have been talking to many world leaders, whether it's  Emmanuel Michael, France, European needed others, not to mention Americans,  who believe that if the president pulls out and discards the Iran nuclear  deal.</p><p>There is absolutely no way North Korea would have any incentive to enter  negotiations or to believe a deal that was ever offered and done by the  United States.</p><p>SHERMAN:  Well, I agree with that assessment.  However, having a bit of  appreciation for how President Trump operates, having watched him over the  election in this last year, I think he may believe that if he says to North  Korea, I pulled out of this deal because I'm going to negotiate the kinds  of deal that we really need that he may indeed do that.</p><p>I think that would be disastrous and it would make sense for him because  then he would have to nuclear crises at the same time.  It's difficult  enough to manage one.  It would be nearly impossible to manage two.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  You know, many people, including yourself, many of the pundits  on television have questioned President Trump's bluster towards North  Korea.  All the words that have been hurled around by Twitter in speeches  at the U.N. podium and elsewhere.</p><p>Likewise, Kim Jong-un's responses, very blustery, very difficult, and all  very scary frankly, but do you think that this tone has actually led to  where we are right now, this potential diplomatic opening?</p><p>And do you think President Trump backing the South Koreans sort of, you  know, Winter Olympic diplomacy, their desire to pursue diplomacy has  helped.</p><p>SHERMAN:  I think there's no doubt that the pressure campaign which was  begun under President Obama and has continued and accelerated under the  Trump administration, particularly if the United Nations has helped.  I  think our military posturing to a point has helped.</p><p>I'm not sure about the rhetoric on all sides as being helpful, but all of  this should be in service of diplomacy.  You always need a credible threat  of force in service of diplomacy.  A pressure campaign is important, but  none of that matters.</p><p>If you end up as the only option being war because you haven't really given  diplomacy a chance.  I hope that the president can put together the team  that's necessary.  I hope he puts in the persistent effort that will be  needed here.</p><p>He's going to have to have patience which isn't his strong suit, because  this is going to take a lot of time, as I said it's highly technical.  The  Iran agreement was 154 pages long.  The most extensive verification and  monitoring system ever put in place in such a situation.</p><p>And that's where we know where the enrichment was going, the plutonium  production was going on.  We don't know where everything is in North Korea.   The IAEA has not been inside of North Korea for some time.  So, this is a  very daunting undertaking.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And there is another crucial aspect of this and that is that in  certain courses in the United States, including with the president, they  appear to believe that negotiation and compromise is a sign of weakness.</p><p>That it has to be all.  It has to be a zero-sum game.  That the United  States has to come out with all the chips.  What is the reality and are  people in the U.S., important people, who have to sign off and agreed to  these negotiations, going to be acclimatized to the fact that it's a give- and-take situation?</p><p>SHERMAN:  Well, this is I think the greatest risk here, Christiane, which  is that the president and his team, give this an effort, but because they  don't get every single thing that they want that they say it's hopeless and  really create the prerequisite for war, the pretense of war.</p><p>And that I think is the most dangerous road that we are on.  It is not that  we should not achieve the objectives that will protect our national  security and the national security of our allies and partners, we  absolutely should, and that should be the common ground on which we all  work.</p><p>But between that and an agreement, there are lots of choices that there  have to be made, and if the president feels that they all have to go the  way the United States wants them to go, we probably won't get to an  agreement and we probably will find ourselves at war.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  It's terrifying.</p><p>SHERMAN:  It is terrifying.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Wendy Sherman, let us hope that this leads in the right  direction.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>SHERMAN:  Thank you, Christiane.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, invaluable insights on the way to this summit between the  two presidents, should it happen now.</p><p>[15:15:12] Now, one of President Trump's most frequent target isn't here in  America but thousands of miles away in London where he's the mayor.  Sadiq  Khan became the first Muslim mayor of a Western capital in 2016.  It was a  rare break from the politics of fear in that year when Britain voted to  leave the European Union and America elected Trump as president.</p><p>Khan is now in America pushing his progressive vision while at the same  time, Donald Trump's erstwhile (inaudible) Steven Bannon is actually  touring Europe to champion right-wing nativism.  I caught up with Sadiq  Khan in Austin, Texas, where he told the techy South by South West  Conference that Silicon values fueling division and the politicians have  failed to stop it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Mayor Khan, welcome to the program from Austin.</p><p>SADIQ KHAN, LONDON MAYOR:  Good to be with you, Christiane.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, you are there at this very innovative tech conference and  your speech is taking on the tech giants in no uncertain terms.  Tell me  what you mean precisely on what you're calling for.</p><p>KHAN:  The point I'm making to people here in Austin is actually, you know  what, social media, the tech revolution has been a source of massive  benefits.  We can keep in touch with our loved ones.  We can access the  information.  We can make new friends and it's wonderful.</p><p>But actually, I think politicians and policymakers have taken the ire of  the bull when it comes to making sure our regulation evolves with the tech  revolution.  The point I make today is, you know, if they don't act  responsibly and take action, then don't be surprised if this pressure on  politicians to regulate like Germany has done.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, let me ask you then because you have obviously supported the  transport for London campaign against Uber in your city and you are a mayor  who believes in pragmatic action rather than ideological warfare.  How do  you spread the needle between trying to restrict and ban certain aspects of  a tech giant like Uber and actually being, as you declare yourself, the  home for tech innovation and all the rest of it for London?</p><p>KHAN:  Well, you raise a very important point and I want to challenge the  premise in your question.  The question of wanting to ban Uber for the sake  of banning Uber is actually there are rules in relation to operation in  London.  In fact, you've got an app to provide services and change in fact  the regulations apply to you.</p><p>It doesn't matter how many lawyers you employ, PR experts that you employ,  the rules ae there for everyone to abide by and the good news is the  (inaudible) global CEO of Uber recognizes this, unlike his predecessor, who  wants to play by the rules of the game and is engaging with crossbow for  London.</p><p>So, that shows an example of, you know, regulation when it's enforced  properly leading to a race the bottom in relation to security and safety  concerns, but actually (inaudible) has been improved.</p><p>I think cities and mayors are uniquely placed to take advantage of the tech  revolution making sure that we design systems that can complement with the  tech revolution with consumers and the citizens.</p><p>In London, we have a program called skills for Londoners twinned with a  digital tech program to skill up Londoners to have these jobs that are  being created by the tech sector.  That's why I want London to be a byword  for small cities.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I'm talking to from the United States where cities, mayors, and  even states and governors are trying to enact policies and perhaps doesn't  get looked at or doesn't get enacted on a federal level.</p><p>But I want to ask you because your profile has now been raised to a global  level, in part due to the constant Twitter warfare between yourself and the  president of the United States, Donald Trump.  How do you deal with that  and at the same time, how do you deal with the lift that's given you to put  forth your politics and policies on a global stage?</p><p>KHAN:  I'm a reluctant participant and this Twitter fisticuffs (inaudible)  speaking with the president of the great (inaudible) of the United States  of America, and look, I'm not going to apologize for standing up to the  values that Londoners have.  We are the most diverse city in the world.</p><p>More than (inaudible) language is spoken in my city.  I think diversity is  a strength, but I say this the context is that we London, we my country  love America.  We love Americans.  We, you know, enjoy your films, your  music, your culture, your fashion, there's CNN.</p><p>But, you know, one of the advantages of having a best friend is not simply  to stand shoulder to shoulder at times diversity and to be an ally, but  when your best friend who is very different from an acquaintance, or a  friend you've hardly ever see, those things you disagree with, you got to  call them out and I won't apologize for calling out things that our best  friend says or tweets.</p><p>[15:20:12] AMANPOUR:  Well, your best friend, the president of the United  States, his now departed chief advisor, Steve Bannon is in Europe right now  taking this very nativist nationalist populist message around to France, to  Italy and elsewhere, and this is what he said, I'm going to play you a  little bit of what he said this weekend, talking at a La Pen rally in  France.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST:  Let them call you  racist.  Let them call you xenophobes.  Let them call you nativists.  Wear  it as a badge of honor.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Wear it as a badge of honor, Mr. Mayor, what do you say to that?</p><p>KHAN:  The idea of dividing communities, protectionism, seeking to try to  wedge between nation states in Europe is the long-term solution is  ridiculous.  I think what we are going to be careful of is people like this  man seeking to drive communities in Europe like he's clearly done in parts  of America as well.</p><p>And those of us who are progressives, proud social Democrats, have got to  think carefully about addressing the fears people have.  One of the roles I  think that politicians have failed to do in the recent past and I say it's  a non-patronizing way is to be teachers, to be educators, to explain the  complex challenges we face, and to realize we've got to be cool, calm, and  collected in addressing the concerns of people.</p><p>There are no short cuts, gimmicks to some of role challenges that people  face in France.  We saw the elections a couple weeks ago in my country and  the U.S.A., dare I say it.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I just wonder how you explained, for instance, your own victory  amid a very ugly campaign in Britain when you were running for mayor where  your conservative opponent sort of insinuated that you backed extremists  and was trying to sort of, you know, divide and conquer there.</p><p>And we also saw in France, Le Pen, tried to say the same thing about  Emmanuel Macron and yet he also won with a centrist globalist agenda.  So  how -- what is your advice to fighting political battles from the center?</p><p>KHAN:  The campaign that I saw in 2016 is one where we've been optimistic,  positive, but also has been honest with the electorate.  I'd rather under  promise and over deliver.  But also, I was unapologetic and proud of who I  am as a Muslim.  I'm of Asian origin.  I'm a Londoner.  I'm an Englishman.   I'm British.  I'm European.  I'm a husband.  I'm a father.  That's who I  am.</p><p>(Inaudible) campaign, but also explaining to fix the housing crisis is a  marathon not a sprint as taken as a result of successive governments  playing down Londoners.  (Inaudible) of immigrants through affordable homes  in London to make sure that we got a decent public transport system.</p><p>We got to invest in a public transport.  It's not (inaudible) of foreigners  coming to London.  The public transport is overfull in the London.  But,  you know, I say this in a respectful way to people who vote in countries  all around the world, analyze, examine, look at carefully on what you are  being sold by the salesman or saleswoman from that critical policy.  Be  careful on short term fixes.  It's too good to be true and this is not  true.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I wonder whether you can comment on some of the promises that  were made by the Brexiteers.  You obviously voted to remain part of the  E.U., but they told British people that they would be heading for the  (inaudible) plans and meantime, we see the United States potentially  slapping steel tariffs on E.U. and on Britain.</p><p>We see already a word that that air roots for airlines, Britain will be put  to the back of the queue for favorable airline routes.  What do you have to  say that and also a major bank, UBS, talking about moving several hundred  employees out?</p><p>KHAN:  Our ability as country of 65 million to do a good deal with these  big nation states is made very, very hard because why would they bend over  backwards to have low tariff deals with us.  If we are member of a club,  the European Union, our abilities to a deal is strengthened and my worry is  the British voters who voted to leave the European Union have been the  phrase we use is soda pop.</p><p>They'd been given as promised that simply can't be met.  The promise that  was made by the Brexiteers campaign was once we -- the vote was taken, we  would benefit from 350 million pounds each week invested in the NHS.</p><p>If you're made the offer, you'd a fool to turn it down.  Lo and behold, we  voted to leave the European Union.  You're not seeing this investment in  the NHS.  This is what turns people to be cynical and saying all  politicians are the same.</p><p>[15:25:02] You know what?  I'm going to give up on politics, not to vote in  elections, and that's why you showed a clip off Mr. Berman in France.  It's  interesting the election results in Italy in the last two weeks.  What is  the case that the amount of milk and honey doesn't arise in Italy in the  next few weeks.</p><p>And those very people who voted the way they did will say, hold on a  second, refer to the way we did what's left us, why we have  responsibilities, Democrats will be, to explain to people, to educate  people about some of the challenges we have, the opportunities around the  corner and how we can, you know, serve that way.</p><p>And that's why in Austin today, I'm saying, look, (inaudible) all doom and  gloom with this tech revolution or social media.  There are other  opportunities here is what we if we embrace them.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Indeed, challenges and opportunities ahead.  Mayor Sadiq Khan of  London, thanks for joining us from Austin.</p><p>And so, two important issues for America and the world and our focus today  and that is it for our program tonight.  And remember you can always listen  to our podcast and you can see un online in amanpour.com.  And of course,  you can follow me on Facebook and Twitter.</p><p>Thank you for watching and goodbye from New York.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

But is each side prepared for the other's unconventional  diplomacy?  I'm joined by the former U.S. nuclear negotiator on North Korea  and Iran, Wendy Sherman.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Plus, my conversation with the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, on his rocky  relationship with President Trump, the problem with populism and why he's  come to America with a word of warning for big tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Good evening, everyone.  Welcome to the program.  I'm Christiane Amanpour  in New York.  Still no word from North Korea about the potentially historic  meeting between Kim Jong-un and President Trump.  Three days after Trump  accepted Kim's invitation which came through South Korean officials.</p><p>Seoul says Pyongyang's radio silence probably means it's approaching this  matter with caution.  But if the summit actually does happen by the end of  May, North Korea is bound to be looking closely at whether Mr. Trump  abandons the Iran nuclear deal, which he calls a disaster as a way to test  the waters before it jumps into any kind of nuclear talks.</p><p> I've been speaking to someone who's negotiated on both issues.  Wendy  Sherman, the lead U.S. negotiator on the Iran deal for President Obama and  the special North Korea advisor under the Clinton administration, and she  joined me from London.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> AMANPOUR:  Wendy Sherman, welcome to the program.  </p><p> WENDY SHERMAN, FORMER SPECIAL ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT CLINTON ON NORTH KOREA:   Great to be here.  Thank you, Christiane.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  So, from a purely negotiating and negotiators point of view,  with your experience in both North Korea and Iran on these issues, what are  the pros and cons, the possible pitfalls or the opportunities of a  presidential meeting even before negotiations are underway?</p><p> SHERMAN:  Well, it's actually quite extraordinary, as you know, in the  annals of diplomacy.  Nonetheless, I'm glad that we're getting into talks.   Even if we start off with the meeting and not formal negotiations because  talk is certainly better than war and we need to give diplomacy a chance  where it should be the last resort, not the first.</p><p> I think the president has to be extraordinarily well prepared.  I know he  likes to shoot from the hip and has tremendous confidence in his ability  does Kim Jong-un, and if there was ever a symmetry between leaders it is  here.  Not that the President Trump is an autocratic dictator in the way  that Kim Jong-un is, he is president of a democracy.</p><p> But these are two men who believe that their choices, their decisions are  the only things that matter, but all of that said, this is a very, very  complicated, very difficult negotiation, much more difficult than the Iran  negotiation because North Korea has nuclear weapons and the means to  deliver them.  So, this is a very uphill climb.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  We wish Iran didn't and I will come to the whole Iran, North  Korea, symmetry, and President Trump's disdain of the Iran nuclear deal in  a moment, but first, I want to pick up on what you just said that the  president has to be very well prepared.</p><p> So, a couple questions on that, there is no US ambassador to South Korea.   The main State Department North Korea advisor has retired, resigned.  There  doesn't seem to be the officialdom the infrastructure of the key advisors  around the president.</p><p> They have obviously gone through the national security review and North  Korea featured at the top of that.  Do you think that he will be well  enough prepared by the time he goes into a meeting if it should happen?</p><p> SHERMAN:  Well, it worried me to hear that he wanted to do it as soon as  possible and that the South Koreans and those around him pushed him to at  least after the South Korean-North Korean Summit, which pushes this to May  because you've got to put a team together.</p><p> Whatever comes out of this meeting for good or for ill, someone's going to  need to follow up.  The president will not be able to do it all.  This is a  highly technical negotiation usually before you start these things to  figure out where you want to go.</p><p> You might even draft a kind of agreement you would hope you get to at the  end just to give you a sense of all of the elements that have to be on the  table.  All of the things you have to think about.</p><p> It also involves a lot of pre-consultation because it's not just our  interests that are at stake. Of course, that's what the president is most  and should be most concerned about, but we have allies with South Korea,  with Japan.</p><p> We certainly want China to be in the mix.  There Russia had interest they  want to build a gas pipeline through North Korean to the South.  So, we  have to not only have a range of consultations but understand everybody's  interest because this negotiation is about denuclearization of the Korean  Peninsula.</p><p> [15:05:07] But it is also about the future of Asia and Northeast Asia and  who is going to decide what that's going to be.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  Should we at this moment be taking any warning signals or be  cautious that North Korea itself has as yet not confirmed that it has  offered this presidential meeting or at least it's not confirmed it  publicly.</p><p> SHERMAN:  Yes, I think that is of concern.  I think we certainly need to be  wary.  I don't know whether the message that the South Koreans conveyed was  in writing.  I believe that it was, which certainly helps, but we would  want to hear from North Korea and I would hope that there would be a direct  channel between North Korea and the United States as the logistics and the  substance and the agenda of this meeting is put together.</p><p> I appreciate our South Korean colleagues work in this regard.  It's  critical that we be shoulder to shoulder with South Korea, but we need a  direct line of communication as well.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  Now, you said, the endgame must be denuclearization, but I put  it to you that first and foremost, the North Koreans, as you mentioned, are  way ahead of Iran which doesn't have nuclear weapons.  North Korea has  anyway, according to the community of 20 to 60 warheads.</p><p> As we've scene is perfecting the delivery mechanism, the ballistic missile  technology.  Is North Korea really going to denuclearize and I'd like to  play for you these two portions of interviews that I've done with experts  on this precise question.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JEFFREY LEWIS, MIDDLEBURY INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES AT MONTERY:   What's going to have to happen is were going to have to learn to live with  this. Just as we learn to live with China having your weapons that could  target the United States and the Soviet Union before that. That's a very  unusual thing.  You know, we haven't gone through this in decades and so  it's a very jolting and bracing thing, particularly in Washington, D.C. for  people to come to grips with it.</p><p> MICHAEL HAYDEN, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR:  Let me give you what I think is a  truth very, a very, very sad truth.  The truth nonetheless, it is my  judgment that it would be more dangerous to prevent North Korea from  getting to that state that it would be for us to try to cope with the North  Korea in that state.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> AMANPOUR:  So, Wendy Sherman, you've heard what these experts are saying.   What is the best that the United States can expect total denuclearization  really?</p><p> SHERMAN:  Well. I certainly think denuclearization should stay as the  objective because we don't want to encourage other countries to take the  nuclear weapons path.  That said, certainly, stabilizing the situation,  making sure it doesn't go further, containment of this situation having an  open channel to manage what's going on, hopefully getting the IAEA, the  International Atomic Energy Agency back into North Korea.</p><p> All of these things are steps along the way and I agree with your experts  to the extent that full denuclearization is certainly a long ways off, but  we need to get going, because ultimately we all hope there is a world  without nuclear weapons including ours and Russia's.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  I want to ask you about what you might think lies behind the  North Korean objective or its movies, reach out right now.  You've been  there.  You've been a special advisor on North Korea.</p><p> You've been with Madeleine Albright as secretary of state in that last time  just before the Clinton administration ended to try to push forward on  these deals that would make the whole peninsula, the United States, and  everyone safer.</p><p> What is it like negotiating with them?  What do they really want?  What is  their mindset?  We asked because we don't really know what goes on inside  the hermit kingdom.</p><p> SHERMAN:  It's hard to fathom from time to time, but I do believe that Kim  Jong un is a rational actor within his paradigm.  I do believe that he is  not in any rush to denuclearize even though he may say OK, we can talk  about that, but let's see how we go from here to there.</p><p> I think his objectives are several.  One, he is in the driver seat at the  moment.  He has been able to get the present.  The United States most  powerful leader in the world to sit in the same room with him as if he is  in equal.</p><p> So, we've already achieved a major objective from his perspective. He  ultimately wants reunified the careers, but under North Korean leadership,  which is certainly not something the United States is going to agree to, I  certainly hope not, and he wants to hold on to his nuclear weapons because  he does not trust the United States.</p><p> He doesn't believe there's any guarantee for his security and his regime  security and he's well aware that there are many people in the United  States that are pushing for regime change and there are even hints that the  president may bring out in and outside envoy, and one who believes in  regime change.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  Who might that be?  I assumed that you know who that might be?</p><p> SHERMAN:  Well, I think the word that has been reported in the press is  there some consideration of having John Bolton come in in that envoy.  I  think that would be quite an unusual and quite a difficult circumstance.</p><p> [15:10:09] AMANPOUR:  Well, many people of your -- people who have actually  sat down and had these negotiations may be equally worried.  I wonder if  you can speak then to the worry about in your community, around Europe and  elsewhere.</p><p> The President Trump's disdain and also John Bolton's disdain for the Iran  nuclear deal.  I have been talking to many world leaders, whether it's  Emmanuel Michael, France, European needed others, not to mention Americans,  who believe that if the president pulls out and discards the Iran nuclear  deal.</p><p> There is absolutely no way North Korea would have any incentive to enter  negotiations or to believe a deal that was ever offered and done by the  United States.</p><p> SHERMAN:  Well, I agree with that assessment.  However, having a bit of  appreciation for how President Trump operates, having watched him over the  election in this last year, I think he may believe that if he says to North  Korea, I pulled out of this deal because I'm going to negotiate the kinds  of deal that we really need that he may indeed do that.</p><p> I think that would be disastrous and it would make sense for him because  then he would have to nuclear crises at the same time.  It's difficult  enough to manage one.  It would be nearly impossible to manage two.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  You know, many people, including yourself, many of the pundits  on television have questioned President Trump's bluster towards North  Korea.  All the words that have been hurled around by Twitter in speeches  at the U.N. podium and elsewhere.</p><p> Likewise, Kim Jong-un's responses, very blustery, very difficult, and all  very scary frankly, but do you think that this tone has actually led to  where we are right now, this potential diplomatic opening?</p><p> And do you think President Trump backing the South Koreans sort of, you  know, Winter Olympic diplomacy, their desire to pursue diplomacy has  helped.</p><p> SHERMAN:  I think there's no doubt that the pressure campaign which was  begun under President Obama and has continued and accelerated under the  Trump administration, particularly if the United Nations has helped.  I  think our military posturing to a point has helped.</p><p> I'm not sure about the rhetoric on all sides as being helpful, but all of  this should be in service of diplomacy.  You always need a credible threat  of force in service of diplomacy.  A pressure campaign is important, but  none of that matters.</p><p> If you end up as the only option being war because you haven't really given  diplomacy a chance.  I hope that the president can put together the team  that's necessary.  I hope he puts in the persistent effort that will be  needed here.</p><p> He's going to have to have patience which isn't his strong suit, because  this is going to take a lot of time, as I said it's highly technical.  The  Iran agreement was 154 pages long.  The most extensive verification and  monitoring system ever put in place in such a situation.</p><p> And that's where we know where the enrichment was going, the plutonium  production was going on.  We don't know where everything is in North Korea.   The IAEA has not been inside of North Korea for some time.  So, this is a  very daunting undertaking.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  And there is another crucial aspect of this and that is that in  certain courses in the United States, including with the president, they  appear to believe that negotiation and compromise is a sign of weakness.</p><p> That it has to be all.  It has to be a zero-sum game.  That the United  States has to come out with all the chips.  What is the reality and are  people in the U.S., important people, who have to sign off and agreed to  these negotiations, going to be acclimatized to the fact that it's a give- and-take situation?</p><p> SHERMAN:  Well, this is I think the greatest risk here, Christiane, which  is that the president and his team, give this an effort, but because they  don't get every single thing that they want that they say it's hopeless and  really create the prerequisite for war, the pretense of war.</p><p> And that I think is the most dangerous road that we are on.  It is not that  we should not achieve the objectives that will protect our national  security and the national security of our allies and partners, we  absolutely should, and that should be the common ground on which we all  work.</p><p> But between that and an agreement, there are lots of choices that there  have to be made, and if the president feels that they all have to go the  way the United States wants them to go, we probably won't get to an  agreement and we probably will find ourselves at war.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  It's terrifying.</p><p> SHERMAN:  It is terrifying.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  Wendy Sherman, let us hope that this leads in the right  direction.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> SHERMAN:  Thank you, Christiane.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> AMANPOUR:  So, invaluable insights on the way to this summit between the  two presidents, should it happen now.</p><p> [15:15:12] Now, one of President Trump's most frequent target isn't here in  America but thousands of miles away in London where he's the mayor.  Sadiq  Khan became the first Muslim mayor of a Western capital in 2016.  It was a  rare break from the politics of fear in that year when Britain voted to  leave the European Union and America elected Trump as president.</p><p> Khan is now in America pushing his progressive vision while at the same  time, Donald Trump's erstwhile (inaudible) Steven Bannon is actually  touring Europe to champion right-wing nativism.  I caught up with Sadiq  Khan in Austin, Texas, where he told the techy South by South West  Conference that Silicon values fueling division and the politicians have  failed to stop it.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> AMANPOUR:  Mayor Khan, welcome to the program from Austin.</p><p> SADIQ KHAN, LONDON MAYOR:  Good to be with you, Christiane.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  So, you are there at this very innovative tech conference and  your speech is taking on the tech giants in no uncertain terms.  Tell me  what you mean precisely on what you're calling for.</p><p> KHAN:  The point I'm making to people here in Austin is actually, you know  what, social media, the tech revolution has been a source of massive  benefits.  We can keep in touch with our loved ones.  We can access the  information.  We can make new friends and it's wonderful.</p><p> But actually, I think politicians and policymakers have taken the ire of  the bull when it comes to making sure our regulation evolves with the tech  revolution.  The point I make today is, you know, if they don't act  responsibly and take action, then don't be surprised if this pressure on  politicians to regulate like Germany has done.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  So, let me ask you then because you have obviously supported the  transport for London campaign against Uber in your city and you are a mayor  who believes in pragmatic action rather than ideological warfare.  How do  you spread the needle between trying to restrict and ban certain aspects of  a tech giant like Uber and actually being, as you declare yourself, the  home for tech innovation and all the rest of it for London?</p><p> KHAN:  Well, you raise a very important point and I want to challenge the  premise in your question.  The question of wanting to ban Uber for the sake  of banning Uber is actually there are rules in relation to operation in  London.  In fact, you've got an app to provide services and change in fact  the regulations apply to you.</p><p> It doesn't matter how many lawyers you employ, PR experts that you employ,  the rules ae there for everyone to abide by and the good news is the  (inaudible) global CEO of Uber recognizes this, unlike his predecessor, who  wants to play by the rules of the game and is engaging with crossbow for  London.</p><p> So, that shows an example of, you know, regulation when it's enforced  properly leading to a race the bottom in relation to security and safety  concerns, but actually (inaudible) has been improved.</p><p> I think cities and mayors are uniquely placed to take advantage of the tech  revolution making sure that we design systems that can complement with the  tech revolution with consumers and the citizens.</p><p> In London, we have a program called skills for Londoners twinned with a  digital tech program to skill up Londoners to have these jobs that are  being created by the tech sector.  That's why I want London to be a byword  for small cities.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  I'm talking to from the United States where cities, mayors, and  even states and governors are trying to enact policies and perhaps doesn't  get looked at or doesn't get enacted on a federal level.</p><p> But I want to ask you because your profile has now been raised to a global  level, in part due to the constant Twitter warfare between yourself and the  president of the United States, Donald Trump.  How do you deal with that  and at the same time, how do you deal with the lift that's given you to put  forth your politics and policies on a global stage?</p><p> KHAN:  I'm a reluctant participant and this Twitter fisticuffs (inaudible)  speaking with the president of the great (inaudible) of the United States  of America, and look, I'm not going to apologize for standing up to the  values that Londoners have.  We are the most diverse city in the world.</p><p> More than (inaudible) language is spoken in my city.  I think diversity is  a strength, but I say this the context is that we London, we my country  love America.  We love Americans.  We, you know, enjoy your films, your  music, your culture, your fashion, there's CNN.</p><p> But, you know, one of the advantages of having a best friend is not simply  to stand shoulder to shoulder at times diversity and to be an ally, but  when your best friend who is very different from an acquaintance, or a  friend you've hardly ever see, those things you disagree with, you got to  call them out and I won't apologize for calling out things that our best  friend says or tweets.</p><p> [15:20:12] AMANPOUR:  Well, your best friend, the president of the United  States, his now departed chief advisor, Steve Bannon is in Europe right now  taking this very nativist nationalist populist message around to France, to  Italy and elsewhere, and this is what he said, I'm going to play you a  little bit of what he said this weekend, talking at a La Pen rally in  France.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST:  Let them call you  racist.  Let them call you xenophobes.  Let them call you nativists.  Wear  it as a badge of honor.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> AMANPOUR:  Wear it as a badge of honor, Mr. Mayor, what do you say to that?</p><p> KHAN:  The idea of dividing communities, protectionism, seeking to try to  wedge between nation states in Europe is the long-term solution is  ridiculous.  I think what we are going to be careful of is people like this  man seeking to drive communities in Europe like he's clearly done in parts  of America as well.</p><p> And those of us who are progressives, proud social Democrats, have got to  think carefully about addressing the fears people have.  One of the roles I  think that politicians have failed to do in the recent past and I say it's  a non-patronizing way is to be teachers, to be educators, to explain the  complex challenges we face, and to realize we've got to be cool, calm, and  collected in addressing the concerns of people.</p><p> There are no short cuts, gimmicks to some of role challenges that people  face in France.  We saw the elections a couple weeks ago in my country and  the U.S.A., dare I say it.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  I just wonder how you explained, for instance, your own victory  amid a very ugly campaign in Britain when you were running for mayor where  your conservative opponent sort of insinuated that you backed extremists  and was trying to sort of, you know, divide and conquer there.</p><p> And we also saw in France, Le Pen, tried to say the same thing about  Emmanuel Macron and yet he also won with a centrist globalist agenda.  So  how -- what is your advice to fighting political battles from the center?</p><p> KHAN:  The campaign that I saw in 2016 is one where we've been optimistic,  positive, but also has been honest with the electorate.  I'd rather under  promise and over deliver.  But also, I was unapologetic and proud of who I  am as a Muslim.  I'm of Asian origin.  I'm a Londoner.  I'm an Englishman.   I'm British.  I'm European.  I'm a husband.  I'm a father.  That's who I  am.</p><p> (Inaudible) campaign, but also explaining to fix the housing crisis is a  marathon not a sprint as taken as a result of successive governments  playing down Londoners.  (Inaudible) of immigrants through affordable homes  in London to make sure that we got a decent public transport system.</p><p> We got to invest in a public transport.  It's not (inaudible) of foreigners  coming to London.  The public transport is overfull in the London.  But,  you know, I say this in a respectful way to people who vote in countries  all around the world, analyze, examine, look at carefully on what you are  being sold by the salesman or saleswoman from that critical policy.  Be  careful on short term fixes.  It's too good to be true and this is not  true.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  I wonder whether you can comment on some of the promises that  were made by the Brexiteers.  You obviously voted to remain part of the  E.U., but they told British people that they would be heading for the  (inaudible) plans and meantime, we see the United States potentially  slapping steel tariffs on E.U. and on Britain.</p><p> We see already a word that that air roots for airlines, Britain will be put  to the back of the queue for favorable airline routes.  What do you have to  say that and also a major bank, UBS, talking about moving several hundred  employees out?</p><p> KHAN:  Our ability as country of 65 million to do a good deal with these  big nation states is made very, very hard because why would they bend over  backwards to have low tariff deals with us.  If we are member of a club,  the European Union, our abilities to a deal is strengthened and my worry is  the British voters who voted to leave the European Union have been the  phrase we use is soda pop.</p><p> They'd been given as promised that simply can't be met.  The promise that  was made by the Brexiteers campaign was once we -- the vote was taken, we  would benefit from 350 million pounds each week invested in the NHS.</p><p> If you're made the offer, you'd a fool to turn it down.  Lo and behold, we  voted to leave the European Union.  You're not seeing this investment in  the NHS.  This is what turns people to be cynical and saying all  politicians are the same.</p><p> [15:25:02] You know what?  I'm going to give up on politics, not to vote in  elections, and that's why you showed a clip off Mr. Berman in France.  It's  interesting the election results in Italy in the last two weeks.  What is  the case that the amount of milk and honey doesn't arise in Italy in the  next few weeks.</p><p> And those very people who voted the way they did will say, hold on a  second, refer to the way we did what's left us, why we have  responsibilities, Democrats will be, to explain to people, to educate  people about some of the challenges we have, the opportunities around the  corner and how we can, you know, serve that way.</p><p> And that's why in Austin today, I'm saying, look, (inaudible) all doom and  gloom with this tech revolution or social media.  There are other  opportunities here is what we if we embrace them.</p><p> AMANPOUR:  Indeed, challenges and opportunities ahead.  Mayor Sadiq Khan of  London, thanks for joining us from Austin.</p><p> And so, two important issues for America and the world and our focus today  and that is it for our program tonight.  And remember you can always listen  to our podcast and you can see un online in amanpour.com.  And of course,  you can follow me on Facebook and Twitter.</p><p> Thank you for watching and goodbye from New York.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

For example, Madison is home to the state's flagship university and entrepreneurial success - electronic health records company Epic Systems. In many ways, Madison is the epitome of the recipe for creating a center of technology innovation that Brookings and ITIF want to try across the country.</p><p>\"It's a mini superstar,\" Muro said.</p><p>Madison was head and shoulders above the next metro identified - Minneapolis and St. Paul. Milwaukee came in the middle of the pack on the Brookings and ITIF index.</p><p>The idea is that injecting some new support into those communities could reorient the nation's economic geography to help regions left behind by innovation on the coasts, with Madison as the most eligible.</p><p>The potential growth areas were identified by looking at a metro's university STEM research and development spending, patents per capita, the share of residents with a college degree, STEM doctoral degrees and share of innovation sector jobs.</p><p>\"Technology firms are known to tend to cluster near each other where they can find clusters of highly skilled workers, specialized service providers, vendors and high quality of life,\" Muro said. \"When they do that, they can begin to overachieve in a two plus two equals five way. The whole overall region becomes more efficient and able to achieve more output.\"</p><p>More than 90% of the nation's innovation-sector growth from 2005 to 2017 came from five metros - Boston, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle and San Diego, according to the report. This clustering effect makes technology different from past economic drivers like agriculture or manufacturing, which were dependent on natural or physical resources like rivers and ports.</p><p>\"It's all about talented people and companies,\" Muro said. \"This is part of the glory of the American tech-based economy, but it also contributes to this problem of the digital rich getting richer.\"</p><p>The proposal from Brookings and ITIF suggests that the federal government put $100 billion into this initiative over 10 years. A big chunk of that money would be direct research and development funding, worth up to $700 million a year in each metro for 10 years.</p><p>It calls for \"carefully targeted innovation, business-development, placemaking, and related investments\" that would allow metro areas to \"transform themselves internally\" with this support.</p><p>Gov. Tony Evers sent a letter Monday to Wisconsin's members of Congress urging them to consider the proposal.</p><p>\"Our state has demonstrated it has the infrastructure, institutions, and importantly, the relationships and commitment to transform ideas into successful outcomes, and Wisconsin could benefit immensely from the type of initiative proposed in the report,\" Evers said in a news release. \"Moreover, this type of bold initiative could not only support the communities that receive funding, but ultimately strengthen our state and our country and support our position on an increasingly competitive world stage.\"</p><p>\"It's a really bold initiative,\" said Aaron Hager, vice president of the division of entrepreneurship and innovation for the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp.</p><p>From where he sits, Hager thinks the ideas put forth by Brookings and ITIF overlap with what's already happening in Madison and Milwaukee. Wisconsin doesn't need to be told about the growing gap between the hyper-concentration of innovation in big tech hubs like Boston, San Francisco and Seattle with cities in the middle of the country.</p><p>\"I'm optimistic that Washington would take it as a challenge worth accepting,\" Hager said.</p><p>Two senators, one Democrat and one Republican, have signed on to the proposal.</p><p>Muro and one of his co-authors, Robert Atkinson, president of the ITIF, will present the proposal at an event Wednesday in Washington, D.C.

As is often the case with such scandals, there are, at the heart of the story, some fairly narrow questions as to whether formal rules have been breached - which in this case centre on the provision of Facebookdata to a third party - but also a broader set of political and ethical questions. Yet it has not always been clear in the reporting and commentary exactly what these wider problems and issues are, let alone how they might be resolved.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The gist of the story is that a rather mercenary and seemingly unethical group of political consultants made use of now fairly standard \"big data\" techniques to develop targeted political messaging. Many of the practices complained of, though, are not especially new, nor are they unique to the coterie of shady political advisors and financiers that have surrounded <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>Indeed, the Obama campaign made use of Facebookdata in much the same way. This begs the question: would this be big news if there weren't an alleged breach?</p><p>The Cambridge Analytica story blends concerns about the power of Facebookand the other tech giants, with an anxiety about the collapse of a longstanding political consensus that has been discussed largely in terms of irrational voter behaviour and manipulative political messaging. We've seen a similar cluster of issues converge in the ongoing low level panics about \"fake news\", and in both cases there seems to be a failure to come to terms with problems in media and politics that were obvious long before the disruptive political victories of Trump and the \"No\" campaign.</p><p>Politicians have long made use of practical and academic expertise in communications to hone messaging, target key voters, and drive through unpopular policies, and such messaging is often negative and/or manipulative. The Thatcherites famously retained the advertising firm Saatchi &amp; Saatchi to target upwardly mobile voters and smear the Conservative's political opponents, whilst New Labour was notorious for its centralised communications operations, its \"spin\" and its targeting of swing voters in key marginals. In all these areas we have seen techniques originally developed by social scientists and professionals in marketing, advertising and the media, applied in political campaigning and strategy.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg on Cambridge </p><p>Analytica</p><p>: 'I'm really sorry'</p><p>What has changed in recent years is the level of sophistication of these techniques, thanks to rapid technological advances. This has meant the marketing and advertising industry, which at one stage relied heavily on survey data and focus groups, can now draw on unprecedented volumes of highly personal data. Naturally these techniques have moved into politics, and in this particular case they were used to support a noxious political candidate, who then stole the White House from its heir apparent.</p><p>The antics of Cambridge Analytica aside, the story highlights some serious problems with both politics and big tech companies. We have a political systemthat is highly centralised and often uses manipulate communication techniques; but they now do so by utilising a massive private infrastructure of surveillance, which can be readily utilised not just by politicians and the state, but by corporate interests too.</p><p>The hope that the corporate giants could be effectively regulated to protect user privacy and data security fundamentally misunderstands the nature of these companies. Their entire business model is based on monitoring our online behaviour and monetising that data. They cannot therefore be reformed without undermining their commercial viability.</p><p>One obvious option is nationalisation. This isn't nearly as much of a political taboo as it was even a few years ago, but still seems very unlikely in the US, and it is hard to see how it would work internationally. More regulation of Facebookand other companies, though, seems inevitable, even if it will likely be rather ineffective.</p><p>At the same time there is an urgent need for the development of non-commercial alternatives which are able to offer users the great benefits of these new technologies, without the serious downsides that are becoming ever more apparent. In some contexts, this might mean the development of platform cooperatives under the control of their users which are able to offer data security and algorithmic transparency. In the UK though we have a very obvious alternative public provider in the BBC.</p><p>The national broadcaster was developed to act in the public interest, free from private interests or political control. Of course, the reality of has fallen rather short of that, but it is a vision that is salvageable and seems highly relevant today.</p><p>Though we think of the BBC primarily as a programme maker and broadcaster, and it also tends to think of itself in those terms, it is also a public communications technology company that has throughout its life developed technology in the public interest. With television a dying medium, the BBC has so far made only tentative steps into the digital space. But in technical terms it would be relatively straightforward for the Corporation to become a public platform and network that could offer its users total algorithmic transparency, data security and the opportunity participate equally in culture and public life free from political or commercial exploitation.</p><p>Tom Mills is the author of The BBC: The Myth of a Public Service.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-42506704</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INPDWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXR-0TD1-JCJY-G151-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"922\"/><timeReceived>5:02 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent (United Kingdom)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19720\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 22, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

For its data management sins Equifax <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/business/equifax-settlement.html?action=click&amp;module=Latest&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">must pay</url> $300 million to a fund for affected consumers with the potential for the fund to grow to cover payments up to $425 million. Google will       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/19/ftc-approves-settlement-with-google-over-youtube-kids-privacy-violations/?utm_term=.9397a5a97f54\">reportedly</url> pay a multimillion-dollar fine for collecting data and targeting children under the age of 13 in violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act. And the F.T.C.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/technology/facebook-ftc-fine.html\">has approved</url> a $5 billion dollar fine for Facebook for mishandling user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In an alternate universe, such settlements in such quick succession would be a clear sign that the regulatory might of the federal government is firmly focused on Silicon Valley and consumer data protection. But unfortunately, here in 2019 on Earth-One, this month\u2019s fines aren\u2019t shows of strength but telling admissions of weakness. When it comes to funding, influence and size, the government is simply outmatched by the internet\u2019s largest data guzzlers. </p><p>Nowhere is this more true than with Facebook. As <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/22/facebook-vs-feds-inside-story-multi-billion-dollar-tech-giants-privacy-war-with-washington/?utm_term=.7fb0ef8725ad\">Tony Romm reported</url> in The Washington Post this week, the F.T.C. had originally conceived of significantly tougher punishments for Facebook, including fines exceeding tens of billions of dollars as well as direct liability for the company\u2019s c.e.o., Mark Zuckerberg. The report lays out the nuance of the settlement negotiation process, and what I found striking was how it seemed as if \u2014 despite being the party in violation of the rules \u2014 Facebook appeared to have the upper hand:</p><p>Internally, the agency knew that it wasn\u2019t guaranteed to get a multibillion dollar fine and other new commitments from a federal judge. Adding to the trouble, the agency, armed with a relatively small $306 million budget in 2018 that supported roughly 1,100 employees, had to confront the possibility that it might be outmatched in such litigation \u2026 A loss also could have immensely damaged the agency, perhaps setting a legal standard that curtailed the commission\u2019s authority to police other tech giants for their privacy and security practices.</p><p>Facebook, in other words, is too big to fight. And so it received a fine that is roughly equivalent to a month of the company\u2019s yearly revenue. When news of the fine broke, Facebook\u2019s stock price surged close to a yearly high. Google\u2019s settlement could change the way the company\u2019s algorithms serve advertisements on children\u2019s videos but its fine, too, is paltry. And Equifax\u2019s total payments, arguably the most onerous of all three, represent <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/ericgeller/status/1153288588811001857?s=20\">roughly 17</url> percent of Equifax\u2019s 2018 revenue. (A substantial portion of the consumer reimbursement is likely to come from Equifax providing free credit monitoring.)</p><p>Together, these weak enforcements reveal a structural asymmetry between data brokers and the government. The old enforcement mechanisms of regulatory agencies (fines, public shaming) are no match for the size of these companies and the unprecedented amount of lucrative personal information they possess. In this way, the feds seem only to partially grasp the business models of the companies they seek to regulate. Facebook, Google and Equifax all derive their profit and power from collecting data and controlling its supply in an economy where demand for data is insatiable. Any effort then to check that power \u2014 or curb those profits \u2014 can come only from changing the ways these companies amass our personal information.</p><p>Some people in Washington are \u2014 gradually \u2014 seeing the light. Representatives Zoe Lofgren and Anna Eshoo, both California Democrats, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/21/silicon-valley-regulator-tech-companies-1600638\">are reportedly circulating a proposal</url> for a 1,600-person data protection agency. And on Sunday, after news of the Facebook settlement, the presidential candidate Andrew Yang tweeted a suggestion to create a new \u201cDepartment of the Attention Economy\u201d to deal with tech issues.</p><p>That he chose the words \u201cattention economy\u201d is meaningful. Facebook and the data brokers are not too big to fight, provided we have agencies that understand how our attention and information are currency to big technology companies. That means staffing, resources, a clear mandate to protect privacy and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-07-23/facebook-negotiated-its-rules\">actual laws that move more invasive forms of data collection</url> from an industry standard to something that\u2019s illegal. It also means reorienting punishments around the resource we\u2019re trying to protect: data. If we want to reform the data brokers, then we must build agencies that force them to change the way they collect our information.</p><p>And on Tuesday afternoon the Justice Department announced it will open <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/technology/justice-department-tech-antitrust.html\">an antitrust review</url> of big tech \u2014 a move that, unlike paltry fines, actually caused       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/23/doj-reportedly-to-open-broad-antitrust-review-of-big-tech-tech-stocks-dip.html\">tech stocks to drop</url>. </p><p>From the Archives: Another Privacy Newsletter!</p><p>Today\u2019s trip to the archives focuses on a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/14/news/a-lobbyist-guards-his-and-others-privacy.html\">1991 profile of Robert Ellis Smith</url>, who wrote an analog monthly newsletter on privacy, titled \u201cThe Privacy Journal.\u201d Some gems include:</p><p>\u201cMr. Smith\u2019s timing, however, was good. In the early 1970s, computers became widespread. As data tapes whirled, Mr. Smith saw images of an Orwellian society where Government and businesses could know too much about an individual\u2019s life and likes. That information quickly became a commodity for marketers. And it was used to decide whether someone should be hired for a job or extended credit. \u201cWhat I soon discovered was that there was often not any need for the information that was being collected, or respect for its accuracy,\u201d Mr. Smith said.\u201d</p><p>Smith\u2019s work shows how our privacy conversation, though much more complex, isn\u2019t all that different in tenor from decades ago. Mentions of \u201cThe Privacy Journal\u201d go back decades in The Times\u2019s archives, including in this now quaint 1977 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/12/archives/privacy-battles-with-the-computer-privacy-and-the-computer.html\">piece by Cokie Roberts</url>, titled \u201cPrivacy: Battles With the Computer,\u201d which is still quite relatable!</p><p>Mr. Smith sprinkles his newsletter with such horrible examples, to inform readers of the need to combat invasions of privacy. Currently about 2,000 people subscribe to the journal at $45 a year. Mr. Smith believes half of them are professionals in the computer field who think they should \u201cknow the enemy\u201d \u2014 him \u2014 while the other half are interested citizens or civil libertarians.</p><p>Smith <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/robert-ellis-smith-lawyer-who-published-journal-on-privacy-dies-at-77/2018/08/09/2d6fdd96-9a5b-11e8-8d5e-c6c594024954_story.html?utm_term=.7324619e60c2\">died last August</url> so I\u2019m dedicating this week\u2019s edition to his trailblazing legacy. </p><p>[If you\u2019re online \u2014 and, well, you are \u2014 chances are someone is using your information. We\u2019ll tell you what you can do about it. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/privacy-project?action=click&amp;module=Intentional&amp;pgtype=Article\">Sign up for our limited-run newsletter</url>.]</p><p>Tip of the Week: Don\u2019t Install Sketchy Software</p><p>Last week\u2019s viral privacy scare centered around FaceApp, an AI-powered way to make yourself look old. Users uploaded pictures of their faces, privacy advocates freaked out and conspiracy theorists and even some politicos worried that maybe it was all a Russian intelligence operation. As <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/opinion/faceapp-privacy.html\">I wrote last week</url>, there\u2019s an upside to the whole fiasco, which is that it got people thinking critically about the random apps they download. </p><p>You should get in the habit of interrogating every new app before downloading, regardless of where the company is based. Figure out what permissions it asks for, what it does with your information and ask: Is this sketchy? But don\u2019t take it from me, my Wirecutter colleague Thorin Klosowski created <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/guides/privacy-project/how-to-protect-your-digital-privacy\">some great instructions</url> as part of our Privacy Project guide that might help you practice safe app downloading. Here\u2019s a relevant excerpt:</p><p>DON\u2019T INSTALL SKETCHY SOFTWARE</p><p>Why: Every weird app you install on your phone and every browser extension or piece of software you download from a sketchy website represents another potential privacy and security hole. Countless mobile apps track your <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html\">location everywhere you go</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/19/technology/phone-apps-stalking.html\">harvest your data</url> without asking consent,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/12/technology/kids-apps-data-privacy-google-twitter.html\">even in children\u2019s apps</url>.</p><p>How: Stop downloading garbage software, and stick to downloading programs and browser extensions directly from their makers and official app stores. You don\u2019t need half the apps on your phone, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/18/smarter-living/wirecutter/declutter-speed-up-phone.html\">getting rid of what you don\u2019t need</url> can make your phone feel faster. Once you clear out the apps you don\u2019t use, audit the privacy permissions of what\u2019s left. If you have an iPhone, open Settings and tap the Privacy option. On Android, head to Settings &amp;gt; Apps, and then tap the gear icon and select App Permissions. Here, you can see which apps have       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/technology/prevent-location-data-sharing.html\">access to your location</url>, contacts, microphone, and other data. Disable permissions where they don\u2019t make sense \u2014 for example, Google Maps needs your location to function, but your notes app doesn\u2019t. In the future, think about app permissions as you install new software; if an app is free, it\u2019s possibly collecting and selling your data.</p><p>The same rules go for your computer. If you\u2019re not sure what to delete from your Windows computer, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.shouldiremoveit.com/\">Should I Remove It?</url> can help you choose. (Yes, it\u2019s more software, but you should delete it after you\u2019re done using it.) Mac users don\u2019t have an equivalent, but all software resides in the Applications folder, so it\u2019s easy to sift through. If you find an app you don\u2019t remember installing, search for it on Google, and then drag it to the trash to delete it if you don\u2019t need it.</p><p>Additionally: Connecticut\u2019s Attorney General <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/AGWilliamTong/status/1153378002262212610?s=20\">created a nice infographic</url> that\u2019s similar to this that you can see here.</p><p>What I\u2019m Reading:</p><p>Going to let these headline speak for themselves. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/19/babys-first-smart-diaper-pampers-takes-wearables-whole-new-level/?utm_term=.c5fcbfd37281\">Baby\u2019s first smart diaper: Pampers takes \u2018wearables\u2019 to a whole new level.</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://thinkprogress.org/exclusive-steve-bannon-geofencing-data-collection-catholic-church-4aaeacd5c182/\">Catholics in Iowa went to church.

We should bring on the   breakup  of big tech and the online privacy laws that are way overdue.\u00a0But a healthy public sphere needs a healthy public media. We've built the equivalent for television and radio. Now it's time to do it for the Internet. The simplest way to proceed is to tax major technology companies to pay for better content. But Congress and the FCC could also take creative advantage of these services to get high-quality news and smart children's programming in front of all Americans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act into law to spur the development of noncommercial radio and TV programming \"that will be responsive to the interests of people,\" and \"that addresses the needs of unserved and underserved audiences, particularly children and minorities.\" The result was publicly funded classics such as \"Sesame Street\" and \"Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood,\" as well as investigative news such as \"Frontline\" and educational programs such as \"Nova\" - freely distributed for all.\u00a0 </p><p>But public media's power to educate generations and inform citizens is diminishing in an ever-more-digitized landscape that amplifies junk and misinformation, and queues up creepy kid-show   knockoffs  instead of quality programming. To the degree that there is a public interest at work here, it is an interest in what you are clicking, buying and liking, not in information on consumers as citizens.\u00a0 </p><p>Perhaps we ought to be grateful that Facebook recently pledged to \"invest\" $300 million in local media initiatives, joining Google, which also promised $300 million to \"build a stronger future for news.\"\u00a0But the Corporation for Public Broadcasting's budget is only about $445 million . Funding for local public media by all state governments combined is roughly $235 million. According to financial reports by PBS and NPR, individual contributions from activities like pledge drives are even less than that. American journalism will now be subsidized by big tech at a level on par with public funding.  That should make us all uncomfortable, especially given the tech industry's powerful interest in controlling its image and maintaining public trust.\u00a0 </p><p>Americans like public media. NPR still consistently  ranks among the most trusted news sources. Likewise, Americans have  rated PBS among the most trusted institutions in the United States for the past decade and a half, according to polls conducted on PBS's behalf. But these services operate in an increasingly challenging environment. Government cuts have forced public media to become far more dependent on listener contributions, sponsorships and private donors.\u00a0These organizations have had to chase audiences migrating to private platforms along with the rest of the media, meeting audiences \"where they're at.\"\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>To their credit, public media have made an impressive effort to upgrade on a dime. PBS  states that its Digital Studios division averaged more than 38 million views per month on YouTube.\u00a0NPR recently co-published a  report about the promise of smart-speaker devices such as Amazon Echo for audience growth.</p><p>Still, we ought to be leery of the conditions under which public media is increasingly forced to operate. Tech companies own many of the railways on which the rest of the media runs.\u00a0Public broadcasters have had to strike deals with tech giants and pay cable channels, the most prominent being the move by \"Sesame Street\" to HBO. They vie for attention on social media feeds that exist to sell advertising and generate lucrative streams of consumer data. How can public media navigate the tricky matter of serving the public interest when their access to the public is through an algorithmic black box someone else owns entirely?\u00a0 </p><p>Rather than let public broadcasters who have accrued so much public trust languish - or, worse, be co-opted by a tech industry that has a vast interest in how its portrayed - both our federal and state governments need to play a more active role in public media's health and digital future.\u00a0 </p><p>A billion-dollar federal funding infusion to upgrade public media would be a start - perhaps paid for by a \"journalism tax\" on the largest tech platforms, as has been proposed in Britain.\u00a0 </p><p>But Congress could also grant the FCC an updated mandate to guarantee that high-quality educational and informational public media is distributed on major tech platforms at limited or no cost to the public.\u00a0There's precedent to do so: In the '90s, Congress passed the Children's Television Act, which gave the FCC regulatory authority to require commercial TV broadcasters to air such content.</p><p>Today's equivalent might be to require Netflix and Amazon to air PBS shows on free limited subscriptions available to parents on low incomes, and for Facebook to advertise these subscriptions and other public media content to new parents as well.\u00a0 </p><p>The same approach could be taken for news.\u00a0We could require the largest social media sites to provide an opt-in public media updates service, notifying users in a county or region when their public media station is broadcasting live or reporting breaking news, and letting them know where to tune in directly on the platform. Telecommunications providers such as AT&amp;T could be required to provide free access to public media on their hotspots.\u00a0This kind of regulation would recognize that it is not enough to create more high-quality public media content without\u00a0 making sure the platforms on which they're delivered make that content easy to access.</p><p>The FCC did propose to  update its children's television rules last summer, but the Republican-led commission has sought to roll back the requirements for TV broadcasters while imposing no new ones for online platforms.\u00a0In an official   blog post, FCC Commissioner Michael O'Rielly  argued that such requirements are outdated in the Internet age, and he's right.\u00a0However, the solution is not a return to the same kind of free-market wasteland Newton Minow decried in 1961.</p><p>What the Internet needs is a fresh infusion of public media, properly funded and paired with federal policy that puts the public interest first.\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-5fe4dfe4391411e9a2cd307b06d0257b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VH7-HXX1-JB4M-V4D6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1060\"/><timeReceived>3:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 25, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC000287N</classCode><className>CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
