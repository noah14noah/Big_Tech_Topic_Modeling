He wrote that, 'When our engineers work tirelessly to improve security[5], we imagine we're protecting you against criminals, not our own government.'<br/> The IBM statement, which was issued by Robert Weber, the company's senior vice president in charge of legal and regulatory affairs, claims that, 'IBM hasn't provided client data to the NSA or any other government agency under any surveillance[6] program involving bulk collection of content or metadata.' He added, 'If the U.S. government were to serve a <person><nameText>national security </nameText></person>order on IBM to obtain data from an enterprise client and impose a gag order that prohibits IBM from notifying that client, IBM will take appropriate steps to challenge the gag order through judicial action or other means,' per Reuters.<br/><br/>The letter is the most recent in a series of tech company backlashes against a recent report that the NSA has used websites to break into computers, and is most likely meant to reassure the company's clients. Experts have estimated that the recent NSA revelations could cost big tech companies like IBM billions of dollars over the next few years if their international clients choose to take their business elsewhere, Time[7] reports.<br/> In its letter, IBM added that its company is different from other companies mentioned in the report because its clients are mainly other businesses and organizations, therefore, the company deals primarily with business data rather than telephone and internet-based communication services.<br/> Similar to <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>harshly-worded post, Weber also criticized the surveillance programs leaked by Snowden. He wrote that, 'Governments should not subvert commercial technologies, such as encryption, that are intended to protect business data,' and that the U.S. government should have a 'robust debate' regarding surveillance programs.<br/> Companies are finding it necessary to address client and customer concerns about security following the release of a report leaked by <person><nameText>Edward Snowden </nameText></person>that the NSA has 'co-opted' more than 140,000 computers since August of 2007 in order to implant them with spying software. The report was published by the Intercept on Wednesday; the NSA has since responded with a statement claiming that 'reports of indiscriminate computer exploitation operations are simply false,' per Reuters[8].<br/>More From Wall Street Cheat Sheet:<br/><person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>Lambasts the NSA, Calls Obama to Complain[9] Snowden Tells SXSW Audience: NSA Is 'Setting

Enquanto o mercado esperava apenas pela prorroga\u00e7\u00e3o do aux\u00edlio emergencial hoje, o presidente Jair Bolsonaro surpreendeu e informou que enviar\u00e1 ao Congresso Nacional na pr\u00f3xima quinta-feira (3) a proposta de reforma administrativa.   Ao mesmo tempo, o ministro da Economia, Paulo Guedes, afirmou a senadores que a reforma tribut\u00e1ria e a Proposta de Emenda \u00e0 Constitui\u00e7\u00e3o (PEC) do Pacto Federativo tamb\u00e9m ser\u00e3o encaminhadas em breve.   \u201cO Congresso trabalha incessantemente para modificar o marco regulat\u00f3rio e destravar os investimentos. Estamos encaminhando as reformas administrativa e tribut\u00e1ria, al\u00e9m da PEC do Pacto Federativo\u201d, disse Guedes.   De acordo com o ministro, o Pacto Federativo j\u00e1 est\u00e1 pronto para ser disparado ao Congresso \u201cassim que a pol\u00edtica ditar o momento para isso\u201d.   Sobre o aux\u00edlio emergencial, como esperado, a prorroga\u00e7\u00e3o ter\u00e1 mais quatro parcelas de R$ 300. O valor atual do benef\u00edcio \u00e9 R$ 600.   Diante dessas not\u00edcias, o benchmark da Bolsa brasileira teve alta de 2,82%, aos 102.167 pontos com volume financeiro negociado de R$ 26,657 bilh\u00f5es.   Enquanto isso, o d\u00f3lar comercial caiu 1,75% a R$ 5,3845 na compra e a R$ 5,385 na venda. O d\u00f3lar futuro para outubro registra queda de 2,17%, a R$ 5,378 no after-market .   No mercado de juros futuros, o DI para janeiro de 2022 teve baixa de sete pontos-base a 2,79%, o DI para janeiro de 2023 recuou nove pontos, a 3,97%, o DI para janeiro de 2025 registrou perdas de 15 pontos-base a 5,77% e o DI para janeiro de 2027 caiu 14 pontos-base a 6,73%.   Hoje pela manh\u00e3 houve a divulga\u00e7\u00e3o dos dados do Produto Interno Bruto (PIB) brasileiro no segundo trimestre. A economia do Pa\u00eds sofreu uma contra\u00e7\u00e3o de 9,7% no per\u00edodo, na compara\u00e7\u00e3o com o primeiro trimestre na s\u00e9rie com ajuste sazonal.   Este dado veio um pouco pior que a expectativa mediana dos economistas, que era de um recuo de 9,2% no segundo trimestre na compara\u00e7\u00e3o com os tr\u00eas primeiros meses do ano, de acordo com a pesquisa Bloomberg. A medi\u00e7\u00e3o anterior foi revisada para queda de 2,5%, de -1,5% anteriormente.   Outro destaque no notici\u00e1rio nacional \u00e9 o Or\u00e7amento para 2021, que foi enviado na noite de ontem ao Congresso. Somando os d\u00e9ficits esperados entre 2021 e 2023, o buraco \u00e9 de R$ 572,9 bilh\u00f5es.   L\u00e1 fora, depois dos \u00edndices Dow Jones e S&amp;P 500 consolidarem seus maiores ganhos para um m\u00eas de agosto desde a d\u00e9cada de 1980 , as bolsas americanas voltaram a subir, desta vez impulsionadas pela valoriza\u00e7\u00e3o de 4% das a\u00e7\u00f5es da Apple depois da companhia realizar um desdobramento.   Essa opera\u00e7\u00e3o tornou os pap\u00e9is da big tech mais acess\u00edveis e com mais liquidez. Diversos analistas revisaram para cima suas proje\u00e7\u00f5es para a empresa.   O tom mais positivo do exterior veio tamb\u00e9m do \u00cdndice de Gerentes de Compras (PMI) da Caixin/Markit da China em agosto, que ficou em 53,1 pontos. Leituras acima de 50 indicam expans\u00e3o, enquanto resultados inferiores a 50 revelam retra\u00e7\u00e3o.   O resultado superou as expectativas e causou uma alta do yuan frente ao d\u00f3lar, ao ficar no n\u00edvel mais alto desde janeiro de 2011. Tamb\u00e9m foi o quarto m\u00eas consecutivo acima da marca de 50.   Ao mesmo tempo, o desemprego na zona do euro subiu, enquanto os efeitos do coronav\u00edrus continuam a ser sentidos. A taxa de desemprego na regi\u00e3o foi de 7,9% em julho, mostrando uma deteriora\u00e7\u00e3o do cen\u00e1rio. No entanto, o n\u00famero ainda est\u00e1 abaixo do recorde visto no meio da crise.  Or\u00e7amento de 2021  O governo enviou ontem ao Congresso a proposta de Or\u00e7amento para 2021, que prev\u00ea um d\u00e9ficit nas contas p\u00fablicas at\u00e9 2023. Somando os d\u00e9ficits esperados entre 2021 e 2023, o buraco \u00e9 de R$ 572,9 bilh\u00f5es, de acordo com O Estado de S.Paulo .   No ano que vem, a expectativa \u00e9 de d\u00e9ficit de R$ 233,6 bilh\u00f5es; em 2022, o resultado deve ficar negativo em R$ 185,5 bilh\u00f5es; j\u00e1 em 2023, faltar\u00e3o R$ 153,8 bilh\u00f5es para fechar as contas do governo.   No entanto, o governo destacou que os gastos da pandemia ficar\u00e3o restritos a 2020.   O governo reservou para 2021 R$ 34,8 bilh\u00f5es para gastar com o Bolsa Fam\u00edlia no ano que vem, segundo O Globo . O Renda Brasil ficou de fora do projeto de lei or\u00e7ament\u00e1ria.   Outro destaque do texto \u00e9 a insufici\u00eancia de R$ 453,715 bilh\u00f5es para que seja cumprida a regra de ouro no pr\u00f3ximo ano. Esta regra pro\u00edbe que o governo tome financiamentos para pagar gastos correntes, como o pagamento de sal\u00e1rios, por exemplo. Por isso, o governo precisar\u00e1 da autoriza\u00e7\u00e3o do Congresso para realizar estes gastos.   Tamb\u00e9m chamou aten\u00e7\u00e3o o fato de que o governo desistiu de dar mais recursos \u00e0 Defesa do que \u00e0 Educa\u00e7\u00e3o em 2021.   Al\u00e9m disso, a previs\u00e3o que consta da proposta de Or\u00e7amento para 2021 prev\u00ea uma alta de 3,2% no PIB do ano que vem. A proje\u00e7\u00e3o para o sal\u00e1rio m\u00ednimo \u00e9 de R$ 1.067, alta de 2,1% ante o valor atual de R$ 1.045.  Aux\u00edlio emergencial  De acordo com a Folha de S. Paulo , a amplia\u00e7\u00e3o do aux\u00edlio por quatro meses a R$ 300 deve aumentar os gastos da Uni\u00e3o neste ano em mais R$ 100 bilh\u00f5es. Com isso, o governo vai chegar a um n\u00famero in\u00e9dito, com d\u00e9ficit de R$ 1 trilh\u00e3o nas contas p\u00fablicas em 2020.   Outro destaque no notici\u00e1rio brasileiro \u00e9 a conclus\u00e3o das investiga\u00e7\u00f5es sobre um suposto esquema de \u201crachadinhas\u201d que teria sido comandado pelo senador Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro quando era deputado federal. Segundo a CNN, o Grupo de Atua\u00e7\u00e3o Especializada no Combate \u00e0 Corrup\u00e7\u00e3o do Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico do Rio considerou encerradas as investiga\u00e7\u00f5es.   O resultado foi encaminhado ao procurador-geral de Justi\u00e7a do Rio, Eduardo Gussem, que repassou o material para o subprocurador da \u00e1rea criminal, Ricardo Ribeiro Martins. Ele poder\u00e1 pedir novas investiga\u00e7\u00f5es ou apresentar a den\u00fancia ao \u00d3rg\u00e3o Especial do Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a do Rio.   Ainda no notici\u00e1rio corporativo, segundo a CNN, o presidente Bolsonaro foi diagnosticado com c\u00e1lculo renal e far\u00e1 uma cirurgia para retir\u00e1-lo em setembro.  Radar corporativo  O mercado vai repercutir hoje os balan\u00e7os divulgados na v\u00e9spera pela Lojas Renner ( LREN3 ), pela IMC ( MEAL3 ) e pelo grupo Technos ( TECN3 ).   A Lojas Renner registrou um lucro l\u00edquido de R$ 818,1 milh\u00f5es no segundo trimestre, alta de 254,5% na compara\u00e7\u00e3o anual. O resultado foi impulsionado pelo reconhecimento de R$ 1 bilh\u00e3o referente a um cr\u00e9dito fiscal.

O banco brasileiro vai herdar os clientes do private banking do J.P.Morgan, que est\u00e1 deixando de atuar neste segmento no Brasil.   Ainda no notici\u00e1rio corporativo, a Pague Menos precificou a sua oferta de a\u00e7\u00f5es (IPO), mas teve que dar um desconto em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao pre\u00e7o inicialmente previsto.

Icahn held back the verbal punches he's thrown at eBay CEO <person><nameText>John Donahoe </nameText></person>and board members <person><nameText>Marc Andreessen </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Scott Cook </nameText></person>in previous letters, and instead laid out reasons why he believes the 20% spin off would be good for eBay, PayPaland shareholders. </p><p>Some ideas where spot on, others might have missed the mark. First, here's Icahn's arguments for an eBay / PayPalspin off: 1) It would unlock value: Currently, we believe the fair market value of eBay and PayPalare shrouded by a conglomerate discount. When compared to other e-commerce companies (such as Amazon) and financial services companies (such as Visa and MasterCard), eBay has trailed its peers in both valuation and performance over all relevant time periods. 2) It would create more-focused management: In our opinion, eBay and PayPalwould benefit tremendously from having their own independent management teams focused only on making the best strategic decisions regarding the long-term health of their respective businesses. We believe that independent management teams, together with newly constituted boards of directors (as further described below), would bring an increased level of focus to the decisions that need to be made as eBay and PayPaltravel along different trajectories. 3) PayPalcould attract better talent: We believe the stock of an independent PayPalwould be a valuable currency for future acquisition opportunities. Ebay recently paid $800 million in cash to acquire Braintree on behalf of PayPal. We believe consolidation in the currently fragmented and quickly developing payment processing industry is inevitable, and an independent PayPal, armed with its own stock as currency, will be better able to participate advantageously in that inevitable consolidation. 4) It could free PayPalup to form new partnerships: For example, we believe a standalone PayPalwould be more able to pursue potential strategic partnerships with other industry leaders, such as Visa, MasterCard, Google, Facebook, Alibaba, etc., that could solidify PayPal's long-term relevance. 5) It maintains the current eBay/PayPalmojo: We believe that the only potentially legitimate defense that eBay's management has offered to date - certain synergies that result from keeping eBay and PayPaltogether - can be maintained through a contractual business relationship consummated before an IPO and do not actually require eBay owning 100% of PayPal. 6) PayPalcould move faster and make itself into a bank: We believe PayPalhas a significant opportunity to expand its product offerings to include check writing, direct deposits, interest on PayPalbalances and other financial conveniences that consumers expect, which were highlighted by David O. Sacks, one of the original architects of PayPal.[6] Under the current eBay leadership, PayPalhas actually removed beneficial services to customers such as providing interest on PayPaldeposits. We believe that focus from a dedicated management team, unencumbered by competing agendas, could drive more innovation at a faster pace. 7) It would create more focused boards: We believe PayPalhas a significant opportunity to expand its product offerings to include check writing, direct deposits, interest on PayPalbalances and other financial conveniences that consumers expect, which were highlighted by David O. Sacks, one of the original architects of PayPal.[6] Under the current eBay leadership, PayPalhas actually removed beneficial services to customers such as providing interest on PayPaldeposits. We believe that focus from a dedicated management team, unencumbered by competing agendas, could drive more innovation at a faster pace. I agree that the spin off would unlock value to shareholders currently trapped in the two-headed company. Ebay's marketplace business and PayPal's payment business are different beasts with two different earning multiples (Bank of America annalist, Justin Post, puts a 14x multiple on eBay and a 22x multiple on PayPal). By spinning off PayPal, you can reap the difference, and give investors a clear vision of how the companies plan to grow and make money. I also think the spin off would open PayPalup to new partnerships (after all, big tech retailers-and potential customers-like Amazon see eBay as a competitor) and would give more freedom for PayPalto act like a bank. As I wrote before, both <person><nameText>Elon Musk </nameText></person>and David Sacks think that PayPalcould be the largest bank on the planet and eventually hit a valuation of $100 billion-but it can't make that leap while still part of eBay (for one, eBay doesn't want to be regulated like a bank, nor should it want to). PayPalcould split off and become a financial company all while (as Icahn, Musk and Sacks argue) keep the profitable synergy with eBay's marketplace business through a contract. I don't agree, however, with the Icahn proposal that the spin off would help PayPalattract new talent and create new products-PayPalis already doing that. PayPal's new president David Marcus has been busy overhauling the payment company since he took over two years ago. He's made smart acquisitions (Braintree), rebuilt the entire technology stack (Node.js!), launched new products (PayPalHere, PayPalmobile wallet, PayPalBeacon) and attracted top talent like Bill Scot (Netflix) Arnold Goldberg (Box) and Stan Chudnovsky (Iron Pearl). Ebay and PayPalmust separate one day-. In 2013 PayPal's revenue grew 20% to $6.6 billion-41% of eBay's total revenue and 36% of its profits. In the next few years, PayPalwill overtake eBay's marketplace business and would likely be spun off soon after. But for now, eBay is adamant about holding onto PayPaland has created a special website dubbed 'Better Together' to defend it's stance against Icahn's complaints.Source: Forbes<br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IFRU11417813952675195213071700</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IFRU-114178</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BSJ-GVF1-F03R-N1FH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"997\"/><timeReceived>10:18 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>I4U News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>March 19, 2014 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0002E8X</classCode><className>EBAY INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC000266V</classCode><className>VISA INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS454112 ELECTRONIC AUCTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

The gains came as Amazon was able to grow profit despite spending heavily and cutting prices to compete with everyone from data storage companies to high street shops and groceries.</p><p>Amazon's rise to dominance in the retail sector was clear from JCPenney's warning that it was forced to sell inventory at a loss to clear a backlog in stores. Shares of the department store and peers such as Sears Holding are worth a fraction of what they were 10 years ago, before Amazon's heyday.</p><p>Analysts at brokerage Wells Fargo warned that Amazon could replicate that success in other fields as its technology appears to be \"adaptable\".</p><p>Fears of Amazon's expansion may also have forced one of the biggest mergers of the current cycle. Pharmacy chain CVS Health is reportedly close to buying health insurer Aetna for US$66 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal. That report hit the tape in the same afternoon as news that Amazon had received licences to sell pharmaceuticals in several states.</p><p>Another stock that hit a record high was the once-stodgy Microsoft. \"You have Microsoft, which many had declared a has-been some years ago, delivering with a refocused business and cut costs, and along the way joining the new headliners in tech,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.</p><p>Apple's pie</p><p>Another first-generation tech company, Apple, is poised near a record high after reports that its premium iPhone X is in such demand in the US that customers will have to wait weeks for theirs to be delivered.</p><p>During a decade of iPhone sales, Apple has generated hundreds of billions of dollars in cash that's currently sitting in bank accounts worldwide. \"Total cash spending will be flat in 2017 given high political, regulatory, monetary, and fiscal policy uncertainties that have weighed on capital deployment,\" said the Goldman analysts, in a note to clients.</p><p>With those policies becoming more clear for next year, corporations like Apple are likely to spend more cash in 2018, said the Goldman analysts. If, as the Trump administration has promised, corporations are allowed to repatriate profits as part of corporate tax cuts, there could be even more incentive to spend.</p><p>\"The passage of corporate tax reform is the largest potential upside risk to our forecast.\" The Goldman analysts assign a roughly two-in-three chance of a tax cut.</p><p>The other big variable for stocks is the Federal Reserve's rate hike plans. The Fed's meeting this week is unlikely to produce any change in policy, apart from plans to sell bonds. But Friday's jobs report could be a crucial factor in the central bank's decision on whether or not to hike rates in December.</p><p>Shares of commercial banks, which benefit from higher rates, sold off while shares of utilities, which are thought to suffer when rates rise, rebounded, after reports that President Trump could name Fed governor Jerome Powell as the successor to Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen. Mr Powell is seen as less likely to raise rates than some of the other candidates.</p><p>READ MORE: US healthcare industry shudders at sound of Amazon's footsteps</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-177880</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PV2-4BW1-JCF2-815F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"810\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 30, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC0001UJF</classCode><className>WELLS FARGO &amp;

ICBA agrees with Chairman Quarles that while technological innovation promises a more efficient financial system, monolithic tech firms and the decentralization of financial transactions pose risks to financial stability.</p><p>\"For instance, ICBA continues calling on policymakers to close a legal loophole that allows industrial loan companies and their parent companies to skirt regulatory oversight, endangering consumers and the economy. ICBA's recent 'Industrial Loan Companies: Closing the Loophole to Avert Consumer and Systemic Harm' white paper calls on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to impose an immediate moratorium on approving deposit insurance for these companies and urges Congress to close the ILC loophole permanently.</p><p>\"The ILC loophole allows commercial interests to own full-service banks while avoiding key regulations and consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve-threatening the financial system, creating an uneven regulatory playing field, and violating the longstanding U.S. policy of separating banking and commerce. Any company that wishes to own a full-service bank should be subject to the same restrictions and supervision that apply to any other bank holding company.</p><p>\"In this era of big data, tech conglomerates, and artificial intelligence, we should stop and think before giving massive tech companies further reach into the economic lives of Americans. ICBA and community bankers look forward to engaging in discussion with Chairman Quarles and other policymakers to support a safe and sound financial system and to maintain the separation of banking and commerce.\"</p><p>About ICBA</p><p>The Independent Community Bankers of America creates and promotes an environment where community banks flourish. With more than 52,000 locations nationwide, community banks constitute 99 percent of all banks, employ more than 760,000 Americans and are the only physical banking presence in one in five U.S. counties. Holding more than $4.9 trillion in assets, $3.9 trillion in deposits, and $3.4 trillion in loans to consumers, small businesses and the agricultural community, community banks channel local deposits into the Main Streets and neighborhoods they serve, spurring job creation, fostering innovation and fueling their customers' dreams in communities throughout America.

The ILC loophole in the Bank Holding Company Act allows commercial interests to own full-service banks, avoid consolidated supervision, and threaten the financial system. Conditions imposed by the FDIC, whether in the approvals or the proposed rule, are insufficient to alleviate these concerns.</p><p>\"To mitigate risks to the financial system, ICBA continues to call on the FDIC to refrain from approving any additional deposit insurance applications submitted by ILCs until the proposed rulemaking is finalized. Further, the FDIC should hold a hearing on each of the remaining ILC applications and require applicants' owners and affiliates to commit to divesting their commercial interests and meeting the same restrictions as community bank holding companies.</p><p>\"In a comprehensive white paper issued last year, ICBA fully detailed the transformation of the ILC charter into the fashionable charter of choice for fintech and Big Tech firms seeking to benefit from the federal safety net while avoiding legal restrictions and company oversight.</p><p>\"Recognizing the dangers of mixing banking and commerce, both the FDIC and Congress have previously placed moratoriums on the use of ILCs.

The chief executive and founder of Farsight Security, a cyber consultancy based in California, is one of the internet's pioneers having been heavily involved in the development 30 years ago of the domain naming system (DNS), the address book of the web.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"All war is a matter of economics. It continues until one side lacks the resources to continue. That's the approach we take to cyber security - to make what online criminals are trying to do both difficult and expensive. For them,\" he says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dr Vixie, who holds a PhD in computer science, was in Dublin last week for International Data Protection Day. He has said that the (EURO)50 million fine handed to Google by a French watchdog for infringements of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will be \"the first brick to fall\" in a spate of privacy actions that could change the face of big tech as we know it. He may be right - similar actions have been filed against Twitter and Facebook with Helen Dixon, Ireland's data protection commissioner, while online privacy activists such as Max Schrems continue to push back against the Facebooks of this world.</p><p>Dr Vixie admits he \"hates\" the fact that tech companies tend to turn a profit by monetising what they know about their customers. \"This is the kind of thing I would have expected humanity to make a conscious decision about for the common good, rather than allowing it to happen because it's profitable for a few pioneers,\" he says.</p><p>Starting out as a software engineer with the now-defunct computer manufacturer Digital Equipment Corporation in the late 1980s, Dr Vixie soon came to prominence. He made his name for his work on email technologies and DNS, the hierarchical address-naming system invented in 1985.</p><p>That work, among other things, won him a place in the Internet Hall of Fame in 2014, which Dr Vixie dismisses as being a \"small matter\".</p><p>From there, things were not entirely plain sailing for him. He formed the world's first anti-spam company Maps in 1996, and thus learned from what he says is the most important business mistake he's ever made: \"If you're going into a situation that has dangers you should enumerate them, and then figure out your backup plan. I didn't do any of that. I came up with a distributed reputation system, so people could consult us as to whether or not a company could be trusted. Unfortunately if you're dealing with a larger company that has bought over a bulk mail company that is in the spamming business, it will turn out that larger company has more lawyers than you have cells in your body. And I was openly acknowledging what I was doing, that we were the reason these mailing firms couldn't spam you. And so I got sued. I got sued a lot, in fact I'm the most sued person I've ever met. And in the end I had to sell the company in 2002.</p><p>\"I've learned not to put myself in harm's way to quite the same extent, although I do still do it a little. I like to work close to the fire where the tools are, I suppose you could say it's one of my charms,\" he says.</p><p>\"So I am not one of the tech billionaires. Though I know many of them. I guess that's close.\"</p><p>Not that he's complaining - Dr Vixie's career has been defined by a keen altruistic streak. He had formed the not-for-profit Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) in the Nineties to handle the intellectual property rights of a free naming software he had written, called Bind, still prevalent today. \"We had a 100 per cent market share in 1995 because we were the only thing that was both free and worked.\" ISC also had responsibility for attempting to fundraise from Bind's users in order to finance programmers to work on and debug the product, not dissimilar to Wikipedia's call for support from its users today.</p><p>\"Fund raising for non profits is like pushing on a rope. I learned my lesson and will not do it again. At some point I had enough. I didn't want to do it any more. However the company was mine, I had recruited for it, so I couldn't just walk away. And that's when we started the project that would become Farsight,\" he says.</p><p>Farsight's approach is one of consultation, Dr Vixie says. It aims to de-anonymise cyber criminals, so that they can't just move on from one victim to the next, because what they're doing makes them identifiable.</p><p>\"We are an observational service. What our clients choose to do with the information we give them is up to them. There are a whole bunch of things that we make easy. We are trying to make it possible for the defenders to win the war of economics with the bad guys. As far as I know we are the only company to take this approach.\"</p><p>Farsight has grown from five employees in 2013 to 45 today, including the co-inventor of DNS Paul Mockapetris as director. It counts companies across the world among its clients, not to mention law enforcement agencies. Dr Vixie is tight-lipped on whether or not national governments have asked him to work for them, but he doesn't deny it. All this was achieved without Silicon Valley venture capital funding, principally because its growth \"is slower than a VC would demand\". \"Also, VCs don't make decisions that are necessarily good for the company they have invested in.</p><p>\"Throwing money at cybersecurity problems does not make them go away. Spending on cybersecurity worldwide has doubled in two years from 2016 to (EURO)120 billion,\" he says.</p><p>\"And there has been no observable positive result from this.</p><p>\"I saw this early and wanted to create a company that could change the rules of security. So I incorporated it from the remains of my own non-profit, and everything we had became Farsight. We didn't want to sell anti-virus, we wanted to get leverage on attackers and give defenders the advantage - so that if you attacked our client it would cost you, hurt you. So your victims can figure out who you are. In the DNS, all the assets an actor puts forward are connected via a sort of invisible metadata, and if you have a broad enough lens and the ability to understand what you're seeing, then you can de-anonymise your attacker.\"</p><p>He uses the analogy of the unlocked house to describe the internet security state of play at present. \"It used to be the case that in the real world many people could leave their home unlocked because in order to capitalise on that someone would have to approach the door. But online, it's the equivalent of everyone having their front doors unlocked, and anyone in the world can get in any time they want. And if you leave that door unlocked it will get broken into, that is guaranteed.\"</p><p>Farsight runs what Dr Vixie describes as \"one of the largest observational networks in the world, covering 22 time zones, making 200,000 individual observations per second\".</p><p>He says that his aim is to \"run up the bad guys' costs\", but adds there are downsides to the approach. \"Firstly, you show them that what they've just tried doesn't work, and they are heavily financed and incentivised to find a way that does work. Secondly, they may move on to the next victim who may not be quite so well protected as you are. The internet supply chain should be your attacker's weakness.</p><p>\"Say they're using bandwidth in South America, after we have provided the information, a client should be able to go to their supplier and say 'your customer is hurting me, what are you going to do about it?'. But that is not the average case, most attacks come from places where the supply chain will not co-operate.\"</p><p>Global losses from cyber crime will total $5 trillion in the next five years, he says. \"That's not a figure you can ignore. It's a fifth of America's national debt.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Dr Vixie has one great desire - that a version of GDPR will eventually come to his industry. He prides himself on running a business that doesn't deal in personally identifiable information (PII), a fact that makes his product particularly attractive to law enforcement given its legal robustness.</p><p>\"We are operating in that manner, and I would very much like my competitors to have to behave the way I do. Because you can build some pretty sexy stuff if you don't care that PII is mixed into it.</p><p>\"That isn't how we work, I want to be able to leave a trail of digital breadcrumbs behind me and not have targeted advertising be my thanks for doing so. So I have both a human reason and an economic reason for wanting GDPR to come to my industry.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Paul Vixie says data protection is good for the industryThe reality of hacking is more mundane than the world made famous in popularGETTY IMAGESculture but the dangers are no less real.

Unfortunately if you're dealing with a larger company that has bought over a bulk mail company that is in the spamming business, it will turn out that larger company has more lawyers than you have cells in your body. And I was openly acknowledging what I was doing, that we were the reason these mailing firms couldn't spam you. And so I got sued. I got sued a lot, in fact I'm the most sued person I've ever met. And in the end I had to sell the company in 2002.</p><p>\"I've learned not to put myself in harm's way to quite the same extent, although I do still do it a little. I like to work close to the fire where the tools are, I suppose you could say it's one of my charms,\" he says.</p><p>\"So I am not one of the tech billionaires. Though I know many of them. I guess that's close.\"</p><p>Not that he's complaining - Dr Vixie's career has been defined by a keen altruistic streak. He had formed the not-for-profit Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) in the Nineties to handle the intellectual property rights of a free naming software he had written, called Bind, still prevalent today. \"We had a 100 per cent market share in 1995 because we were the only thing that was both free and worked.\" ISC also had responsibility for attempting to fundraise from Bind's users in order to finance programmers to work on and debug the product, not dissimilar to Wikipedia's call for support from its users today.</p><p>\"Fund raising for non profits is like pushing on a rope. I learned my lesson and will not do it again. At some point I had enough. I didn't want to do it any more. However the company was mine, I had recruited for it, so I couldn't just walk away. And that's when we started the project that would become Farsight,\" he says.</p><p>Farsight's approach is one of consultation, Dr Vixie says. It aims to de-anonymise cyber criminals, so that they can't just move on from one victim to the next, because what they're doing makes them identifiable.</p><p>\"We are an observational service. What our clients choose to do with the information we give them is up to them. There are a whole bunch of things that we make easy. We are trying to make it possible for the defenders to win the war of economics with the bad guys. As far as I know we are the only company to take this approach.\"</p><p>Farsight has grown from five employees in 2013 to 45 today, including the co-inventor of DNS Paul Mockapetris as director. It counts companies across the world among its clients, not to mention law enforcement agencies. Dr Vixie is tight-lipped on whether or not national governments have asked him to work for them, but he doesn't deny it. All this was achieved without Silicon Valley venture capital funding, principally because its growth \"is slower than a VC would demand\". \"Also, VCs don't make decisions that are necessarily good for the company they have invested in.</p><p>\"Throwing money at cybersecurity problems does not make them go away. Spending on cybersecurity worldwide has doubled in two years from 2016 to (EURO)120 billion,\" he says.</p><p>\"And there has been no observable positive result from this.</p><p>\"I saw this early and wanted to create a company that could change the rules of security. So I incorporated it from the remains of my own non-profit, and everything we had became Farsight. We didn't want to sell anti-virus, we wanted to get leverage on attackers and give defenders the advantage - so that if you attacked our client it would cost you, hurt you. So your victims can figure out who you are. In the DNS, all the assets an actor puts forward are connected via a sort of invisible metadata, and if you have a broad enough lens and the ability to understand what you're seeing, then you can de-anonymise your attacker.\"</p><p>He uses the analogy of the unlocked house to describe the internet security state of play at present. \"It used to be the case that in the real world many people could leave their home unlocked because in order to capitalise on that someone would have to approach the door. But online, it's the equivalent of everyone having their front doors unlocked, and anyone in the world can get in any time they want. And if you leave that door unlocked it will get broken into, that is guaranteed.\"</p><p>Farsight runs what Dr Vixie describes as \"one of the largest observational networks in the world, covering 22 time zones, making 200,000 individual observations per second\".</p><p>He says that his aim is to \"run up the bad guys' costs\", but adds there are downsides to the approach. \"Firstly, you show them that what they've just tried doesn't work, and they are heavily financed and incentivised to find a way that does work. Secondly, they may move on to the next victim who may not be quite so well protected as you are. The internet supply chain should be your attacker's weakness.</p><p>\"Say they're using bandwidth in South America, after we have provided the information, a client should be able to go to their supplier and say 'your customer is hurting me, what are you going to do about it?'. But that is not the average case, most attacks come from places where the supply chain will not co-operate.\"</p><p>Global losses from cyber crime will total $5 trillion in the next five years, he says. \"That's not a figure you can ignore. It's a fifth of America's national debt.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Dr Vixie has one great desire - that a version of GDPR will eventually come to his industry. He prides himself on running a business that doesn't deal in personally identifiable information (PII), a fact that makes his product particularly attractive to law enforcement given its legal robustness.</p><p>\"We are operating in that manner, and I would very much like my competitors to have to behave the way I do. Because you can build some pretty sexy stuff if you don't care that PII is mixed into it.</p><p>\"That isn't how we work, I want to be able to leave a trail of digital breadcrumbs behind me and not have targeted advertising be my thanks for doing so. So I have both a human reason and an economic reason for wanting GDPR to come to my industry.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-51357633</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VB1-2P01-F021-6369-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1398\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 1, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Over the course of five weeks, I blocked Amazon , Facebook , Google , Microsoft , and Apple one at a time, to find out how to live in the modern age...</p><p>A couple of months ago, I set out to answer the question of whether it\u2019s possible to avoid the tech giants. Over the course of five weeks, I blocked Amazon , Facebook , Google , Microsoft , and Apple one at a time, to find out how to live in the modern age without each one.                     This article was originally published in 2019 and has been updated since its original publication.   To end my experiment, I\u2019m going to see if I can survive blocking all five at once.   Not only am I boycotting their products, a technologist named Dhruv Mehrotra designed a special network tool that prevents my devices from communicating with the tech giants\u2019 servers, meaning that ads and analytics from Google won\u2019t work, Facebook can\u2019t track me across the internet, and websites hosted by Amazon Web Services, or AWS, hypothetically won\u2019t load.   I am using a Linux laptop made by a company named Purism and a Nokia feature phone on which I am relearning the lost art of T9 texting .   I don\u2019t think I could have done this cold turkey. I needed to wean myself off various services in the lead-up, like an alcoholic going through the 12 steps. The tech giants, while troubling in their accumulation of data, power, and societal control, do offer services that make our lives a hell of a lot easier.   Earlier in the experiment, for example, I realised I don\u2019t know how to get in touch with people without the tech giants. Google, Apple, and Facebook provide my rolling Rolodex.   So in preparation for the week, I export all my contacts from Google, which amounts to a shocking 8,000 people. I have also whittled down the over 1,500 contacts in my iPhone to 143 people for my Nokia, or the number of people I actually talk to on a regular basis, which is incredibly close to Dunbar\u2019s number .   I wind up placing a lot of phone calls this week, because texting is so annoying on the Nokia\u2019s numbers-based keyboard. I find people often pick up on the first ring out of concern; they\u2019re not used to getting calls from me.  I don\u2019t think I could have done this cold turkey.  On the first day of the block, I drive to work in silence because my rented Ford Fusion\u2019s \u201cSYNC\u201d entertainment system is powered by Microsoft. Background noise in general disappears this week because YouTube, Apple Music, and our Echo are all banned\u2014as are Netflix, Spotify, and Hulu, because they rely on AWS and the Google Cloud to get their content to users.   The silence causes my mind to wander more than usual. Sometimes this leads to ideas for my half-finished zombie novel or inspires a new question for investigation. But more often than not, I dwell on things I need to do.   Many of these things are a lot more challenging as a result of the experiment, such as when I record an interview with Alex Goldman of the podcast Reply All about Facebook and its privacy problems.   I live in California, and Alex is in New York; we would normally use Skype, but that\u2019s owned by Microsoft, so instead we talk by phone and I record my end with a handheld Zoom recorder. That works fine, but when it comes time to send the 386 MB audio file to Alex, I realise I have no idea how to send a huge file over the internet.   My Gmail alternatives\u2014ProtonMail and Riseup\u2014tell me the file is too large; they tap out at 25 MB. Google Drive and Dropbox aren\u2019t options, Dropbox because it\u2019s hosted by Amazon\u2019s AWS and relies on Google for sign-in. Other file-sharing sites also rely on the tech giants for web hosting services.   Before resorting to putting the file on a thumb drive and dropping it in a IRL mailbox, I call up my tech freedom guru, Sean O\u2019Brien, who heads Yale Law School\u2019s Privacy Lab. He also does marketing work for Purism, the company that makes my laptop. O\u2019Brien tries to avoid tech giants in favour of open source technologies, so I figure he might be able to help.   O\u2019Brien directs me first to Send.Firefox.com , an encrypted file-sharing service operated by Mozilla. But\u2026 it uses the Google Cloud, so it won\u2019t load. O\u2019Brien then sends me to Share.Riseup.net , a file-sharing service from the same radical tech collective that is hosting my personal email, but it only works for files up to 50 MB.   O\u2019Brien\u2019s last suggestion is Onionshare , a tool for sharing files privately via the \u201cdark web,\u201d i.e. the part of the web that\u2019s not crawled by Google and requires the Tor browser to get to. I know this one actually. My friend Micah Lee, a technologist for the Intercept, made it . Unfortunately, when I go to Onionshare.org to download it, the website won\u2019t load.   \u201cHah, yes,\u201d emails Micah when I ask about it. \u201cRight now it\u2019s hosted by AWS.\u201d   As I encountered at the beginning of this experiment , Amazon\u2019s most profitable business isn\u2019t retail; it\u2019s web hosting. Countless apps and websites rely on the digital infrastructure provided by AWS, and none of them are working for me this week.   Micah suggests I download it from Github, but that\u2019s owned by Microsoft. Thankfully, O\u2019Brien tells me I can download the Onionshare program directly from Micah\u2019s server via command line on my Linux computer. He has to walk me through it step-by-step, but it works. I\u2019m able to run Onionshare, drop my file into it, creating a temporary onion site; I send the URL for the onionsite to Alex so he can download it via the Tor browser. Once he downloads it, I tell Onionshare to \u201cstop sharing,\u201d which takes the onion site down, erasing the file from the web.   (In the end, Alex doesn\u2019t even wind up using my audio for Reply All\u2019s year-end finale. Sigh.)   I realise that\u2019s a long story about sharing one file, but it\u2019s a nice summation of what online tasks are like this week. There are workarounds for services offered by the tech giants, but they take extra research to find and are often more difficult to use. I wind up in strange parts of the internet, using Ask.com (formerly known as Ask Jeeves) as my search engine, for example, after I ixnay Google.com and realise DuckDuckGo is hosted by AWS.   But Ask.com is not necessarily a great replacement: it\u2019s owned by IAC, the media and dating company behemoth. I\u2019ve just traded one huge corporation seeking to monetise my searches for another, less competent one.   Some strange things are delightful: I discover that my Nokia phone can play the radio, so when I go running, I listen to NPR instead of my usual go-tos: Spotify, a podcast, or an audiobook. I\u2019m planning a trip to South Africa, and wind up in charming conversations with the travel agents I have to call for help; it\u2019s more costly and less efficient to book via a travel agency, but it\u2019s the only option because travel-booking websites aren\u2019t working for me.    My mother-in-law was not impressed with the Nokia\u2019s photos (Screenshot: Maureen Taravella)   Something not delightful is my Nokia 3310\u2019s camera; it takes terrible, dark photos. I have an old Canon point-and-shoot digital camera, but I find I don\u2019t take many photos this week\u2014because without Facebook and Instagram, I don\u2019t have anywhere to share them.  These phones are the nicotine patch for smartphone addiction.  Sometimes I just can\u2019t find a digital replacement. Venmo won\u2019t work without a smartphone, so I pay our babysitter in cash. I start using a physical calendar to keep track of my schedule. When it comes to getting around, Marble Maps is an option, but I\u2019m confused by the interface, so I stick to places I know, and buy a physical map as a back-up.   \u201cIt\u2019s funny because Nokia used to have amazing navigation with Navtech,\u201d a technologist says to me one day when I\u2019m talking about how hard driving is without mapping apps, \u201cbut then they sold themselves to Microsoft.\u201d   Fuck , I think, my Nokia 3310 might be made by Microsoft.       But it turns out, while Microsoft did buy Nokia\u2019s mobile devices division for $US7.2 billion in 2014, it sold Nokia\u2019s \u201cfeature phone assets\u201d two years later for a painful write-down, $US350 million , to Foxconn (of Apple outsourcing fame) and to HMD Global, a Finnish firm helmed by a former Nokia executive. HMD Global now uses Nokia\u2019s \u201cintellectual property,\u201d i.e. brand, to sell phones. Most \u201cNokia\u201d phones are Android smartphones, but there\u2019s a line of \u201cclassic\u201d phones, including the 3310, which run an operating system called FeatureOS made by Foxconn.   My Nokia 3310 is not a tech giant phone, but it\u2019s certainly tech giant adjacent.   To find out why the HMD Global is still selling dumbphones, I call its Hong Kong-based chief product officer, Juho Sarvikas. Sarvikas tells me that the company thought the core market for \u201cclassic\u201d phones would be in Asia and Africa, where smartphones are less prevalent, but he says the devices have done surprisingly well in America.   \u201cDigital well-being is a concrete area now,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you want to go into detox mode or if you want to be less connected, we want to be the company that has the toolkit for you.\u201d   \u201cSo these phones are the nicotine patch for smartphone addiction,\u201d I say.   He laughs, \u201cI\u2019ve never put it that way before, but yes.\u201d   I had assumed that the phones were for parents who wanted their kids to have phones sans a pipeline to social media and apps.   \u201cThat too,\u201d says Sarvikas.   Many people I talk to about this experiment liken it to digital veganism. Digital vegans reject certain technology services as unethical; they discriminate about the products they use and the data they consume and share, because information is power, and increasingly a handful of companies seem to have it all.  He refers to joining social networks as being \u201cbait\u201d that lures other people into \u201csurveillance traps.\u201d  When I meet a full-time practitioner of the lifestyle, Daniel Kahn Gillmor, a technologist at the ACLU, I\u2019m not totally surprised to discover he\u2019s an actual vegan. I am surprised by the lengths to which he\u2019s gone to avoid the tech giants: he doesn\u2019t have a mobile phone and prefers to pay for things with cash.   \u201cMy main concern is people being able to lead autonomous healthy lives that they have control over,\u201d Gillmor tells me during a chat via Jitsi , an open-source video-conferencing service that will work on any web browser. There\u2019s no proprietary app you have to download and it doesn\u2019t require you to create an account.    Daniel Kahn GIllmor\u2014ACLU technologist, digital vegan, and real vegan (Photo: Santiago Garcia)   Gillmor hosts his own email and avoids most social media networks (he makes exceptions for Github and Sourceforge, because he\u2019s an open source developer who wants to share his code with others). He refers to joining social networks as being \u201cbait\u201d that lures other people into \u201csurveillance traps.\u201d   Gillmor thinks people will have better lives if they aren\u2019t being data-mined and monetized by companies that increasingly control the flow of information.   \u201cI have the capacity to make this choice. I know a lot of people would like to sign off but can\u2019t for financial reasons or practical reasons,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI don\u2019t want to come across as chastising people who don\u2019t make this choice.\u201d   And there are definitely costs to the choice. \u201cHow things are structured determines the decisions people can make socially,\u201d he says. \u201cLike you didn\u2019t get invited to a party [via Facebook] because you chose not to be part of a surveillance economy.\u201d   Gillmor teaches digital hygiene classes where he tries to get people to think about their privacy and security. He usually starts the class by asking people if they know when their phones are communicating with cell towers. \u201cMost people say, \u2018When I use it,\u2019 but the answer is, \u2018anytime it\u2019s on,\u2019\u201d he says.   He wants people to think about their own data trails but also when they are creating data trails for other people, such as when a person uploads their contacts to a technology service \u2014sharing information with the service that those contacts might not want shared.   \u201cOnce the data is out there, it can be misused in ways we don\u2019t expect ,\u201d he says.   But he thinks it\u2019s going to take more than actions by individuals. \u201cWe need to think of this as a collective action problem similar to how we think about the environment,\u201d he says. \u201cOur society is structured so that a lot of people are trapped. If you have to fill out your timesheet with an app only available on iPhone or Android, you better have one of those to get paid.\u201d   Gillmor wants lawmakers to step in, but he also thinks it can be addressed technologically, by pushing for interoperable systems like we have for phone numbers and email. You can call anyone; you don\u2019t need to use the same phone carrier as them. And you can take your phone number to a different carrier if you want (thanks to lawmaker intervention ).   When companies can\u2019t lock us into proprietary ecosystems, we have more freedom. But that means Facebook would have to let a Pinterest user RSVP for an event on its site. And Apple would need to let you Facetime an Android user.   No one wants to give the keys out when they have customer lock-in .   The Amazon block continues to be the most challenging one for me.   My friend Katie is in town from New York; we have plans to meet for dinner one night at a restaurant near my house, an event marked on my physical calendar. On the morning we are to meet, I get an email from her to my Riseup account with the subject line, \u201cWhat is happening.\u201d   Katie had been sending me messages for days via Signal, but I hadn\u2019t gotten them because Signal is hosted by AWS. When she didn\u2019t hear from me, she sent an \u201cARE YOU GETTING MY TEXTS\u201d email to Gmail, and got my away message directing her to my Riseup account.  \u201cARE YOU GETTING MY TEXTS\u201d  I tell her dinner is still a go, but it\u2019s a reminder of the costs of leaving these services. I can opt out, but people might not realise I\u2019ve left, or might forget, even if they do know.   One day, I ask my husband, Trevor, who declined to do the block with me because he has \u201ca real job,\u201d what the hardest part of my experiment is for him. \u201cI never know if you\u2019re going to respond to my texts,\u201d he says.   \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhat have I not responded to?   \u201cI sent you some messages on Signal,\u201d Trevor says, having forgotten I am off it.       The block provides constant conversation fodder, and I find myself in conversations more often because, at social gatherings, I don\u2019t have a smartphone to stare at.   An Ivy League professor tells me he regularly employs a Google blocker. \u201cI had to disable it when I paid my taxes because they have Google Analytics on the IRS website,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was kind of horrifying.\u201d   People under 35 are intrigued (and sometimes jealous) of life without a smartphone; people over 35 just seem nostalgic.   One night, I run into Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle, who is delighted to hear about the block. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get away from technology,\u201d he says. \u201cA friend was just telling me about trying to get a TV that wasn\u2019t smart and didn\u2019t have a microphone. It was impossible. He wound up getting a 27-inch [computer] monitor.\u201d   Sometimes we make the choice to bring technology into our lives, but sometimes it\u2019s forced upon us. Television makers have turned their products into surveillance machines that collect what we watch and what we don\u2019t watch and sometimes even what we say, and that\u2019s just how most TVs come now.   This week, I stop watching TV altogether because we don\u2019t have cable and internet TV isn\u2019t an option. I hadn\u2019t meant to make this experiment a \u201crejection of all technology\u201d\u2014but it happens despite my intentions.   I\u2019m most frustrated by this with my phone. I would love to be using a tech-giant free smartphone, but they aren\u2019t really commercially available yet. If you want one, you need to be technically savvy and install a custom operating system on special phone models . That will hopefully change soon, with commercial offerings on the horizon from Eelo and Purism .   In the past, I would have assumed that idealistic projects like these were doomed, but there seems to be a heightened awareness these days of the dystopia created by the tech giants. Everywhere I look, I see criticism of the Frightful Five.  \u201cAre America\u2019s technology companies serving as instruments of freedom or instruments of control?\u201d  A writer I know pens an op-ed in the New York Times : \u201c Hate Amazon? Try living without it .\u201d (She didn\u2019t actually live without it.) A CNBC tech reporter reveals she gave up Facebook and Instagram for three months and that it \u201cmade her a lot happier.\u201d A CBS reporter tries and fails to quit Google . A Vice writer gives all the giants up for a month (but not as rigorously as I did). The New York Times writes about apps tracking people\u2019s locations with horrifying regularity and granularity.   The tech giants laid down all the basic infrastructure for our data to be trafficked. They got us to put our information into public profiles, to carry tracking devices in our pockets, and to download apps to those tracking devices that secretly siphon data from them.   \u201cAre America\u2019s technology companies serving as instruments of freedom or instruments of control?\u201d asks a Californian politician .   It\u2019s in the air. The tech giants were long revered for making the world more connected, making information more accessible, and making commerce easier and cheaper. Now, suddenly, they are the targets of anger for assisting the spread of propaganda and misinformation, making us dangerously dependent on their services, and turning our personal information into the currency of a surveillance economy.   The world is flawed, and, fairly or not, the tech titans are increasingly being blamed.   A new book about \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d by Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff argues that the extreme mining and manipulation of our data for profit is making an inescapable panopticon the driver of our economy.   Zuboff\u2019s publicist sent me an advance copy as an e-book, and I\u2019ve really been enjoying it, but I have to put it down this week because I can\u2019t read it on my Kindle. Instead, I\u2019m reading a physical book\u2014Henry Thoreau\u2019s Walden , which I ordered from Barnes &amp; Noble. It too is full of calls to re-immerse ourselves in the natural world and not get too caught up in the distractions of modern life.   But, because it was published in 1854, it warns people to get away from work and newspapers rather than smart devices and screens.   For ideas about what the government can do about all this, I call Lina Khan, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute who wrote a blockbuster paper on the need to regulate Amazon\u2019s monopoly power. (At least it\u2019s a blockbuster by academic standards.)  \u201cIf users had been told that the price for access would be near-total surveillance, would they have agreed?\u201d  Khan is in New York doing an academic fellowship at Columbia University where she is working on more papers. Khan doesn\u2019t have a Prime account and avoids Gmail. Right before I call her, I see a tweet from a video producer at the Washington Post who got bombarded with baby ads after she had a stillborn delivery.   \u201cPlease, Tech Companies, I implore you: If your algorithms are smart enough to realise that I was pregnant, or that I\u2019ve given birth, then surely they can be smart enough to realise that my baby died, and advertise to me accordingly \u2014 or maybe, just maybe, not at all,\u201d she wrote in yet another reminder that privacy invasions have real harms.   I recount the story to Khan at the beginning of our call and say that this type of anger seems to be on the rise.    Lina Khan and author having a Skype call (after the experiment ended) (Screenshot: Kashmir Hill)   \u201cThe tech companies\u2019 own actions are prompting the tide to turn. It is a belated reckoning, but it seems to be a reckoning nonetheless,\u201d she says. \u201cCompanies started monetizing user data far before most users even realised their data was valuable, let alone being collected by private actors. If users had been told that the price for access would be near-total surveillance, would they have agreed? Would companies have been forced to offer different business models?\u201d   Khan thinks law enforcers need to get involved to keep these companies from using anti-competitive tactics to dominate the business landscape, as public officials did in the \u201890s against Microsoft .   \u201cSeveral of the big tech firms have acquired rivals and inhibited competitors through predatory conduct,\u201d she says, a topic that\u2019s been in the news recently with the exposure of Facebook emails where CEO Mark Zuckerberg talks about cutting off then-viral video service Vine\u2019s access to the Facebook social graph. \u201cThey have engaged in practices that, a few decades ago, were widely considered monopolistic. We need investigations by the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, or state attorneys general.\u201d   Europe is on the case, its regulators fining Google and saying Facebook can\u2019t combine users\u2019 data from Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram without their consent. But antitrust regulators in the U.S. have stayed away from these companies because their services are cheap or free, so they\u2019re perceived as pro-consumer, which is ultimately what regulators want to encourage. But how does that work when the \u201cconsumer\u201d is what the company is selling?   An uncomfortable idea I keep coming up against this week is that, if we want to get away from monopolies and surveillance economies, we might need to rethink the assumption that everything on the internet should be free.   So when I try to create a fourth folder in ProtonMail to organise my email and it tells me that I need to upgrade from a free to a premium account to do so, I decide to fork over 48 euros (about $75) for the year. In return, I get a 5 GB email account that doesn\u2019t have its contents scanned and monetized.   However, I\u2019m well aware that not everyone has $75 to spare for something that they can easily get for \u201cfree,\u201d so if that\u2019s the way things go, the rich will have privacy online and the poor (and most vulnerable) will have their data exploited.   The previous week, my 1-year-old, Ellev, started saying that Alexa is \u201cscary\u201d and \u201cspooky,\u201d concepts she learned while trick-or-treating. It\u2019s not unreasonable; I can see how a disembodied voice that\u2019s always there and always listening would be disconcerting to a toddler\u2014or really any normal human being.       But this week, she keeps crying for Alexa, wanting her to play \u201cBaby shark\u201d and other music that is otherwise absent from our home. \u201cI miss Alexa,\u201d she says, and I feel terrible both for depriving her and for making her dependent on an AI at such a young age.   On the last day of the block, Trevor and I are flying to New York, and he\u2019s begging me to end the experiment early so we can use the iPad to keep Ellev happy. However, I\u2019m adamant about maintaining the blockade for the six-hour flight.   \u201cI\u2019m changing my seat to a different part of the plane,\u201d Trevor warns, kiddingly.   Trevor charges the iPad up in case my will falters. But I hold strong. We read books with Ellev, doodle on a magnetic drawing board, sing songs, and play for at least an hour with sticky, flexible \u201cWizzle sticks\u201d that come in her Alaska Airlines snack pack. She sleeps for the last hour and a half of the flight, something she doesn\u2019t usually do if there is an iPad available.   That was Ellev\u2019s 26th flight. In the taxi after we land, Trevor turns to me and says, \u201cThat\u2019s the easiest flight we\u2019ve ever had with her.\u201d   We get to our Airbnb in Brooklyn, which I booked months before the experiment. (It should technically be banned because Airbnb is hosted by AWS.) There\u2019s a lock box on the outside of the apartment building that I open with a four-digit code. Inside is a key that gets us into the building and the same four-digit code opens a digital lock on the apartment\u2019s door. I had written down the address and code on a piece of paper knowing I wouldn\u2019t be able to access the Airbnb website.  Technology creates the problems that technology solves.  We get in with no problem. We\u2019re starving so head to a restaurant we passed in our taxi. Afterward, we need groceries, but Ellev is melting down, so I head to the Airbnb while Trevor goes to shop. I get into the building with the key, but once Ellev and I climb four flights of stairs to the apartment, I realise I don\u2019t have the piece of paper with the door code on it\u2014and I don\u2019t remember the code.   Ellev is crying and trying to turn the doorknob. I start to feel that desperate panic of an earlier age that nowadays accompanies a dying smartphone battery.   My laptop is inside the locked apartment. I use a password manager, stored on that laptop, to get into all my online accounts, so I couldn\u2019t get into Airbnb on another computer even if I wanted to toss in the towel on the blockade.   A masochistic part of my brain reminds me that I am in this mess because I used a site hosted by AWS. I could have just booked a normal hotel room via the phone, and then I would be picking up a new key card at this very moment. Technology creates the problems that technology solves, and vice versa.   While soothing Ellev, I try a bunch of different combinations on the lock based on my vague recollection of what the four numbers are. One of them works. As soon as I get inside, I plug my iPhone into the charger, relieved I\u2019ll resume using it the next day.   Critics of the big tech companies are often told, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the company, don\u2019t use its products.\u201d I did this experiment to find out if that is possible, and I found out that it\u2019s not\u2014with the exception of Apple.    Graphic: Jim Cooke, Gizmodo   These companies are unavoidable because they control internet infrastructure, online commerce, and information flows. Many of them specialize in tracking you around the web, whether you use their products or not. These companies started out selling books, offering search results, or showcasing college hotties, but they have expanded enormously and now touch almost every online interaction. These companies look a lot like modern monopolies .   Since the experiment ended, I\u2019ve resumed using the tech giants\u2019 services, but I use them less. I deliberately seek out alternatives to do what I can, as a consumer, not to help them monopolize the market.  I want to embrace a lifestyle of \u201cslow Internet.\u201d  But the experiment went beyond that for me; it made me reexamine the role of tech in my life more widely. It broke me of that modern bad habit of swiping through my phone looking for a distraction rather than engaging with the people around me or seeking stimulation in my real world environment.   I deleted time-wasting apps like Words With Friends and a Hearts app. I look at Instagram less often, such that I see friends have tagged me in their stories, but don\u2019t see the stories because they\u2019ve already reached their 24-hour expiration mark.   I turn my phone off around 9pm each night and don\u2019t turn it back on until I really need it the next day. It took two weeks of using my \u201cnicotine patch\u201d dumb phone, but I eventually lost the urge to start my day by reaching for my smartphone on the bedside table.   My iPhone tells me in my weekly \u201cScreentime\u201d reports that my usage is down significantly, to under 2 hours per day. My phone feels less like an appendage and more like a tool I use when necessary. I still love using Google Maps or Waze when I\u2019m driving to an unfamiliar place, texting far-away friends and family members, and sharing a beautiful photo on Instagram\u2014but I have regained the ability to put my phone away.   I went through the digital equivalent of a juice cleanse. I hope I\u2019m better than most dieters at staying healthy afterward, but I don\u2019t want to be a digital vegan. I want to embrace a lifestyle of \u201cslow Internet,\u201d to be more discriminating about the technology I let into my life and think about the motives of the companies behind it. The tech giants are reshaping the world in good and bad ways; we can take the good and reject the bad.   I ask Trevor if he notices anything different about me since the experiment.   \u201cYou never know what time it is anymore,\u201d he jokes, but it\u2019s true. I look at my phone infrequently and there are rarely clocks around, personal devices apparently having made them obsolete. I am more in the moment, but less aware of the actual hour and minute.   This is easily solvable: I\u2019ll get a watch. It definitely won\u2019t be a smart one.

And I was talking to Senator Josh Hawley the other day, who wrote a piece on this, and he said that it bothers him that some of the greatest minds in technology created, you know, got together, and this is what they did to us. </p><p>They created social media in our era. He said, you know, think about landing on the moon, think about the great innovations that American minds have brought to the world. And our moment created this beast that we have to deal with now. Rivera: I have this image you know I'm a father of five I have this image of my kids like drowning in that thing. Their whole faces getting in. Or you know looking at a picture of a butterfly when there's a real butterfly flying around, and they're going to miss the reality of it. I just think that they are profit-driven. They should be regulated like utilities are regulated. I'm a free enterpriser. But I just don't trust when something gets this big when it's 2.4 billion people, and they own WhatsApp, and they own Instagram, and a half a dozen or a dozen other companies.

Is \"science\" whatever a scientist says? Is it just another buzzword politicians use to mask their motives? \"News\" comes from \"new,\" just like \"information\" comes from \"inform,\" both terms over 500 years old. In print, news usually means information about current events, ranging roughly from a small tweet (280 characters) to a long-form essay (20,000 characters). In general, the shorter the news piece and the faster it arrives, the less trustworthy it is. Some of the news we read is autogenerated by bots; some is fake.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Away from fake and fast, at the upper end of science, the laws of nature are true and eternal. But weirdly, while discovering such laws counts among humanity's most amazing accomplishments, they are too old and boring to be news. Science textbooks are expensive and obscure. Online hosting fails the laws of nature entirely, because grand laws arrive so rarely, command less interest and are hard to monetize with advertising.</p><p>Worse is a feedback loop wherein the more society considers the hallowed high ground of science as \"true,\" the more valuable science becomes as a tool of persuasion, and the more monetization tries to wrest control of it. So \"scientific truth\" becomes even more tempting to misrepresent. As a result, there are few or no places online to find clean true useful science, unsullied by marketers, lawyers and bureaucrats.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">News as Data Points</emphasis></h><p>In science terms, what we call pieces of news are in fact data points, one of two crucial components in making sense of information. The other component is predictive models. Every responsive, self-regulating system feeds on data points. Your brain, your computer and your society all have to ingest data points from a changing world in chunks in order to turn it into useful information.</p><p>What kinds of data points? Brains ingest neural pulses. Markets ingest stock-transaction \"ticks.\" Societies ingest news articles. But two effects limit how useful those points can be. First, because quickness matters, reporters (and editors and fact-checkers) often make mistakes on deadline, so news is noisy. Further, because a viral story can make so much money whether true or not, and because \"fake news\" is cheaper to make than trustworthy news, more and more of news is more and more fake.</p><p>Make Sense of the World Unique insights from 2000+ contributors in 80+ countries I agree to receive emails and other content from Fair Observer. I understand that I may repeal my consent at any time. You can review our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use for further information.</p><p>For example, during the US election four years ago, a Macedonian teenager earned 10 times the local wages by creating clickbait stories for extremist news site with the sole purpose of going viral. Fake news is very cost-effective, because it costs nothing to gather - yet it gathers more clicks. As a result, in terms of information science, media bias is real, but not toward ideology, rather toward money and power.</p><p>The fact that news can go stale and be replenished makes it an evergreen moneymaker in online media, which thrive on high throughput, agility, change and detail. But readers seldom pay online, which forces online media to grab the money first byinserting ads and popups, extra pages to create extra clicks, groveling appeals to repost/follow/like and \"sponsored\" (incentivized) content, all just to pay the bills. They also surreptitiously sell your reading data so that other companies can manipulate you even better. The core problem is that incentives - all incentives - mathematically corrupt trust, in direct proportion to how well they work. Incentives change things in a particular direction, while truth doesn't change and is neutral.</p><p>So as an information source, online \"news\" has two structural problems: its quick-and-dirty gathering process makes the result narrow and noisy, and monetization makes it biased. Such corrupt input needs a lot of cleaning up, say with a predictive model.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Science as News</emphasis></h><p>Is news about science more trustworthy than news about events? Almost never, and for all the same reasons. Most science you find in news media is, like regular news, not truth with a capital T but selected data about specific recent events, experiments and conjectures, still noisy and biased toward monetization.</p><p>The vast majority of science, and the news about it, works as follows. Scientists work for organizations with budgets and agendas. Those organizations want their research to serve those agendas (hello, incentives!), making the experiments themselves biased, even before publication. Then comes scientific publication, in which tradition, along with anonymous and often biased peer reviewers, impose obfuscated jargon, irrelevant detail and muddled explanations, ending with the obligatory weasel-worded conclusion like \"this experiment might mean something, so more research is necessary.\"</p><p>Such research reports are scarcely comprehensible even to specialists, much less to lay people. Reporters deal with this by speaking to the scientist who did the experiment or by merely reading digests. This quick-and-dirty reporting happens because news is time-sensitive. The result is science news that has already been corrupted by cascading steps of translation and selection optimized to boost reputation, attention-capture and revenue before it ever reaches you, the reader. At present, science news provides interesting but shaky data points, but no way to make sense of them -just like regular news.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ideal Science</emphasis></h><p>At worst, politicians invoke the trappings of science as a mask, like the meaningless dials and numbers on a COVID-19 dashboard. At best, politicians respect that scientific laws (like viral spread) are real and adopt objective metrics and data-driven targets to support human welfare. The right scientific metrics resist political and commercial tinkering, because they are transparent and obvious. The best of those metrics are based on what I'm calling ideal science.</p><p>Ideal science isn't its gummy practice, which mixes in guesswork, experiments, mentoring and grantsmanship. Ideal science is exactly the opposite of news: old, plain and obvious. It combines experiment with mathematical law, distilling the result into the most powerful of predictive models, the universal laws of nature, like the law of gravity. These laws are so universal you don't need to worry about the difference between Chinese and European versions. They last forever. And they predict the future, as spacecraft navigation proves. Or black holes, which were finally confirmed to be real nearly 95 years after being mathematically predicted by Karl Schwartzschild.</p><p>Prediction also drives the scientific method: First make predictions from data and models, then update the models, get more data and try again. Continually confirming predictions is also the principle brains use to explore their worlds.</p><p>What makes universal laws so potently predictive is precisely that they avoid specific details about the world and instead relate details together. The best-known laws describe relations in the physical world, including the laws of gravity, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, heat and relativity. Of laws describing life, evolution is the best known, and on the horizon are other informational laws describing self-regulation, brains and communication. The power of such laws comes from their simplicity, as captured by idealizations such as ideal gas, absolute zero, perfect vacuum and frictionless surface. These idealizations generally appear as simple equations that can leverage data from the past into predictions of the future, the way gravity's F = GmM/r2guides spacecraft.</p><p>The universal law of math dominating today's news is epidemic spread. As the separate dots of COVID-19 caseload increase percentage-wise day by day, they stay close to the predicted rising whip-like exponential curve of epidemic spread. The dots give us the curve, and the curve gives us the future. So as an idealization of how data might predict the future, fitted curves -and fitted curves alone -allow precisely smooth predictions from a few uncertain chunks. At times like now, with so many economic and social parameters so far out of kilter for months simultaneously worldwide, idealized predictive models are the only way to plan ahead. We've never been here before, so we need a map.</p><p>The map we seek has one new \"color\" (i.e. kind of natural law) never included before: the laws of information flow through space and time. Those laws are already used everywhere in technology, under names like signal processing, data science, algorithmics and computer science. The human side of those same laws includes symbolic communication, the brain's reconstruction of 3D reality and neuromechanical trust. The extended information sciences are as close to \"eternal truth\" as science can get, besides gravity. They inspired most modern technology; now they can help us humans, too.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Hyperdimensional Jigsaw Texbook</emphasis></h><p>The predictive models of ideal science are what we need, but they face corruption by monetization pressures. So they can't appear as news about science. But they might appear as science about news, in an unorthodox new form disguised as news. The base material for this new information structure would be freestanding \"news\" articles, each keyed to the hook of a recent event but collectively outlining universal principles, nay laws, which both precede and outlast the event itself. As if one used news about an extra-high tide to illustrate gravity in general.</p><p>Those articles together could form a tightly connected, intellectually interlocking network of mutually-supporting scientific claims, a textbook built of pieces like a jigsaw puzzle. Any motivated readers, putting them together, might solve the puzzle of the truth they seek. On the other hand, if those same readers agreed there were major contradictions, they would thereby know the whole was bunk. Even more than agreeing with experimental evidence, coherence and self-consistency among ideas mark them as coherent candidates to match reality.</p><p>If such a virtual \"textbook\" explained only one subject, such as economics, it would refract truth only along that axis, with few ways of cross-checking built in. By cross-linking those ideas to a different discipline, such as mathematics, cross-checking is much easier, so there is an extra axis to establish trust. By showing links between a half-dozen different quantitative disciplines - say economics, mathematics, physics, neuroscience, biology, computer science - the result (in mathematical terms) is a six-dimensional hyper-crystal, an informational structure far more solid and stable than mere three-dimensional diamond. So we can call our novel ideal-science-in-news structure a \"hyperdimensional jigsaw textbook.\"</p><p>Who might be the ideal creators of such a jigsaw textbook? While the voice of an author is easier to understand and more coherent, the research itself should come from multiple individuals, if only for extra pairs of error-catching eyes. Ideally those authors would ground their claims in root principles, scientifically expressed, ideally from their own synthetic works. Ideally, these authors would be intellectually independent, uninfluenced by funding or agenda. Their results should be consistent with information science and obvious in hindsight. That's the ideal. That ideal supports human welfare by providing transparent principles, objective metrics, data-driven targets and especially a conceptually coherent framework for evaluating them. Transparency, objectivity and coherence are hard to tamper with.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ideal Reader</emphasis></h><p>Most news readers, like most news reporters, are rushed, distracted and prone to avoid dense intellectual material. They have no interest in any textbook, much less an idealized hyperdimensional jigsaw textbook. Might anyone?</p><p>Let's imagine an ideal reader for any ideal jigsaw textbook (not just mine). Truly ideal readers of Fair Observer, of course, would so enthusiastically support the mission of diverse, unbiased, high-quality reporting to subscribe with their own money. Of those readers, the most motivated (and least busy), understanding the problems of reading on screens, would print each article out on paper because reading comprehension is severalfold better that way. They would read each printout slowly in good light and mark the paper up with questions and observations.</p><p>They would meet with other like-minded readers in person to discuss each article, enjoying the interactive bandwidth of common intention in a quiet place, and would cherish the collective \"aha!\" when some point resonates, or would roll their eyes when points go flat. They would make and share backup copies of whatever articles they cherish as both PDF and paper copies, so the knowledge could survive censorship, crisis or net outage. If they liked one article, they would read others since all derive from the same principles.</p><p>And most of all, they would look for conceptual contradictions, in groups to minimize their own contradictions. In any accumulating jigsaw textbook like this, as article after article comes out, each invoking similar mathematical principles across a wide range of subjects, it ought to be progressively harder to avoid bits of one article contradicting another. I claim and expect you will find no contradictions, because the truth is actually simple, and actually true. I hope you find it useful.</p><p>*[Big tech has done an excellent job telling us about itself.

The share prices of technology companies have responded accordingly, as have funds that invest in them such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/investment-trust/tearsheet/summary?s=PCT:LSE&#34; title=&#34;\">Polar Capital Technology Trust</url> (PCT), which has seen its share price rise 34 per cent over the year to 29 July.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ben Rogoff, lead manager of Polar Capital Technology Trust, is cautiously optimistic for the sector. He says that the current crisis has shown that today's world is built on technology and that there is nothing quite like a crisis to spur innovation. And although valuations across the sector are materially higher than they were at the start of the year, on a relative basis they are only 5 per cent higher than the broader market. This is partly because the low cost of borrowing has pushed up asset prices across sectors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although the introduction of stricter regulations on technology companies is a risk associated with technology, Mr Rogoff does not think that it will result in the break-up of the big tech companies, which some US politicians support. Instead, he expects a slightly tougher environment for mergers and acquisitions, and perhaps higher taxation in future.</p><p>\"When we model our companies' [profits] we naturally assume an increasing tax rate,\" he says.</p><p>Rising Sino-US trade tensions also make him less worried about regulatory threats. \"The idea that tech companies will be kneecapped by regulators just when the Chinese are coming on the outside rail seems highly unlikely,\" he says, as the two superpowers appear to be on a collision course for technology supremacy. And he is \"fairly sanguine\" about the risk posed by trade tensions because the big US and Chinese companies are fairly distinct and tend not to operate in each other's markets.</p><p>Some telecoms companies, meanwhile, such as Ericsson(SWE:ERIC), look well placed to benefit from the removal of Huawei from building 5G networks.</p><p>                     Investment approach                   </p><p>A problem for active fund managers has been that tech megacaps, which dominate indices, have been the main drivers of performance, making it hard to beat indices. But Polar Capital Technology Trust holds about 100 stocks and is managed with a close eye to its benchmark index, Dow Jones Global Technology. It is managed with a low active share of 40 to 50 per cent, which means typically 50 to 60 per cent of what the trust holds are constituents of this index. Some investors have a preference for benchmark-agnostic funds because you can buy an index tracker fund for a much lower fee and no performance charge. However, Polar Capital Technology Trust has consistently delivered on its target of outperforming its benchmark by 2 to 3 per cent every year. And Mr Rogoff says that the large number of holdings reflects \"how much we like the very largest companies in our benchmark and the availability of good ideas at the right prices elsewhere\".</p><p>The trust has many small holdings, some of which are relatively new companies, so it could benefit from getting in early because some of these may turn out to be outstanding investments. Mr Rogoff gives the example of Apple (US:AAPL), which he reckons he has owned more of than anyone in the UK. \"In 2003 you couldn't find a person that would buy this stock, but I bought it because it was in the index and was doing a bit better than the benchmark,\" he explains. </p><p>He concedes that his benchmark-conscious approach may mean he owns less or more of a stock than he might otherwise - Amazon (US:AMZN), for example, is not in the benchmark so is a much smaller holding in the trust than Microsoft (US:MSFT), Alphabet (US:GOOGL) and Apple. \"There are times when I think if the benchmark had Amazon I might have held more,\" he says, adding that Amazon is the single largest relative bet the trust has against the benchmark. </p><p>However, he says: \"In the round the benchmark has delivered very strong returns. It has outperformed most - certainly many - of my peers and we have pretty much been beating [the benchmark] by 2 to 3 per cent a year for the past decade.\"</p><p>Mr Rogoff approaches stockpicking by identifying key themes that offer new technology poised for growth. \"The way I attack the tech space is to think about thematically where I need to be invested and also where we don't need to be invested,\" he says.</p><p>Consequently, the fund is overweight software companies and companies related to cloud computing and underweight older-breed hardware companies. The tech space is evolving rapidly as it moves through changing transitions such as cloud computing. </p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sector exposure</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"544\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Software</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">24.10%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Semiconductors &amp; equipment</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">17.0%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Interactive media &amp; services</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">16.20%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Tech hardware, storage &amp; peripherals</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">11.20%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Internet &amp; direct marketing retail</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">7.60%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">IT services</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">5.80%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Entertainment</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4.40%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Elec. equip. instruments &amp; components</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3.40%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Communications equipment</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1.40%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Machinery</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1.30%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Other</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3.30%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cash</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4.30%</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Source: Polar Capital as at 30 June 2020</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>                     Mr Rogoff also looks to invest in a broad sweep of companies that come under an attractive theme: \"It would have been very difficult to know which of the automotives to own at the turn of the automotive era, but much easier to not own anything that is to do with horses and carriages,\" he says.A theme the trust has increased exposure to recently is 5G, as Mr Rogoff and his team feel as though it is increasingly a national imperative that wireless infrastructure is upgraded. \"Particularly with a backdrop of US-Sino relations deteriorating, the need for a 5G network to underpin things such as autonomous driving and the internet of things looks very exciting,\" says Mr Rogoff.However, he will not invest in unquoted stocks because being able to sell stocks quickly for him is really important. \"We need to make sure that if we're wrong, or if technology change occurs in ways we couldn't or didn't see, that we can change our minds,\" he says. He adds that if that means he ends up with a slightly smaller investment universe \"then so be it\". People tend to remember the small unquoted companies that go on to be great successes but forget about the majority which end up in the graveyard of history. Mr Rogoff's liquidity imperative is reflected in the trust's turnover, which was 87 per cent over the year to 30 April, up from 70 per cent in the previous year. \"We are paranoid tech investors and we understand that change happens all the time and there is very little permanence in tech,\" he says. The trust has no gearing - debt - which Mr Rogoff says may be one of his failings. But his view is that when tech companies do well the incremental margins are very high and they do not need structural gearing.The trust has a net cash position of 5 per cent and some put options to soften the impact of a sell-off, should one occur.View on individual companiesMicrosoft, Alphabet and Apple account for 24.5 per cent of Polar Capital Technology Trust's assets. Although these are very large holdings, the trust is underweight each of these relative to the benchmark. Apple has rerated meaningfully this year, Google owner Alphabet faces increasing regulatory risks and Microsoft is \"well owned\" so the trust has been reducing its allocation to these companies at the margins.But Mr Rogoff still really likes all of these \"wonderful\" businesses. He says that Apple should be thought of as a mass-affluent consumer brand rather than a tech company. \"The app economy that Apple has created is mind-boggling and will be of huge value to us [as 5G is rolled out],\" he says.He thinks that Google is a very attractively valued company and that Microsoft is the company that disproves the theory that tech companies can't reinvent themselves.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Top 10 holdings (%)</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"368\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"256\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Microsoft</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">10.00%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Apple</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">8.20%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Alphabet</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">6.30%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Facebook</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4.00%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Tencent</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3.50%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Alibaba</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3.10%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Samsung</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2.70%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Amazon</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2.70%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">NVIDIA</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2.10%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Paypal</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2.00%</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_6\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Source: Polar Capital as at 30 June 2020</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Ericsson and Samsung Electronics (SMSD) are two companies that the trust has been increasing exposure to recently.

And he is \"fairly sanguine\" about the risk posed by trade tensions because the big US and Chinese companies are fairly distinct and tend not to operate in each other's markets.</p><p>Some telecoms companies, meanwhile, such as Ericsson (SWE:ERIC), look well placed to benefit from the removal of Huawei from building 5G networks.</p><p>Investment approach A problem for active fund managers has been that tech megacaps, which dominate indices, have been the main drivers of performance, making it hard to beat indices. But Polar Capital Technology Trust holds about 100 stocks and is managed with a close eye to its benchmark index, Dow Jones Global Technology. It is managed with a low active share of 40 to 50 per cent, which means typically 50 to 60 per cent of what the trust holds are constituents of this index. Some investors have a preference for benchmarkagnostic funds because you can buy an index tracker fund for a much lower fee and no performance charge. However, Polar Capital Technology Trust has consistently delivered on its target of outperforming its benchmark by 2 to 3 per cent every year. And Mr Rogoff says that the large number of holdings reflects \"how much we like the very largest companies in our benchmark and the availability of good ideas at the right prices elsewhere\".</p><p>The trust has many small holdings, some of which are relatively new companies, so it could benefit from getting in early because some of these may turn out to be outstanding investments. Mr Rogoff gives the example of Apple (US:AAPL), which he reckons he has owned more of than anyone in the UK. \"In 2003 you couldn't find a person that would buy this stock, but I bought it because it was in the index and was doing a bit better than the benchmark,\" he explains.</p><p>He concedes that his benchmark-conscious approach may mean he owns less or more of a stock than he might otherwise - Amazon (US:AMZN), for example, is not in the benchmark so is a much smaller holding in the trust than Microsoft (US:MSFT), Alphabet (US:GOOGL) and Apple. \"There are times when I think if the benchmark had Amazon I might have held more,\" he says, adding that Amazon is the single largest relative bet the trust has against the benchmark.</p><p>However, he says: \"In the round the benchmark has delivered very strong returns. It has outperformed most - certainly many - of my peers and we have pretty much been beating [the benchmark] by 2 to 3 per cent a year for the past decade.\" Mr Rogoff approaches stockpicking by identifying key themes that offer new technology poised for growth. \"The way I attack the tech space is to think about thematically where I need to be invested and also where we don't need to be invested,\" he says.</p><p>Consequently, the fund is overweight software companies and companies related to cloud computing and underweight olderbreed hardware companies. The tech space is evolving rapidly as it moves through changing transitions such as cloud computing.</p><p>Mr Rogoff also looks to invest in a broad sweep of companies that come under an attractive theme: \"It would have been very difficult to know which of the automotives to own at the turn of the automotive era, but much easier to not own anything that is to do with horses and carriages,\" he says.</p><p>A theme the trust has increased exposure to recently is 5G, as Mr Rogoff and his team feel as though it is increasingly a national imperative that wireless infrastructure is upgraded. \"Particularly with a backdrop of US-Sino relations deteriorating, the need for a 5G network to underpin things such as autonomous driving and the internet of things looks very exciting,\" says Mr Rogoff.</p><p>However, he will not invest in unquoted stocks because being able to sell stocks quickly for him is really important. \"We need to make sure that if we're wrong, or if technology change occurs in ways we couldn't or didn't see, that we can change our minds,\" he says.</p><p>He adds that if that means he ends up with a slightly smaller investment universe \"then so be it\". People tend to remember the small unquoted companies that go on to be great successes but forget about the majority which end up in the graveyard of history.</p><p>Mr Rogoff's liquidity imperative is reflected in the trust's turnover, which was 87 per cent over the year to 30 April, up from 70 per cent in the previous year. \"We are paranoid tech investors and we understand that change happens all the time and there is very little permanence in tech,\" he says.</p><p>The trust has no gearing - debt - which Mr Rogoff says may be one of his failings. But his view is that when tech companies do well the incremental margins are very high and they do not need structural gearing. The trust has a net cash position of 5 per cent and some put options to soften the impact of a sell-off, should one occur.</p><p>View on individual companies Microsoft, Alphabet and Apple account for 24.5 per cent of Polar Capital Technology Trust's assets. Although these are very large holdings, the trust is underweight each of these relative to the benchmark. Apple has rerated meaningfully this year, Google owner Alphabet faces increasing regulatory risks and Microsoft is \"well owned\" so the trust has been reducing its allocation to these companies at the margins.</p><p>But Mr Rogoff still really likes all of these \"wonderful\" businesses. He says that Apple should be thought of as a mass-affluent consumer brand rather than a tech company. \"The app economy that Apple has created is mind-boggling and will be of huge value to us [as 5G is rolled out],\" he says.</p><p>He thinks that Google is a very attractively valued company and that Microsoft is the company that disproves the theory that tech companies can't reinvent themselves.</p><p>Ericsson and Samsung Electronics (SMSD) are two companies that the trust has been increasing exposure to recently. He thinks the withdrawal of Huawei in many countries will provide a boost in demand for Ericsson and he's added to Samsung, which could benefit from Intel's (US:INTC) decision to start outsourcing chip manufacturing.</p><p>Nvidia (US:NVDA) is another stock that the trust is overweight in that has had exceptional performance. Nvidia used to make graphic cards for computer games, but now uses the same process with its graphic processor to manipulate neural networks for machine learning and artificial intelligence. Mr Rogoff says Nvidia is one of the core ways the trust plays the artificial intelligence theme.</p><p>Advanced Micro Devices (US:AMD) also operates in this space, developing computer processors and related technologies for business and consumer markets. Mr Rogoff says it has been one of the fund's best investments over the past five years.</p><p/><p>'A problem for active fund managers has been that tech mega-caps, which dominate indices, have been the main drivers of performance, making it hard to beat indices'</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVSTR-162161463</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVSTR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HY-H3R1-DYTY-C1SP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234036</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1423\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investors Chronicle - magazine and web content</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59206\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 7, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The firm has decided to focus on consumer tech in general, and there are some interesting trends that I'm going to break out here. You can read the full report here.</p><p><br/>The team has analyzed and surveyed 1,500 companies over multiple months. And Idinvest has identified rising stars in multiple different verticals, such as fintech, mobility, healthcare or travel. If a startup has raised more than (EURO)100 million or has been acquired, Idinvest considers them as giants already.<br/>Lesson No. 1: VC funding is growing at a faster pace in Europe than in the rest of the world<br/>Notice that jump from (EURO)4.4 billion in 2014 to (EURO)16.6 billion in 2019.<br/>Lesson No. 2: The European fintech boom is real<br/>Fintech is now the largest vertical in Europe. On average, European startups attract 16% of global VC investments. But Europe is grabbing a bigger piece of that pie with fintech as European fintech startups have attracted 26% of total VC investments in that space.<br/>And it's not just challenger banks, such as N26, Monzo or Revolut. There are trading startups, lending startups, API-driven companies and more.<br/>Lesson No. 3: Mobility is fragmented<br/>While mobility is a huge vertical in Europe, there are countless players that do more or less the same thing - multiple scooter startups (Voi, Dott, Tier...), multiple ride-hailing startups (Bolt, Heetch, FreeNow, Cabify...), etc.<br/>Some of them are thriving, but you're not going to see any of the big names you'd expect in the list of giants as those companies are not European -\u00a0Uber, Didi, Bird... In other words, Europe is mostly a fast follower in this space, and it's been working fairly well.<br/>Lesson No. 4: Health is regulated as hell<br/>This isn't surprising, but European healthcare startups seem to be mostly active in Europe. Similarly, American healthcare startups don't seem to have a huge presence in Europe.<br/>I personally think European healthcare startups have a shot at becoming global leaders for two reasons. First,\u00a0it's a privacy-sensitive industry and European startups tend to care more about privacy due to the legal framework. Second, the tech lash against big tech companies, such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple, is going to be particularly strong with healthcare products.<br/>Lesson No. 5: Food startups could reshape cities<br/>Let me quote Idinvest's report directly here because it is spot-on: \"In the Middle-Age, posting houses became inns to feed and offer rest to travelers. In the 20th century, McDonald's restaurants grew exponentially around the U.S. road infrastructure. In the past 18-24 months, we have seen the rise of dark kitchens (Keatz, Taster) and dark groceries (Glovo) which are both piggybacking this new food delivery infrastructure and adding to it a real estate layer. Dark kitchens and groceries are selling products exclusively through delivery. The customer facing location of a restaurant or a grocery shop is replaced by a cheaper real estate location optimized for order preparations.\"<br/>Lesson No. 6: Travel is a bigger industry in Europe than in the U.S.<br/>Tourists spend more money in Europe than in the U.S. Given that many travel startups start with a simple marketplace to improve liquidity, pricing, listings, discovery or open up a whole new segment, it makes sense to start it from Europe.<br/>Lesson No. 7: Gaming is big in Europe<br/>Gaming, and in particular mobile gaming, has been thriving in Europe. Many casual games have emerged from European startups. There's no European Netflix, but Minecraft, Candy Crush Saga and Angry Birds were all born in Europe.<br/>All the rest<br/>Idinvest's report covers other verticals, but I don't have much to add. I'm just going to share the mapping of those verticals and you can read the report if you want to dig deeper.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GREENT-M1065983</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GREENT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:603V-N571-JBYT-H0SW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">422724</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"639\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greentechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 11, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"80\"><classCode>CC0001YS7</classCode><className>MCDONALD'S CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>NAICS722513 LIMITED-SERVICE RESTAURANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>SIC5812 EATING PLACES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The firm has decided to focus on consumer tech in general, and there are some interesting trends that I m going to break out here. You can read the full report here.</p><p>The team has analyzed and surveyed 1,500 companies over multiple months. And Idinvest has identified rising stars in multiple different verticals, such as fintech, mobility, healthcare or travel. If a startup has raised more than  100 million or has been acquired, Idinvest considers them as giants already.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lesson No. 1: VC funding is growing at a faster pace in Europe than in the rest of the world</emphasis></p><p>Notice that jump from  4.4 billion in 2014 to  16.6 billion in 2019.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lesson No. 2: The European fintech boom is real</emphasis></p><p>Fintech is now the largest vertical in Europe. On average, European startups attract 16% of global VC investments. But Europe is grabbing a bigger piece of that pie with fintech as European fintech startups have attracted 26% of total VC investments in that space.</p><p>And it s not just challenger banks, such as N26, Monzo or Revolut. There are trading startups, lending startups, API-driven companies and more.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lesson No. 3: Mobility is fragmented</emphasis></p><p>While mobility is a huge vertical in Europe, there are countless players that do more or less the same thing   multiple scooter startups (Voi, Dott, Tier...), multiple ride-hailing startups (Bolt, Heetch, FreeNow, Cabify...), etc.</p><p>Some of them are thriving, but you re not going to see any of the big names you d expect in the list of giants as those companies are not European   Uber, Didi, Bird... In other words, Europe is mostly a fast follower in this space, and it s been working fairly well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lesson No. 4: Health is regulated as hell</emphasis></p><p>This isn t surprising, but European healthcare startups seem to be mostly active in Europe. Similarly, American healthcare startups don t seem to have a huge presence in Europe.</p><p>I personally think European healthcare startups have a shot at becoming global leaders for two reasons. First, it s a privacy-sensitive industry and European startups tend to care more about privacy due to the legal framework. Second, the tech lash against big tech companies, such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple, is going to be particularly strong with healthcare products.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lesson No. 5: Food startups could reshape cities</emphasis></p><p>Let me quote Idinvest s report directly here because it is spot-on:  In the Middle-Age, posting houses became inns to feed and offer rest to travelers. In the 20th century, McDonald s restaurants grew exponentially around the U.S. road infrastructure. In the past 18-24 months, we have seen the rise of dark kitchens (Keatz, Taster) and dark groceries (Glovo) which are both piggybacking this new food delivery infrastructure and adding to it a real estate layer. Dark kitchens and groceries are selling products exclusively through delivery. The customer facing location of a restaurant or a grocery shop is replaced by a cheaper real estate location optimized for order preparations. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lesson No. 6: Travel is a bigger industry in Europe than in the U.S.</emphasis></p><p>Tourists spend more money in Europe than in the U.S. Given that many travel startups start with a simple marketplace to improve liquidity, pricing, listings, discovery or open up a whole new segment, it makes sense to start it from Europe.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lesson No. 7: Gaming is big in Europe</emphasis></p><p>Gaming, and in particular mobile gaming, has been thriving in Europe. Many casual games have emerged from European startups. There s no European Netflix, but Minecraft, Candy Crush Saga and Angry Birds were all born in Europe.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">All the rest</emphasis></p><p>Idinvest s report covers other verticals, but I don t have much to add. I m just going to share the mapping of those verticals and you can read the report if you want to dig deeper.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Campaign:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@IdinvestPartners/idinvest-european-consumer-startups-map-2020-b48a82e5a79\">https://medium.com/@IdinvestPartners/idinvest-european-consumer-startups-map-2020-b48a82e5a79</url><br/>Contact Information:<br/>Romain Dillet<br/><br/>Tags:<br/>, Wire, United States, English<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpsicrowdnewswirecomp2581067</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6028-VXR1-JCTB-F1B4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"732\"/><timeReceived>9:35 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 3, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Mark Warner On China's Strategy In Future Technologies</url></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There's no shortage of ideas on how to deal with the megaplatforms of Big Tech. Break them up! Make them more transparent! Enforce stronger privacy rules! Fine them into oblivion! Do nothing, and accept the benevolence of our corporate overlords! All of these are equally good ideas with pros and cons. As is the proposal put forward by Democratic senator Mark Warner of Virginia and Republican senator Josh Hawley of Missouri: legislation that would require Big Tech companies like Facebook to disclose the value of the user data that they possess.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The laboriously named Designing Accounting Safeguards to Help Broaden Oversight and Regulations on Data Act (or DASHBOARD) would affect companies that gain material revenue from data collection and processing and have more than 100 million monthly users. According to<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/mark-warner-josh-hawley-dashboard-tech-data-4ee575b4-1706-4d05-83ce-d62621e28ee1.html\"> Axios </url>, it would require these companies \"to disclose to users the types of data collected, how it is used, and to provide an assessment of the value of that data once every 90 days.\" Users would also be able to delete this data from the service. Companies would also need to provide \"the aggregate value of all of their users' data\" to the SEC on an annual basis.</p><p>It's well-worn knowledge at this point that \"free\" online services are actually subsidized by revenue created through the monetization of user data. Usually, that means precisely targeted ads. \"But the overall lack of transparency and disclosure in this market have made it impossible for users to know what they're giving up, who else their data is being shared with, or what it's worth to the platform,\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-technology-202/2019/06/24/the-technology-202-a-bipartisan-pair-of-senators-want-companies-to-put-a-price-on-your-data/5d0fd8aa1ad2e552a21d507d/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.865a6b9325a2\"> Warner said </url>.</p><p>This is a nice idea, and I guess it couldn't hurt, but the initiative suffers from too much wiggle room and a misplaced focus. The idea of what constitutes a \"monthly user\" is not standardized across the tech industry, and this new legislation, according to Axios, directs the SEC to figure out the specifics. \"The bill would direct the SEC to develop methods for calculating the value of user data, accounting for varying uses, sectors, and business models,\" it reports. If the congressional testimony of Big Tech is anything to go by, these companies prefer to obfuscate and stall by splitting hairs about language and terminology (\"Facebook doesn't sell user data, it sells the ability to utilize that data for targeting,\" and so on).</p><p>Even setting the workability of this idea aside, I don't think anyone remotely cognizant of these large platforms needs to be informed that their data is of value. In fact, it's already pretty easy to quantify the average value of many of these users. Here's an example: Facebook earned $16.9 billion in profit in 2018, off of 2.32 billion monthly users, according to its<url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2019/Facebook-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2018-Results/default.aspx\"> Q4 report </url>. That's roughly $7.28 per user, a metric already in use by Wall Street known as \"average revenue per user\" or ARPU. This is a back-of-the-envelope calculation, however, and certain factors weigh more than others. A North American or European user is more valuable to Facebook, for instance, because they are in the geographic regions most heavily bombarded with targeted ads. Still, the general principle holds that quantifying the value of an individual user is already not a strenuous task.</p><p>Now, it's possible that under more strict accounting rules, that $7.28 figure won't hold up. Depending on how you count, my data might be worth $100 to Facebook, or $1,000, or just $1. But even if we were to get more granular, I'm not clear on how putting a precise dollar amount on what my name, email address, favorite bands, and old pics from college are worth to Facebook will change how I - or anyone else - behaves on the platform. Not to get too twisted up in a logical ouroboros, but what is the value of knowing the precise value of my data to Facebook or Google?</p><p>It's a shame the law is misguided like this because there is a market sector adjacent to Big Tech data-reliant companies for which legislation like this would be incredibly useful: data brokers, which do actually sell user data to other firms and advertising companies. You probably know Facebook and Twitter, but maybe you're less familiar with names like Acxiom, CoreLogic, Datalogix, eBureau, ID Analytics, Intelius, PeekYou, RapLeaf, and Recorded Future. Those are some names I grabbed from a<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/data-brokers-call-transparency-accountability-report-federal-trade-commission-may-2014/140527databrokerreport.pdf\"> 2014 FTC report </url>outlining the complex data-broker industry and the granularity of the data that these companies trade in, \"largely without consumers' knowledge.\"</p><p>This activity happens out of public view, but fuels much of the online advertising industry by supplying and collating targeting data for clients. (\"Seven of the nine data brokers in the Commission's study provide data to each other.\") It would do a world of good if companies like these - companies that you probably never gave your data to or interacted with directly - were forced to reveal themselves as possessing user data and that they were profiting from it, and were forced to allow users to remove themselves from the database. But given that Warner and Hawley's legislation focuses on Big Tech companies with a lot of regular users, instead of enterprise firms with a smaller amount of deep-pocketed clients, it's unclear whether they would be affected by such legislation.</p><p>There is good news on the horizon though. Tucked in at the end of Warner's Axios interview, the senator gestured at impending legislation requiring tech platforms to<url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_portability\"> make user data portable </url>, so that users could join and leave different platforms with things like their photos and friends lists intact. At a consumer level, that's a much more effective measure for combating big tech, and something to eagerly anticipate.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYMAG-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYMAG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDR-5FS1-DYWJ-M0GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">296337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"959\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 New York Magazine Holdings LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>New York Magazine</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 24, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Reflecting this is growing interest in the digital health space, as evidenced by a substantial $4.7 billion being invested in 2017 as outlined in the brand new report from IDTechEx Research, Digital Health 2018: Trends, Opportunities and Outlook.  </p><p><br/>     (Logo: <url normalizedValue=\"http://photos.prnewswire.com\">http://photos.prnewswire.com</url> /prnh/20140310/673848 )  <br/>     (Photo:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com\">https://mma.prnewswire.com</url> /media/662694/Rise_of_Digital_Health_Infographic.jpg )  <br/>Digital health is a convoluted and complex field, much of which is made up of technologies and services that enable healthcare outside of traditional clinical settings. It follows a global trend in the healthcare industry of decentralization to alleviate overburdened hospitals and clinics. Coupled with escalating healthcare costs, shrinking profit margins and ageing populations suffering with chronic conditions, digital health offers a solution to these problems for all players in the space including patients, providers and payers. In fact, it presents such an alluring and lucrative opportunity that companies not previously in the healthcare space are making significant investments and moves to do so.

Tegen Google loopt een afzonderlijk onderzoek.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Van onze redacteur  Dominique Deckmyn</p><p>BrusselDe Ierse regulator DPC reageert naar eigen zeggen op potenti\u00eble problemen die zijn gesignaleerd door Ieren en mensen elders in Europa. Hij gaat daarom na of Tinder 'een wettelijke basis heeft voor de verwerking van de persoonlijke gegevens van zijn gebruikers' en of het bedrijf voldoende transparant is tegenover die gebruikers.</p><p>Meer details geeft de DPC niet, maar enkele weken geleden publiceerde de Noorse consumentenorganisatie Forbruker\u00adradet een rapport dat bijzonder kritisch was voor Match Group. Dat is het moederbedrijf van \u00adTinder en van bijna alle bekende datingapps en -websites, waaronder \u00adOkcupid, Match.com, Hinge, Meetic en het Belgische Twoo.</p><p>Tinder en Okcupid eigenen zichzelf in hun gebruiksvoorwaarden het recht toe om gegevens van gebruikers uit te wisselen met ander apps van Match Group en met een groot aantal derden, dat laatste voor reclame-doeleinden. De gebruiker kan dat niet zomaar weigeren. Volgens Forbrukerradet is dat een flagrante schending van de GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), de Europese privacy\u00adwetgeving.</p><p>Google</p><p>Het onderzoek naar Google heeft betrekking op de manier waarop dat bedrijf met zijn \u00adbesturingssysteem Android gegevens verzamelt over de locatie van smartphones. Ook hier is de vraag of Google die gegevens niet gebruikt op manieren die niet toegestaan zijn onder de GDPR, en of het over dat gebruik wel voldoende transparant is.</p><p>Een onderzoek als dit duurt minstens zes maanden, zegt DPC-woordvoerder Graham Doyle. Tinder en Google krijgen elk de gelegenheid om te antwoorden op vragen van de DPC. Daarna neemt die een beslissing. De GDPR, die sinds mei 2018 van kracht is, voorziet boetes tot 4 procent van de internationale jaaromzet van een bedrijf.</p><p>'We voeren nu 23 onderzoeken naar de 'big tech'-bedrijven', zegt Doyle. De eerste daarvan dateren van eind 2018. Maar het is nog \u00adaltijd wachten op een klacht, laat staan een veroordeling.</p><p>De Franse regulator CNIL schreef een jaar geleden wel al een boete van 50 miljoen euro uit aan het adres van Google, vanwege de manier waarop het bedrijf advertenties personaliseert. De Europese Commissie voert ook verschillende onderzoeken naar mogelijke inbreuken door Google op de concurrentieregels.</p><p>In het verleden klonk vaak de kritiek dat de Ierse privacy-autoriteit te laks was tegenover de grote Amerikaanse technologie-bedrijven, vanwege personeelsgebrek maar ook omdat Ierland die bedrijven het liefst niet te veel voor de voeten loopt. Dat heeft de voormalige Belgische Privacycommissie (inmiddels GBA) in 2015 aangezet om zelf een klacht in te dienen tegen Facebook, hoewel ook dat bedrijf zijn Europese hoofdkwartier in Ierland heeft. 'Vijf jaar geleden hadden we 30 mensen, nu 140', zegt Doyle.

'It was about public education and changing our perception of what our individual duties were.' Webster's dictionary defines a paradigm shift as: 'an important change that happens when the usual way of thinking about or doing something is replaced by a new and different way.' </p><p>One recent example of a paradigm change transpired in the 1970s when dog owners were suddenly expected to pick up after their pets. Previously, little attention had been paid to dog doo. In her very entertaining article, 'The Messy History of Poop Scooping,' Linda Lombardi outlined some of the steps and missteps of the pick-up-the-dog-doo paradigm shift that took place in New York. No one enjoyed stepping in a steaming pile on the sidewalk, but that was the only point of agreement. Humane organizations like the ASPCA were against the law, believing it would make people get rid of their dogs. And pet owners feared it would be the first step on a slippery slope to banning dogs in the city. 'People were terrified that the city was going to come into their homes and take their best friends away,' Brandow says \u2014 and with some reason, given the public discussion at the time. One book, titledThe Dog Crisis, argued that dogs didn't belong in cities; one councilman introduced a law to ban dogs from multiple-unit buildings, which is where most New Yorkers live. And one well-known activist tried to convince people that dogs were a serious health hazard despite little scientific support. The result was that being pro-dog meant being anti-picking-up. Other approaches were proposed, some of which now seem absurd. Some argued that dogs should never go on public property, but only on paper in their owners' bathrooms. Another idea, impractical for a cash-strapped city, was to hire special workers to clean up, at an estimated expense of a million dollars. The most complicated scheme would have the city provide trainers to teach dogs to go only over sewer drains, which the Department of Sanitation would flush out twice a day. Owners of dogs who couldn't be persuaded to stand on the open gratings would be provided with paper that they could spread out nearby; then they could toss the droppings in the drain. But, again, budget constraints intervened and a pilot program was canceled. Seven years after the original proposal in 1970, the law seemed to be at a dead end. 'City politicians shied away from it because elected leaders were threatened by dog-owning groups that if they supported this, they shouldn't bother seeking re-election,' Brandow says. 'It got that ugly.' 'Credit for breaking the impasse is usually given to Ed Koch, who as mayor-elect in 1977 decided to take the law to the state government level. But credit is also due to the assemblyman who, during hearings, demonstrated a pooper-scooper device consisting of a bag on a stick that snapped shut. Brandow says that the show caused 'a lot of laughter,' but it also convinced legislators that the elderly wouldn't have to bend down, and no one would have to use their hands. Just passing the law, of course, was only the first step, because police could never write enough tickets to persuade everyone to scoop. 'It's not the law, it's the custom,' Brandow says. 'It was about public education and changing our perception of what our individual duties were.' SOURCE: Vet Street[2] In this age of rapid innovation and transformation towards 5G fifth-generation telecommunications, utility, and energy infrastructure, increased connectivity and convenience is being promoted as the cure to nearly all of society's challenges. Linda Lombardi wrote:But dog poop marches with the times like anything else, and both enforcement and encouragement have gone high-tech. It's now possible to identify an individual dog's droppings by DNA, and a company calledPooPrints[3]offers its services to property management companies so they can determine who's neglecting to clean up after their dog in common areas.This might sound like a reasonable forensic approach for a frustrating issue. But here is the problem. There are unacknowledged concerns about health, the environment, surveillance, privacy, cost, the consumption of resources, and abuse of power. [1] In the present age of intoxication with 5G and big data, the current thinking would be to pummel the airwaves by monitoring every time every dog goes for a walk and monitoring the DNA of all of their dogs and their owners and mapping out poop locations using wireless sensors, everywhere, around the clock, long after people were already picking up after their dogs.  Maybe the sensors could even be incorporated into dog food! And when the dog poops, we could track it! We could be transmitting and collecting and analyzing and storing all of the data in air-conditioned data centers to support policy and decision-making! This plan for 'collecting it all' for data underlies the current thinking as well as funding and policy for smart meters and smart grids, which may be one of the most wasteful and polluting initiatives ever perpetrated on the planet, under the banner of sustainability. [2] In truth, your utility company and your government does not need a record of every toilet flush or cooked meal prepared in your home in the name of energy efficiency or water conservation, any more so than we need a historical log of your dog's excrement. The focus of smart meters is on monitoring the behavior of the customers, and not on the question of electricity-as-an essential-service itself. When dog poo became a concern, some of the proposed solutions were outlandish, crazy and impractical. So is the current thinking regarding the electrical grid. We are at the point where we need to question the need to remotely control our lives at a distance from the convenience of our cellphones, now. Because if we don't, a 5G tower is coming to your neighborhood to accommodate the constant chatter of our always-on networks, for example, for the smart meter that may transmit 10,000 to 190,000 times per day.[3] \ufeff There are many other ways of moving towards a more ecological lifestyle, but they may not be able to double as a surveillance network, or to be monetized.Use a Timer That is NOT WirelessMany energy-wasting and electrosmog-polluting behaviors could be replaced by the use of a programmed timer in the home, for example, to manage heat or air conditioning. A timer device does not need to study your behavior to learn how to manager your environment. There may be a few times per year when you work late unexpectedly, but the energy wasted in that scenario will be far less than the energy wasted creating an invisible overlay of antennas and sensors for a remote controlled system blanketing the planet. And, the timer will be more secure than any wireless system. For example, McAfee just demonstrated that Mr. Coffee can be hacked.McAfee researchers have uncovered two new vulnerabilities within connected devices that allow hackers access to the personal lives of consumers. A vulnerability withinBoxLocksmart padlock enables hackers to unlock the device within a few seconds, and a vulnerability within theMr. Coffeebrand coffee makerwith Wemo grants hackers access to home networks. SOURCE: The Daily Nonpareil[4]Continuing to roll out a wireless grid is the equivalent of writing a blank check for security, which will never be achieved for wireless. Hard-wiring is far more secure.Plan Ahead and Pay Attention Download Your First Issue Free! Do You Want to Learn How to Become Financially Independent, Make a Living Without a Traditional Job ...nally Live Free? Download Your Free Copy of Counter MarketsContinuing to expect that we do not need to plan ahead, and that we need the convenience of an always-on remote control system for our appliances and devices is a cultivated greed. The smart grid scenario assumes that individuals are routinely consuming more electricity than they need at times when they don't really need it, and that the utility needs access to personal usage data in order to customize targeted education about energy savings.[4] The Smart Energy Consumer Collaborative, which includes no consumers, will manufacture evidence for the need for on-going customer education in order to cultivate certain behaviors through its white papers and surveys by implying that in 10 years when your frig starts to fail, they need to let you know and also sell this information to appliance companies, because you are too inept to manage this without assistance. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-shot-2019-02-28-at-6.41.35-PM.pngThis\">https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Screen-shot-2019-02-28-at-6.41.35-PM.pngThis</url> line of reasoning assumes that customer education is an on-going carrot-and stick dynamic involving an uncooperative public and an omniscient utility industry that must constantly provide data to support decision-making, regardless of the cost. The data itself is the product. Customers should have the right to decide how they want to access guidance to adopt a more ecological lifestyle, without it being a condition for access to electricity.Don't Fall for PropagandaIs it possible that public sentiment away from fossil fuels and towards increased conservation is running far ahead of utilities? Utilities and regulators initially justified smart meters in order to increase the integration of renewables into the grid, and then decimated solar net metering and added punitive fees including demand surcharges in many states. Should we fall for this again, now that smart meters are being linked to the adoption of electric vehicles? Does managing electric vehicle use mandate that every single customer must have all of their usage monitored 24/7/365? Accompanying the drive for data by government and industry is the cultivation of an attitude of entitlement by consumers for faster, more powerful, more ubiquitous connectivity, regardless of the emergence of evidence of harm to human health and the environment. By increasingly expecting that our wants and wishes are indulged via energy expenditure of the universe bringing its resources to us, we are moving away from, and not towards saving planet earth, while ignoring the not-so-hidden agendas of monetization of the data, and surveillance. It was a remarkable achievement for economic interests to monetize the core values of the emerging masses who seek to move away from polluting fossil fuels and to lower their carbon footprint, by shifting fossil fuel consumption to a massive burgeoning wireless footprint [5] that starts and ends with human rights abuses in poorer nations, from mining of conflict minerals to e-waste. The promotion of smart grids in the New Green Clean Deal is not a paradigm shift, it is a fiasco. \ufeff As younger and younger customers adopted cellphones, thereby consuming resources every waking minute and well as while sleeping, we are now embracing the idea that our devices themselves need to be part of a 24/7/365 consumption plan.We Need Another Paradigm Shift Away From Tech As the Answer to EverythingThe picking-up-the-dog-doo paradigm shift was an incomplete paradigm shift, as dog owners who picked up their doo wring their hands over the un-ecological solution of using plastic bags for a biodegradable substance ended up in landfills. Biodegradable bags are one strategy. Linda Lombardi writes about a local, truly ecological solution:perhaps the most forward-thinking approach is happening at a dog park in Arizona with a specially designed device that converts dog waste to electricity to power a light. Created by graduate students at Arizona State University, the technology is playfully namedEnergy Transformation Using Reactive Digestion, or E-TURD[5]. There's still work to be done to educatedog[6]owners to use it, and it may sound crazy now, but remember: At first, so did the poop-scoop law. SOURCE: Vet Street[7] There are many challenges facing humanity at this juncture; including being subjected to manipulation of core values. The times require undivided attention, compassion, inclusion, and new vision. We have an abundance of evidence that our circadian rhythm is tied to our health. [6] We need to restore balance between our lifestyle choices and the laws of nature, which govern our sleep and rest, digestion, and elimination. Smart meters and enabled time of use billing will pressure consumers towards unhealthy choices, such as eating a cold sandwich for dinner in the middle of winter. Transmissions of data are causing harm to health and the environment. Conservation, energy efficiency, insulation, energy storage and other initiatives have the potential to eliminate the need for smart meters and punitive time of use billing, but unlike smart meters, they must be tested and monitored for health and environmental impacts. Customers cannot be pressured financially or otherwise to adopt unhealthy behaviors, and reports of harm due to wireless exposures deserve as much scrutiny as complaints from fossil fuel pollution. Customer education can achieve tremendous success if it is directed toward ethical choices. Smart meters are not ethical choices. Dog owners have a duty to deal with their dog doo. Awake and conscious individuals have a duty to deal with the doo-doo that is circulating about 5G, smart meters, and smart grids.

Pacific Power stated that Smart Meters only make only four transmissions a day, and that they broadcast less RF in a year than a cell phone does in 15 minutes.9 Did they lie? A. Yes. Pacific Power has made a number of false statements about Smart Meters, and in this case, they flatly contradict information on Smart Meter RF output provided by both the OPUC1 and by Silver Spring Networks, 10 who makes the Smart Meters Pacific Power installs. With respect to the number of transmissions per day, Pacific Power makes the same claim that Pacific Gas ...ectric made, before a court order forced them to disclose the truth11 that Smart Meters do not transmit signals only a few times a day as PG...laimed, but because of how a Smart Meter mesh network operates, transmit on average 10,000 times a day. And 'downstream' Smart Meters that serve as final transmission points can send out over 190,000 transmissions a day, 20x that average. And, since the RF power unit of a Smart Meter has twice the wattage of a cell phone12 when it does transmit, it sends out a far more powerful signal than a cell phone does.

According to local news KFOR.com, the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation is advocating testing of the drug against COVID-19, the disease caused by the Wuhan coronavirus. From the KFOR.com website:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">James explained that repurposing existing medications is often the fastest path to treating those infected by the virus in a novel way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'That would be really exciting, because it's a drug that already has FDA approval, and it is readily available,' she said. 'If it works, it might treat COVID-19 almost instantly.'</p><p>Wider studies are now underway to confirm the results.</p><p>Chloroquine is best known as a malaria treatment, and it seems very likely to be helpful in preventing coronavirus infections. But what about natural molecules from herbs that might offer the same promise against both malaria and coronavirus?</p><p>Here's a promising candidate herb that prevents malaria and tuberculosis</p><p>In the world of natural medicine, there are already powerful, well-known treatments against malaria that also happen to prevent tuberculosis, an aggressive infection of the respiratory tract. While nothing is yet proven to treat coronavirus, our review of herbal medicine studies and medicinal phytochemicals leads us to the conclusion that this Chinese Medicine herb may one day become known as the 'natural cure' for coronavirus (although clinical trials are needed, obviously, to prove this).</p><p>The chemical is called artemesinin, and the herb is known as sweet wormwood. And no, we don't sell it. This isn't a commercial promotion, it's an effort to help save millions of lives using medicine that's available right now, all around the world.</p><p>Artemesinin is known for its ability to block the bacterial strain that causes tuberculosis, known as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. That doesn't mean it prevents coronavirus, which is a viral infection, but it's a strong candidate for a number of logical reasons.</p><p>According to research published in the journal Phytomedicine, artemisinin / sweet wormwood has a '100% cure rate' for treating drug-resistant malaria, at least in a small trial involving 18 patients (all of whom were cured). As Herbs.news writes in this important story:</p><p>A study led by Pamela Weathers, a professor of biology and biotechnology at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), published in the journal Phytomedicine, describes how the Artemisia annua plant, commonly known as sweet wormwood or sweet annie, saved 18 patients with drug-resistant malaria from the brink of death.</p><p>The Congolese patients, who ranged in age from 14 months to 60 years, had all developed severe, untreatable malaria, with symptoms ranging from loss of consciousness, to trouble breathing and convulsions, among others. When they failed to respond to intravenous treatment with an ACT, compassionate doctors decided to try the dried leaves of the Artemisia annua plant as a last resort. After only five days of the treatment, all 18 patients were fully recovered, including one child who had been in a coma. Blood tests revealed that absolutely no parasites remained in their blood.</p><p>That study was published in Phytomedicine, and the full study is available at this link on ScienceDirect.com. The title of the study is, 'Artemisia annua dried leaf tablets treated malaria resistant to ACT and i.v. artesunate: Case reports.'</p><p>There's even more scientific evidence to back this up. Natural News covered another story about sweet wormwood herb in 2017, entitled, 'Chinese medicine herb discovered to prevent tuberculosis infections.' The story cites a study published in Nature Chemical Biology in 2011.</p><p>Here's part of that story:</p><p>Chinese medicine herb discovered to prevent tuberculosis infections</p><p>A recent study reveals that artemisinin, a compound found in sweet wormwood, shows potential in tuberculosis treatment. This Chinese herbal medicine is previously known for its efficacy in treating malaria. Researchers at the Michigan State University have discovered that the compound prevents Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a tuberculosis-causing bacteria, from becoming dormant. Dormancy was associated with antibiotic resistance in patients.</p><p>Lead researcher Dr. Robert Abramovitch explains that dormant bacteria become highly tolerant to antibiotic therapy. Inhibiting dormancy makes the tuberculosis bacteria more susceptible to drug treatments and shortens treatment duration. To test this, researchers engineered a tuberculosis strain that glows bright green upon the onset of dormancy. A vast number of compounds were then assessed to see if they could prevent the bacteria from becoming dormant.</p><p>According to the researchers, Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Mtb requires oxygen to thrive. Artemisinin is shown to inhibit the molecule called heme found in the bacterium's oxygen sensor, which in turn disrupts the Mtb from sensing its deteriorating oxygen levels. 'When the Mtb is starved of oxygen, it goes into a dormant state, which protects it from the stress of low-oxygen environments. If Mtb can't sense low oxygen, then it can't become dormant and will die,' Dr. Abramovitch says. The researchers have also identified five other compounds that may potentially replicate a similar effect on the bacterium.</p><p>A 2011 study also supports artemisinin's anti-tuberculosis potential. Researchers said using the compound as a conjugation factor induces a selective antagonistic effect against multi- and extensively drug-resistant strains of Mtb. The findings are published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.</p><p>More published studies and papers discuss artemisinin as a complementary treatment against malaria or tuberculosis</p><p>The author of the paper mentioned above, Robert Abramovitch, is also a co-author of a 2016 paper, published in Nature Chemical Biology, which explores the ability of artemesinin to treat tuberculosis, a respiratory illness. This paper is entitled, 'Inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DosRST signaling and persistence.' It says: (bolding added)</p><p>The Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) DosRST two-component regulatory system promotes the survival of Mtb during non-replicating persistence (NRP)\u2026 The screen discovered novel inhibitors of the DosRST regulon, including three compounds that were subject to follow-up studies: artemisinin, HC102A and HC103A. Under hypoxia, all three compounds inhibit Mtb-persistence-associated physiological processes, including triacylglycerol synthesis, survival and antibiotic tolerance. Artemisinin functions by disabling the heme-based DosS and DosT sensor kinases by oxidizing ferrous heme and generating heme-artemisinin adducts.</p><p>In addition, the journal Nature Reviews Microbiology also discusses the use of artemisinin as a therapy against malaria. In this article by Richard. T. Eastman and David A. Fidock, it's explained that artemisinin is now used across the world because malaria has become resistant to the prescription drugs chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. From their summary:</p><p>Drug resistance, however, remains the biggest threat to current drug efficacy. The former mainstays of antimalarial chemotherapy, chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, have been rendered ineffective for the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria by the emergence and spread of drug-resistant parasites.</p><p>Almost all malaria-endemic regions have switched to artemisinin (ART)-based combination therapies (ACTs) for the first-line treatment of P. falciparum malaria.</p><p>The term 'ACTs' means artemisinin-based combination therapies.</p><p>We caution that artemesinin is not proven to treat or cure coronavirus, but so far, nothing else is either</p><p>The upshot of all this is that artemisinin is a promising candidate that might one day be known as the 'natural cure' for coronavirus. However, since nearly every government and science body in the world is run by Big Pharma and the vaccine industry, it's almost certain that this herb will never be tested against coronavirus. The natural cures are, of course, systematically suppressed.</p><p>Fortunately, this herb is widely available right now, and it works with a very high margin of safety, efficacy and affordability. That's precisely why the pharmaceutical industry doesn't want you to know about it, of course: There's not much money to be made in affordable natural cures.</p><p>Yet this is how we can best serve humanity: Find the natural cures that exist right now, test them and disseminate the information as widely as possible. But Big Tech is making sure that all voices that promote natural cures are censored, thereby protecting Big Pharma's profit interests. The DOJ has even announced it's going to conduct criminal investigations into 'false cures' being promoted for the coronavirus, which of course means they will specifically target anyone selling herbs, colloidal silver, chlorine dioxide and so on.</p><p>It's all a grand racket to keep the people isolated from real knowledge while protecting the profits of the corrupt pharmaceutical industry that already kills 200,000+ Americans a year. In fact, so far this year, Big Pharma has killed far more people than the coronavirus, at least for the moment.</p><p>While I can't tell you what to do with your own personal health strategy, I encourage you to discuss artemisinin with your naturopathic physician to determine if it's a good fit. Personally, I'm stocking up on this herb and will start taking a preventive dose immediately. Should I begin to show any symptoms of respiratory distress or fever, I'll up my daily dose of this along with a wide assortment of other vitamins, herbs, minerals and superfoods that might also be effective.</p><p>Rest assured, the corrupt establishment will make sure that sweet wormwood never gets tested against the coronavirus. That's how they can say, in perpetuity, there's 'no evidence' that it works. There's no evidence because they refuse to test it, just like the CDC managed to claim coronavirus infections were 'low' in America because they deliberately botched the testing kits.</p><p>It's amazing what the corrupt establishment can achieve by avoiding testing the things they don't want to test, isn't it?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRUDCT-BRUDIR1803202000022</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRUDCT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YFR-JJF1-JCH9-G056-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">423883</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1702\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 BruDirect All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>BruDirect</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 18, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0006CQX</classCode><className>OKLAHOMA MEDICAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FOOD &amp;

It's impressive technology that makes cars safer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But for all the impressive engineering, there's a bigger problem with all this modern technology in new cars. Namely, the complex software that connects vehicles to the internet, allowing car companies to gather vital data about drivers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nowadays, data is the new oil. It's a commodity. There aren't any rules on how and where it is being stored or used. But if big companies are going to gather and use that valuable data - shouldn't they be paying for it? After all, they're profiting from our personal information. We should get a cut of it, too. It's our data - we own it. We should know how it is being used. In the future, we should think of data as a product that can be monetized, so we can all share in the wealth.</p><p>How much information is being collected in our cars while we're driving? Think about it. Advanced safety systems use cameras, sensors and GPS systems to gather information about roads and obstacles in our path, but it's also collecting data about the driver, their driving habits and driving routes. There's also other data being collected - information on our contact lists and favorite music selections via our smartphones, synced to Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Smartphone apps from Kia and GM let you lock and unlock our doors from anywhere in the world or remotely start your vehicle with the push of a few buttons on your phone. Ford, BMW and other automakers offer in-car roaming WiFi hotspots, allowing access to social media. Tesla has over-the-air software updates. Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Hyundai have their own in-car voice-activated personal assistants, while Lexus, Toyota and Ford use Amazon's in-car Alexa voice command system to let you talk to your car and ask it to perform a number of tasks - everything from adjusting the temperature to changing the ambient lighting in the cabin's interior.</p><p>Last year, at the international press launch of the 2019 Mercedes-Benz A-Class in Split, Croatia, I tested Mercedes-Benz's new in-vehicle personal assistant, dubbed MBUX. Similar to Amazon's Alexa, the Mercedes system supposedly understands multiple languages and natural speech. Say, for example, \"Hey Mercedes, I'm cold,\" and the temperature raises by one degree. It worked well when speaking English, but when asked similar commands in Italian, it didn't do as well. After making a few cracks about its language barriers, the system responds back, \"Now, now. Be nice!\" It's a bit alarming and uncomfortable to be scolded by a car. But even worse is having it listen to my personal conversation. Where's my privacy? What's happening to the data and personal information that's being collected while I'm driving? Who owns it? Is it being shared with third parties?</p><p>Gone are the days of the Model T. Cars are becoming sophisticated computers on wheels. Modern cars have more than 100 sensors, generating significant data about our every move - where we shop, what we eat, the music we play, the routes we take - while automakers and tech companies such as Google, Apple and Amazon are profiting from it. They're using voice, location and behavioural data to buy and sell ads, tailored specifically to target the right demographic and increase sales and profits. And all that information can be bundled and sold to third parties, like auto-insurance companies, to generate more money in the future.</p><p>Perhaps a data tax on a company's gross revenues would do the trick. That's what California Governor Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers are proposing with their \"data dividend\" plan, where tech companies would pay the state or consumers a fraction of the revenue made if their personal data is sold.</p><p>Last year, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/27/chris-hughes-facebook-google-data-tax-regulation\">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/27/chris-hughes-facebook-google-data-tax-regulation</url> with the value of labour in The Guardian. While a single person's data isn't worth much, a collection of it is. Hughes also suggested a data dividend model - something similar to Alaska's Permanent Fund Dividend, which divides an equal portion of a tax on oil companies in the state to Alaskan residents. According to Hughes, it works out to roughly $1,500 per person a year. The fund has benefited the entire state and helped Alaska achieve one of the lowest levels of income equality in the U.S., according to the Gini Index, which measures income distribution to determine inequality. It's a smart, bold move and one that automakers should consider in the future.</p><p>After all, why should only big tech companies and car companies profit from our data? We helped create their wealth. We should all benefit and reap the rewards of it, too.</p><p>Shopping for a new car?

Google, we're told, is subject of a looming antitrust probe by the DOJ[2]. Amazon, we've learned, is facing growing scrutiny from the FTC[3]. Apple stock also did a nose dive on the news[4] that it too may soon be subject to a significant new antitrust probe. On its surface, many of these actions aren't all that surprising. After all, experts have noted for a decade than US antitrust enforcement has grown toothless and frail[5], and our definitions of monopoly power need updating in the Amazon era[6]. Facebook's repeated face plants on privacy (and basic transparency and integrity) have only added fuel to the fire amidst calls to regulate \"big tech.\" </p><p>Oddly missing from coverage from these probes is the fact that much of this behavior by the Trump administration may *gasp* not be driven by a genuine interest in protecting markets and consumer welfare. For one, it's hard to believe that an administration that has shown it's little more than a rubber stamp for sectors like telecom[7] is seriously worried about monopoly power. Two, it's hard to believe an administration obsessed with partisan fever dreams of nonexistent censorship[8] is going to come at these inquiries with integrity, and not, say, as a vessel to pursue a pointed partisan agenda. I've been arguing for a while that while many of the calls to regulate big tech are driven by genuine worries about monopoly power, a lot of it is being driven by the telecom sector. For years now, telecom lobbyists and policy folks have been using the anger over Facebook to covertly call for heavier regulation of Silicon Valley[9]. You see, these telecom lobbyists, who just got done convincing the Trump administration to neuter FCC oversight of their own natural monopolies[10], are looking for any advantage they can get as they try to compete with companies like Google in the online ad space. This is how former FCC boss turned cable lobbyist Michael Powell put it at a recent conference[11]:\"Our governmental authorities need to get a handle on what kind of market power and harm flow from companies that have an unassailable hold on large pools of big data, which serve as barriers to entry, allowing them to dominate industries throughout the economy. For years, big tech companies have been extinguishing competitive threats by buying or crushing promising new technologies just as they were emerging. They dominate their core business, and rarely have to foreclose competition by buying their peers. Competition policy must scrutinize more rigorously deals that allow dominant platforms to kill competitive technologies in the cradle.\"If you've watched as telecom giants have crushed every and any competitive threat by buying state and federal government, this entire paragraph should be fairly amusing to you. Powell's clients couldn't care less about anti-competitive behavior. What they do want is, again, for government to erect regulatory barriers that hamper the Silicon Valley companies whose ad revenues giants like AT...nd Comcast have drooled over for the better part of the last fifteen years. In the Trump administration they've finally found a vessel for this agenda. The problem, of course, is there's enough legitimate bipartisan worry about the power of big tech that this little telecom sector lobbying gambit has been able to fly under the radar as the real driver of this new Trump administration push. Even with former Verizon lawyers now at the head of the DOJ (Bill Barr[12]) and the Trump FCC (Ajit Pai[13]). But there's a reason the Trump administration ignores telecom's monopoly and privacy issues while amplifying Silicon Valley's, and I'd argue it has a lot more to do with protectionism than a genuine worry about healthy markets. If you were remotely serious about addressing the US' monopoly and antitrust problems, there's no way you'd simply ignore telecom. Giants like AT...nd Comcast already enjoy natural monopolies over the on ramp to the internet[14]. They've then increasingly hoovered up countless media companies as they also position themselves to dominate the media flowing over those connections. This conflict and the potential for anticompetitive behavior sits at the heart of the net neutrality debate[15]. Now, giants like AT...ant to become the next Google, with data harvesting plans every bit as problematic if not more so[16]. Yet again, notice how telecom gets a free pass by the Trump administration? Notice how Silicon Valley is demonized, but telecom's surveillance and anti-competitive gambits see zero backlash? I don't think it's happenstance that this new Trump \"big tech\" antitrust push comes as big telecom has asked for just such a push to aid its own competitive agenda. A lot of folks on both sides of the political aisle who'd like to see more done to rein in \"big tech\" seem a touch oblivious to the possibility that this new antitrust push may not be entirely in good faith. There's a good chance these antitrust inquiries into Google, Facebook, and Apple are little more than partisan fever dreams co-driven by telecom lobbyists, yet a lot of outlets and experts are acting as if market health and consumer welfare are genuine motivators. It's entirely unclear what the Trump administration did to suddenly earn this blanket trust, but as the net neutrality fracas made pretty clear, it sure as hell isn't its several year track record on coherent tech policy.Permalink[17] | Comments[18] | Email This Story[19] [ 1]: <url

Though the hearing was ostensibly about antitrust, in practice, it was a forum for members of Congress to air their grievances about the influence that technology companies have, especially over public discourse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While large technology companies are still undergoing enormous growth, even in the face of the massive disruption caused by the coronavirus, they are under fire from both sides in Washington.</p><p>Democrats, still trying to delegitimize President Trump\u2019s win in the 2016 election, attribute his victory to the proliferation of \u201cfake news\u201d on social media. In practice, their definition of \u201cfake news\u201d manages to target conservative and pro-Trump content disproportionately while ignoring conspiracy theories fostered on the Left. </p><p>Twitter, Facebook, and Google (through its search and YouTube platforms), which are largely dominated by left-liberal executives and staff, have heeded Democrats and begun deplatforming and demonetizing voices on the Right. </p><p>Twitter has slapped warning labels on Trump tweets and suspended Donald Trump Jr. temporarily, even as it allows the Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, unmoderated use of his account to advocate Holocaust denialism and terrorism and to call Israel a \u201ccancerous growth\u201d that must be \u201cuprooted and destroyed.\u201d</p><p>Twitter is a leading forum for public discussion. Facebook and Google are tremendous drivers of traffic to websites. Additionally, Google\u2019s ad platform is a leading way for publishers to make money, and YouTube remains the dominant video platform for independent voices to express their views and earn money.</p><p>The left-liberal tech companies mistakenly think they can placate Democrats by targeting conservatives. In reality, philosophically speaking, the Left is much more skeptical of the concentration of power by large companies within an industry and much more willing to use federal regulatory and enforcement power to squash private businesses. Politicians such as Sens. Elizabeth Warren aren\u2019t going to be satisfied because Facebook or Twitter removes a few conservative users. </p><p>On the Right, there is a split. </p><p>The libertarian streak that runs through the Republican Party and the conservative movement is skeptical of antitrust enforcement and federal regulation. This group is more amenable to having the government step aside so companies operate freely and let the market work out problems. This group believes that those who don\u2019t like the policies of Big Tech are free to start their own platforms, as they have done with Parler, an alternative to Twitter.</p><p>But faithful free-marketers are losing the intraparty battle to conservatives prominently identified in Congress with Sen. Josh Hawley. From the perspective of these conservatives, large technology firms have too much control over the content people see. According to this view, if Big Tech is going to enjoy freedom from legal liability and avoid antitrust enforcement, it should be made to provide forums that are free of bias. </p><p>These conservatives see how Democrats beat corporations into submission by taking or threatening legal action, and they believe Republicans should not unilaterally disarm by simply singing the praises of the free market and watching as conservative voices disappear behind a wall of corporate censorship.</p><p>There are reasons to be skeptical of Hawley's proposed solution, which would require social media platforms that wish to have immunity from lawsuits to go before the Federal Trade Commission every two years to obtain certification that they are removing content in a politically neutral manner. Such arrangements grant power to the government to police content and would probably lead to even more censorship, as tech companies would probably err on the side of removing any vaguely political content so as not to take any chances.</p><p>But tech companies should recognize that if they continue to demonstrate clear bias against conservatives, then Hawley's side will prevail in the intraparty fight.</p><p>This would be unwise for tech companies, for in the long run, their only allies as they get larger and more influential are going to be free-market conservatives, who aren\u2019t automatically spooked when companies become successful. </p><p>If Big Tech companies continue to target and make enemies of conservatives, they will unite both sides of the political aisle against them. Democrats already have fewer qualms about going after large corporations.</p><p>The solution is not to go in the other direction and disproportionately favor conservative content, but to have platforms get out of content policing as much as possible. If content poses a direct and imminent threat to safety, few would argue with its removal. But once platforms with hundreds of millions of users try to moderate content, when there are large disagreements over what qualifies as offensive or what counts as \u201cfake news,\u201d they are inevitably going to lead to arbitrary judgment calls and bias.</p><p>As private enterprises, social media firms are allowed to set their own policies, so this is not an issue about free speech in a constitutional sense. But democracy thrives on open speech, and when companies dominating modern communication platforms restrict speech in a biased manner, the ramifications are alarming. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2437648350</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60R9-FTD1-JBHT-D2P5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"898\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

Apple's pouring its ad money into promoting iCloud. Microsoft has SkyDrive, and rumors of Google launching an online storage system have been circulating since about the time U2 played at Red Rocks.</p><p>IT needs to get excited about this trend. You're probably only a year into coming to grips with the \"bring your own device\" movement, addressing the serious security and compliance problems, but constant change is the new reality of business IT. In the not-so-distant future, if not now, your employees will expect a \"bring your own cloud\"--BYOC--policy that mimics their consumer experience.</p><p>Personal cloud storage is as simple as it sounds: free online storage in the 2-GB to 5-GB range. While big tech vendors such as Apple and Microsoftare all over this trend, get to know Dropbox and its enterprise-focused (and unaffiliated) equivalent, Box.</p><p>Dropbox is the embodiment of the consumerization of IT. It makes saving files online mindlessly simple. Want to give a bunch of people access to your 12-MB PowerPoint presentation without crushing their inboxes? Save it to Dropbox and give them access. The only problem I've faced was bumping up against transfer limits trying to upload from my iPad an enormous file containing video of an entire half of my daughter's soccer game.</p><p>Dropbox is a consumer-first service, but it's working to be more business friendly, adding a Dropbox Teams option that provides administrative controls and 1 TB of data for $795 for five users. It's mostly a small-business service, but departments of large companies are using it for tasks like sharing large graphics with outside partners, says ChenLi Wang, Dropbox's head of business development. If you're in a highly sensitive or regulated world like defense, banking, or healthcare, \"our service as it stands today isn't a good fit,\" Wang acknowledges.</p><p>Box is the opposite of Dropbox. Box started with an enterprise vision for online personal storage. Yes, we're talking about young, venture-backed entrepreneurs creating a Web startup with enterprise IT in mind. It has raised $125 million in funding and has 400 employees, and \"we focus most of our improvements on security and administrative controls,\" said Box CFO Dylan Smith at this month's Wells FargoTech Summit in San Francisco. Its typical enterprise sale strategy is \"land and expand,\" Smith said--start with something like a 200-seat pilot and hope it goes viral.</p><p>Smith said companies are using Box alongside collaboration tools such as Jive, Chatter, and Yammer, so that in addition to talking about what they're going to do they can share the related PowerPoints, PDFs, and other files. Some use it as a front end to existing content management systems, such as Microsoft SharePoint. Smith said Box's next big investment will be in getting to true enterprise scale; Box has focused on supporting thousands of workers at a company, and now it will focus on supporting tens of thousands.</p><p>Here's one rub for CIOs: From what I can tell, Box isn't replacing something for you. It has a lot of potential as a nifty productivity gainer, one that makes IT hugely popular, but you know how hard it is to put ROI on productivity. It's looking like a net additional cost, at least near term.</p><p>IT may not have much choice. Jerry Johnson, CIO of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, predicts that IT leaders who don't think public services such as Box meet their security or functional needs will have to replicate this kind of service with an in-house option.</p><p>Jason Maynard, the Wells Fargosoftware industry analyst who hosted the firm's Tech Summit, made this point while talking on stage with Box's CFO: Just like photos are the fuel to personal social networks, big files are the fuel for modern collaboration systems. The output of knowledge workers is a PowerPoint, a PDF, a project management plan. Those are only useful if shared, so IT needs to make that easy to do.</p><p>Mobile devices will increase pressure to provide an easy way to move things created on a PC to a smartphone or tablet, and to share huge files without exceeding corporate inbox limits (or resorting to Gmail).</p><p>Delivering consumer IT services in a business environment isn't easy. IT teams have tried to replicate Facebook inside the enterprise, with disappointing results. BYOD, on the other hand, has been an IT success--once IT embraced the challenge. The pressure to deliver on BYOC is coming fast.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.informationweek.com\">www.informationweek.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDSB&amp;I-7632687</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">7632687 WBI</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:55GW-77R1-DYV1-93H5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">210548</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"794\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2012 CMP Media, Inc.

Supporters cheered the decision as a victory for the free and open internet, where the deep pockets of big companies couldn't buy faster web speeds over struggling startups.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since then, the issue has largely faded from the spotlight and has rarely come up on the presidential campaign trail. But internet policy experts said the FCC decision was far from the end of the story - and with just more than 10 weeks until the election, time is running out for voters to ask the candidates to clarify their positions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Net neutrality rules, also known as \"open internet,\" prohibit internet service providers from favoring certain high-traffic websites, like Netflix and Amazon, by giving them greater bandwidth at the expense of smaller start-up companies. Advocates argue that it ensures an even playing field. An open internet also means banning fast lanes, which would allow ISPs like Verizon and AT&amp;T to pay extra to ensure smoother, speedier streaming for their users.</p><p>Internet companies have vowed to continue the fight against the regulation, pursuing it all the way to the Supreme Court if need be. This June, a divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected challenges to the net neutrality rules. The next president's administration, and the FCC, will face the colossal task of catching up to technology that evolves beyond its ability to regulate it.</p><p>Clinton would follow in Obama's footsteps on internet policy.</p><p><person><nameText>Hillary Clinton's </nameText></person>campaign website says she \"strongly supports the FCC decision under the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>to adopt strong network neutrality rules.\"</p><p>While she would be following in the <person><nameText>Obama administration's </nameText></person>footsteps, Clinton has her own decadelong record of supporting net neutrality. While serving as a New York senator, she co-sponsored the Internet Freedom Preservation Act, which sought to amend the 1934 Communications Act to ensure net neutrality.</p><p>\"The internet as we know it does not discriminate among its users,\" she said in 2006. \"It does not decide who can enter its marketplace and it does not pick which views can be heard and which ones silenced.\"</p><p>Ten years later, adopting tech sector-friendly policies is proving to be a smart fundraising strategy for the Democratic nominee. This week she wrapped up a fundraising tour that included several Silicon Valley hotspots. One of the events was hosted by Apple CEO Tim Cook, with tickets selling for $2,700 to $50,000.</p><p>Clinton has also worked broadband issues into her infrastructure platform.</p><p>\"By 2020, I want 100 percent of American households to have access to quality, affordable high-speed internet, no matter where they live,\" Clinton told supporters at a dinner in New Hampshire last November.</p><p>Trump - no policy yet, except for a tweet</p><p>The Republican nominee's position is unclear, but it's a reasonable assumption that he will line up with his party's opposition to net neutrality, which is seen as needless government regulation.</p><p>In fact, the only public acknowledgment of the issue from Donald Trump is a 2014 tweet weighing in on net neutrality when it dominated the headlines.</p><p>\"Obama's attack on the internet is another top down power grab. Net neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine. Will target the conservative media,\" he tweeted. He was referring to the 1940s law requiring newscasters to report the news in a balanced manner, which was repealed in 1987. It's unclear what it has to do with net neutrality; open internet rules don't give the FCC the power to interfere with any political content, conservative or otherwise.</p><p>The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>His running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, co-sponsored the Internet Freedom Act in 2011, which sought to kill net neutrality by prohibiting the FCC \"from further regulating the internet.\"</p><p>The positions of Trump's opponents for the Republican nomination shed a bit more light on the party's opposition to open internet regulation.</p><p>Texas Sen. Ted Cruz famously called net neutrality \"Obamacare for the internet.\" Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said regulation of the internet was illogical.</p><p>\"While the FCC plan supposedly seeks to prevent ISPs from playing favorites, it does so by giving that power to another entity: government,\" Rubio wrote in an opinion piece for Politico in March. \"The answer to correcting injustice in an economy is to increase consumer power, not government power.\"</p><p>The details of internet policy aside, there are other reasons the sector might not support Trump.</p><p>\"The tech community is full of immigrants who started their companies here, so many of them were founded by immigrants,\" said Marvin Ammori, a First Amendment lawyer well-known for his work on net neutrality issues who's general counsel for Hyperloop One, a tech company backed by Elon Musk that's working on an ultra-fast transit system. \"So if you're anti-immigrant you're not going to be popular in (Silicon) Valley. If you're anti-gay you're not going to be popular in the Valley. . So it does put Republicans at a disadvantage even if they're progressive on some tech issues.\"</p><p>How much does it matter to the internet's future who becomes president?</p><p>\"The president does matter,\" Ammori said, pointing out that the president's party gets to pick three of the five FCC commissioners, as well as appoint the solicitor general, who would defend the regulations in front of the Supreme Court - or not.</p><p>\"This (net neutrality) was a 3-2 vote. If you get another Republican in there they could undermine everything the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>has done,\" he said.</p><p>(EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE)</p><p>Despite the FCC decision, some ISPs are finding loopholes to go around net neutrality rules. For example, they might set monthly data limits for users but exempt certain apps or websites. This is known as \"zero rating,\" and some internet advocates argue it gives certain content preferential treatment.</p><p>\"These policies will have to evolve and change, and as carriers try to introduce new services and 'innovative pricing models,' what ends up happening is you always have to make sure it remains an even playing field,\" Ammori said.</p><p>One of the clearest examples is T-Mobile's unlimited streaming service \"Binge On.\" While it might seem like a good thing for consumers, some internet policy experts worry that while it's technically legal, its model infringes on net neutrality. Users are allowed to stream video without it counting toward their monthly data cap - but only as long as they stream from a select group of content providers. Smaller, less established video services that aren't Netflix or HBO Go might never get to consumers, and that could stifle innovation for online startups.</p><p>\"Right now the FCC is somewhat quiet on this, since within the net neutrality order itself this is allowed, so the FCC is reviewing them on a case-by-case basis,\" said Brake of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.</p><p>The use of zero rating practices by internet service providers will likely become a big tech issue for the next administration.</p><p>\"Binge On undermines the core vision of net neutrality,\" Barbara van Schewick, the director of the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, wrote in a report on the T-Mobile service. \"Internet service providers that connect us to the internet should not act as gatekeepers that pick winners and losers online by favoring some applications over others.\"</p><p>---</p><p>\u00a92016 McClatchy Washington Bureau</p><p>Visit the McClatchy Washington Bureau at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com\">www.mcclatchydc.com</url></p><p>Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p><p>-----</p><p>Topics: t000138315,t000002953,t000047682,t000138309,t000047680,t000043891,t000003086,t000012820,t000410083,t000002537,t000040350,t000002664</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LEWMT-020560196</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LEWMT2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KKG-TDM1-JCDG-Y3S3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11805</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1301\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Tribune Publishing Co.

Much of Capitol Hill's distrust for the initiative was on display Wednesday morning, as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before the House Financial Services Committee.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Elected representatives may distrust Facebook because of its past conduct. They may even harbor concerns about Big Tech firms with copious amounts of customer data becoming involved in financial services. But if Libra never comes to pass, a similar initiative will urgently need to take its place in order to increase global financial inclusion. Without easy access to payments and credit, those living in low- and middle-income countries will struggle to build the businesses and human capital required to match the standard of living of wealthy countries.</p><p>The Libra Association was proposed in June as a network with its own currency that could be used for payments and other transactions. Members of the Libra Association, which included Facebook and 27 corporate partners, would ensure that each unit of Libra was backed by financial assets denominated in a mix of stable national currencies, such as the US dollar and the euro. This would help keep Libra's value from fluctuating wildly, unlike other digital currencies like Bitcoin. The members would also validate transactions and offer Libra-based products, such as digital wallets.</p><p>But Facebook's leading role in the initiative immediately earned Libra political blowback due to the firm's huge size, its past use of customer data and its recent involvement in controversial votes such as the 2016 US presidential election. Rep. Maxine Waters, Chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, called on Facebook to place a \"moratorium\" on the project. Senator Sherrod Brown, the Senate Banking Committee's leading Democrat, dismissed Libra as \"a risky new cryptocurrency [run] out of a Swiss bank account.\" Brown and Hawaii Senator Brian Schatz earlier this month sent strongly-worded letters to Libra Association partners Stripe, Visa, and Mastercard which a few days later announced their decision withdraw from the project.</p><p>The great paradox of the public response to Libra is that what many regard as a threat is also the project's greatest promise. Facebook's enormous network has 2.4 billion active users and would be supplemented by the hundreds of millions of customers from Libra's partners. The larger a payment network's size, the more attractive it becomes to other potential users. That, of course, is also true of currency. Libra will rely on its large established user network to compensate for the fact that the value of each Libra unit will fluctuate relative to those of the national currencies people use daily.</p><p>The Libra Association seeks to ensure trust in the network by backing every unit of Libra with relatively safe assets such as bank deposits and government bonds from stable countries. The interest income from Libra's bond holdings of sovereign bonds will subsidize payments on the Libra network, which Libra's backers hope will further encourage adoption.</p><p>The costliest payments today are international: immigrant remittances to developing countries, monetary transfers from politically unstable and high-inflation economies to more stable markets and payments for goods purchased abroad. Furthermore, while the US dollar is the global reserve currency today, it may not be in the future. Creating a basket of currencies is one way to make a payments network like Libra internationally attractive and able to remain useful in the future should the US dollar decline.</p><p>For advocates of greater financial inclusion, Libra has the added advantage of linking payments directly to mobile technology. Globally, the World Bank estimates two-thirds of unbanked adults own a cell phone. Existing mobile payments services are of little use to the unbanked, since they require a bank account or debit card. Mobile money accounts, such as the digital wallets that would run on the Libra network, on the other hand, could do much to ease access to basic financial services by the financially excluded.</p><p>As the World Bank documented in its most recent Findex Database report, which tracks account ownership trends around the world, mobile money accounts have led the way in the expansion of access to financial services across Africa and parts of Asia and Latin America. Between 2014 and 2017 alone, countries like Burkina-Faso, Senegal and Zimbabwe managed to double and triple their rates of financial inclusion -- thanks in large part to mobile accounts. A currency such as Libra, separate from government and managed independently, could help hundreds of millions of global unbanked achieve not just convenience, but financial security, too.</p><p>Rich countries could also benefit from Libra. Despite America's status as a financial services leader, its unbanked problem has only partly subsided in recent years, going from 7.7% of households in 2009 to 6.5% in 2017. Post-2008 regulations that were put in place following the financial crisis have led to substantially increased account maintenance fees, making it more expensive for low-income Americans to hold bank accounts. Laws seeking to curb money-laundering have driven banks to eschew business with certain customers. The high fees that low-income immigrants currently pay to send money abroad are another reason to welcome an innovation such as Libra to promote financial inclusion.</p><p>Progressive politicians such as Waters and Brown claim to have made financial inclusion a priority. Yet, so long as Congress isn't ready to consider major changes to current banking legislation and the regulatory burdens it poses, non-bank payments innovations like Libra remain one of the few lifelines for the financially excluded. Policymakers, even those keen to scare Facebook away from payments provision, should reflect on the consequences that their risk aversion will have for the most vulnerable Americans.</p><p>If Libra ends up not coming into existence, we will still need something like it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20191023zuckerberg-facebook-libra1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBH-R101-JBPX-X151-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1019\"/><timeReceived>2:19 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 23, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000266V</classCode><className>VISA INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This is not to say that Amazon, Alibaba and others are getting boring - they are all also invested in payments and lending - but Facebook's entry is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, as the Western World's largest social network, it is important; on the other hand, as the Western World's largest abuser of trust and privacy, it is challenged. Gen Z kids graduating from university campuses are rejecting Facebook,[1] after the Cambridge Analytica outcry, and my favourite meme always gets a laugh at conferences (because the audience knows it's true). </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Mark_Zuckerberg_spying_not_your_dad.png\">https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Mark_Zuckerberg_spying_not_your_dad.png</url> However, providing a payments service using blockchain does not need trust in the same way as full-scale banking does, so they may succeed in this venture. Bear in mind, this is also not necessarily in Facebook as it can also be used in Instagram and WhatsApp, both owned by Facebook but seen in a different way as they are separate brands. Equally, it's not so new. Facebook has had an EU e-money licence for five years[2], and has focused upon financial services for longer. My view is that they're not offering anything that's a real threat to banks, as their largest advertisers are banks. Why would you cut the hand that feeds you? (Comment: the same is true with Google and AWS's biggest users are banks, so same with Amazon) The threat is far more to payments firms like Western Union and foreign exchange firms. After all, if you can make seamless, frictionless, global payments via WhatsApp for free, why would you use someone else? The media focus on Facebook payments is ramping up after The Wall Street Journal[3] (paywall) reported on May 2that Facebook is recruiting dozens of financial firms and online merchants to help launch its cryptocurrency network. The WSJ reports that they refer to the developments as Project Libra internally. Facebook is raising $1 billion in capital to launch its stablecoin, and has actively been talking about such plans with Visa, MasterCard and First Data. I'm sure those talks were interesting as their plan includes wiping out interchange fees, which may not be something the card networks appreciate. Barclays analyst Ross Sandler recently estimated that Facebook's cryptocurrency project could yield anywhere from$3 billion to $19 billion[4]in additional revenue by 2021, so you can see why this would make sense. On May 2 Facebook also registered a new company in Switzerland called Libra Networks LLC[5]. It's a FinTech firm focusing on 'investing, payments, financing, identity management, analytics, big data, blockchain and other technologies,' according to Geneva's commercial register published on May 7. For the full background and build up to the registration of Libra Networks, Cryptopedic[6] posted an interested summary which shows Zuckerberg's first statements about his interest in cryptocurrency dates back to January 2018[7], just as bitcoin peaked at $20,000 a coin. But there are two spanners in the works. First, Facebook's co-founder Chris Hughes[8] has called for Facebook to be broken up: ''I'm angry that [Mark's] focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks' As has presidential candidates Senators Elizabeth Warren[9] and Bernie Saunders. Facebook's COO Sheryl Sandberg[10] rejects the issue: 'You could break us up, you could break other tech companies up, but you actually don't address the underlying issues people are concerned about. They're concerned about election security, they're concerned about content. They're concerned about privacy and data portability. We know at Facebook that we have a real responsibility to do better, and to earn back people's trust.' She recognises Facebook has lost trust, but not that they should lose control. Interesting. Second, and possibly a bigger issue, is a letter addressed to Mark Zuckerberg on May 9 from the United States Senate's Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs andsigned by Chairman Mike Crapo and Ranking Member Sherrod Brown. Here is the letter in full[11]:Dear Mr. Zuckerberg: This week the Senate Banking Committee held its first hearing on Privacy Rights and Data Collection in a Digital Economy. Earlier this year, the Senate Banking Committee's Chairman and Ranking Member invited feedback on the collection, use and protection of sensitive information by financial regulators and private companies in light of the immense growth and use of data for a multitude of purposes across the economy. As the Committee moves forward with additional hearings to build the record for legislation, it is important to understand how large social platforms make data available that can be used in ways that have big implications for consumers' financial lives, including to market or make decisions on financial products or services that impact a consumer's access to or cost of credit and insurance products, or in ways that impact their employment prospects. It is also important to understand how large social platforms use financial data to profile and target consumers. TheWall Street Journalrecently reported that Facebook is recruiting dozens of financial firms and online merchants to help launch a cryptocurrency-based payments system using its social network. Last year, Facebook asked U.S. banks to share detailed financial information about consumers. In addition, privacy experts have raised questions about Facebook's extensive data collection practices and whether any of the data collected by Facebook is being used for purposes that do or should subject Facebook to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Accordingly, please respond to the following questions. 1) How would this new cryptocurrency-based payment system work, and what outreach has there been to financial regulators to ensure it meets all legal and regulatory requirements? 2) What privacy and consumer protections would users have under the new payment system? 3) What consumer financial information does Facebook have that it has received from a financial company? 4) To the extent Facebook has received consumer financial information from a financial company, what does Facebook do with such information and how does Facebook safeguard the information? 5) Does Facebook share or sell any consumer information (or information derived from consumer information) with any unaffiliated third parties? 6) Does Facebook have any information bearing on an individual's (or group of individuals') creditworthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics or mode of living that is used (either by Facebook or an unaffiliated third party) to establish eligibility for, or marketing of a product or service related to, (1) credit, (2) insurance, (3) employment, or (4) housing? 7) How does Facebook ensure that information bearing on an individual's (or group of individuals') creditworthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, and/or personal characteristics is not used in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act?I have not seen any official response to this letter from Facebook yet, but I guess the bottom-line is that Facebook may have developed a stablecoin using blockchain to enable global payments within Messenger, Instagram and Whatsapp but the day they press that button into production will be the day when the regulators come down hard. In fact, it shows the gulf between Alipay and WeChat Pay, where social networks in China work with the government to enable integrated social, commercial and financial superapps. In the USA, the government does not want such integration as the firms are commercial operators working in shareholder rather than government interests. An interesting space to watch.

We were entering into Government at a grave moment in the modern history of Britain.  At a time when people felt uncertainty, even fear.  Here was the challenge:  To make an insolvent nation solvent again.  To set our country back on the path to prosperity that all can share in.  To bring home our troops from danger while keeping our citizens safe from terror.  To mend a broken society.  Two and a half years later of course I can't tell you that all is well, but I can say this:  Britain is on the right track.  As Prime Minister it has fallen to me to say some hard things and to help our country face some hard truths.  All of my adult life, whatever the difficulties, the British people have at least been confident about one thing. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have thought we can pay our way. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That we can earn our living as a major industrial country...</p><p>...and we will always remain one.  It has fallen to us to say - we cannot assume that any longer. </p><p>Unless we act, unless we take difficult, painful decisions, unless we show determination and imagination, Britain may not be in the future what it has been in the past.</p><p>Because the truth is this. </p><p>We are in a global race today.</p><p>And that means an hour of reckoning for countries like ours. </p><p>Sink or swim. Do or decline.   To take office at such a moment is a duty and an honour...</p><p>...and we will rise to the challenge. </p><p>Today I'm going to set out a serious argument to this country about how we do that.</p><p>How we compete and thrive in this world...</p><p>...how we can make sure in this century, like the ones before, Britain is on the rise.</p><p>Nothing matters more. </p><p>Every battle we fight, every plan we make, every decision we take is to achieve that end...</p><p>...Britain on the rise.</p><p>BRITAIN CAN DELIVER</p><p>Though the challenge before us is daunting, I have confidence in our country. </p><p>Why?</p><p>Because Britain can deliver. We can do big things. </p><p>We saw it this summer. </p><p>The Jubilee, the Olympics, the Paralympics...</p><p>...the best country in the world...</p><p>...and let's say it: with our Queen, the finest Head of State on earth.</p><p>I was trying to think of my favourite moment. </p><p>Was it telling President Hollande that no, we hadn't cheated at the cycling, we didn't have rounder wheels, it was just that we peddled faster than the French?</p><p>No... for me it was seeing that young woman who swam her heart out for years... </p><p>...nine training sessions a week, two hours a time.</p><p>My best moment was putting that gold medal around the neck of Ellie Simmonds.  </p><p>And I am so grateful for what all those Paralympians did. </p><p>When I used to push my son Ivan around in his wheelchair, I always thought that some people saw the wheelchair, not the boy.</p><p>Today more people would see the boy and not the wheelchair - and that's because of what happened here this summer.</p><p>And the Olympics showed us something else. </p><p>Whether our athletes were English, Scottish, Welsh or from Northern Ireland...</p><p>....they draped themselves in one flag. </p><p>Now, there's one person who didn't like that...</p><p>...and he's called Alex Salmond. </p><p>I'm going to see him on Monday to sort that referendum on independence by the end of 2014. </p><p>There are many things I want this coalition to achieve but what could matter more than saving our United Kingdom...</p><p>...let's say it: we're better together and we'll rise together - so let's fight that referendum with everything we've got. </p><p>There are so many people to thank for this summer.</p><p>Those that won the bid, those that built the stadia, that ran the Games...</p><p>...and of course: the man who put a smile on our faces...</p><p>...the zinger on the zip-wire...</p><p>...the Conservative Mayor of London: our Boris Johnson. </p><p>And those Games-Makers.</p><p>You know, I've spent three years trying to explain the Big Society...</p><p>...they did it beautifully in just three weeks.</p><p>. </p><p>There is another group of people who stepped into the breach this summer - and we in this party never forget them.</p><p>Our armed forces have been on the ground in Afghanistan for over ten years now.</p><p>433 men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice.</p><p>Just last weekend there was a memorial service for one of the fallen, and the eulogy said this:</p><p>\"All that they had they gave. All that they might have had. All that they had ever been. All that they might ever have become.\"</p><p>For all those who serve, and their families, I repeat the commitment I made when this Government came to office. </p><p>By the end of 2014, all UK combat operations in Afghanistan will have come to an end. </p><p>Nearly all our troops will be home - their country proud, their duty done...</p><p>...and let everyone in this hall stand and show how profoundly grateful we are for everything they do. </p><p>CONSERVATIVES CAN DELIVER</p><p>To meet the challenges our country faces, we must have confidence in ourselves... confidence as a party.</p><p>We've been in office two and a half years now - and we've done some big, life-changing things.</p><p>Just ask Clive Stone, who you saw in a film earlier. </p><p>I met him years ago, when we were in Opposition. </p><p>He had cancer and he said to me: the drug I need - it's out there but they won't give it to me because it's too expensive...</p><p>...please, if you get in, do something about it. </p><p>And we have. A new cancer drugs fund that has got the latest drugs to more than 21,000 people and counting.</p><p>There was a reason we could do that. </p><p>It's because we made a big decision to protect the NHS from spending cuts. </p><p>No other party made that commitment. </p><p>Not Labour. Not the Liberal Democrats. Just us - the Conservatives.</p><p>To all those people who said we'd bring the NHS down...</p><p>...I say...</p><p>...well, yes, you've got a point.</p><p>I'll tell you what is down.</p><p>Waiting lists - down. Mixed wards - down. The number of managers - down. Bureaucratic targets - down. Hospital infections - down.</p><p>And what's up? The number of doctors, the number of dentists, the number of midwives, the number of operations carried out in our NHS.</p><p>So be in no doubt: this is the party of the NHS and that's the way it's going to stay. </p><p>We made a big decision to go on saving lives abroad too. </p><p>I know some are sceptical about our aid budget. </p><p>But picture the scene - you're in a health centre in Kinshasa. </p><p>See the child with a needle in her arm, being injected with a Yellow Fever vaccine...</p><p>...the difference between living and dying... </p><p>...how can anyone tell me that's a waste of money. </p><p>Since we gathered here in Birmingham on Sunday, British aid money has vaccinated 130 thousand children around the world. One hundred and thirty thousand children.</p><p>You, the Conservative party helped do that, and you should be proud of what you've done.  </p><p>Here's something else this party's done in government. </p><p>Last December I was at a European Council in Brussels. </p><p>It was three in the morning, there was a treaty on the table that was not in Britain's interests...</p><p>...and twenty five people around that table were telling me to sign it.</p><p>But I did something that no other British leader has ever done before...</p><p>...I said no - Britain comes first - and I vetoed that EU treaty.</p><p>We're doing big, Conservative things. </p><p>For years people said you'll never reform public sector pensions, the trade unions won't stand for it.</p><p>Well, we've done it, and it's going to cut the cost to the taxpayer almost in half. </p><p>For years people said benefits are out of control and there's nothing you can do about it.</p><p>Well, because of our welfare cap, no family will be getting more in benefits than the average family earns. </p><p>For years people asked why we couldn't get rid of those radical preachers who spout hatred about Britain while living off the taxpayer...</p><p>...well, Theresa May - a great Home Secretary - has done it - and she's got Abu Hamza on that plane and out of our country to face justice. </p><p>Be proud of what we've done already.</p><p>Two million of the lowest-paid workers being taken out of income tax altogether.</p><p>Over eighteen million households helped with a freeze in their council tax - and we're freezing it all over again next year too.</p><p>BRITAIN ON THE RISE</p><p>Big, Conservative things - delivered by this government; made possible by this party.</p><p>We can deliver. We can do big things. </p><p>The Olympics reminded us how great it feels to be successful.</p><p>But we mustn't let that warm glow give us a false sense of security.</p><p>All around the world, countries are on the rise.</p><p>Yes, we've been hearing about China and India for years...</p><p>...but it's hard to believe what's happening in Brazil, in Indonesia, in Nigeria too.</p><p>Meanwhile, the old powers are on the slide.</p><p>What do the countries on the rise have in common?</p><p>They are lean, fit, obsessed with enterprise, spending money on the future - on education, incredible infrastructure and technology.</p><p>And what do the countries on the slide have in common?</p><p>They're fat, sclerotic, over-regulated, spending money on unaffordable welfare systems, huge pension bills, unreformed public services.</p><p>I sit in those European Council meetings where we talk endlessly about Greece...</p><p>...while on the other side of the world, China is moving so fast it's creating a new economy the size of Greece every three months.  </p><p>I am not going to stand here as Prime Minister and allow this country to join the slide.</p><p>My job - our job - is to make sure that in this twenty first century, as in the centuries that came before, our country, Britain, is on the rise.</p><p>And we here know how that is done.</p><p>It is the collective result of individual effort and aspiration...</p><p>... the ideas you have, the businesses you start, the hours you put in.</p><p>Aspiration is the engine of progress.</p><p>Countries rise when they allow their people to rise.</p><p>In this world where brains matter more, where technologies shape our lives, where no-one is owed a living...</p><p>...the most powerful natural resource we have is our people. </p><p>Not just the scientists, the entrepreneurs, the engineers...</p><p>...not just the teachers, the parents, the nurses...</p><p>...but all our people: including the poorest, those who've never had a job, never had a chance, never had hope. </p><p>That's why the mission for this government is to build an aspiration nation...</p><p>...to unleash and unlock the promise in all our people. </p><p>And for us Conservatives, this is not just an economic mission - it's also a moral one.</p><p>It's not just about growth and GDP...</p><p>...it's what's always made our hearts beat faster - aspiration; people rising from the bottom to the top.</p><p>Line one, rule one of being a Conservative is that it's not where you've come from that counts, it's where you're going. </p><p>We've been led by the daughter of a grocer, the son of a music hall performer...</p><p>...by a Jew when Jews were marginalised, by a woman when women were sidelined. </p><p>We don't look at the label on the tin; we look at what's in it. </p><p>Let me put that another way.</p><p>We don't preach about one nation but practise class war...</p><p>...we just get behind people who want to get on in life. </p><p>The doers. The risk takers. The young people who dream of their first pay-cheque, their first car, their first home - and are ready and willing to work hard to get those things.</p><p>While the intellectuals of other parties sneer at people who want to get on in life, we here salute you.</p><p>They call us the party of the better-off...</p><p>...no: we are the party of the want to be better-off, those who strive to make a better life for themselves and their families - and we should never, ever be ashamed of saying so.</p><p>THE RIGHT IDEAS</p><p>This party has a heart but we don't like wearing it on our sleeve.</p><p>Conservatives think: let's just get on with the job and help people and not bang on about it. It's not our style. </p><p>But there's a problem with that. </p><p>It leaves a space for others to twist our ideas and distort who we are: the cartoon Conservatives who don't care. </p><p>My mission from the day I became leader was to change that.</p><p>Yes, to show the Conservative party is for everyone: North or South, black or white, straight or gay.</p><p>But above all - to show that Conservative methods are not just the way we grow a strong economy, but the way we build a big society.</p><p>That Conservative methods are not just good for the strong and the successful but the best way to help the poor, and the weak, and the vulnerable.</p><p>Because it's not enough to know our ideas are right - we've got to explain why they are compassionate too.</p><p>Because we know what we're up against. </p><p>We say we've got to get the private sector bigger and the public sector smaller...our opponents call it Tory cuts, slashing the state'.</p><p>No: it's the best way to create the sustainable jobs people need.</p><p>We say help people become independent from welfare...our opponents call it: cruel Tories, leaving people to fend for themselves.'</p><p>No: there is only one real route out of poverty and it is work.</p><p>We say we've got to insist on a disciplined, rigorous education for our children...our opponents call it: elitist Tories, old-fashioned and out of touch.' </p><p>No: a decent education is the only way to give all our children a proper start in this world.</p><p>The reason we want to reform schools, to cut welfare dependency, to reduce government spending is not because we're the same old Tories who want to help the rich...</p><p>...it's because we're the Tories whose ideas help everyone - the poorest the most.</p><p>A strong private sector. Welfare that works. Schools that teach. </p><p>These three things are essential to helping our people rise.</p><p>They are essential to our success in this world. </p><p>And you know what - Labour will fight them all the way. </p><p>So these things are not just the battle-ground for Britain's future...</p><p>...they are also the battle-lines for the next election - and it is a fight we've got to win, for our party and our country.</p><p>ECONOMY</p><p>To help our people rise, then - number one - we need an economy that creates good jobs.</p><p>We need businesses, of every size, in every type of industry, in every part of the country - investing and taking people on.</p><p>There are some basic things they need to do that.</p><p>Low interest rates so they can afford to take out a loan.</p><p>And confidence that it's worth investing - because the customers will be there, whether at home or abroad.</p><p>Getting the deficit down is essential for both.</p><p>That's why our deficit reduction plan is not an alternative to a growth plan: it's the very foundation of our growth plan.</p><p>It's the only way we'll get Britain on the rise. </p><p>Now I know you are asking whether the plan is working.</p><p>And here's the truth: the damage was worse than we thought, and it's taking longer than we hoped.</p><p>The world economy - especially in the Eurozone - has been much weaker than expected in the past two years.</p><p>When some of our big trading partners like Ireland, Spain and Italy are suffering, they buy less from us. </p><p>That hurts our growth and makes it harder to pay off our debts. </p><p>But here is the crucial thing you need to know. </p><p>Yes it's worse than we thought, yes it's taking longer, but we are making progress.</p><p>Thanks to the grit and resolve of George Osborne, we have cut a quarter off the deficit in the past two years. </p><p>25 per cent.  </p><p>That's helped to keep interest rates at record low levels...</p><p>...keeping mortgages low.  Leaving more money in your pockets.  Giving businesses more confidence to invest.</p><p>Creating more jobs.</p><p>And if you don't believe me, just look at the job creation figures.</p><p>Since this government took office, over one million new jobs have been created in the private sector.</p><p>That is more - net - in the last two years than Labour managed in ten years. </p><p>LABOUR </p><p>Now, the Labour politicians who got us into the mess say they have a different way out of it.</p><p>They call it Plan B and it goes like this: </p><p>We should stop worrying about deficit reduction, borrow more money and spend it to boost the economy. </p><p>It sounds so reasonable when you put it like that. </p><p>Let me tell you why it's not.</p><p>Right now, while we've got a deficit, the people we're borrowing money from believe that we'll pay it back - because we've set out a tough plan to cut spending and live within our means.</p><p>That's why our interest rates are among the lowest in the world, even though the deficit left to us by Labour was one of the highest in the world.</p><p>If we did what Labour want, and watered down our plans, the risk is that the people we borrow money from would start to question our ability and resolve to pay off our debts. </p><p>Some may actually refuse to lend us that money. </p><p>Others would only lend it to us at higher interest rates. </p><p>That would hurt the economy and hit people hard.</p><p>If you have a mortgage of \u00a3100,000, just a 1 per cent interest rate rise would mean an extra thousand pounds to pay each year.</p><p>Labour's plan to borrow more is actually a massive gamble with our economy and our future.</p><p>And it would squander the sacrifices we've already made.</p><p>We're here because they spent too much and borrowed too much.</p><p>How can the answer be more spending and more borrowing?</p><p>I honestly think Labour haven't learned a single thing.</p><p>When they were in office, their answer was always:</p><p>Borrow more money.</p><p>Now they're out of office it's:</p><p>Borrow more money.</p><p>Whatever the day, whatever the question, whatever the weather it's: borrow more money.</p><p>Borrow, borrow, borrow. </p><p>Labour: the party of one notion: more borrowing.</p><p>I sometimes wonder if they know anything about the real economy at all.</p><p>Did you hear what Ed Miliband said last week about taxes?</p><p>He described a tax cut as the government writing people a cheque.</p><p>Ed... Let me explain to you how it works.</p><p>When people earn money, it's their money.   </p><p>Not the government's money: their money.</p><p>Then, the government takes some of it away in tax.</p><p>So, if we cut taxes, we're not giving them money - we're taking less of it away.  OK?</p><p>And while we're on that - who suffers when the wealthy businessman goes off to live in Geneva? </p><p>Not him - he's paying about half the tax he would do here...</p><p>...it's those who want to work who suffer because the jobs aren't being created here.</p><p>We promised that those with the broadest shoulders would bear the biggest burden...</p><p>...and with us, the rich will pay a greater share of tax in every year of this Parliament than in any one of the thirteen years under Labour.</p><p>Under Labour.</p><p>We haven't forgotten, you know. </p><p>We remember who spent our golden legacy, who sold our gold...</p><p>...who busted our banks, who smothered our businesses...</p><p>... who wracked up our debts, who wrecked our economy...</p><p>...who ruined our reputation, who risked our future...</p><p>...who did this? - Labour did this - and this country should never forget it. </p><p>ASPIRATION ECONOMY</p><p>To get Britain on the rise we need a whole new economy...</p><p>...more enterprising, more aspirational...</p><p>...and it's taking shape already.</p><p>We're getting our entrepreneurial streak back: last year the rate of new business creation was faster than any other year in our history. </p><p>Let me repeat that. </p><p>The rate at which new businesses started - faster than any year on record. </p><p>We're making things again.</p><p>We had a trade surplus in cars last year for the first time in almost 40 years.</p><p>And it's not just the old industries growing, it's the new. </p><p>We're number one in the world for offshore wind.</p><p>Number one in the world for tidal power.</p><p>The world's first green investment bank. </p><p>Britain leading; Britain on the rise.  We're showing we can do it.</p><p>Look at the new investment coming in. </p><p>In the last two years, Google, Intel, Cisco - the big tech firms - they've all set up new bases here. </p><p>And we are selling to the world again. </p><p>When I became Prime Minister I said to the Foreign Office: those embassies you've got...</p><p>...turn them into showrooms for our cars, department stores for our fashion, technology hubs for British start-ups.</p><p>Yes, you're diplomats but you need to be our country's salesforce too.</p><p>And look what's happening.</p><p>In just two years, our exports to Brazil are up 25 per cent...</p><p>...to China - 40 per cent...</p><p>...to Russia - 80 per cent. </p><p>There are so many opportunities in this world. </p><p>I want to tell you about one business that's seizing them. </p><p>It's run by a guy called Alastair Lukies. </p><p>He and his business partner saw a world with almost 6 billion mobile phones and just 2 billion bank accounts. </p><p>They saw the huge gap in the market- and they started a mobile banking firm...</p><p>...helping people in the poorest parts of the world manage their money and start new companies.</p><p>He's been with me on trade missions all over the world - and his business is booming. </p><p>Back in 2010, when we came to office, they employed about 100 people - now it's more than 700. </p><p>Then they were nowhere in Africa, nowhere in Asia, now they are the global player, with one million new users every month. </p><p>So don't let anyone tell you Britain can't make it in this world - we're the most enterprising, buccaneering, creative, dynamic nation on earth. </p><p>And to those who question whether it's right to load up a plane with businesspeople - whether we're flying to Africa, Indonesia, to the Gulf or China...</p><p>...whether we're taking people from energy, finance, technology or yes - defence ...</p><p>...I say - there is a global battle out there to win jobs, orders, contracts...</p><p>...and in that battle I believe in leading from the front. </p><p>To get our economy on the rise there's a lot more to do - and frankly a lot more fights to be had. </p><p>Because there are too many of what I'd call the \"yes-but-no\" people. </p><p>The ones who say \"yes, our businesses need to expand...</p><p>...but no we can't reform planning.\"</p><p>It's simple.</p><p>For a business to expand, it needs places to build.</p><p>If it takes too long, they'll just build elsewhere.</p><p>I visited a business the other day that wanted to open a big factory just outside Liverpool. </p><p>But the council was going to take so long to approve the decision that they're now building that factory on the continent - and taking hundreds of jobs with them. </p><p>If we're going to be a winner in this global race we've got to beat off this suffocating bureaucracy once and for all. </p><p>And then there are those who say \"yes of course we need more housing\"...</p><p>...but \"no\" to every development - and not in my backyard.</p><p>Look - it's OK for my generation. Many of us have got on the ladder.</p><p>But you know the average age that someone buys their first home today, without any help for their parents? </p><p>33 years old. </p><p>We are the party of home ownership - we cannot let this carry on.</p><p>So yes - we're doubling the discount for buying your council house...</p><p>...we're helping first-time buyers get a 95 per cent mortgage...</p><p>...but there's something else we need to do - and that's accept we need to build more houses in Britain.</p><p>There are young people who work hard year after year but are still living at home.</p><p>They sit in their childhood bedroom, looking out of the window dreaming of a place of their own.</p><p>I want us to say to them - you are our people, we are on your side, we will help you reach your dreams. </p><p>WELFARE</p><p>If we want our people to rise so Britain can rise, we must tackle welfare.</p><p>Here's two facts for you. </p><p>Fact one.  We spend \u00a390 billion a year on welfare for working-age people.</p><p>Not pensions. Just welfare for working age people - and that's one pound in every eight the government spends. </p><p>Fact two.  More of our children live in households where nobody works than almost any other nation in Europe.</p><p>Let me put it simply.  Welfare isn't working. And this is a tragedy. </p><p>Our reforms are just as profound as those of Beveridge 60 years ago.</p><p>He had his great evils to slay. Squalor. Ignorance. Want. Idleness.  And Disease.</p><p>Here are mine.</p><p>First, unfairness.  </p><p>What are hard-working people who travel long distances to get into work and pay their taxes meant to think when they see families - individual families - getting 40, 50, 60 thousand pounds of housing benefit to live in homes that these hard working people could never afford themselves?</p><p>It is an outrage. And we are ending it by capping housing benefit. </p><p>The second evil: injustice.</p><p>Here's the choice we give our young people today. </p><p>Choice one: Work hard. Go to college. Get a job. Live at home. Save up for a flat. And as I've just said, that can feel like forever.</p><p>Or: Don't get a job. Sign on. Don't even need to produce a CV when you do sign on. Get housing benefit. Get a flat. And then don't ever get a job or you'll lose a load of housing benefit.</p><p>We must be crazy.</p><p>So this is what we've done.</p><p>Now you have to have to sign a contract that says: you do your bit and we'll do ours.</p><p>It requires you to have a real CV and it makes clear: you have to seek work and take work - or you will lose your benefit.</p><p>And we're going to look at ending automatic access to housing benefit for people under 25 too. </p><p>If hard-working young people have to live at home while they work and save, why should it be any different for those who don't?</p><p>The next evil: bureaucracy. </p><p>Sign on. Sign here. Come back in a fortnight. Repeat as required.</p><p>What does this do for the guy who's been out of work for years, playing computer games all day, living out a fantasy because he hates real life? </p><p>For people like him we're doing something new. </p><p>The Work Programme takes the money we're going to save from getting people off the dole...</p><p>...and uses it today to get them into work, with proper training.</p><p>We're spending up to \u00a314,000 on one individual to get them into work - and already almost 700,000 people have got onto the Work Programme.</p><p>So let's be clear: in British politics today it is this party saying no-one is a write-off, no-one is hopeless...</p><p>...and with Iain Duncan Smith leading this revolution let this be the party that shows there is ability and promise in everyone. </p><p>And just one more thing on welfare.</p><p>You know our work experience programme, where we give young people the chance to work in a supermarket, a shop, an office?</p><p>Here's what one union official said about it. </p><p>I quote: \"The scheme belongs back in the nineteenth century, along with Oliver Twist and the workhouse. It is nothing short of state sponsored slavery...\"</p><p>Honestly. What an appalling, snobbish attitude to the idea of work. </p><p>We're not sending children up chimneys, we're giving them a chance. </p><p>What's cruel isn't asking something of people - it's when we ask nothing of them.</p><p>Work isn't slavery, it's poverty that is slavery...</p><p>...and again it's us, the modern compassionate Conservative party, who are the real champions of fighting poverty in Britain today.</p><p>EDUCATION </p><p>To help people to rise, to help Britain rise, there's a third - crucial - thing we must do. </p><p>Educate all our children.</p><p>And I mean really educate them, not just pump up the grades each year. </p><p>In maths, in science, in reading, we've fallen behind...</p><p>...not just behind Germany and Canada but Estonia and Australia too. </p><p>This is Britain's real school report and the verdict is clear: must try harder. </p><p>You've heard of pushy parents, sharp-elbowing their way to a better education for </p><p>their kids? </p><p>Well - this is a pushy government. </p><p>My approach is very simple. </p><p>I've got two children in primary school, and I want for your children what I want for mine. </p><p>To go to schools where discipline is strict, expectations are high and no excuses are accepted for failure.</p><p>I don't want great schools to just be the preserve of those that can pay the fees, or buy the nice house in the right catchment area...</p><p>...I want those schools to be open to every child - in every neighbourhood.</p><p>And the reason I know that every child can go to a school like that is because with this Government, more and more new ones are opening.</p><p>We've heard from some of them this week...</p><p>...not just the 79 new free schools - with over a hundred more to come...</p><p>...but from some of the more than 2000 academies we've helped create - state schools given all the freedoms, and carrying all the high expectations, of private schools.</p><p>Yes - that's my plan - millions of children sent to independent schools...</p><p>...independent schools, in the state sector.</p><p>That's the genuine revolution that's now underway.</p><p>The Harris Academy in Peckham has increased the number of students getting five good GCSEs - from 12 percent when it was under local authority control to almost 90 percent now. </p><p>The transformation has been astonishing - and the methods have been Conservative.</p><p>Smart uniforms, teachers in suits.</p><p>Children taught physics, chemistry and biology not soft options.</p><p>Children set by ability - with excellence applauded, extra resources for those most in need but no excuses for slacking.</p><p>When you see a school like that succeed it prompts the question:</p><p>Why can't every school be that way? Why can't every child have those chances?</p><p>It's not because parents aren't ambitious enough - most of these schools are massively over-subscribed. </p><p>It's because the old educational establishment - the left-wing local authorities, the leaders of the teachers unions, the Labour party theorists - stood in the way.</p><p>When we saw a badly failing school in Haringey and wanted to turn it into an Academy, the Labour authority, the Labour MP and the teaching unions said no. </p><p>When inspirational teachers and parents - in Hammersmith, in Norwich, in Bristol and in Wigan - wanted to open free schools, the left-wing establishment said no.</p><p>When we proposed: More pay for good teachers... Getting rid of bad teachers...</p><p>...Longer school days to help children learn... Flexible school hours to help parents work...</p><p>...More stretching exams for those who're really able... Less nonsense about health and safety...</p><p>...the left-wing establishment have said just one thing: No.</p><p>When you ask them: why is a school failing? Why aren't the children succeeding? </p><p>You hear the same thing over and over again.</p><p>What can you expect with children like these?' they say.  These children are disadvantaged.'</p><p>Of course we want to tackle every disadvantage. </p><p>But isn't the greatest disadvantage of all being written off by those so in hock to a culture of low expectations that they have forgotten what it's like to be ambitious, to want to transcend your background, to overcome circumstance and succeed on your own terms?</p><p>It's that toxic culture of low expectations - that lack of ambition for every child - which has held this country back.</p><p>Well, Michael Gove and I are not waiting for an outbreak of sanity in the headquarters of the NUT or an embrace of aspiration in the higher reaches of Labour before we act.</p><p>Because our children can't wait.</p><p>So when people say we should slow down our education reforms - so adults can adjust to them, I say:</p><p>I want more free schools, more Academies, more rigorous exams in every school, more expected of every child.</p><p>And to all those people who say: he wants children to have the kind of education he had at his posh school... </p><p>...I say: yes - you're absolutely right. </p><p>I went to a great school and I want every child to have a great education.</p><p>I'm not here to defend privilege, I'm here to spread it.</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>I don't have a hard luck story.</p><p>My dad was a stockbroker from Berkshire.</p><p>It's only when your dad's gone that you realise - not just how much you really miss them - but how much you really owe them.  </p><p>My dad influenced me much more than I ever thought.</p><p>He was born with no heels on his feet and legs about a foot shorter than they're meant to be.  But he never complained - even when he lost both those legs later in life.</p><p>Because disability in the 1930s was such a stigma, he was an only child.  Probably a lonely child.   </p><p>But Dad was the eternal optimist.  To him the glass was always half full.  Usually with something alcoholic in it.</p><p>When I was a boy I remember once going on a long walk with him in the village where we lived, passing the church he supported and the village hall where he took part in interminable parish council meetings.  </p><p>He told me what he was most proud of.  </p><p>It was simple - working hard from the moment he left school and providing a good start in life for his family.  </p><p>Not just all of us, but helping his mum too, when his father ran off.</p><p>Not a hard luck story, but a hard work story.  </p><p>Work hard.  Family comes first.  But put back in to the community too.</p><p>There is nothing complicated about me.</p><p>I believe in working hard, caring for my family and serving my country.</p><p>And there is nothing complicated about what we need today.</p><p>This is still the greatest country on earth.  We showed that again this summer.  22nd in world population.  3rd in the medals table.  </p><p>But it's tough.  These are difficult times.  We're being tested.  </p><p>How will we come through it?  Again, it's not complicated.</p><p>Hard work.  Strong families.  Taking responsibility.  Serving others.</p><p>As I said on the steps of No10 Downing Street before walking through that door:  Those who can should, those who can't we will always help.</p><p>The job of this party ... of this government ... is to help to bring out the best in this country.  Because at our best we're unbeatable.</p><p>We know Britain can deliver because we've seen it time and again. </p><p>This is the country that ... invented the computer, defeated the Nazis, started the web, saw off the slave trade, unravelled DNA and fought off every invader for a thousand years.</p><p>We even persuaded the Queen to jump out of a helicopter to make the rest of the world smile .... there is absolutely nothing we cannot do.</p><p>Can we make Britain the best place in the world to start a business, grow a business and help that business take on the world and win?  Yes.</p><p>Can we - the people who invented the welfare state in the first place - turn it into something that rewards effort, helps keep families together and really helps the poorest with a new start in life.  Yes.  </p><p>Can we take our schools and turn out students that will take on the brightest in the world?  Yes. Of course we can.</p><p>Let us here in this hall, here in this government, together in this country make this pledge - let's build an aspiration nation...</p><p>...let's get Britain on the rise.</p><p>Deficit, paid down.

an achievement that should rank alongside putting wine in a cask - he can transform nouns into verbs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This makes Hastings the latest Silicon Valley philosopher king to commit such felonies, usually in a vain attempt to mark their organisation as exceptional.</p><p>The word Hastings has chosen to abuse most frequently is \"sunshining\", which in Netflix-speak means being honest about an idea or proposal from a colleague.</p><p>It even has a past tense (sunshined), another word hated by spellcheck, which equates to explaining a decision the company has previously taken.</p><p>It's groundbreaking stuff, which basically means \"be honest\".</p><p>But using an actual English word is not Silicon Valley's style, which counts stating the blindingly obvious via mangled syntax as \"disruption\".</p><p>I wouldn't mind this corporate sleight of hand from Hastings if it were not designed to fool us Wage Slaves.</p><p>The larger deception behind Hastings' language crime is to promote Netflix as a preferred employer to attract and retain the best staff - I'm not going to use the words talent or team.</p><p>To this end, Hastings put out his corporate philosophy in early September in the form of a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/culture/tv-and-radio/from-b-student-to-billionaire-the-man-who-built-netflix-20200820-p55nml.html\">343-page book</url> of such piercing insights the Nobel committee will surely feel compelled to offer a new prize in management theory.</p><p>Its title, No Rules Rules, sounds more like a comeback album from Vanilla Ice, and from the reviews I've read has about as much depth - I couldn't bring myself to actually read the thing.</p><p>I'm in the minority, as the book has been universally praised and even been long-listed for the Financial Times' Business Book of the Year.</p><p>In marvelling at the rise of Netflix, which has a not insignificant 193 million subscribers, two examples are nearly always offered to showcase its exceptionalism.</p><p>The first is that Netflix has no rules around expenses.</p><p>\"Act in Netflix's best interests,\" is the five-word articulation of that policy.</p><p>The second is that employees can have as many holidays as they need. \"Take some!\" is how this is defined in the HR manual.</p><p>As someone who has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/management/spare-us-the-pain-of-lodging-expenses-20190220-h1bhvf\">battled with lodging expenses, </url>and views adequate holidays in terms of months not days, the Netflix model sounds wonderful.</p><p>And as a marketing tool it's had the right effect, with the streaming giant rated as the second most desirable public company to work for behind Google in a <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>2019 survey by recruiting firm Hired</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>.</p><p>It scored 82 on the Brand Positivity Index- another triumph of corporate speak -  five points higher than Apple.</p><p>Given Hastings is such a fan of uncomfortable honesty, might I suggest this \"positivity index\" could use a little \"sunshining\" of its own.</p><p>Soft power</p><p>In reality Netflix is no different to the tax-avoiding, regulation-hating monopolists of old.</p><p>As my colleague <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/big-tech-s-bad-week-has-made-the-world-wake-up-20180323-p4z5uu.html\">Peter Hartcher</url> noted about big tech a few years back: \"The soft power of their image gave them worldwide licence to evade tax, break laws, abuse customers' trust and exploit workers.\"</p><p>He said less likeable firms including Monsanto or Exxon Mobil could never get away with this, but \"big tech merely rebranded it as 'disruption' and it was suddenly cool, fun and freewheeling\".</p><p>When you put it this way it's easy to understand why Hastings cares less about the odd negroni being booked up to the company card when Netflix paid only $342,000 in Australian tax during 2018. That's on estimated revenue generated from local <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/media-and-marketing/revealed-how-much-tax-netflix-pays-20191025-p534aa\">subscribers of between $600 million and $1 billion.</url></p><p>Asked to explain how this was possible, there was more clouding -  that's my contribution to the genre -  than sunshining from its local arm.</p><p>\"We comply with all Australian and international tax law,\" a Netflix spokesman said.</p><p>Big tobacco could not have said it better in 1972.</p><p>When seen in this light -  see what I did there? -  it's easy to understand why Netflix employees taking a few extra days' holiday is no bother; when the company does not have the added cost of complying with local content rules applicable to all other broadcasters in Australia.</p><p>Those quotas are vital for helping us understand ourselves as a nation through programs such as Married at First Sight, which would never have been made if not for local content requirements.</p><p>So next time a tech evangelist with a goatee turns up speaking in tongues, reflect some of that sunshine back towards them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520330402</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6105-CVW1-JBJ7-N31Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"751\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Sometimes the fight for the  future of news does not seem winnable. But in my view, there is one  way forward that will ensure the long-term sustainability of  quality journalism, and that's getting a better deal from the big  tech platforms.  The ability to control our content and protect it  from poaching by the major platforms, like Facebook and Google --  which dominate the online ecosystem -- is what our industry needs.  And the ability to collectively negotiate with the platforms  represents our biggest hope. With help from members of Congress on  both sides of the aisle, The Journalism Competition and  Preservation Act of 2019 (a.k.a., the safe harbor bill), has been  introduced in the House and the Senate. The organization I  represent, News Media Alliance, is one of the bill's chief  advocates. If passed, the bill would allow publishers a four-year  antitrust safe harbor in which to collectively negotiate with the  tech platforms for better business terms around how their news  content is shared and monetized online. </p><p>   The news media industry has long struggled to balance its need for  financial security with its mission to provide the public with  vital information about society and the world. But today we are  faced with a striking irony: news consumption is higher today than  it's ever been, while publisher revenue is steadily declining. This  is, in large part, because of the unbalanced relationship between  news publishers and tech platforms. </p><p>  The major tech platforms try to say the safe harbor bill is about  preserving older business models for news. That's a false narrative  and a misdirection. This bill is about fighting for a digital  future for news content in a world where two companies absolutely  control the online ecosystem. </p><p>Google and Facebook have access to billions of users, allowing them  to set the rules for how publishers engage with their audiences,  and how their content is displayed, prioritized and monetized. Not  only does their market dominance allow them to control the news,  but since they act as middlemen between readers and publishers,  they capture valuable consumer data that they can then use to sell  advertising. </p><p>   This has broadened the distance between the content provider and  the consumer, causing deterioration of the publisher-reader  relationship.

What we  want is the ability to control our own content -- and to be  compensated fairly for that content -- so we can remain a thriving  and vital component of American democracy. </p><p>   Without access to high-quality journalism, everyone suffers,  including the tech platforms.

It helps them make decisions about their  businesses. But unlike the average reader, the decisions they're  making have an outsized impact on our business, as well. </p><p>   News content from quality publishers always has, and always will,  drive consumers to the latest medium, whether they're following the  news of the day on the radio or television, their computers or  their smartphones. But unless publishers are given an opportunity  to get a fair return from their own product and establish real  relationships with their audience, there will be nothing of value  for news consumers to find. </p><p>   Small local publishers are currently defenseless against the tech  platforms. The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act is not  an attack on the platforms but would offer a shield to defend  publishers against those who are unfairly overpowering them. </p><p>   Only by joining forces can our industry hope to build the  relationship we need with the tech platforms in order to continue  providing quality information to the public. If we can't secure a  fair deal with the platforms now, not only is the future of news at  risk, but so is the future of our civic society. </p><p>   Editor's note: This piece originally appeared in the October 2019  issue of Crain's News Pro. </p><p>   Your Turn David Chavern Guest columnist </p><p>   photo Illustration by LUIS SOLANO/USA TODAY NETWORK;

By granting publishers the ability to collectively negotiate with the platforms, Congress would be recognizing the imbalance of power and helping to level the playing field.More favorable terms from tech platforms would allow earned subscription and advertising dollars to ow back to the publishers while protecting and preserving the public's right to access quality news. Parameters included in the bill ensure that these negotiations would strictly benefit news consumers and news publishers at-large, not just one or a few publishers.</p><p>We're not asking for tech platforms to be regulated, and we see the immense value of the online experience for our readers. What we want is the ability to control our own content - and to be compensated fairly for that content - so we can remain a thriving and vital component of American democracy.</p><p>Without access to high-quality journalism, everyone suffers, including the tech platforms. It is because of news media that we know where our politicians stand on the issues that impact us, how extreme weather events will affect our communities and what our local businesses and communities are up to, among many other things.</p><p>Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter's Jack Dorsey and Google's co-founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, rely on the news as much as any of our readers. It helps them make decisions about their businesses. But unlike the average reader, the decisions they're making have an outsized impact on our business, as well.</p><p>News content from quality publishers always has, and always will, drive consumers to the latest medium, whether they're following the news of the day on the radio or television, their computers or their smartphones. But unless publishers are given an opportunity to get a fair return from their own product and establish real relationships with their audience, there will be nothing of value for news consumers to find.</p><p>Small local publishers are currently defenseless against the tech platforms. The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act is not an attack on the platforms but would offer a shield to defend publishers against those who are unfairly overpowering them.</p><p>Only by joining forces can our industry hope to build the relationship we need with the tech platforms in order to continue providing quality information to the public.</p><p>If we can't secure a fair deal with the platforms now, not only is the future of news at risk, but so is the future of our civic society.</p><p>Editor's note: This piece originally appeared in the October 2019 issue Crain's News Pro.</p><p>Your Turn</p><p>David Chavern</p><p>Guest columnist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The Rockaway printing plant for The Record and other Gannett newspapers.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>The Record</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYTME-slb-2081715555</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYTME2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XK0-GNJ1-JC3H-02GC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257785</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"899\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Daily Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Times (Salisbury, Maryland)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 23, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And the ability to collectively negotiate with the platforms represents our biggest hope. With help from members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act of 2019 (a.k.a., the safe harbor bill), has been introduced in the House and the Senate. The organization I represent, News Media Alliance, is one of the bill's chief advocates. If passed, the bill would allow publishers a four-year antitrust safe harbor in which to collectively negotiate with the tech platforms for better business terms around how their news content is shared and monetized online.</p><p>The news media industry has long struggled to balance its need for financial security with its mission to provide the public with vital information about society and the world. But today we are faced with a striking irony: news consumption is higher today than it's ever been, while publisher revenue is steadily declining. This is, in large part, because of the unbalanced relationship between news publishers and tech platforms.</p><p>This bill is about fighting for a digital future for news content in a world where two companies absolutely control the online ecosystem.</p><p>Google and Facebook have access to billions of users, allowing them to set the rules for how publishers engage with their audiences, and how their content is displayed, prioritized and monetized. Not only does their market dominance allow them to control the news, but since they act as middlemen between readers and publishers, they capture valuable consumer data that they can then use to sell advertising.</p><p>This has broadened the distance between the content provider and the consumer, causing deterioration of the publisher-reader relationship. It also rewards low-quality \"click-bait\" over high-quality journalism.</p><p>However, there is power in numbers, and the antitrust safe harbor bill would allow us to use our numbers to improve our situation. By granting publishers the ability to collectively negotiate with the platforms, Congress would be recognizing the imbalance of power and helping to level the playing field.</p><p>We're not asking for tech platforms to be regulated, and we see the immense value of the online experience for our readers.

Not content to be simply a social media platform, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-us-midterms-latest-war-room-election-interference-brazil-a8590461.html\">this year it launched Portal</url>, a huge screen and camera for video chatting. It emerged at the same time as a series of data abuse scandals that served only to highlight the risks of giving big tech such control of your life.</p><p>Portal received a torrent of criticism and confusion. The product's strange look and limited features were eventually entirely obscured by the simple fact that a company so criticised for doing everything it can to track you around the web had created a product that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-us-midterms-latest-war-room-election-interference-brazil-a8590461.html\">tracked you around your house</url>. Was Facebook satirising itself? Regardless of whether the Portal was a good product, the damage was already done.</p><p>Products like Amazon's Alexa have paved the way for voice technology to take centre-stage in 2019 (Getty)</p><p>The flip side is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-us-midterms-latest-war-room-election-interference-brazil-a8590461.html\">Apple's focus on privacy</url>, which has sometimes looked a little perverse: it has refused to collect data users are happy to hand over, and it's difficult not to link that decision with the relative weakness of some of its products, such as Siri. Yet it has spun the move as an ethical one - the company and CEO Tim Cook have argued it's about human rights - which makes sense, given that it's hard to see the technological or economic benefits.</p><p>With time the decision appears to be a smart one. If technology is going to take an even more intimate place in our lives - watching our every move, driving our cars, controlling our house, even constructing our reality - then the promise not to hoover up data at the same time is not just nice, but necessary.</p><p>Apple already has access to some of our most personal information, such as our heart rate, and is rumoured to be working on everything from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-us-midterms-latest-war-room-election-interference-brazil-a8590461.html\">electric vehicles</url> to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-us-midterms-latest-war-room-election-interference-brazil-a8590461.html\">augmented reality</url> glasses. That kind of intimacy requires trust.</p><p>Even companies that have committed to use data conscientiously, like Amazon with its Alexa voice assistant, have been dogged by fears that they are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-us-midterms-latest-war-room-election-interference-brazil-a8590461.html\">sharing information with the FBI</url>, the NSA, or worse. If we are to give our trust to tech companies then they must prove themselves worthy of it: if they are to be let into our personal lives, then they must respect - and protect - our privacy.</p><p>With more money being spent on voice-powered tech than ever before, privacy could not be more important. But smart tech has made the wrong bet before, on technologies such as virtual reality that have failed to take off. If voice assistants are to avoid the same fate, they must focus on convincing us they're not only useful, but trustworthy.</p><p>Read more</p><p>Has the future of smart home tech arrived?</p><p>Will Amazon's deliver-on-demand smart homes be the future of housing? </p><p>How the 'smart home' could allow your house to spy on you</p><p>It might turn out that its killer feature is not so much a feature at all, but a lack of them.

Tech tycoons are asking - nay, pleading - to be regulated. Alphabet's Sundar Pichai said this month that artificial intelligence is \"too important\" not to be governed by new laws. He was joined by Microsoft's Satya Nadella, who said at Davos that Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which the industry fought tooth and nail, was a \"fantastic start\" that he hoped America would soon emulate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg is pining for new rules. He wrote last year: \"Law-makers often tell me we have too much power over speech, and frankly I agree.\" He listed areas where he would invite \"sensible\" regulation, ranging from privacy to ensuring the integrity of elections and blocking harmful content. The 35-year-old billionaire will be in Munich this month to discuss \"a framework for new rules and regulation for the internet\" with European politicians.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The public pleas for a crackdown are, however, at odds with a very different dynamic unfolding behind the scenes. Big Tech has launched a fierce, wellfunded campaign to stamp out a crackdown entirely or, at worst, craft rules that could in fact tighten its stranglehold.</p><p>To understand the forces at play, look no further than lobbying dollars. Amazon is run by the world's richest person, Jeff Bezos, who has pointedly not joined the pro-regulation chorus. Last year he grabbed the throne as America's top corporate lobbyist, lavishing $16.8m ((EURO)15m) on a team of more than 100 in Washington, according to federal data compiled by the Centre for Responsive Politics.</p><p>Second was Facebook, which spent $16.7m on 71 lobbyists. The top spender from 2018, Google parent Alphabet, dropped to ninth, spending $12.7m. The centre's Sarah Bryner said that only five years ago \"these companies were essentially nothing in the lobbying universe\". Perhaps it is not surprising they are ramping up their influence operations. The justice department and Federal Trade Commission have opened competition investigations into the \"big four\" - Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet/ Google. The House judiciary committee has launched its own investigation. Presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders make breaking up Big Tech central to their campaigns.</p><p>For the industry, getting ahead of the coming wave is sensible. However, it is doing much more than simply trying to educate politicians. It is trying to stop them doing anything.</p><p>Carl Szabo is general counsel of NetChoice, one of tech's most aggressive lobbyists, whose members include Google, Facebook, Twitter and Yahoo. He spends most of his time beating back two arguments: that tech companies are too big and should be broken up, and that section 230 - the \"liability shield\" that has fuelled their rise - needs to be scrapped.</p><p>Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act was passed in 1996, when fewer than 10% of Americans or Britons had internet access. It handed immunity to websites over content posted by users. It is the cornerstone of the empires built by Facebook, Google, Twitter and the rest. It allows them to sell ads worth hundreds of billions of dollars against the posts made by their users, and to do so without any concern that they could be held liable for what those posts might promote, be it political misinformation, self-harm or terrorist propaganda.</p><p>Hany Farid, digital forensics professor at University of California, Berkeley, called it a \"gift from the gods. It is unprecedented liability protection.\" Presidential candidate Joe Biden said last month that section 230 should be \"revoked\" - the idea being that if social media platforms could be sued for what appeared on their websites, they would do more to clean them up.</p><p>Szabo, however, said that logic was faulty. Section 230, he said, simply codifies another concept, known as \"conduit immunity\", which has been established through nearly 70 years of case law. If section 230 goes away, Big Tech will argue that their immunity should remain through another mechanism.</p><p>\"At the end of the day, section 230 produces the most good with the least harm,\" said Szabo, because it empowers companies to police their content - Facebook, for example has 30,000 post moderators - without fear of legal reprisals. This is shaping up to be a key battleground. Szabo said the industry would \"stand in unison\" against efforts to touch section 230. Farid, who testified in Congress on Big Tech's failings last year, said: \"Industry lobbyists can say what they want, but there is bipartisan support for reforming 230. Everybody acknowledges that this is absurd.\"</p><p>According to industry sources, American politicians are considering borrowing from Britain, where a law set to go into effect this year would impose a \"duty of care\" on platforms, even allowing for civil suits if companies failed to protect users from a list of harms ranging from pornography to cyber-bullying.</p><p>The other area of focus for Szabo is the call to break up Big Tech. The giants' power was on full display last week. Facebook hit record profits and revealed that an astounding 2.9 billion people used its apps every month. Amazon reported its best three months ever. So did Apple. Amazon's zooming stock price added $13bn to Bezos's fortune in a day.</p><p>For Szabo, the eye-catching figures are distractions from the reality: none of these companies fits the legal definition of a monopoly, which in America means a company that uses its power to harm consumers. Facebook, for example, has a quarter of the global advertising market. Google has about a third. Amazon accounts for roughly half of e-commerce transactions but is lapped by Walmart in overall sales. Apple is a niche seller of luxury tech products, with one-fifth of global smartphone sales. Most of the rest is dominated by Google's Android.</p><p>\"From an analytical perspective, when you look at whether there is a case to be made for antitrust, it fails every single time, aside from the declaration of, 'They're too big',\" said Szabo. \"When you actually look at the facts, there's no 'there' there, and I think the government will come to the same conclusion pretty soon.\"</p><p>Benedict Evans, an independent tech analyst, said: \"We've shifted to a world where many people in Silicon Valley are starting to understand that it's not just a search engine, or a messaging platform, but that these tools are systemically important parts of western society.\"</p><p>In the backrooms of Washington, Brussels and Westminster, these are the issues being hammered out.

The putative tech masters of the universe now face unprecedented criticism from both\u00a0left[1]\u00a0and\u00a0right[2]. The reasons extend from wanton privacy invasions of the people once described by Facebook's\u00a0Mark Zuckerberg[3]\u00a0as 'dumb f***ks' to\u00a0President Trump's[4]\u00a0typically hyperbolic assaults on Amazon's success at\u00a0tax avoidance[5]. The\u00a0public[6]\u00a0so far still does not disdain the tech oligarchs as they do Wall Street or energy firm but they are clearly threatened, both politically and in their wallets. Their once seemingly unstoppable hold of the capital markets also has started to slip somewhat as investors begin to worry about a potential decline in social media as well as technical failures undermining the value of companies like\u00a0Uber[7],\u00a0Tesla[8]\u00a0and\u00a0Snapchat[9]. Not that the oligarchs will change their ways without coercion. Mark Zuckerberg, amid the uproar, still seems determined to block privacy protections in\u00a0California[10]\u00a0or\u00a0elsewhere[11]. Facebook's arrogance has even incited tension between the tech overlords, with Apple's\u00a0Tim Cook[12]\u00a0assaulting Mark Zuckerberg for privacy violations. </p><p>The fact that Cook did this in Beijing, world capital of advanced surveillance, makes the public spanking ever more bizarre. If you don't like the media, buy it Yet even if their net worth drops a bit, the tech oligarchs have more than enough money to subtly change the conversation. One primary way is to buy the financially stressed media, particularly the print side. Tech money in recent years has bought such venerable institutions as the New Republic and, most importantly, the Washington Post, putting the world's richest man in charge of one of the nation's most influential newspapers. More recently Laurene Powell, the\u00a0left-leaning[13]\u00a0widow of the late Steve Jobs (net worth $20 billion[14]), has scooped up the Atlantic for a nonprofit that will compete with more traditional competitors who still, sadly, have to make money. Perhaps most important has been the move by Google, which is also promoting\u00a0journalism by robots[15], to\u00a0invest $300 million[16]\u00a0into subsidizing favored reporters. Given the\u00a0generally poor condition[17]\u00a0of the business, this will be as alluring to many scribblers as a fat beef shank would be to a hungry dog. Progressives might cheer, but if they are concerned about privacy, consider what the company's former executive Chairman\u00a0Eric Schmidt[18]\u00a0once told CNBC:'If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.' What will be the tech-controlled media agenda? The oligarch's leveraged buyout of journalism could shape news in the decades to come. When the equally rapacious moguls of the early 20th century, like the\u00a0McCormicks[19]\u00a0of Chicago or William Randolph Hearst, bought papers, they pushed an agenda of imperial expansion, anti-unionism and resistance to those assaulting their fortunes. Our current crop of moguls also has an ideology   the politics of\u00a0gentry liberalism[20]. This includes promotion of dense urbanism (although not usually for themselves), open borders and a heaping portion of identity politics. But they, like their forebears, want to keep their money, embracing a quasi-libertarian refusal to address the dangers posed by the concentration of wealth and power, notably their own. To provide a patina of fairness, the oligarchs may try to find allies among\u00a0libertarian conservatives[21]\u00a0who can be counted on to never oppose any malefactor, but conservative views on sensitive social issues, as\u00a0Kevin D. Williamson just found[22], can't go too far off the reservation. Less room will be provided to anything associated with grassroots-based populism, whether the Trumpian version or that of Bernie Sanders. Jeff Bezos might\u00a0detest Trump[23], but recall that in 2016, he\u00a0turned his guns on Bernie[24], whose policies might threaten his enormous wealth and corporate power. The Republic in peril? Once, the internet seemed to invite expanded access for an ever widening scope for content creators. Now, digitization appears to be\u00a0hyper-concentrating media[25]\u00a0both geographically, on the coasts, and through pipelines\u00a0controlled overwhelmingly[26]\u00a0by a firms like\u00a0Facebook[27]\u00a0and Google. As\u00a0the Guardian[28]\u00a0recently put it: 'If ExxonMobil attempted to insert itself into every element of our lives like this, there might be a concerted grassroots movement to curb its influence.' Ironically, the brouhaha over Russian efforts to influence the election may provide the oligarchs with the license to 'curate,' or more accurately censor, views they don't like. For the most part\u00a0this censorship[29]\u00a0is being carried out under guidance developed\u00a0largely by progressive groups[30]\u00a0like the\u00a0Southern Poverty Law Center[31], which often labels anyone outside its ideological 'safe space' as racist bigots. What is considered hateful speech by the politically correct does not have to reflect neo-Nazi or Putin-inspired opinion; meanwhile there have been very few restraints on equally noxious voices on the left. Ultimately the tech moguls are following the approach described by the late radical social thinker C. Wright Mills: 'power elites' remain so by constraining debate in ways that do not threaten their core interests. The oligarchs' unprecedented wealth, married to new technologies, could help shape the nation's thinking in ways that represent a direct assault on pluralism and independent journalism. This needs to be recognized and opposed across the ideological spectrum by people committed to both pluralism and independent thought.

The putative tech masters of the universe now face unprecedented criticism from bothleft[1]andright[2]. The reasons extend from wanton privacy invasions of the people once described by Facebook'sMark Zuckerberg[3]as 'dumb f***ks' toPresident Trump's[4]typically hyperbolic assaults on Amazon's success attax avoidance[5]. Thepublic[6]so far still does not disdain the tech oligarchs as they do Wall Street or energy firm but they are clearly threatened, both politically and in their wallets. Their once seemingly unstoppable hold of the capital markets also has started to slip somewhat as investors begin to worry about a potential decline in social media as well as technical failures undermining the value of companies likeUber[7],Tesla[8]andSnapchat[9]. Not that the oligarchs will change their ways without coercion. Mark Zuckerberg, amid the uproar, still seems determined to block privacy protections inCalifornia[10]orelsewhere[11]. Facebook's arrogance has even incited tension between the tech overlords, with Apple'sTim Cook[12]assaulting Mark Zuckerberg for privacy violations. </p><p>The fact that Cook did this in Beijing, world capital of advanced surveillance, makes the public spanking ever more bizarre. If you don't like the media, buy it Yet even if their net worth drops a bit, the tech oligarchs have more than enough money to subtly change the conversation. One primary way is to buy the financially stressed media, particularly the print side. Tech money in recent years has bought such venerable institutions as the New Republic and, most importantly, the Washington Post, putting the world's richest man in charge of one of the nation's most influential newspapers. More recently Laurene Powell, theleft-leaning[13]widow of the late Steve Jobs (net worth $20 billion[14]), has scooped up the Atlantic for a nonprofit that will compete with more traditional competitors who still, sadly, have to make money. Perhaps most important has been the move by Google, which is also promotingjournalism by robots[15], toinvest $300 million[16]into subsidizing favored reporters. Given thegenerally poor condition[17]of the business, this will be as alluring to many scribblers as a fat beef shank would be to a hungry dog. Progressives might cheer, but if they are concerned about privacy, consider what the company's former executive ChairmanEric Schmidt[18]once told CNBC:'If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.' What will be the tech-controlled media agenda? The oligarch's leveraged buyout of journalism could shape news in the decades to come. When the equally rapacious moguls of the early 20th century, like theMcCormicks[19]of Chicago or William Randolph Hearst, bought papers, they pushed an agenda of imperial expansion, anti-unionism and resistance to those assaulting their fortunes. Our current crop of moguls also has an ideology \u2014 the politics ofgentry liberalism[20]. This includes promotion of dense urbanism (although not usually for themselves), open borders and a heaping portion of identity politics. But they, like their forebears, want to keep their money, embracing a quasi-libertarian refusal to address the dangers posed by the concentration of wealth and power, notably their own. To provide a patina of fairness, the oligarchs may try to find allies amonglibertarian conservatives[21]who can be counted on to never oppose any malefactor, but conservative views on sensitive social issues, asKevin D. Williamson just found[22], can't go too far off the reservation. Less room will be provided to anything associated with grassroots-based populism, whether the Trumpian version or that of Bernie Sanders. Jeff Bezos mightdetest Trump[23], but recall that in 2016, heturned his guns on Bernie[24], whose policies might threaten his enormous wealth and corporate power. The Republic in peril? Once, the internet seemed to invite expanded access for an ever widening scope for content creators. Now, digitization appears to behyper-concentrating media[25]both geographically, on the coasts, and through pipelinescontrolled overwhelmingly[26]by a firms likeFacebook[27]and Google. Asthe Guardian[28]recently put it: 'If ExxonMobil attempted to insert itself into every element of our lives like this, there might be a concerted grassroots movement to curb its influence.' Ironically, the brouhaha over Russian efforts to influence the election may provide the oligarchs with the license to 'curate,' or more accurately censor, views they don't like. For the most partthis censorship[29]is being carried out under guidance developedlargely by progressive groups[30]like theSouthern Poverty Law Center[31], which often labels anyone outside its ideological 'safe space' as racist bigots. What is considered hateful speech by the politically correct does not have to reflect neo-Nazi or Putin-inspired opinion; meanwhile there have been very few restraints on equally noxious voices on the left. Ultimately the tech moguls are following the approach described by the late radical social thinker C. Wright Mills: 'power elites' remain so by constraining debate in ways that do not threaten their core interests. The oligarchs' unprecedented wealth, married to new technologies, could help shape the nation's thinking in ways that represent a direct assault on pluralism and independent journalism. This needs to be recognized and opposed across the ideological spectrum by people committed to both pluralism and independent thought.

After years on the defensive against a worldwide \"techlash\" that threatened to break up their empires, tech giants have suddenly become essential services. Governments need them to control misinformation and track disease; citizens rely on them simply to work and stay sane; their rivals are drowning, while their own cash reserves are gigantic. Surely, then, this is their hour of domination? Not if Margrethe Vestager has anything to do with it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Asked whether she is concerned that American tech firms will exploit the coronavirus crisis to cement their power by snapping up rivals or conquering new markets, the European Union's top monopoly enforcer only retorts: \"Well, not with me!\" Speaking to The Sunday Telegraph from the EU's hulking Berlaymont building in Brussels, now empty save for a tiny core of staff who are not working from home, the former Danish finance minister, who turned 52 this month, vows that her office will remain \"vigilant\". \"We have not changed our perspective when it comes to the obligations of a dominant company,\" Vestager says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"If they do something that is illegal, we'll have to pursue those cases.\" Indeed, the EU is still pressing forward with new regulations - a necessity that she says the crisis only \"enhances\".</p><p>It is a strong signal from a woman who has already levied billions of dollars in fines against Big Tech. As the European Commission's competition minister since 2014, she has launched inquiries into Google, Apple and Amazon that drew the ire of Donald Trump (as well as a typical Trumpian sobriquet: \"the tax lady\").</p><p>In December, under the new Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, she was promoted to oversight of all digital affairs - widely taken as a sign that Brussels' war on Silicon Valley would only heat up.</p><p>Now there is a bigger battle. The fiscally unthinkable has become routine almost overnight, and state aid to private companies - a core target of Vestager's office - is one of the only things keeping the European economy afloat. The Commission has relaxed those rules, pledging to do \"whatever is necessary\", but member states are now squabbling over relief measures along the same north-south divide that bedevilled the last crash.</p><p>It's hectic work. When she speaks to The Telegraph, she has just finished eating a quick dinner microwaved in her office, where she also keeps a small ceramic sculpture of an upthrust middle finger (it reminds her that she can't please everybody). Despite being in the hot seat for the Great Recession, she says this is like nothing she's faced: \"It is unprecedented, historic in every respect.\"</p><p>The risks, too, are \"quite profound\": hostile takeovers by powerful companies sensing opportunity in crisis, smaller companies desperate for a saviour, and hugely increased cybercrime and fraud.</p><p>On some matters, Vestager is oddly keen to stress business as usual. She declines to be drawn on whether the pandemic actually increases the risk of Silicon Valley dominance. Surrounded by tremendous upheaval, she notes continuities in the EU's approach. She grants that US tech firms are always on the hunt, but says that has been true for years.</p><p>Yet one thing she is not cagey about is the threat of takeovers by foreign state-backed companies. With Europe's economy on life support, she warns that there is more danger than ever of such companies using their generous access to government credit to \"import unfair competition\" into the EU and acquire rivals while they are in a vulnerable state.</p><p>\"Since we have been hit by the virus in different stages, it's also probable that we could recover in different stages,\" she says. \"So one could imagine that European businesses would be in a weakened position when other regions have recovered. Here, I think it's important to send the signal that we will be vigilant \u2026 that we would actually stand by companies.\"</p><p>In past interviews, Vestager has singled out China, saying that its companies are now in a \"later phase of the crisis\". Indeed, Britain recently blocked a plan by a Beijing-backed venture capitalist to tighten control over Imagination Technologies, a UK chip designer. But she also cites Germans' fury over a report that Trump had offered $1bn (\u00a30.8bn) to a home-grown pharma company for exclusive rights to its vaccine. Saudi \"intended for both camps\". Even so, how strict can she really afford to be, given the scale of the crisis? The British Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) spent almost a year scrutinising Amazon's investment in Deliveroo, but on April 17 it suddenly gave it a provisional green light. The reason was simple: the potential damage to consumers, of Amazon taking a stake, were now eclipsed by the risk of Deliveroo going bust.</p><p>Vestager does accept that regulators will often end up more lenient in effect. Mergers that might otherwise have been denied could be approved if the alternative is one company collapsing; collaborations between companies that might normally be banned by anti-cartel laws are already being authorised in the name of keeping up supplies. EU rules allow exceptions for \"dramatic, extraordinary events\", she says, and this is one.</p><p>\"But,\" she adds, \"the world is still inhabited by humans. Just as we see businesses go to extraordinary lengths to produce ventilators and protective gear, you will also see that there are some crisis privateers. It's important to be extremely helpful where it makes sense, and at the same time to stay vigilant so that people do not fall victim.\" For what it's worth, she says she trusts tech giants not to be privateers - if only because everyone is watching them.</p><p>Not that tech's new eminence has convinced her that big is beautiful. While Vestager demurs at the idea that internet services should be treated like public utilities, she does argue that greater dominance confers greater duty. She cites EU laws, taking effect this summer, that will force digital marketplaces such as Amazon and Google to explain their search rankings, disclose how they are boosting their own products and give their sellers the right to appeal against decisions.</p><p>\"If you win the market, you become a de facto regulator of that market, setting the rules of the game,\" she says. \"You're more than welcome to be successful, but you're not supposed to misuse powers to promote yourself.\"</p><p>Vestager's strongest response is to the suggestion that competition laws should take a back seat in a crisis of this scale. \"Actually, I think that competition law enforcement is an essential necessity. It is anything but a luxury,\" she says. When the US suspended some antitrust action after 2008, it actually postponed the recession. \"You need competition to ensure that companies that create jobs can survive, that companies that are innovative survive.\"</p><p>Her vision is that much of this competition will come from Europe itself. She lists areas where European firms could excel, and sees the very risk of American predation as proof of their potential. \"There is more to digitisation than what the giants are providing right now,\" she says, seeing in the recovery a chance to \"accelerate\" EU prowess.</p><p>That truly would be a historic conclusion to the isolation: triumph not for Californian incumbents but for the long-prophesied, ever-elusive European Google.</p><p>CV ?

She has benefited from comparison with Bernie Sanders - a Democratic socialist. Warren is a capitalist, as she says, \"in her bones.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And if your benchmark is Karl Marx, Warren is correct. She believes in private ownership of the means of production. But her program would lead to a radically different version of capitalism than what Americans know. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It would greatly increase the presence of government. It would do away with private health insurance, ban fracking for natural gas, introduce a new form of taxation, break up big banks and big tech, accelerate curbs on fossil fuels and turn higher education into a federal entitlement. </p><p>Warren also has proposed involving the government in the production of prescription drugs - certainly a creative approach to lowering prices.</p><p>A Warren administration would try to prevent investment and jobs from moving overseas - that is, to prevent businesses from responding to market incentives and acting in their own economic interest. Warren would also restrict corporations' freedom to make basic capital decisions such as repurchasing their own stock.</p><p> Her buyback measure is not as egregious as Sanders's, but her program is animated by contempt for big corporations, which, looking just at the Fortune 500, employ more than 26 million people and are entrusted with the savings of tens and tens of millions of Americans. </p><p>Her program would raise the presence, and the power, of labor unions. It would restrict trade, with results similar to Donald Trump's, although the rhetoric is different. And it would do these things - many things - with a speed and scale that is revolutionary. </p><p>It has been said that Warren's positions will moderate as the campaign progresses, or that once in office, she won't be able to accomplish her agenda. This ignores our unhappy present situation (the same was said of Trump). And it is disrespectful to Warren. She has said, repeatedly, that she wants \"big, structural changes.\" She deserves to be taken at her word. </p><p>At the recent debate in Ohio, the Warren program that got the most attention was her plan to tax wealth over $50 million. It's hard to imagine that this would be enforceable - Accounting Today calls it \"a boon for appraisers\" - but it is not her most troubling idea. </p><p>Taxes on big incomes should go up, though there are better ways to raise revenue than a wealth tax, including Andrew Yang's value-added tax, eliminating the step-up in basis for inherited assets and raising the tax on capital gains. </p><p>The point is, taxes have fluctuated since 1776, and so they will continue. Warren's more fundamental changes occur at the corporate level, before the profits are earned.</p><p>It's worth stressing this: Redistribution is the government's job; no one else can do it. But messing with business before the profits are earned messes with the source of the profits that pay for all the social things that Warren wants to do, and it messes with the incentives for earning them. </p><p>Her signature plan to force large corporations to reserve 40 percent of board seats for employees violates every notion of American capitalism. It treats the assets of corporations as social assets, not really private, irrespective of their being funded with shareholder capital. </p><p>And it reeks of disdain for bigness. She does not propose that the owners of small businesses give up control. Big companies are not fundamentally different. They are not alien or malevolent creatures. They are small companies that succeeded.</p><p> Beto O'Rourke said at the debate in Ohio that Warren seems \"punitive.\" Warren said she was shocked. Yet her wealth tax, by targeting only the super-rich, does seem hostile to the wealthy. Social burdens should properly fall on everyone, with the rich paying more and others paying some. </p><p>And Warren blames virtually every social ill on \"big corporations.\" Her exchange in Ohio with Yang was revelatory. Yang blamed job losses on automation - a complex process for which no one set of actors is to blame. For Warren, there is always a culprit, and it's always the same culprit: big multinational corporations. </p><p>Abraham Lincoln, who expanded the government more than any previous president, said property is \"a positive good in the world,\" and he elaborated, \"That some should be rich shows that others may become rich.\" Warren has said similar, but one doesn't feel she means it. </p><p>There is a strong whiff in Warren's rhetoric of state industrial policy, and a patent disdain for markets.</p><p>Her proposal to install labor in the boardroom would redefine American capitalism. Unions and corporations would be pressed into partnership. As the price for assuming responsibility for social goals, corporations would demand federal protection and surely get it. The result would be a more managed and less innovative economy - big companies, big labor, big government running the show. (She would further enhance the clout of union bosses by adopting \"sectoral bargaining,\" or bargaining industry by industry.) </p><p>Judging from her recent attack on Facebook, there would be strong pressure on social media to regulate domestic political ads. I know that Facebook has spread much misinformation. But the American model holds that the marketplace of ideas ultimately is the best judge. If not the market, who would Warren anoint to decide which politicians will be heard? </p><p>Some of Warren's plans have been tried in Europe, such as universal health insurance and a greater role for unions, including, in Germany, in the boardroom. And Europe is the best model for what a Warrenized America would look like. I say that as an admirer of many aspects of European society, especially Europe's investment in public goods (try comparing trains there with Amtrak's). But no one should minimize the differences between the European and U.S. models. </p><p>America remains a more individualistic society. It is easier to find a job or to get rich (or to go broke). U.S. choices are more unfettered; U.S. capitalism is closer to Adam Smith. Europe has fewer start-ups, lower growth, a lower per-capita income and higher unemployment. On the other hand, Europe has less inequality and less poverty, and everyone has health insurance. </p><p>The liberal approach has been to address social ills by bolstering the safety net while preserving American dynamism. It has usually moved in small steps, cognizant that social institutions are complex and that the well-intentioned can also make mistakes. Trump has destroyed the liberal center, and Warren, with her repeated assertion that problems have a \"simple\" causality, poses a similar threat to the liberal approach. </p><p>Warren is a better human being than Trump, as are the other Democratic candidates, but like him, she oversimplifies problems and is too eager to blame. She is certain to a fault. </p><p> As a senator, she blackballed a qualified Treasury nominee who had worked on Wall Street as if it were a stain. Her standard line that the system is \"rigged\" undermines trust in the system and promises a continuation of combative politics. </p><p>Warren has not explained how she would pay for her programs. She seems unaware that bigness in government - especially when it attempts many new things at once - also has its perils. Her mistrust of markets and trade seems suited to a post-growth era. It augurs not optimism but a defensive crouch.

She has benefited from comparison with Bernie Sanders - a Democratic socialist. Warren is a capitalist, as she says, \"in her bones.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And if your benchmark is Karl Marx, Warren is correct. She believes in private ownership of the means of production. But her program would lead to a radically different version of capitalism than what Americans know. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It would greatly increase the presence of government. It would do away with private health insurance, ban fracking for natural gas, introduce a new form of taxation, break up big banks and big tech, accelerate curbs on fossil fuels and turn higher education into a federal entitlement. </p><p>Warren also has proposed involving the government in the production of prescription drugs - certainly a creative approach to lowering prices.</p><p>A Warren administration would try to prevent investment and jobs from moving overseas - that is, to prevent businesses from responding to market incentives and acting in their own economic interest. Warren would also restrict corporations' freedom to make basic capital decisions such as repurchasing their own stock.</p><p> Her buyback measure is not as egregious as Sanders's, but her program is animated by contempt for big corporations, which, looking just at the Fortune 500, employ more than 26 million people and are entrusted with the savings of tens and tens of millions of Americans. </p><p>Her program would raise the presence, and the power, of labor unions. It would restrict trade, with results similar to Donald Trump's, although the rhetoric is different. And it would do these things - many things - with a speed and scale that is revolutionary. </p><p>It has been said that Warren's positions will moderate as the campaign progresses, or that once in office, she won't be able to accomplish her agenda. This ignores our unhappy present situation (the same was said of Trump). And it is disrespectful to Warren. She has said, repeatedly, that she wants \"big, structural changes.\" She deserves to be taken at her word. </p><p>At the recent debate in Ohio, the Warren program that got the most attention was her plan to tax wealth over $50 million. It's hard to imagine that this would be enforceable - Accounting Today calls it \"a boon for appraisers\" - but it is not her most troubling idea. </p><p>Taxes on big incomes should go up, though there are better ways to raise revenue than a wealth tax, including Andrew Yang's value-added tax, eliminating the step-up in basis for inherited assets and raising the tax on capital gains. </p><p>The point is, taxes have fluctuated since 1776, and so they will continue. Warren's more fundamental changes occur at the corporate level, before the profits are earned.</p><p>It's worth stressing this: Redistribution is the government's job; no one else can do it. But messing with business before the profits are earned messes with the source of the profits that pay for all the social things that Warren wants to do, and it messes with the incentives for earning them. </p><p>Her signature plan to force large corporations to reserve 40 percent of board seats for employees violates every notion of American capitalism. It treats the assets of corporations as social assets, not really private, irrespective of their being funded with shareholder capital. </p><p>And it reeks of disdain for bigness. She does not propose that the owners of small businesses give up control. Big companies are not fundamentally different. They are not alien or malevolent creatures. They are small companies that succeeded.</p><p> Beto O'Rourke said at the debate in Ohio that Warren seems \"punitive.\" Warren said she was shocked. Yet her wealth tax, by targeting only the super-rich, does seem hostile to the wealthy. Social burdens should properly fall on everyone, with the rich paying more and others paying some. </p><p>And Warren blames virtually every social ill on \"big corporations.\" Her exchange in Ohio with Yang was revelatory. Yang blamed job losses on automation - a complex process for which no one set of actors is to blame. For Warren, there is always a culprit, and it's always the same culprit: big multinational corporations. </p><p>Abraham Lincoln, who expanded the government more than any previous president, said property is \"a positive good in the world,\" and he elaborated, \"That some should be rich shows that others may become rich.\" Warren has said similar, but one doesn't feel she means it. </p><p>There is a strong whiff in Warren's rhetoric of state industrial policy, and a patent disdain for markets.</p><p>Her proposal to install labor in the boardroom would redefine American capitalism. Unions and corporations would be pressed into partnership. As the price for assuming responsibility for social goals, corporations would demand federal protection and surely get it. The result would be a more managed and less innovative economy - big companies, big labor, big government running the show. (She would further enhance the clout of union bosses by adopting \"sectoral bargaining,\" or bargaining industry by industry.) </p><p>Judging from her recent attack on Facebook, there would be strong pressure on social media to regulate domestic political ads. I know that Facebook has spread much misinformation. But the American model holds that the marketplace of ideas ultimately is the best judge. If not the market, who would Warren anoint to decide which politicians will be heard? </p><p>Some of Warren's plans have been tried in Europe, such as universal health insurance and a greater role for unions, including, in Germany, in the boardroom. And Europe is the best model for what a Warrenized America would look like. I say that as an admirer of many aspects of European society, especially Europe's investment in public goods (try comparing trains there with Amtrak's). But no one should minimize the differences between the European and U.S. models. </p><p>America remains a more individualistic society. It is easier to find a job or to get rich (or to go broke). U.S. choices are more unfettered; U.S. capitalism is closer to Adam Smith. Europe has fewer start-ups, lower growth, a lower per-capita income and higher unemployment. On the other hand, Europe has less inequality and less poverty, and everyone has health insurance. </p><p>The liberal approach has been to address social ills by bolstering the safety net while preserving American dynamism. It has usually moved in small steps, cognizant that social institutions are complex and that the well-intentioned can also make mistakes. Trump has destroyed the liberal center, and Warren, with her repeated assertion that problems have a \"simple\" causality, poses a similar threat to the liberal approach. </p><p>Warren is a better human being than Trump, as are the other Democratic candidates, but like him, she oversimplifies problems and is too eager to blame. She is certain to a fault. </p><p> As a senator, she blackballed a qualified Treasury nominee who had worked on Wall Street as if it were a stain. Her standard line that the system is \"rigged\" undermines trust in the system and promises a continuation of combative politics. </p><p>Warren has not explained how she would pay for her programs. She seems unaware that bigness in government - especially when it attempts many new things at once - also has its perils. Her mistrust of markets and trade seems suited to a post-growth era. It augurs not optimism but a defensive crouch. As Democrats choose, they might consider whether this is the future that they and the country will want. </p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:business@washpost.com\">business@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-4874a3f4f42f11e98cf04cc99f74d127</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XC5-WPC1-JCDY-T0NJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1302\"/><timeReceived>10:43 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 27, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

These were recorded by someone at the meeting and were published on Tuesday on The Verge's website.<br/>The recordings show the level of unease that prompted Warren's promise to divide Google, Facebook, and Amazon if it wins the 2020 presidential election.<br/>Zuckerberg said, \"We have someone like Elizabeth Warren, who thinks the right answer is to split the companies.\"<br/>\"If she's elected president, I'd bet we'll have a legal challenge, and I'd bet we'd win the legal challenge. And that still sucks for us? Yes. I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government...\"<br/>\"But see, at the end of the day, if anyone's going to try to threaten something so existential, you go and fight with everything.\"<br/>Warren responded yesterday, shortly after the recordings were published, tweeting: \"What really 'sucks' is not fixing a corrupt system that allows giant companies like Facebook to engage in illegal anti-competitive practices, trampling on the consumer privacy rights and repeatedly let their responsibility to protect our democracy fall.\"<br/>He then republished his plan to divide the big tech companies, which he proposes to name regulators that commit to undoing Facebook's mergers with WhatsApp and Instagram.<br/>He said he would also seek to eliminate Amazon's Acquisitions of Whole Foods and Zappos, as well as Google's purchases from Waze, Nest and DoubleClick.<br/>Large technology companies have become the target of a number of potential antitrust challenges. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice initiated their own investigations into several companies, including Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google, while state attorneys general also investigate specifically to Facebook and Google.<br/>Until recently, Warren's plans did not appear to pose an immediate threat, as she lagged far behind Joe Biden in the contest to become the Democratic candidate in next year's presidential election.<br/>But recent polls show Warren is getting support and beating Biden in some of the early primaries and even nationally.<br/>Meanwhile, Facebook recordings also show that Zuckerberg is asked about a variety of issues facing his company, from his refusal to testify in the face of parliamentary consultations around the world to regulatory hurdle over Pound, the cryptocurrency the company hopes to launch.<br/>At the hearings, he said, \"I'm not going to every audience around the world. A lot of different people want to do that. When the problems arose last year around Cambridge Analytica, I appeared at the hearings in the United States. I attended the hearings in the European Union. It just doesn't make sense for me to go to the audiences in every country that wants me to introduce myself.\"<br/>And he presented an optimistic note on the chances of overcoming the regulators' resistance to Libra, saying, \"I think public things tend to be a little more dramatic. But a more important part is the private commitment toregulators around the world, and I think they often have more substances and are less dramatic.\"<br/>\"And those meetings are not performed for the camera, but that's where a lot of the discussions and details are resolved.\"<br/>Facebook declined to comment on the recordings.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-8814427</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X63-5H41-JBJN-M157-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"604\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 2, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002O8A</classCode><className>DOUBLECLICK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Apple won one round of a complex legal battle with the European Commission to protect its use of low-tax jurisdictions. And Huawei lost out on UK business after the British government did a U-turn from its decision to allow limited Huawei participation in the UK 5G network. A perfect storm of Conservative backbench insurrection and US sanctions made the previous UK position untenable. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These clashes are skirmishes in a much bigger war for dominance of the emerging digital world economy and the new, overlapping, technologies within it: artificial intelligence; 5G; big data; advanced semiconductors; and quantum computing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One aspect of this multifaceted conflict is between the \"big five\" American data giants - Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (ie Google), Microsoft and Facebook - and various governments trying to impose rules regarding privacy, content, competition and tax. Another is the emergence of competition with these household names from China's lesser-known but enormous data companies - Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, and others which have achieved global leadership in specific sectors like Huawei (telecommunications) and Daijang (drones).</p><p>Only the two economic superpowers, the US and China, now have the capacity in their companies and national infrastructure to compete seriously in this territory. That competition is rapidly degenerating into a polarised \"cold war\" between them.</p><p>Europe has not produced any of its own data giants and seems unlikely to do so. Instead, its markets are being fought over by US companies and increasingly the Chinese. The activities of the European Union have centred on consumers rather than producers, with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) becoming a notable success in establishing a common standard for the protection of privacy across Europe. It is accepted beyond the EU's borders, including in Brexit Britain.</p><p>Meanwhile, the European Commission is the only effective referee of the market, as the sole competition authority with sufficient heft and will to tackle, head-on, the immense power which resides in the data giants. This power derives from having near monopoly reach through a commonly used operating system as with Microsoft and MS-DOS in the Eighties and Nineties, Apple more recently with IoS and Google with Android. Conversely, internet platforms gain power as they gain users, with Amazon's online retail, Facebook's social media and Google's search engine now near-universal services. The monopolies are strengthened by numerous acquisitions of innovative companies and potential competitors, such as Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp, and Google's of YouTube and Spotify.</p><p>The only major counterweight is Margrethe Vestager, a Danish liberal, who as European competition commissioner has a passion for free trade, open markets and consumer rights in the European liberal tradition. She is rumoured to have been the model for the fictional Birgitte Nyborg in the Danish political drama Borgen. In the real world, she has been tenacious in challenging the data giants, albeit with mixed results.</p><p>In this field, proving monopoly abuse is difficult, not least because data giants provide their services free at the point of use, so do not obviously rip anyone off. Instead we pay indirectly through advertising and the data collected on what we click. We pay even more through lost revenue when big companies pick and choose where to pay their taxes, escaping billions in liabilities. In the complex task of demonstrating that abuse it taking place, the commission is painfully slow. Google for example managed to acquire 167 companies after an EU Commission inquiry commenced. It was, however, eventually fined for market abuse over competition between its search engine and price comparison sites.</p><p>Apple has been defter, successfully defeating the commission in the courts. It was accused of colluding with the Irish government to dodge state aid rules through a \"sweetheart\" deal which involved paying 1 per cent corporate tax. The second-highest court in the EU found for Ireland and the company, and the commission has low expectations of winning when the issue goes to the European Court of Justice. It is to the credit of Vestager that she keeps fighting. She is already bringing another case against Apple over the fees Spotify has to pay for using its payments system.</p><p>By comparison, the US takes virtually no action over big data companies. The \"trust-busting\" traditions - the break-up of the railway baronies, the Rockefeller oil empire and Bell Telephone - are long forgotten. Today's president sees data companies solely in terms of their political usefulness in promoting his message. Although a few radical legislators like Elizabeth Warren have called for the likes of Facebook to be broken up, the companies face far less challenge than in Europe. </p><p>The US authorities have so far had an additional reason for turning a blind eye to whatever market abuses the data companies get up to: superpower competition with China. To paraphrase a former US statesman challenged about his country's unsavoury allies: \"They may be bas***ds but they are our bas***ds\". With the big tech giants, and others in specialised applications - Netflix, PayPal, Uber, eBay - and many others the US is the only western country with the range of skills, the depth of capital markets, the entrepreneurial energy and the scale to be able to dominate and push ahead into new technologies.</p><p>Some of the big US data companies were never allowed to get a foothold in China (Google, Facebook), opening the way to Chinese alternatives, and Amazon has been marginalised there by a Chinese competitor, Alibaba. China has produced its own version of Uber (Didi) and hitherto unknown companies are colonising other areas. </p><p>The switch under Donald Trump and Xi Jinping from a recognition of interdependence and mutual interest to outright hostility and conflict has enormous implications for the digital world. In a few cases, notably Apple, there is heavy interdependence with China and interlocking supply chains. Companies like Huawei are genuinely global. Others like TikTok have become popular with western consumers. Newcomers like Zoom have a big research and development footprint in both the west and China.</p><p>The policy of delinking now apparently being pursued by the west will be seriously disruptive for some of these companies, but it will also deprive countries like Britain of state-of-the-art technology. In its latest act of self-harm, the UK has just accepted that it will go backwards for several years in ambitions for 5G connectivity, in return for pleasing Trump. Meanwhile, the timid challenge which Britain offered to the tech industry through a proposed digital tax is likely to be swept away as a condition for the US agreeing to a bilateral trade deal.</p><p>The long-term effect of American myopia over what should be recognisable mutual interest is unlikely to be China simply backing off and giving up. Instead, the Chinese will try even harder, using the country's immense capacity to mobilise talent, investment and hard work. In the long term, their ambition is not just to equal US power, but to exceed it and become number one. As these titans wage war against each other, more is the pity that the UK has walked away from the - limited - protection that a forceful European Competition Commission provides from the crossfire. </p><p>                     Vince Cable is the former leader of the Liberal Democrats                   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-64587953</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INPDWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DB-GH21-JCJY-G1YM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1280\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent (United Kingdom)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19720\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 21, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

One man with thick, swirling tattoos across his arms and neck turns to the others and asks: \"So what are you in for?\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Murder,\" says a stringy gentleman with a scar on his face. \"Arson,\" says a bearded man with a wry smile. Then heads swivel to Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook. \"Hosting harmful online content,\" he shrugs, to sympathetic murmurs.</p><p>It is very unlikely that anything like this scenario will result from the British Government's new social media regulations, which will be unveiled today <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/duty-of-care-campaign/\">after a two-year campaign by the Telegraph</url>. Nevertheless, the rules being proposed are serious business indeed.</p><p>The Government is expected to make named officers of social media firms personally responsible for enforcing their new legal obligations to protect children from harm. If they fail to take \"reasonable and proportionate action\", as judged by the telecommunications regulator Ofcom, they could face fines, personal disqualification, or even criminal prosecution. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/duty-of-care-campaign/\">A source told the Telegraph last week</url> that doing so would \"concentrate the minds of executives\".</p><p>This would not actually mean Mark Zuckerberg personally becoming an international fugitive. Affected companies would probably be required to appoint a UK-based director who would take on this liability. The system is modelled on the finance industry, which has long burdened named officers with personal responsibility for breaches of the law.</p><p>Even so, it may strike some readers as pretty out there. Isn't it a huge step to make individual tech executives liable criminally liable, especially given that some have been arrested in other countries for refusing to hand over user data to repressive governments?</p><p>Moreover, is it practical to apply that responsibility to massive global companies headquartered outside the UK? Would these new rules actually change anything, or will Big Tech simply find a way to minimise their impact?</p><p>In fact, there are good reasons to think these rules would make a real difference to how tech firms behave - and, perhaps, help make the internet genuinely safer for children.</p><p>First, let's dispense with the idea that such rules are unprecedented, or indeed tantamount to government repression. They may be new to the tech industry, which for years was able to voraciously expand its power over millions and then billions of people in something of a regulatory void.</p><p>But they are a venerable element of banking and finance regulation, as well as the regulation of the traditional press, where editors and journalists can be held individually liable for libel and can be personally convicted if they break rape victims' statutory anonymity without their consent. </p><p>Nor is the liability infinite. In finance, managers are not culpable for any bad outcome of their actions, however unpredictable. Instead, they simply need to show that they took all reasonable steps to minimise risks. Based on the Government's white paper, it's likely the new social media regulations will work in a similar way, requiring social media bosses to follow a set of best practices designed to avoid harm.</p><p>Experience from the finance industry does suggest that this can make a real difference. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/duty-of-care-campaign/\">A report from September 2019 by UK Finance</url>, a bankers' lobby group, found that new liability rules introduced in 2016 had created \"a meaningful and tangible change in culture, behaviour and attitudes\". Of the 60 senior surveyed for the report, 88pc believed that change had been \"for the better\", and none believed it had been for the worse.</p><p>One respondent said that senior managers were now \"more focused on doing the right thing\", as well as \"being able to evidence that they are doing the right thing\". Another said that it had \"increased the focus on front-line responsibility for risk\". Others described improvements in ethics culture, saying there was now \"less appetite to push boundaries or risk tolerances\". Of course there were drawbacks: more complexity, more bureaucracy and more risk aversion.</p><p>A lawyer who specialises in individual liability cases, but who preferred to stay anonymous, gave me a similar assessment. They said that the rules really had \"focused minds\" and induced more caution, as well as requiring managers to document their decisions more thoroughly.</p><p>\"People no longer think they can hide behind the company,\" the lawyer said. \"You've got to make the decision yourself.\" Applying such rules to the tech industry, they said, seemed likely \"push the needle\" where monetary fines had not, although the devil will be in the details.</p><p>Fines, of course, are the elephant in the room here. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) introduced stiff new penalties for companies found to violate privacy, reaching up to 4pc of annual turnover. EU competition authorities have also imposed gigantic fines of billions of dollars, equivalent to those levied against big banks, on Apple and Google.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/duty-of-care-campaign/\">US trade regulators fined Facebook an eye-watering $5bn (\u00a33.9)</url> for alleged privacy breaches including those that led to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>It's not clear that these fines, in themselves, have created much change. True, tech giants now take privacy more seriously than they used to, and their systems for limiting disinformation, catching criminals and dealing with harmful content have improved significantly. But this seems to be the result of a much broader cultural shift, and GDPR itself has hardly upended the way Facebook and Google do business. </p><p>Last January, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/duty-of-care-campaign/\">the French data regulator fined Google (EURO)50m</url> (\u00a342m) for making its privacy settings too complex and opaque, with       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/duty-of-care-campaign/\">officials objecting</url> that data sharing options came pre-ticked and spread across multiple pages and masked behind a \"more options\" button. As of Monday, however, those things are still true of Google's privacy settings in the UK.</p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook's shares actually went up when the Cambridge Analytica penalty was announced. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/duty-of-care-campaign/\">Snapchat recently settled a lawsuit for $187m</url>, but $87m of that was covered by insurance.</p><p>It seems likely, then, that individual responsibility would provoke changes that the threat of fines alone would not. For tech firms to become slower and more burdened with internal bureaucracy, as described in the UK Finance report, would be a huge shift from their traditional philosophy of savage agility. Some will argue that it would kill the tech industry's best qualities, destroying the rapid innovation and experimentation for which it is known. </p><p>Perhaps, however, speed and ruthlessness are not what Britons want from the companies that now dominate their children's schoolwork, social lives and leisure time from a very early age.
