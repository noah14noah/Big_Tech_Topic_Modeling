Washington: As the Trump administration moves toward antitrust action against search giant Google, it\u2019s campaigning to enlist support from sympathetic state attorneys general across the country.    And President Donald Trump pushed his campaign against Big Tech on Wednesday, touting curbs on legal protections for social media platforms he denounces as biased against conservative views.    \u201cIn recent years, a small group of technology platforms have tightened their grip over commerce and communications in America,\u201d Trump declared at a White House event with Attorney General William Barr and Republican attorneys general from several states. \u201cThey\u2019ve used this power to engage in unscrupulous business practices while simultaneously waging war on free enterprise and free expression.\u201d    The anticipated lawsuit against Google by the Justice Department could be the government\u2019s biggest legal offensive to protect competition since the ground-breaking case against Microsoft almost 20 years ago.    Lawmakers and consumer advocates accuse Google of abusing its dominance in online search and advertising to stifle competition and boost its profits.    For over a year, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have pursued sweeping antitrust investigations of big tech companies, looking at whether Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple have hurt competition, stifled innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. And a bipartisan coalition of 50 US states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, announced a year ago on the steps of the Supreme Court that they were investigating Google\u2019s business practices. They cited \u201cpotential monopolistic behaviour.\u201d    Now with some 40 days to the presidential election, the Justice Department appears to be approaching legal action against Google and soliciting the support of state attorneys general on an issue of rare bipartisan agreement, while Trump appeals to his political base by amplifying a longstanding grievance of conservatives against Silicon Valley.    Along with the antitrust drive, the Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter, putting down a legislative marker in Trump\u2019s drive against the social media giants. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.    Trump signed an executive order earlier this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.    The White House said Wednesday the legislative proposal would protect the open internet and prevent hidden manipulation by social media. In addition, Barr said, the government will provide individuals the ability to pursue legal claims against online platforms for \u201cbad-faith censorship.\u201d    Social media platforms can abuse consumers\u2019 trust \u201cby deciding which voices they are going to amplify and which they are going to throttle, and by improperly tracking, collecting user data and even facilitating criminal activity,\u201d Barr said.    Separately, the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust officials are expected to discuss their planned action on Google in Washington meetings and a conference call with the state attorneys general on Thursday.    \u201cBig Tech has a powerful influence on commerce and our daily lives, warranting significant scrutiny,\u201d Washington state attorney general Bob Ferguson said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cAny effort to abuse that influence for competitive gain calls for vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws.\u201d    Support from the states would bolster the Justice Department\u2019s case against Google. It\u2019s a tricky political calculus for states, however. If a Biden administration takes over next year, the status of the lawsuit against Google would be unclear. A state signing on to the federal case also could limit the tools, such as state consumer laws, that it might want to use to pursue its own action _ and the political benefit locally of taking up a cause for consumers.    Some Republican attorneys general could be expected to join the federal case, while another group of states may opt to pursue their own actions.    The Trump administration has long had Google in its sights. A top economic adviser to the president said two years ago that the White House was considering whether Google searches should be subject to government regulation. Trump himself has often criticized Google, recycling unfounded claims by conservatives that the search giant is biased against conservatives and suppresses their viewpoints, interferes with U.S. elections and prefers working with the Chinese military over the Pentagon.    The company, based in Mountain View, California, has denied the claims and insists that it never ranks search results to manipulate political views. Google has argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. It maintains that its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives. Most of its services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps Google sell its ads.    A House Judiciary subcommittee has pursued its own bipartisan sweeping investigation of Big Tech\u2019s market dominance. The panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., accused Google in a July hearing of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites, and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost profits.    Antitrust regulators in Europe have cracked down on Google in recent years by imposing multibillion-dollar fines and ordering changes to its practices.    Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., controls about 90% of global web searches. Its dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data. Google dwarfs other search competitors such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing and Yelp, and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favouring its own products over competitors at the top of search results.    Google also owns the leading web browser in Chrome, the world\u2019s largest mobile operating system in Android, the top video site in YouTube and the most popular digital mapping system.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

It's clear the CEA doesn't buy into the idea that the U.S. has apervasive 'monopoly problem' and is very aware of the danger of simplistic thinking around large digital platforms. The President's economic advisers echo much of my recent critique[3] on the use of crude national industry concentration measures as proxies for the health of competition. </p><p>They bring lots of theoretical arguments and empirical evidence to bear that these are not reflective of relevant product markets pertaining to antitrust enforcement, not least because markets are often incredibly local. For example, six\u2010\u200bdigit NAICS codes are often used to assess sector\u2010\u200blevel concentration in many studies - and these go as granular as industries such as 'book publishers,' 'beauty salons,' and 'car washes.' But, as amoment's reflection of these examples suggests, these are clearly not relevant markets for antitrust. Abeauty salon in Kenosha, Wisconsin doesn't compete with one in Dupont Circle, Washington DC. In fact, the EROP highlightsevidence Ihadn't seen before: Werden and Froeb (2018) calculate the volume of commerce of the relevant markets alleged in DOJ merger complaints between 2013 and 2015 as ashare of industry shipments in the six\u2010\u200bdigit NAICS sector. They find that in most cases, the antitrust markets accounted for less than 0.5 percent of the six\u2010\u200bdigit NAICS sector. In many cases, this is because the antitrust markets where the DOJ identified acompetition problem involved single localities such as acity, State, or region, whereas the NAICS sectors are national.Still though, many seem to be conducting the public debate over whether the U.S. has amonopoly problem knowingly using data that is easy to collect but which doesn't represent actual markets. It's very pleasing the CEA demurs from this growing trend. Even better, the CEA report is clearly extremely skeptical of 'Hipster Antitrust' calls to broaden the scope of antitrust law and the most interventionist policy proposals on 'Big Tech,' including proposals for sector\u2010\u200bspecific remedies such as enforced data portability and interoperability, tougher restrictions on acquisitions, andbringing in aspecific digital sector regulator. Perhaps most pleasing of all though is that the EROP doesn't fall for the 'this time is different' narratives we hear about digital platforms. It's common to read that because of economies of scale, network effects, data, or firms competing on platforms they operate, that there's something just unique about today's tech companies that requires amore 'forward\u2010\u200blooking' antitrust. The CEA cites lots of evidence showing that none of these economic features of these markets ensure sustained dominance, in line with my own work[4] showing how Schumpeterian competition from new products put pay to historical examples of firms said to have just these types of advantages. The overall chapter concludes: confusion surrounding the effects of rising concentration appears to be driven by questionable evidence and an overly simple narrative that 'Big Is Bad.' When companies achieve scale and large market share by innovating and providing their customers with value, this is awelcome result of healthy competition.Do read the whole thing[5].

They bring lots of theoretical arguments and empirical evidence to bear that these are not reflective of relevant product markets pertaining to antitrust enforcement, not least because markets are often incredibly local.</p><p>For example, six\" digit NAICS codes are often used to assess sector\" level concentration in many studies and these go as granular as industries such as \"book publishers,\" \"beauty salons,\" and \"car washes.\" But, as a moment's reflection of these examples suggests, these are clearly not relevant markets for antitrust. A beauty salon in Kenosha, Wisconsin doesn't compete with one in Dupont Circle, Washington DC. In fact, the EROP highlights evidence I hadn't seen before:</p><p>Werden and Froeb (2018) calculate the volume of commerce of the relevant markets alleged in DOJ merger complaints between 2013 and 2015 as a share of industry shipments in the six\" digit NAICS sector. They find that in most cases, the antitrust markets accounted for less than 0.5 percent of the six\" digit NAICS sector. In many cases, this is because the antitrust markets where the DOJ identified a competition problem involved single localities such as a city, State, or region, whereas the NAICS sectors are national.</p><p>Still though, many seem to be conducting the public debate over whether the U.S. has a monopoly problem knowingly using data that is easy to collect but which doesn't represent actual markets. It's very pleasing the CEA demurs from this growing trend.</p><p>Even better, the CEA report is clearly extremely skeptical of \"Hipster Antitrust\" calls to broaden the scope of antitrust law and the most interventionist policy proposals on \"Big Tech,\" including proposals for sector\" specific remedies such as enforced data portability and interoperability, tougher restrictions on acquisitions, and bringing in a specific digital sector regulator.</p><p>Perhaps most pleasing of all though is that the EROP doesn't fall for the \"this time is different\" narratives we hear about digital platforms. It's common to read that because of economies of scale, network effects, data, or firms competing on platforms they operate, that there's something just unique about today's tech companies that requires a more \"forward\" looking\" antitrust. The CEA cites lots of evidence showing that none of these economic features of these markets ensure sustained dominance, in line with my own work showing how Schumpeterian competition from new products put pay to historical examples of firms said to have just these types of advantages.</p><p>The overall chapter concludes:</p><p>confusion surrounding the effects of rising concentration appears to be driven by questionable evidence and an overly simple narrative that \"Big Is Bad.\" When companies achieve scale and large market share by innovating and providing their customers with value, this is a welcome result of healthy competition.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123501933</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y84-7N01-JCBF-S1BT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"574\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 20, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to the reports, the U.S. Department of Justice effort may amount to one of the most significant federal antitrust actions in 20 years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While Main Street continues to search for a way out of a very deep hole, mega-tech monstrosities like Amazon, Google and Facebook have been fueling their massive data monopolies and thriving amidst this time of turmoil. Since the March 2020 market lows, all have reached or exceeded their all-time high share prices. In addition to help from Congress, ultra-accommodative Federal Reserve policy has once again sent trillions straight into the pockets of tech executives at the expense of American workers.</p><p>What's becoming crystal clear to our citizens and representatives alike is that these conglomerates are primarily growing thanks to unfair, predatory behavior\u2014and not superior execution.</p><p>Because they determine how information is disseminated, companies like Google and Facebook now have almost limitless control over the population. Google alone controls over <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/\">85 percent</url> of the digital advertising market, while Facebook has a similar stranglehold over social media. This ability to regulate the spread of information and messaging is unlike any in history, yet these companies continue to amass even more power.</p><p>Consider their recent actions with respect to censoring free speech. Google and Facebook are repeatedly <url normalizedValue=\"https://telecoms.com/503783/facebook-doubles-down-on-covid-19-censorship/\">removing</url> information that counters World Health Organization (WHO) releases related to COVID-19. Now that the WHO has been       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/international/495406-we-need-to-take-a-cold-hard-look-at-the-world-health-organization\">outed</url> as spreading dubious information and having an       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/who-must-drop-its-pro-beijing-goodwill-ambassador-opinion-1504961?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">uncomfortable relationship</url> with the Chinese Communist Party, this has proven especially concerning.</p><p>But the absurdity of this policy hasn't hurt these companies' market shares. As unchecked monopolies, they can act with impunity\u2014and smaller firms that work with them are forced to accept abuses.</p><p>Third-party vendors and providers rely on their platforms to conduct business. Amazon, Google and Facebook collect data that informs advertisers and sellers on how to target and market their products. Now that their power has become essentially limitless, they've also begun abusing vendors in disturbing ways.</p><p>Google, for example, recently <url normalizedValue=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/\">announced</url> it will ban third-party cookies from its Google Chrome browser. Cookies allow advertisers to utilize users' web traffic to more accurately target those users' interests and preferences. With its upcoming change, however, Google will cut out all competition and become the sole gatekeeper of this coveted data.</p><p>Marketplaces like Amazon have not behaved any differently. While you can still find independent vendors who use its market, they are increasingly afterthoughts.</p><p>Recently, it was credibly alleged that the Seattle-based company <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.extremetech.com/internet/309794-amazon-used-third-party-merchant-data-after-testifying-to-congress-that-it-didnt\">stole</url> third-party vendor data to help develop Amazon-branded competitors. Not only does this alleged practice contradict years of public statements denying such tactics, but it also shows that Amazon's real goal is not to be a private marketplace for others. Instead, it seeks to become a supplier of its own user data that it mined from sellers in order to undercut competition.</p><p>Additionally, Amazon has been reportedly making support of its vendors <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/01/amazon-sellers-say-online-retail-giant-is-trying-help-itself-not-consumers/?arc404=true\">more costly and difficult</url>. Sellers now have to pay up to $5,000 per month just to get basic seller support from a representative. Vendors must also now reinvest a larger percentage of earnings into advertising on Amazon search pages just to compete with its private-label brands. It appears that with its private-label brands growing, Amazon now has little use for the small businesses that rely on its platform to profit.</p><p>The tech behemoths claim that this is just a case of free market capitalism prevailing, but that simply isn't true. Take the Google-Apple partnership: When they teamed up to announce COVID-19 tracking software, the public responded with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/29/most-americans-are-not-willing-or-able-use-an-app-tracking-coronavirus-infections-thats-problem-big-techs-plan-slow-pandemic/\">overwhelming displeasure</url>. People don't trust these companies to protect their data, yet their business models are based on collecting it. How could they continue to grow in the face of such opposition?</p><p>Because they're not operating in a fair market.</p><p>The actions of Big Tech have been so egregious that there is increasingly a bipartisan desire to investigate and prosecute them. Senators ranging from progressive Democrat <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rollcall.com/2020/05/05/antitrust-hawks-take-on-big-tech-as-pandemic-persists/\">Elizabeth Warren</url> to conservative Republican       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thehill.com/policy/technology/493917-hawley-presses-apple-google-to-make-ceos-personally-liable-for-contact\">Josh Hawley</url> have been calling for investigations and hearings.

Stay tuned, and send names [and] events.\"</p><p>There is a fear that cracking down on Silicon Valley could take a backseat, as it has in the past. We can't let this happen. For the sake of American small businesses and citizens that rely on competition and the free flow of information, Congress must make ending unfair practices by Big Tech a top priority.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Brian Maloney is the co-founder of the Media Equality Project, a conservative watchdog group.

About a dozen states sued to block the deal. Also at TPI, Delrahim confirmed his department and several states are probing tech issues. He wouldn't object to a look by others at Communications Decency Act Section 230.</p><p>Delrahim noted the states' lawsuit was filed before Justice reached a settlement with the companies. \"They have amended their complaint,\" he told us of the states, taking into account his agency's consent decree (see 1907260071). \"I think they would have a hard time winning the case\" with DOJ's remedies, he said of the case in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.</p><p>One TPI attendee noted Delrahim's handicapping may not be borne out. \"His record of predictions in the AT&amp;T trial pretrial, during the trial and prior to the appeal proved not to be accurate,\" said Blair Levin of New Street and the Brookings Institution, in an interview. \"Like many predictions in Washington, they are judged not by their accuracy but whether they drive an agenda.\" After a trial and an appeal, AT&amp;T succeeded in buying Time Warner.</p><p>Faced with the same T-Mobile/Sprint before his department's consent decree, he might have gone to court, too, Delrahim told TPI Tuesday. His issue with states participating in the litigation against the transaction is that there had been confidentiality pacts during the review: \"It makes you wonder why they did that.\" Justice's settlement \"is a great solution, ultimately pro-consumer and pro-efficiency,\" he said. States \"now have to litigate not the underlying transaction, but the fix that we have\" with the FCC and DOJ, he said.</p><p>The states' suit came after \"a year-long investigation and careful consideration of the parties' arguments and all the evidence,\" emailed a New York AG office spokesperson. The litigants sued over the deal \"because of its impact on competition,\" he added. \"We are acting under our capacity as independent states.\"</p><p>Tech Probe</p><p>On DOJ's look at the tech sector, perhaps a few dozen state AGs \"have expressed interest in the subject matter,\" Delrahim said. \"Where we can work in a cooperative manner with some state attorney generals, we do work together ... so we attempt to operate in that mode.\" He's not disclosing a timetable for the probe. \"We have an investigation,\" Delrahim said. \"We will be taking a broad look, and we will be looking at it with no preset agendas.\"</p><p>Big tech isn't necessarily bad tech, Delrahim suggested: As U.S. AG William Barr says, \"big in and of itself is not bad, it's big behaving badly.\" One wants tech companies \"to continue to strive and compete,\" Delrahim said. Investigations can look at efficiencies, and whether better ability to compete and possibly lower prices to consumers and increase output springs from that, he noted. \"I have no idea without doing an investigation\" whether that's the case with the tech industry, he said.</p><p>Though some tech and other products are free to consumers, that doesn't mean no one pays, Delrahim said: \"You don't have a free lunch in this market economy.\" On broadcast TV, he noted, \"who pays for that is the advertiser.\" And \"when you look at a social media product, is it really free?\" he asked. \"It might be free to you but not somebody else.\" Antitrust laws aren't limited to only prices, he added.</p><p>The CDA's Section 230 isn't an antitrust issue, Delrahim noted, though it might be worthwhile to look at that law. He said the portion of the 1996 Telecom Act didn't anticipate the type of online services available now: \"A review of Section 230 by people who care about it is perfectly appropriate.\" Some want it expanded to give tech companies less safe harbor, which came up earlier at the conference (see 1908190021). \"To the extent that companies internalize externalities of their offerings and that makes them improve and be more responsible, that can be a positive thing,\" Delrahim said.</p><p>\"CDA 230 makes the best parts of the internet possible. Americans rely upon user reviews, ratings, and more -- which exist thanks to CDA 230 -- to make safer, better decisions online,\" emailed an Internet Association spokesperson. \"CDA 230 is also the law that allows companies to moderate and delete content that everyone agrees has no place online without facing liability for making platforms a safer place for all.\"</p><p>\"CTA has always been a supporter of Section 230,\" said Jamie Susskind, vice president-policy and regulatory affairs, on a later panel. (See Notebook below in this report). The section helps small businesses that might lack money for content monitoring systems, and may have helped the U.S. get internet investment, Susskind said: \"Section 230 is a very essential protection\" for tech innovators.</p><p>DOJ + FTC = OK</p><p>Some may have the mistaken impression DOJ and the FTC divided up their reviews of aspects of tech by company, Delrahim suggested later in Q&amp;A with reporters. \"It's never company by company,\" he told us. \"It's conduct by conduct.\" He cited instances where the agencies reviewed different deals involving tech companies: \"If you look through history, you have largely the same process.\"</p><p>It's also not correct that there's much tension between the antitrust agencies, though some areas of differences have surfaced over many years, Delrahim told reporters. Some 99.9 percent of the time, DOJ and the FTC don't have such issues, he estimated: \"The differences between the two agencies have been going on for some time, going back decades. I don't think anything is new.\"</p><p>\"Both agencies have the good fortune of talented lawyers who are passionate about great cases and enforcing the law,\" said FTC Chairman Joe Simons in a statement Tuesday. \"I view each agency's eagerness to pursue the investigations as a positive.\"</p><p>Delrahim disagreed with some of Colorado AG Phil Weiser's earlier comments at TPI about politics possibly playing role at DOJ. \"I don't agree with it, and I think it's really dangerous when we start questioning, not that we shouldn't do proper oversight and checks and balances ... if you start questioning the motives, just for political gain, of institutions like the Justice Department,\" Delrahim said. \"It starts to be problematic\" if people believe what DOJ does may include political motives, he added. Moderator and CNBC anchor Brian Sullivan noted Weiser had said similar.</p><p>Colorado's Weiser recounted now that he told TPI Sunday of his worries about the department and the Affordable Care Act. \"My concern with the DOJ's conduct during the ACA litigation is that, instead of defending the law as required, it is making the highly questionable argument that the entire law is invalid based on the invalidity of a single provision,\" he emailed us. Some attendees said they took his remarks as criticizing Justice for being too politicized.</p><p>On advice to the audience of tech, telecom and media executives on what they and their lawyers should keep in mind when dealing with his department, Delrahim said to be forthright, generally reflecting what another Justice official told the conference last year (see 1808200056). Get data to DOJ that may be relevant as early as possible, Delrahim advised. \"We have no qualms about going to court to try to enforce our\" civil investigative demands, he continued. \"We're fully prepared to enforce our process to preserve the integrity of our investigation.\" He suggested looking at court documents on Sinclair's abandoned deal to buy Tribune. \"That complaint shows what not to do, if you are a merging party\" and dealing with DOJ's front office, he said. Sinclair had no comment.</p><p>TPI Notebook</p><p>Tech and content stakeholders differed, some along historic fault lines, about how easy it is for new, small entrants to get traction in the music market, including scoring wide distribution. At a TPI panel Tuesday (see page 6), RIAA CEO Mitch Glazier said \"the market will work.\" Jean Prewitt, CEO of the Independent Film &amp; Television Alliance, wasn't so sure, saying not to be distracted from this analysis by the next shiny object. There are hundreds of music services, Glazier noted. He pointed to Amazon's Alexa letting a user order by voice command various music services and bundles as \"a great example of differentiation.\" He identified \"a huge amount of competition\" in the U.S., with varied services often having similar music. \"There's a fierce competition for global markets both within big companies\" and local ones, he added. Distribution remains powerful, said Prewitt, as content producers need those \"pipelines.\" It's \"much more about who gets close to the consumer and in the winner-takes-all analogy, you sort of ignore the fact that consumers are famous from walking away from today's form of distribution. So I think the jury is really out on how this all plays out,\" she said. \"You make the best content you can\" is her suggested strategy. Entertainment Software Association Senior Counsel-Tech Policy Delara Derakhshani noted tech platforms are releasing transparency reports, and mentioned \"the importance of collaboration and cooperation\" in this sector. Prewitt said such disclosures, which can include information on IP/royalties, \"don't actually tell you how your product performed, which is what we really want.\" In industry self-regulation, Derakhshani said the videogame sector's Entertainment Software Rating Board is held up as a good example.</p><p>Current U.S. trade issues can affect startups and other companies, a TPI panel was told Tuesday (see page 7). With the current focus in Washington on China, \"what's important in terms of what's happening in Washington is our relationships with other countries,\" said BigID CEO Dimitri Sirota. \"We really see ourselves as an international company, even though we are only three years old.\" CTA continues to have concerns about the administration's duties on products from China, said Jamie Susskind, vice president-policy and regulatory affairs. She said about 600 of CTA's roughly 2,000 members are startups, and many levies taking effect in September and in December may affect consumer tech products: \"For us, the results are tangible and they are real.\" Though the association is \"sympathetic to what the administration is trying to do\" on China and its IP practices, \"we don't prefer to see tariffs imposed,\" which the group likens to taxes, Susskind continued. On privacy, CTA has concerns about California's law. \"Consumers have a right to know\" what data is being collected, but that state's law could \"hurt innovation,\" she said. \"We've been advocating for a federal framework. Our hope is that Congress will get it done.\" The association prefers \"a framework that isn't\" like the EU's general data protection regulation and lets companies \"use data in ways that provide benefits to consumers,\" she said.</p><p>Regulatory systems need to change because of artificial intelligence, including as applied to machine learning for financial-sector AI, an economics professor told TPI. \"The expertise has got to be there,\" said Stanford's Susan Athey. \"I think each regulatory agency is going to have to hire people\" with the appropriate expertise in this realm, she said. \"We have to change our regulatory structure to accommodate a world where firms\" can show what's an acceptable error rate, Athey said. \"The regulatory scheme has got to adapt\" to \"actually accept errors,\" she continued. \"You cannot be error-free. ... A machine learning model makes mistakes. You can't hide that it makes mistakes.

About a dozen states sued to block the deal. Also at TPI, Delrahim confirmed his department and several states are probing tech issues. He wouldn't object to a look by others at Communications Decency Act Section 230.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Delrahim noted the states' lawsuit was filed before Justice reached a settlement with the companies. \"They have amended their complaint,\" he told us of the states, taking into account his agency's consent decree (see 1907260071). \"I think they would have a hard time winning the case\" with DOJ's remedies, he said of the case in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.</p><p>One TPI attendee noted Delrahim's handicapping may not be borne out. \"His record of predictions in the AT&amp;T trial pretrial, during the trial and prior to the appeal proved not to be accurate,\" said Blair Levin of New Street and the Brookings Institution, in an interview. \"Like many predictions in Washington, they are judged not by their accuracy but whether they drive an agenda.\" After a trial and an appeal, AT&amp;T succeeded in buying Time Warner.</p><p>Faced with the same T-Mobile/Sprint before his department's consent decree, he might have gone to court, too, Delrahim told TPI Tuesday. His issue with states participating in the litigation against the transaction is that there had been confidentiality pacts during the review: \"It makes you wonder why they did that.\" Justice's settlement \"is a great solution, ultimately pro-consumer and pro-efficiency,\" he said. States \"now have to litigate not the underlying transaction, but the fix that we have\" with the FCC and DOJ, he said.</p><p>The states' suit came after \"a year-long investigation and careful consideration of the parties' arguments and all the evidence,\" emailed a New York AG office spokesperson. The litigants sued over the deal \"because of its impact on competition,\" he added. \"We are acting under our capacity as independent states.\"</p><p>Tech Probe</p><p>On DOJ's look at the tech sector, perhaps a few dozen state AGs \"have expressed interest in the subject matter,\" Delrahim said. \"Where we can work in a cooperative manner with some state attorney generals, we do work together ... so we attempt to operate in that mode.\" He's not disclosing a timetable for the probe. \"We have an investigation,\" Delrahim said. \"We will be taking a broad look, and we will be looking at it with no preset agendas.\"</p><p>Big tech isn't necessarily bad tech, Delrahim suggested: As U.S. AG William Barr says, \"big in and of itself is not bad, it's big behaving badly.\" One wants tech companies \"to continue to strive and compete,\" Delrahim said. Investigations can look at efficiencies, and whether better ability to compete and possibly lower prices to consumers and increase output springs from that, he noted. \"I have no idea without doing an investigation\" whether that's the case with the tech industry, he said.</p><p>Though some tech and other products are free to consumers, that doesn't mean no one pays, Delrahim said: \"You don't have a free lunch in this market economy.\" On broadcast TV, he noted, \"who pays for that is the advertiser.\" And \"when you look at a social media product, is it really free?\" he asked. \"It might be free to you but not somebody else.\" Antitrust laws aren't limited to only prices, he added.</p><p>The CDA's Section 230 isn't an antitrust issue, Delrahim noted, though it might be worthwhile to look at that law. He said the portion of the 1996 Telecom Act didn't anticipate the type of online services available now: \"A review of Section 230 by people who care about it is perfectly appropriate.\" Some want it expanded to give tech companies less safe harbor, which came up earlier at the conference (see 1908190021). \"To the extent that companies internalize externalities of their offerings and that makes them improve and be more responsible, that can be a positive thing,\" Delrahim said.</p><p>\"CDA 230 makes the best parts of the internet possible. Americans rely upon user reviews, ratings, and more -- which exist thanks to CDA 230 -- to make safer, better decisions online,\" emailed an Internet Association spokesperson. \"CDA 230 is also the law that allows companies to moderate and delete content that everyone agrees has no place online without facing liability for making platforms a safer place for all.\"</p><p>\"CTA has always been a supporter of Section 230,\" said Jamie Susskind, vice president-policy and regulatory affairs, on a later panel. (See Notebook below in this report). The section helps small businesses that might lack money for content monitoring systems, and may have helped the U.S. get internet investment, Susskind said: \"Section 230 is a very essential protection\" for tech innovators.</p><p>DOJ + FTC = OK</p><p>Some may have the mistaken impression DOJ and the FTC divided up their reviews of aspects of tech by company, Delrahim suggested later in Q&amp;A with reporters. \"It's never company by company,\" he told us. \"It's conduct by conduct.\" He cited instances where the agencies reviewed different deals involving tech companies: \"If you look through history, you have largely the same process.\"</p><p>It's also not correct that there's much tension between the antitrust agencies, though some areas of differences have surfaced over many years, Delrahim told reporters. Some 99.9 percent of the time, DOJ and the FTC don't have such issues, he estimated: \"The differences between the two agencies have been going on for some time, going back decades. I don't think anything is new.\"</p><p>\"Both agencies have the good fortune of talented lawyers who are passionate about great cases and enforcing the law,\" said FTC Chairman Joe Simons in a statement Tuesday. \"I view each agency's eagerness to pursue the investigations as a positive.\"</p><p>Delrahim disagreed with some of Colorado AG Phil Weiser's earlier comments at TPI about politics possibly playing role at DOJ. \"I don't agree with it, and I think it's really dangerous when we start questioning, not that we shouldn't do proper oversight and checks and balances ... if you start questioning the motives, just for political gain, of institutions like the Justice Department,\" Delrahim said. \"It starts to be problematic\" if people believe what DOJ does may include political motives, he added. Moderator and CNBC anchor Brian Sullivan noted Weiser had said similar.</p><p>Colorado's Weiser recounted now that he told TPI Sunday of his worries about the department and the Affordable Care Act. \"My concern with the DOJ's conduct during the ACA litigation is that, instead of defending the law as required, it is making the highly questionable argument that the entire law is invalid based on the invalidity of a single provision,\" he emailed us. Some attendees said they took his remarks as criticizing Justice for being too politicized.</p><p>On advice to the audience of tech, telecom and media executives on what they and their lawyers should keep in mind when dealing with his department, Delrahim said to be forthright, generally reflecting what another Justice official told the conference last year (see 1808200056). Get data to DOJ that may be relevant as early as possible, Delrahim advised. \"We have no qualms about going to court to try to enforce our\" civil investigative demands, he continued. \"We're fully prepared to enforce our process to preserve the integrity of our investigation.\" He suggested looking at court documents on Sinclair's abandoned deal to buy Tribune. \"That complaint shows what not to do, if you are a merging party\" and dealing with DOJ's front office, he said. Sinclair had no comment.</p><p>TPI Notebook</p><p>Tech and content stakeholders differed, some along historic fault lines, about how easy it is for new, small entrants to get traction in the music market, including scoring wide distribution. At a TPI panel Tuesday (see page 6), RIAA CEO Mitch Glazier said \"the market will work.\" Jean Prewitt, CEO of the Independent Film &amp; Television Alliance, wasn't so sure, saying not to be distracted from this analysis by the next shiny object. There are hundreds of music services, Glazier noted. He pointed to Amazon's Alexa letting a user order by voice command various music services and bundles as \"a great example of differentiation.\" He identified \"a huge amount of competition\" in the U.S., with varied services often having similar music. \"There's a fierce competition for global markets both within big companies\" and local ones, he added. Distribution remains powerful, said Prewitt, as content producers need those \"pipelines.\" It's \"much more about who gets close to the consumer and in the winner-takes-all analogy, you sort of ignore the fact that consumers are famous from walking away from today's form of distribution. So I think the jury is really out on how this all plays out,\" she said. \"You make the best content you can\" is her suggested strategy. Entertainment Software Association Senior Counsel-Tech Policy Delara Derakhshani noted tech platforms are releasing transparency reports, and mentioned \"the importance of collaboration and cooperation\" in this sector. Prewitt said such disclosures, which can include information on IP/royalties, \"don't actually tell you how your product performed, which is what we really want.\" In industry self-regulation, Derakhshani said the videogame sector's Entertainment Software Rating Board is held up as a good example.</p><p>Current U.S. trade issues can affect startups and other companies, a TPI panel was told Tuesday (see page 7). With the current focus in Washington on China, \"what's important in terms of what's happening in Washington is our relationships with other countries,\" said BigID CEO Dimitri Sirota. \"We really see ourselves as an international company, even though we are only three years old.\" CTA continues to have concerns about the administration's duties on products from China, said Jamie Susskind, vice president-policy and regulatory affairs. She said about 600 of CTA's roughly 2,000 members are startups, and many levies taking effect in September and in December may affect consumer tech products: \"For us, the results are tangible and they are real.\" Though the association is \"sympathetic to what the administration is trying to do\" on China and its IP practices, \"we don't prefer to see tariffs imposed,\" which the group likens to taxes, Susskind continued. On privacy, CTA has concerns about California's law. \"Consumers have a right to know\" what data is being collected, but that state's law could \"hurt innovation,\" she said. \"We've been advocating for a federal framework. Our hope is that Congress will get it done.\" The association prefers \"a framework that isn't\" like the EU's general data protection regulation and lets companies \"use data in ways that provide benefits to consumers,\" she said.</p><p>Regulatory systems need to change because of artificial intelligence, including as applied to machine learning for financial-sector AI, an economics professor told TPI. \"The expertise has got to be there,\" said Stanford's Susan Athey. \"I think each regulatory agency is going to have to hire people\" with the appropriate expertise in this realm, she said. \"We have to change our regulatory structure to accommodate a world where firms\" can show what's an acceptable error rate, Athey said. \"The regulatory scheme has got to adapt\" to \"actually accept errors,\" she continued. \"You cannot be error-free. ... A machine learning model makes mistakes. You can't hide that it makes mistakes. You have to demonstrate the error rate.\" Athey spoke separately Monday from a panel where she and others said government faces challenges measuring tech's impact on the economy (see 1908190038).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONSED-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONSED2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WWD-RX31-DYRJ-10MS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">274795</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1968\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Consumer Electronics Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 21, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0009EZR</classCode><className>SPRINT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0008XKE</classCode><className>T-MOBILE INTERNATIONAL AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001ZF4</classCode><className>DISH NETWORK CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>BROOKINGS INSTITUTION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS443142 ELECTRONICS STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC4812 RADIOTELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS515210 CABLE &amp;

Meanwhile, Facebook'sannouncement[2]of a major buy reminded Washington that Big Tech plans to keep augmenting its power.What's happening: Today, the tech philanthropy group Omidyar Network is unveiling what authors call a \"roadmap[3]\" for an antitrust case against Google. Drawing on findings that U.K. competition regulators made public in December, the report argues that Google has used its products to shut out competing online advertisers from reaching its users and to cut off web publishers from the revenue generated by their content.The report's release comes on the heels of Friday's Wall Street Journal report[4], which said a DOJ suit against Google was \"likely\" as soon as this summer, to be followed by a likely parallel suit from a coalition of 50 states in the fall. </p><p>Such litigation, the product of concurrent investigations, would aim to demonstrate that Google has used its advertising business to harm competitors.Separately, Facebook announced[5] it was acquiring animated image repository Giphy. The $400 million transaction, first reported[6] by Axios, marks one of Big Tech's highest-profile deals since the pandemic reset the dynamics[7] of the industry's public image. What they're saying: \"[T]here is significant reason for concern that Google has violated U.S. antitrust law,\" write the report's authors, Omidyar's David Dinielli and Yale economics professor Fiona Scott Morton, who both served in the DOJ's antitrust division during the Obama administration. They argue that just looking at Google's percentage of the display and video ad markets may vastly understate the actual power it wields there, thanks to the ubiquity and dominance in digital video of Google-owned YouTube.\"[I]n the digital advertising market, virtually all roads lead through Google,\" they write. \"Using the insurmountable data advantage it derives from its search engine and other properties as well as contract and design choices, Google has made it nearly impossible for publishers and advertisers to do business with each other except through Google.\"Public Knowledge's Gene Kimmelman and Charlotte Slaiman, former federal antitrust attorneys, also contributed to the report. The other side: Google has long denied engaging in anti-competitive behavior, noting in a blog post[8] last year that the ad tech sector is \"famously crowded\" and that the average online advertiser uses three to four platforms to reach users. Google also sought to rebut some of the U.K. findings underpinning today's report in a recent filing[9].Meanwhile, Facebook's purchase of Giphy could raise antitrust questions for the social network at a time when it is already under intense scrutiny. The Federal Trade Commission is already in the process[10] of reviewing similar deals dating back to 2010.While sources familiar with the deal say it is not subject to mandatory federal review, regulators could investigate it anyway, given the spotlight on the company's data collection practices and privacy record. 'Just like Google purchased DoubleClick because of its widespread presence on the internet and ability to collect data, Facebook wants Giphy so it can collect even more data on us,\" GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, a frequent Big Tech critic, said in a statement.\"Facebook shouldn't be acquiring any companies while it is under antitrust investigation for its past purchases.\" Context: Litigating an antitrust case against any major tech firm is a major undertaking, and the government's past efforts \u2014 suits against IBM and Microsoft \u2014 have been lengthy, inconclusive affairs. The bottom line: As companies edge back toward business as usual and revive their merger pipeline in a friendlier public atmosphere than they enjoyed before the pandemic hit, each step they take will test regulators' appetite for challenging them.Go deeper: Facebook's Giphy acquisition invites antitrust attention[11] [ 1]: <url

I think the only way forward here is in the legislative branch. These are hard decisions. They're contentious. But if as a society, we're going say, 'We're not going allow the kind of power that Facebook has accumulated. That's not the society we want to live in,' the only way to address that is for citizens to push their elected representatives to pass laws that stop the behavior that they don't want to live with.\"</p><p>28:57-30:36 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://youtu.be/XSSGaQ9xwd8?t=1737\">https://youtu.be/XSSGaQ9xwd8?t=1737</url>)</p><p>Timothy Wu: \"And then Facebook just kept buying its most dangerous competitors.

That's a ton of document gathering and sending, and if anyone has gotten a bill from a corporate law firm, that's not cheap,\" said Jessica Melugin, associate director of the Center for Technology and Innovation at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department, nearly all 50 states, and Congress have launched investigations into possible antitrust violations by Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple. The investigations focus on varying aspects of each company's business models, but all hinge on whether Silicon Valley's most prominent players have stifled competition and harmed consumers.</p><p>The investigations are the latest crusade against big tech, as the collective group is sometimes called, which has become a favored target of Republicans and Democrats alike who are concerned the companies have engaged in monopolistic practices as they have grown in size and dominance.</p><p>\"The states have joined the federal government in being concerned about the power that tech companies have, a power that seems to be intruding into our daily lives more and more with each passing day,\" said Michael Carrier, a law professor at Rutgers University and leading authority on antitrust law.</p><p>The various investigations are all proceeding concurrently, though details have been kept primarily under wraps.</p><p>For Amazon, the scrutiny could focus on numerous acquisitions and whether the e-commerce giant gives preference to its products at the expense of those from outside sellers, while Apple may be under fire for its power over the App Store.</p><p>The focuses of the investigations involving Google and Facebook, meanwhile, could be numerous. For Facebook, they could include its data collection practices and history of acquiring companies that could threaten its dominance, while Google's trouble may relate to its search function and advertising business.</p><p>Carrier said any action from the federal government would have \"a significant effect,\" but the multiple state efforts \"could play an important backstop role.\"</p><p>\"If the states believe the federal government is not being as aggressive as it should be, they can act to fill the gap,\" he said.</p><p>Casting a shadow over the investigations is the question of how far antitrust laws reach and whether they amount to more than fishing expeditions that could ensnare the country's biggest firms, tying them up with unnecessary litigation for months or even years.</p><p>\"The U.S. standard for antitrust is consumer harm,\" Melugin said. \"You can find a lot of people who say, 'It gives me a weird feeling that they're so big. It makes me uncomfortable they have this data about me.' But that doesn't quite rise to the level of consumer harm.\"</p><p>A red flag, she added, is that many supporters of the investigations are calling for expanding antitrust laws that would bolster the case against Silicon Valley's largest companies. </p><p>Doug Gansler, the former attorney general of Maryland who is now in private practice, noted Google and Facebook are both free to use, which throws a wrench in determining whether consumers face higher prices as the companies have grown.</p><p>\"Facebook has 2.4 billion people using it [monthly], and every single one of them is using it for free,\" he said. \"I don't know the answer, but the question is going to have to be broached at some point: Yes, they're a big company, yes, people like their service. How is that damaging to any consumer?\"</p><p>To chip away at the dominance of the tech companies, some lawmakers have called for Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple to be broken up, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democratic presidential front-runner, leading the charge.</p><p>While the investigations into the tech companies can provide the vehicle for breaking up big tech, it's a penalty that can only be pursued by the federal government, experts say.</p><p>\"States,\" Melugin said, \"certainly have all the right to do antitrust enforcement, but when you're talking about states investigating corporations that have very little or any corporate presence in the state, it gets more tenuous.\"</p><p>\"Citizens of this state are using these products. OK, but that doesn't translate into now in Missouri, I can break up Google in Menlo Park,\" she said.</p><p>In addition to breaking up the big firms, penalties could also include unwinding mergers, such as Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>\"There could be more behavioral remedies that would change the ways the companies do business, ranging from forcing the companies to share data to tinkering with their algorithms,\" Carrier said.</p><p>A total of 47 attorneys general, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, have signed on to an antitrust investigation into Facebook, while 50 attorneys general are investigating Google in an investigation spearheaded by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.</p><p>Gansler said state attorneys general have taken up the mantle in recent years with investigating the private sector because \"there's a perception right now that the federal government is engaged in less regulation and enforcement.\"</p><p>\"They truly believe that states are laboratories of democracy, and states are much more nimble and able to coordinate with each other and bring a case more quickly and with more consensus than the federal government,\" he said. </p><p>Although some view the president and his policies as friendly to big businesses, the Trump administration has not been shy about blocking significant mergers and acquisitions.</p><p>The Justice Department sought to block AT&amp;T's $85.4 billion merger with Time Warner and blocked Broadcom's merger with Qualcomm over national security concerns. </p><p>There are a host of state antitrust laws similar to those at the federal level that can be raised in a potential case brought against big tech, but Gansler said public statements from the state attorneys general indicate they may be \"attempting to go at back-door privacy issues that they have with these companies by using antitrust laws.\"</p><p>The Justice Department has made the case that antitrust violations could extend beyond price increases.</p><p>\"Price effects alone do not provide a complete picture of market dynamics,\" Makan Delrahim, who helms the agency's antitrust division, said in June. \"Diminished quality is also a type of harm to competition. As an example, privacy can be an important dimension of quality. By protecting competition, we can have an impact on privacy and data protection.\"</p><p>But Melugin noted that there are rules under the FTC's jurisdiction dealing specifically with privacy that should not get entangled with antitrust laws.</p><p>\"These are not new concepts, but they're not antitrust,\" she said. \"What is antitrust? It's consumer harm in the form of higher prices, less output.\"</p><p>While the states may not have the same power behind them that federal regulators do, they do have strength in numbers.</p><p>\"The federal remedies are more serious in the end, but the immediate problem is now you're having to dance like a monkey for 50 state attorneys general, and that's a huge diversion of time, resources, and energy where I would prefer to see these companies focused on making the next great innovation for consumers,\" Melugin said. \"Now they're having to lawyer up for 50 different regimes.\"</p><p>Most of the states are likely to try to extract money out of the tech firms in the form of fines, but whether they are successful again depends on whether regulators can show their expanded dominance hurt consumers.</p><p>\"Whether or not that money goes back to any consumers that would theoretically have to be harmed by free tech products, it's difficult to see it playing out,\" Melugin said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2314515027</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XH9-PVN1-DY0W-44KB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1324\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

It then considers reinvigorated antitrust enforcement as an example of a federal policy that would strengthen local economies while benefiting from policy feedback effects.</p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The last 40 years have seen a dramatic widening of economic disparities between regions of the United States. A handful of rich coastal metros have seen their incomes grow substantially, while large regions of the country struggle with unemployment and stagnation. This regional inequality is uniquely consequential for U.S. politics because political power is distributed geographically, meaning that unlike other social groups, struggling places are guaranteed to keep their representation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this article, I argue that rising regional inequality should be thought of first and foremost as a consequence of national economic policy\u2014that is, it stems from political decisions made at the federal level. In addition to being an accurate reflection of the forces that have buffeted many parts of the United States since 1980, this framing will help to generate the political will to address regional divergence, particularly from within struggling regions themselves.</p><p>Second, I explore the policy feedback dynamics in one national policy area with important regional implications: antitrust enforcement. There is a growing movement to strengthen antitrust policy in light of rapid corporate consolidation in recent years. Here I describe why antitrust enforcement has important implications for regional economies and how a new antitrust regime could benefit from policy feedback effects that would help to entrench and expand its impact once established. I also highlight some advantages that may make antitrust enforcement easier to enact than other federal regional development policies, as well as some strategic considerations in the initial enactment.</p><h>The Geographic Concentration of Prosperity</h><p>One of the most wrenching social and economic shifts to hit the United States over the past 40 years has been the geographic concentration of prosperity. Since 1980, the income gap between the richest and poorest regions of the country has widened by 50 percent, a reversal of more than 100 years of economic convergence (Ganong and Shoag 2017). A handful of metro areas have seen concentrations of wealth almost unprecedented in human history, while a much larger set has seen their jobs evaporate and their economic bases contract. In addition to the direct economic pain this causes, it likely contributes to family instability (Autor, Dorn, and Hanson 2017; Wilson 1996), diminished mobility prospects for children (Sharkey 2013; Sharkey and Faber 2014), and declining social and political cohesion (Beramendi 2012).</p><p>The size of the change is shown in Figure 1, which plots mean family income by commuting zone (a definition of metro area comprising a central city and surrounding suburban counties) as a fraction of the national mean family income in 1980 and 2013. In 1980, the picture is one of relative consistency across most of the country. New York (specifically the New Jersey suburbs) and Washington, D.C., stand out as cities with mean incomes more than 20 percent higher than the nation as a whole, while rural parts of the Southeast and Southwest had incomes substantially lower than average. Across the rest of the country, average incomes fell into a tight band between 80 percent and 120 percent of the national mean.</p><h>Figure 1</h><p>Commuting Zone Mean Family Income as a Fraction of the National Average, 1980 and 2013</p><p>SOURCE: Reproduced from Manduca (2019).</p><p>By 2013, this was no longer true. Most of the East Coast had joined New York and D.C. in the highest income category, as had northern California and Minneapolis-St. Paul. At the same time, rural economies across the country had hollowed out, with most rural parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Midwest, and California joining those in the Southeast and Southwest in the bottom income category. In total, whereas just 12 percent of the U.S. population in 1980 lived in commuting zones with mean family incomes more than 20 percent higher or lower than the national average, by 2013 the share had climbed to 31 percent.</p><h>The unique political consequences of inequality between regions</h><p>Inequality between places is uniquely consequential for U.S. politics because declining areas retain their political representation. No matter how much a state\u2019s population shrinks, it keeps its two Senate seats. And while House districts are redrawn every 10 years, they are drawn based on residential, not voting, population. Because voting is strongly correlated with income (Leighley and Nagler 2013), this means that poor places maintain a political voice that poor people as individuals often do not. For example, in 2018 just 175,000 voters participated in the contested election for WV-03, a district with a median income of $36,000. This is fewer than half of the 370,000 votes cast in MO-02, another close election, but one held in a district with a median income of $79,000 (Golshan and Mark 2018). Yet both districts have equal representation in Congress. This means that the federal government is structurally predisposed to address the concerns of districts like WV-03 out of proportion to either their financial resources or political mobilization.</p><p>The geographical apportionment of representation should lead the federal government to spend disproportionate effort addressing the challenges facing struggling regions, all else equal. But such action has been largely absent. In part, this is because local economic performance is not typically discussed as a national political issue, but rather as the responsibility of local governments and civic leaders. This article argues that local economic performance should be treated as a national issue on both empirical and political grounds.</p><h>Local Economic Performance Is a National Political Issue</h><p>At first glance, it is not necessarily apparent that the economic performance of local regions should be thought of as a national issue. Just as an individual\u2019s economic success in the United States is often attributed primarily to his or her personal actions and character traits, so regional economic success is frequently described as stemming predominantly from local actions. Conversely, regional economic difficulties are often attributed to local failings.</p><p>This \u201clocal responsibility\u201d view of regional economic development pervades much of the writing, both academic and popular, that examines the plight of struggling regions. Popular writers have profiled successful regions in the hope that other places can adopt the strategies they have taken (Fallows and Fallows 2018). Academic researchers, too, have sought to identify the local characteristics that predict economic success, using both case studies (Saxenian 1996; Storper et al. 2015) and large-sample quantitative analyses (Benner and Pastor 2012; Kemeny and Storper 2012). Some findings of this literature have emphasized the importance of developing tightly knit \u201cclusters\u201d of interrelated industries (Porter 1998). Other studies have encouraged regions to develop urban amenities that can attract the highly skilled workers who currently command high wages (Clark et al. 2002; Florida 2002; Glaeser, Kolko, and Saiz 2001), while a third set has highlighted the role of interconnected leadership networks that allow diverse groups of local stakeholders to jointly solve local problems (Benner and Pastor 2015; Storper et al. 2015).</p><p>These recommendations are typically aimed at local policy-makers, suggesting actions that can be undertaken independently by individual regions. There are good reasons for this approach: in the absence of a concerted national effort, individual places can only control what goes on within their borders, and some places have been remarkably effective at navigating the twenty-first-century economy. But as a diagnosis of why so many places are currently struggling, and as a proposal for fixing this problem at scale, the local responsibility view is incorrect empirically and misguided politically.</p><h>Empirics: Regional disparities largely result from national trends</h><p>The local responsibility view of regional economic development, and the associated focus on restoring prosperity by improving local competitiveness, fundamentally misunderstands the changes that have caused regional disparities to increase. There has always been a vigorous economic competition between cities in the United States\u2014nineteenth-century civic boosters make that abundantly clear. But for more than 100 years up to the 1970s, poor regions still gained on rich ones on average (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1992). Starting in the late 1970s, some aspect of the competition changed, and rich regions began pulling further ahead. The core question about regional divergence, then, is not why some regions do better than others economically. It is why the gap between winners and losers suddenly started increasing in the late 1970s.</p><p>Much of the research studying this reversal has attributed it to a change in the spatial distribution of different types of workers. Starting around 1980, college-educated workers in particular began to cluster in a relatively small number of cities (Moretti 2012). Possible explanations for this concentration include the rise of industries with strong economies of agglomeration (Diamond 2016; Kemeny and Storper 2012), the increasing importance of urban amenities to high-income workers (Clark et al. 2002; Florida 2002; Glaeser, Kolko, and Saiz 2001), or the implementation of increasingly restrictive zoning and occupational licensing laws that make it more difficult for people to move to prosperous areas (Schleicher 2017; Ganong and Shoag 2017). In line with these findings, the most prominent policy proposals to reverse regional divergence have focused on undoing this sorting and spatially redistributing high-paying jobs and skilled workers back to struggling areas. Some would do this by subsidizing employment in struggling regions (Austin, Glaeser, and Summers 2018), while others would make it easier for lower-income workers to move to thriving metros (Avent 2011; Yglesias 2012), or directly relocate institutions and government agencies away from coastal metros (MacGillis 2010; Yglesias 2016).</p><p>These policies are unlikely to have success on their own because they misunderstand the core driver of regional economic divergence. While there has indeed been a spatial concentration of college educated workers, and a sorting of people across metro areas by income, its contribution to divergence is relatively small. A more important factor has been rising income inequality at the national level. If there had been no income sorting whatsoever, rising income inequality alone would still have increased the economic disparities between regions by more than half as much as actually occurred. But if income inequality had been kept constant, the observed amount of sorting would have only increased disparities between regions by about a quarter of the true amount (Manduca 2019). The widening gap between rich and poor regions is thus first and foremost a reflection of the widening gap between rich and poor people. And while the causes of rising inequality are hotly debated, they almost certainly include many changes to national economic policy made beginning in the 1970s and 1980s (Hacker and Pierson 2010).</p><p>Thus, purely as a matter of policy, reinvigorating the economies of struggling regions and reducing the gaps between rich and poor places are likely to require national action. Framing regional divergence as a national policy decision rather than a matter of local responsibility is also more likely to generate the political will needed to address it.</p><h>Political consequences of treating regional divergence as a national policy issue</h><p>In addition to being empirically accurate, framing regional disparities as the consequence and responsibility of federal economic policy rather than local failings is likely to be a potent political message. Rather than telling rural or rust belt voters that their hometown economic struggles are their fault and that their cities need to \u201cshrink to greatness\u201d (Glaeser 2010), this approach would rightly attribute economic difficulties to national policy changes made largely outside their control. It is far less condescending, more likely to match voters\u2019 lived experiences, and gives a clear direction for action: updating national economic policy to meet the needs of the regions it has left behind (Glastris 2019).</p><p>As commentators (e.g., Catte 2019; Kelloway 2019) have noted, while rural and rust belt areas are often viewed as conservative, that hides a strong strain of economic populism (Levitz 2019). Individual progressive economic policies can do very well in red states: Missouri decisively rejected a right to work referendum in 2018, just as Oklahoma rejected a so-called right to farm referendum in 2016. A platform of economic populism that explicitly draws the line between national economic policy and local economic struggles would likely be compelling to voters in these areas.</p><p>Addressing regional divergence with national policy is a promising strategy as a matter of both policy and politics. The remainder of this article considers one possible national policy with important regional effects: reinvigorated antitrust enforcement. It outlines how the lack of effective antitrust enforcement has contributed to regional divergence, how a renewed antitrust movement might build on itself through policy feedback effects, and how advocates of a new antitrust regime might design it to maximize its chance of success.</p><h>Antitrust Enforcement as Federal Regional Convergence Policy</h><p>An increasing number of scholars and policy-makers recognize that many American companies have gotten too big (Wu 2018). In industry after industry, the major players have consolidated until only a handful of firms control the large majority of the market. Some conglomerates, most infamously Amazon, have attained dominant positions in multiple markets simultaneously and adeptly use their position in one market as leverage over competitors in another (Khan 2017).</p><p>The result of this consolidation has been a rise in economic inequality. At the most fundamental level, when a firm acquires a competitor, it reduces the number of alternatives available to its employees, customers, and suppliers, increasing its power over anyone who interacts with it (Emerson 1962; Coleman 1982). As a result, firms in concentrated markets are able to hold down wages (Wilmers 2018; Azar et al. 2018). This is a core reason that the share of national income going to labor has declined by 6 percentage points since 1980 (Autor et al. 2017; Barkai 2016).</p><p>The negative consequences of market concentration for regional economies can be especially severe (Salerno 2017). The waves of corporate consolidation over the past four decades have deprived many cities and towns of the corporate headquarters and local businesses that used to be a source of high-paying jobs and demand for professional business services (Longman 2015). The loss of these jobs is amplified by economic multipliers: the local spending of each accountant or lawyer may support two or three restauranteurs or gas station attendants. Beyond strictly economic effects, local business owners are often a key source of charitable donations and civic leadership, roles that absentee owners do not continue at the same levels (Brunell 2006). More broadly, local business ownership is a strong predictor of community and civic health on a number of indicators (Tolbert et al. 2002; Tolbert, Lyson, and Irwin 1998).</p><p>For rural areas, often dominated by a small number of employers or industries, the consequences of consolidation have been particularly devastating. Consider the case of agriculture. In the 1980s, 37 percent of every dollar consumers spent on food ended up with the farmer who produced it. Today, the farmer receives less than 15 percent (Kelloway 2019). Taking economic multipliers into account\u2014agriculture often forms the economic base of rural areas\u2014that change alone can plausibly account for a substantial portion of rural America\u2019s struggles. It has come largely because of consolidation among both farmers\u2019 suppliers and their customers. Where there used to be dozens of seed companies, now there are just three (Charles 2016). Prices for seed have risen accordingly. And where there were once many buyers for farm products, now there are just a handful: in meatpacking, for instance, four companies control 85 percent of the market for beef (Leonard 2014). This consolidation was a direct result of changes to the interpretation of antitrust law, and it could be reversed through updated policy.</p><p>Agriculture is just one sector where the results of consolidation have been especially pernicious for regional economies. Another example is air travel, which has been felt most noticeably by midsize cities. The number of major airlines has fallen steadily since deregulation in the 1970s, from more than twenty to just four as of this writing. As a result of consolidation, air service has become more concentrated in major cities, with connectivity to small and midsize airports dropping substantially since 2007 (Wittman and Swelbar 2014). The lack of convenient air service is a major constraint on cities\u2019 economic competitiveness and is often cited as a reason that corporate headquarters leave smaller cities and towns (Longman and Khan 2012).</p><p>The lack of effective antitrust enforcement over the past 40 years has been a major contributor to economic stagnation in many parts of the country, and a reinvigorated approach to enforcement offers a promising route to help restore prosperity across the country. If implemented carefully, with attention to potential policy feedbacks, a renewed antitrust movement could maintain and expand itself over time.</p><h>Policy Feedback Considerations in the Development of New Antitrust Policy</h><p>There are several features of antitrust enforcement as a political issue that make it a particularly promising federal regional development policy. These features occur with respect to all of the \u201cthree E\u2019s\u201d that Jacob Hacker mentions in his article in this issue (Hacker, this volume). Its bipartisan appeal to voters, potential to attract business support, and logistical ease of enactment make the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">establishment</emphasis> of a reinvigorated antitrust regime likely to be easier than many other regional development policies. Once established, initial successful antitrust actions are likely to change the politics of the issue in ways that make its <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">entrenchment</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">expansion</emphasis> more likely. Here I briefly describe these attractive features and potential for policy feedbacks, along with certain strategic recommendations related to sequencing and the use of federalism in the initial establishment phase.</p><p>Note that two types of regulatory action form the core of the antitrust toolkit. One is to block proposed mergers, preventing new monopolies from being created. The second is to break up currently existing companies with excess market power into their component parts. Both types of enforcement would benefit from the promising political considerations facilitating the establishment of a renewed antitrust movement. But many of the most promising feedback effects related to the entrenchment and expansion of such a movement will be felt most strongly with the successful breakups of currently existing firms. For this reason, a revitalized antitrust movement should strongly consider pursuing such breakups whenever possible, even though regulators have been hesitant to pursue them in the past (Wu 2018).</p><h>Features of antitrust enforcement that make its establishment more likely</h><p>Among possible federal regional development policies, reinvigorated antitrust enforcement stands out in several ways that make its establishment as a policy more likely. First, it is salient and familiar to voters. Most voters have encountered monopolies in their daily lives, whether they be airlines, utilities, internet providers, or tech platforms. Almost everyone has had a negative experience with a company too large or omnipresent to avoid in the future. Breaking such companies up offers a response to angry customers who would otherwise not have any way to express their frustration.</p><p>Moreover, aggressive antitrust enforcement has a long history in the United States, and it was widely practiced within the lifetimes of many voters. It has been a stated principle of capitalist economics since Adam Smith (Smith 1827), albeit one that has often been honored in the breach. In the United States specifically, antitrust enforcement fits with a longstanding American skepticism toward \u201cbigness\u201d (Lemann 2016; Rosen 2016). Perhaps for these reasons, the current antitrust movement has managed to find support among both liberals and conservatives. A poll conducted in September 2018, for instance, found that 65 percent of Americans\u2014and 54 percent of Trump voters\u2014think the government \u201cshould do more to break up corporate monopolies\u201d (Dayen 2018). And leading proponents of antitrust enforcement in Congress and the media are found on both sides of the aisle (Crane 2018).</p><p>Perhaps more important than its broad appeal among voters, antitrust enforcement has the potential to attract support, or at least avoid opposition, from a wide range of organized interest groups. Of particular note is the potential for corporate ambivalence on this issue. Unlike many progressive economic policies, many companies\u2014including quite powerful ones\u2014stand to benefit from a reinvigorated antitrust regime. Yelp, for instance, has been a major critic of Google\u2019s abuse of its search monopoly for several years (Dougherty 2017). When AT&amp;T attempted to acquire T-Mobile in 2010, some of the most vocal opposition came from competitor Sprint (Singel 2011), though that did not stop Sprint from initiating its own bid for T-Mobile recently. Even Walmart, the largest retailer in the country, recently joined with other brick and mortar retailers to call on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to examine \u201cpersistent oligopolies in other parts of the retail system,\u201d specifically singling out the market power of Amazon and Google (Dodge 2019). Companies like these could potentially become strong supporters of specific antitrust enforcement actions or a new antitrust movement in general.</p><p>This potential to attract corporate support is a key advantage of antitrust enforcement as a regional development policy. A major question will be whether proponents of the new enforcement regime will be able to secure support, or at least neutrality, from overarching corporate lobbying organizations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. As I discuss, choosing initial enforcement targets to maximize the possibility of such support or neutrality is a strategic imperative for the new antitrust movement.</p><p>A third advantage of antitrust enforcement relative to many potential federal redevelopment policies is the comparative ease with which it could be enacted. For the most part, the current antitrust movement is calling for better enforcement of laws already on the books, by agencies that already exist. This means that large parts of the policy could be implemented without creating new government entities or requiring large increases in federal spending, and perhaps even without new legislation.</p><p>These three features of reinvigorated antitrust enforcement\u2014its widespread support among voters, potential for ambivalence from corporations, and legislative ease of enactment\u2014suggest that it may be easier to establish than many other federal regional development policies. Should initial enforcement actions be successful, they are also likely to entrench the policy and lay the groundwork for further expansion.</p><h>Entrenchment and expansion: The finality of breaking up companies</h><p>Should initial enforcement actions succeed\u2014and specifically should existing oligopolistic companies be broken apart\u2014they are likely to alter the political landscape in ways that entrench the new antitrust regime and promote future regional development efforts in general.</p><p>When a company is successfully split apart, it no longer exists as an independent entity capable of political action. That in itself may remove the single biggest source of potential backlash to a given enforcement action\u2014as Patashnik describes in his contribution to this issue, sometimes the most effective way to reduce backlash is to fragment the organizations most likely to mobilize such backlash (Patashnik, this volume).</p><p>The entrenchment effects of breaking up existing monopolies extend beyond their particular enforcement action. Monopoly rents are a key source of political donations, either from the companies themselves or from the individuals who own them (Skocpol and Williamson 2012). Reducing those rents through increased competition will thus decrease the money available to fund future anti-enforcement lobbying.</p><p>Beyond reducing the availability of monopoly rents to fund future advocacy, successful enforcement actions may reduce the political clout of targeted industries by changing the number and nature of corporate players. In the case where one company is split horizontally into several competitors, this would occur by increasing the total number of actors that need to be coordinated for industry-wide lobbying, which is likely to make such coordination more difficult. In the case where a company is split vertically into firms that each occupy different stages in the chain of production, the successor firms may have policy interests that directly conflict. Amazon the online market platform and its client Amazon the bookseller are likely to have a tense relationship and might end up on opposite sides of debates about Internet policy.</p><p>A particularly promising dynamic, which is plausible though by no means guaranteed, would be if the successor companies created by one round of trustbusting become agitators for the next round. Firms in some cases pursue mergers and acquisitions defensively in response to observed or anticipated consolidation in their own or related industries (Gorton, Kahl, and Rosen 2009; Ahern and Harford 2014). This process can lead to vertical or horizontal merger waves where all tiers of an industry\u2019s supply chain quickly consolidate. If some of these mergers were undone, the resulting smaller companies might push for further antitrust enforcement up or down their supply chain to even the playing field once more. That could create a virtuous cycle in which the successor companies from one enforcement action lobby for the next action.</p><p>Should a more assertive antitrust regime become established, it is quite possible that it will induce beneficial feedback effects that could entrench and expand it relatively quickly. It is important to note that many of these feedback effects would stem from the changes to the marketplace and political arena that result from breaking up firms that are currently consolidated vertically or horizontally into their component pieces. This dynamic suggests that proponents of the new enforcement regime would be wise to push for the full breakup of consolidated companies rather than simply imposing fines or attempting to regulate them through consent decrees. A powerful firm that has just been hit with a major fine is likely to redouble its efforts at political influence; a firm that is split in two will likely find that its successor companies have both less total power and conflicting goals.</p><h>Strategic Considerations in Establishing a Reinvigorated Antitrust Regime</h><p>Despite the many features that make antitrust enforcement a promising candidate for establishment, it is important that advocates pursue the issue carefully and strategically. Here I briefly discuss some strategic considerations related to the initial establishment of a reinvigorated antitrust regime. These recommendations include embracing the political nature of antitrust enforcement, thinking carefully about the sequencing of enforcement actions, and taking advantage of federalism to force progress at the state level if federal regulators continue with a lax approach.</p><h>Embrace the political nature of antitrust</h><p>Antitrust policy is fundamentally a political issue. It centers on questions about resource distribution and power that are at the core of any political system. This means that any attempts to remove it from public debate and treat it as a purely technical question are likely to fail: entrenched interests will continue to correctly see it is as vitally important to their interests, and without a countermobilization bureaucrats will almost certainly succumb to their lobbying.</p><p>Rather than searching for an illusory econometric magic bullet, supporters of stronger antitrust enforcement should fully embrace its political nature. This means building an antitrust movement that mobilizes a large number of people, uses high-visibility platforms to describe the problems of consolidation\u2014and even the specific harms caused by specific companies\u2014and pressures public figures, both elected and unelected, to take clear stances in favor of competition. Antitrust is an issue with great power to energize everyday consumers and voters, and that power should be utilized.</p><p>A corollary to the political nature of antitrust is that, as with other political issues, fighting for greater enforcement and campaigning against predatory companies may result in political progress even in instances where the immediate objective is defeated. Just as an initial electoral loss can lay the groundwork for future victories, so each attempt to fight a merger or break up a monopoly moves the national conversation forward, generates awareness of the harms of consolidation, and makes further merger attempts appear more costly to businesses.</p><h>Careful sequencing to build momentum</h><p>Because a new antitrust enforcement regime is likely to face substantial pushback from entrenched interests, the initial targets for enforcement actions should be carefully chosen for political as well as legal viability. Enforcers should aim to set precedent and build momentum by choosing targets for enforcement that are in politically precarious positions and that offer the possibility of dividing corporate lobbies.</p><p>Companies that are already distrusted by consumers and politicians are in a politically weak state that may make them easier targets for initial enforcement. Facebook offers a potentially useful example. It is increasingly disliked by consumers after a multitude of hacking, fake news, and privacy scandals (Liao 2018). At the same time, it is distrusted by conservative politicians for its perceived liberal bias. This weak position means that government intervention to protect Facebook\u2019s customers may face less skepticism than similar action against a more popular company\u2014the need for some sort of corrective action is widely apparent. Equally important, while industry lobbying groups might be concerned about the implications of a successful dismantling of Facebook, they may hesitate to face the political consequences of aligning themselves with an unpopular company.</p><p>As described above, an important feature of antitrust enforcement is that many companies stand to benefit from it alongside consumers and workers. Antitrust advocates would do well to choose initial enforcement targets that maximize the chance of gaining support from other corporations and keeping industry- or economy-wide business lobbying groups on the sidelines. The most promising cases will be ones that have relatively powerful interests on both sides, such as Walmart and Amazon, mentioned above, or Google and News Corp, who recently squared off in Australia (Meade 2018).</p><p>By picking initial targets that are politically weak or have strong corporate opponents, antitrust enforcers will be more likely to win their initial cases in the courts of law and public opinion. Once some initial victories are achieved, further enforcement actions can build on their precedent and benefit from the more favorable political landscape.</p><h>Federalism and the advantageous position of state attorneys general</h><p>A third strategic consideration concerns the level of government at which to pursue establishment of a new antitrust regime. Ideally, aggressive enforcement should be pursued concurrently wherever possible, be that through the FTC, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Congress, or the states. However, action may not always be possible at the federal level, and in recent years the FTC and DOJ have generally looked favorably on mergers (Tepper 2019). Thus, it may be advantageous to initially pursue enforcement at the state level. A number of state attorneys general (AGs) have already begun investigations into Google and Facebook (Romm 2019), and ten state AGs recently sued to block the proposed merger between T-Mobile and Sprint (Harding McGill 2019).</p><p>Besides the possibility of short-term action, state AGs have a number of advantages as antitrust enforcers. The most important of these is that in most states they are elected politicians. This means that they are well equipped to treat antitrust as a political issue\u2014they have more reason than career bureaucrats to consider the political optics of particular stances and are more likely to be adept at communicating with the media and the public. They also stand to see personal electoral benefits from popular enforcement actions and are directly susceptible to pressure from organized advocates. State AGs thus occupy a unique position. Unlike federal enforcers at the DOJ or FTC, they are elected politicians who know how to mobilize voters and can be directly pressured to adopt procompetition stances. But unlike members of Congress, they have direct enforcement power.</p><p>A state-level strategy also offers the possibility of building enforcement momentum piecemeal. It may prove easier for antitrust advocates to secure the support of a handful of AGs, perhaps from states that are especially harmed by a particular conglomerate or potential merger, than to convince the FTC or DOJ to reverse several decades of harmful policies. As a suit progresses, other states or federal agencies may join in.</p><h>Conclusion: National Action for a National Problem</h><p>This article has considered the problem of economic divergence between regions of the United States. Over the past four decades, the United States has bifurcated economically, with increasing fractions of the population living in both exceptionally poor and exceptionally rich places. Many of the biggest challenges facing the country are intricately tied to this bifurcation, including the basic question of whether national political cohesion can be maintained. Here I have argued that the growing economic disparities among regions of the United States should be treated first and foremost as a national policy issue. This view is accurate because it takes into account the changes that have pulled regions apart, and it is valuable because it offers pathways to political action that might address the problem.</p><p>As an example of a national policy with important effects on regional economies, I have considered antitrust enforcement. Though difficult to quantify directly, the lax antitrust enforcement of the past few decades has likely contributed to the economic struggles of many cities and towns nationwide. A reinvigorated antitrust movement would thus likely disproportionately benefit those parts of the country that have been left behind. In addition to having unique characteristics that make its establishment more likely in this era of polarization and negative partisanship, antitrust offers the possibility of beneficial feedback effects that may make it easier to entrench and expand.</p><p>Antitrust is just one of many areas in which national policy shifts starting in the 1970s and 1980s exacerbated economic gaps among regions. Other policy areas include the devolution of welfare program administration from the federal government to the states (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose and Gill 2004); the relaxing of financial and telecommunications regulations; and the end of federal revenue sharing with state and local governments, which led to a dramatic increase in the fiscal stakes of regional economic competition (Pacewicz 2016). Policy-makers seeking to address regional disparities today would do well to remember the role federal action had in creating those disparities and to recognize its potential for reducing them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><h>REFERENCES</h><p>Ahern Kenneth R., Harford Jarrad,  . 2014.

A handful of rich coastal metros have seen their incomes grow substantially, while large regions of the country struggle with unemployment and stagnation. This regional inequality is uniquely consequential for U.S. politics because political power is distributed geographically, meaning that unlike other social groups, struggling places are guaranteed to keep their representation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this article, I argue that rising regional inequality should be thought of first and foremost as a consequence of national economic policy\u2014that is, it stems from political decisions made at the federal level. In addition to being an accurate reflection of the forces that have buffeted many parts of the United States since 1980, this framing will help to generate the political will to address regional divergence, particularly from within struggling regions themselves.</p><p>Second, I explore the policy feedback dynamics in one national policy area with important regional implications: antitrust enforcement. There is a growing movement to strengthen antitrust policy in light of rapid corporate consolidation in recent years. Here I describe why antitrust enforcement has important implications for regional economies and how a new antitrust regime could benefit from policy feedback effects that would help to entrench and expand its impact once established. I also highlight some advantages that may make antitrust enforcement easier to enact than other federal regional development policies, as well as some strategic considerations in the initial enactment.</p><h>The Geographic Concentration of Prosperity</h><p>One of the most wrenching social and economic shifts to hit the United States over the past 40 years has been the geographic concentration of prosperity. Since 1980, the income gap between the richest and poorest regions of the country has widened by 50 percent, a reversal of more than 100 years of economic convergence (Ganong and Shoag 2017). A handful of metro areas have seen concentrations of wealth almost unprecedented in human history, while a much larger set has seen their jobs evaporate and their economic bases contract. In addition to the direct economic pain this causes, it likely contributes to family instability (Autor, Dorn, and Hanson 2017; Wilson 1996), diminished mobility prospects for children (Sharkey 2013; Sharkey and Faber 2014), and declining social and political cohesion (Beramendi 2012).</p><p>The size of the change is shown in Figure 1, which plots mean family income by commuting zone (a definition of metro area comprising a central city and surrounding suburban counties) as a fraction of the national mean family income in 1980 and 2013. In 1980, the picture is one of relative consistency across most of the country. New York (specifically the New Jersey suburbs) and Washington, D.C., stand out as cities with mean incomes more than 20 percent higher than the nation as a whole, while rural parts of the Southeast and Southwest had incomes substantially lower than average. Across the rest of the country, average incomes fell into a tight band between 80 percent and 120 percent of the national mean.</p><h>Figure 1</h><p>Commuting Zone Mean Family Income as a Fraction of the National Average, 1980 and 2013</p><p>SOURCE: Reproduced from Manduca (2019).</p><p>By 2013, this was no longer true. Most of the East Coast had joined New York and D.C. in the highest income category, as had northern California and Minneapolis-St. Paul. At the same time, rural economies across the country had hollowed out, with most rural parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Midwest, and California joining those in the Southeast and Southwest in the bottom income category. In total, whereas just 12 percent of the U.S. population in 1980 lived in commuting zones with mean family incomes more than 20 percent higher or lower than the national average, by 2013 the share had climbed to 31 percent.</p><h>The unique political consequences of inequality between regions</h><p>Inequality between places is uniquely consequential for U.S. politics because declining areas retain their political representation. No matter how much a state\u2019s population shrinks, it keeps its two Senate seats. And while House districts are redrawn every 10 years, they are drawn based on residential, not voting, population. Because voting is strongly correlated with income (Leighley and Nagler 2013), this means that poor places maintain a political voice that poor people as individuals often do not. For example, in 2018 just 175,000 voters participated in the contested election for WV-03, a district with a median income of $36,000. This is fewer than half of the 370,000 votes cast in MO-02, another close election, but one held in a district with a median income of $79,000 (Golshan and Mark 2018). Yet both districts have equal representation in Congress. This means that the federal government is structurally predisposed to address the concerns of districts like WV-03 out of proportion to either their financial resources or political mobilization.</p><p>The geographical apportionment of representation should lead the federal government to spend disproportionate effort addressing the challenges facing struggling regions, all else equal. But such action has been largely absent. In part, this is because local economic performance is not typically discussed as a national political issue, but rather as the responsibility of local governments and civic leaders. This article argues that local economic performance should be treated as a national issue on both empirical and political grounds.</p><h>Local Economic Performance Is a National Political Issue</h><p>At first glance, it is not necessarily apparent that the economic performance of local regions should be thought of as a national issue. Just as an individual\u2019s economic success in the United States is often attributed primarily to his or her personal actions and character traits, so regional economic success is frequently described as stemming predominantly from local actions. Conversely, regional economic difficulties are often attributed to local failings.</p><p>This \u201clocal responsibility\u201d view of regional economic development pervades much of the writing, both academic and popular, that examines the plight of struggling regions. Popular writers have profiled successful regions in the hope that other places can adopt the strategies they have taken (Fallows and Fallows 2018). Academic researchers, too, have sought to identify the local characteristics that predict economic success, using both case studies (Saxenian 1996; Storper et al. 2015) and large-sample quantitative analyses (Benner and Pastor 2012; Kemeny and Storper 2012). Some findings of this literature have emphasized the importance of developing tightly knit \u201cclusters\u201d of interrelated industries (Porter 1998). Other studies have encouraged regions to develop urban amenities that can attract the highly skilled workers who currently command high wages (Clark et al. 2002; Florida 2002; Glaeser, Kolko, and Saiz 2001), while a third set has highlighted the role of interconnected leadership networks that allow diverse groups of local stakeholders to jointly solve local problems (Benner and Pastor 2015; Storper et al. 2015).</p><p>These recommendations are typically aimed at local policy-makers, suggesting actions that can be undertaken independently by individual regions. There are good reasons for this approach: in the absence of a concerted national effort, individual places can only control what goes on within their borders, and some places have been remarkably effective at navigating the twenty-first-century economy. But as a diagnosis of why so many places are currently struggling, and as a proposal for fixing this problem at scale, the local responsibility view is incorrect empirically and misguided politically.</p><h>Empirics: Regional disparities largely result from national trends</h><p>The local responsibility view of regional economic development, and the associated focus on restoring prosperity by improving local competitiveness, fundamentally misunderstands the changes that have caused regional disparities to increase. There has always been a vigorous economic competition between cities in the United States\u2014nineteenth-century civic boosters make that abundantly clear. But for more than 100 years up to the 1970s, poor regions still gained on rich ones on average (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1992). Starting in the late 1970s, some aspect of the competition changed, and rich regions began pulling further ahead. The core question about regional divergence, then, is not why some regions do better than others economically. It is why the gap between winners and losers suddenly started increasing in the late 1970s.</p><p>Much of the research studying this reversal has attributed it to a change in the spatial distribution of different types of workers. Starting around 1980, college-educated workers in particular began to cluster in a relatively small number of cities (Moretti 2012). Possible explanations for this concentration include the rise of industries with strong economies of agglomeration (Diamond 2016; Kemeny and Storper 2012), the increasing importance of urban amenities to high-income workers (Clark et al. 2002; Florida 2002; Glaeser, Kolko, and Saiz 2001), or the implementation of increasingly restrictive zoning and occupational licensing laws that make it more difficult for people to move to prosperous areas (Schleicher 2017; Ganong and Shoag 2017). In line with these findings, the most prominent policy proposals to reverse regional divergence have focused on undoing this sorting and spatially redistributing high-paying jobs and skilled workers back to struggling areas. Some would do this by subsidizing employment in struggling regions (Austin, Glaeser, and Summers 2018), while others would make it easier for lower-income workers to move to thriving metros (Avent 2011; Yglesias 2012), or directly relocate institutions and government agencies away from coastal metros (MacGillis 2010; Yglesias 2016).</p><p>These policies are unlikely to have success on their own because they misunderstand the core driver of regional economic divergence. While there has indeed been a spatial concentration of college educated workers, and a sorting of people across metro areas by income, its contribution to divergence is relatively small. A more important factor has been rising income inequality at the national level. If there had been no income sorting whatsoever, rising income inequality alone would still have increased the economic disparities between regions by more than half as much as actually occurred. But if income inequality had been kept constant, the observed amount of sorting would have only increased disparities between regions by about a quarter of the true amount (Manduca 2019). The widening gap between rich and poor regions is thus first and foremost a reflection of the widening gap between rich and poor people. And while the causes of rising inequality are hotly debated, they almost certainly include many changes to national economic policy made beginning in the 1970s and 1980s (Hacker and Pierson 2010).</p><p>Thus, purely as a matter of policy, reinvigorating the economies of struggling regions and reducing the gaps between rich and poor places are likely to require national action. Framing regional divergence as a national policy decision rather than a matter of local responsibility is also more likely to generate the political will needed to address it.</p><h>Political consequences of treating regional divergence as a national policy issue</h><p>In addition to being empirically accurate, framing regional disparities as the consequence and responsibility of federal economic policy rather than local failings is likely to be a potent political message. Rather than telling rural or rust belt voters that their hometown economic struggles are their fault and that their cities need to \u201cshrink to greatness\u201d (Glaeser 2010), this approach would rightly attribute economic difficulties to national policy changes made largely outside their control. It is far less condescending, more likely to match voters\u2019 lived experiences, and gives a clear direction for action: updating national economic policy to meet the needs of the regions it has left behind (Glastris 2019).</p><p>As commentators (e.g., Catte 2019; Kelloway 2019) have noted, while rural and rust belt areas are often viewed as conservative, that hides a strong strain of economic populism (Levitz 2019). Individual progressive economic policies can do very well in red states: Missouri decisively rejected a right to work referendum in 2018, just as Oklahoma rejected a so-called right to farm referendum in 2016. A platform of economic populism that explicitly draws the line between national economic policy and local economic struggles would likely be compelling to voters in these areas.</p><p>Addressing regional divergence with national policy is a promising strategy as a matter of both policy and politics. The remainder of this article considers one possible national policy with important regional effects: reinvigorated antitrust enforcement. It outlines how the lack of effective antitrust enforcement has contributed to regional divergence, how a renewed antitrust movement might build on itself through policy feedback effects, and how advocates of a new antitrust regime might design it to maximize its chance of success.</p><h>Antitrust Enforcement as Federal Regional Convergence Policy</h><p>An increasing number of scholars and policy-makers recognize that many American companies have gotten too big (Wu 2018). In industry after industry, the major players have consolidated until only a handful of firms control the large majority of the market. Some conglomerates, most infamously Amazon, have attained dominant positions in multiple markets simultaneously and adeptly use their position in one market as leverage over competitors in another (Khan 2017).</p><p>The result of this consolidation has been a rise in economic inequality. At the most fundamental level, when a firm acquires a competitor, it reduces the number of alternatives available to its employees, customers, and suppliers, increasing its power over anyone who interacts with it (Emerson 1962; Coleman 1982). As a result, firms in concentrated markets are able to hold down wages (Wilmers 2018; Azar et al. 2018). This is a core reason that the share of national income going to labor has declined by 6 percentage points since 1980 (Autor et al. 2017; Barkai 2016).</p><p>The negative consequences of market concentration for regional economies can be especially severe (Salerno 2017). The waves of corporate consolidation over the past four decades have deprived many cities and towns of the corporate headquarters and local businesses that used to be a source of high-paying jobs and demand for professional business services (Longman 2015). The loss of these jobs is amplified by economic multipliers: the local spending of each accountant or lawyer may support two or three restauranteurs or gas station attendants. Beyond strictly economic effects, local business owners are often a key source of charitable donations and civic leadership, roles that absentee owners do not continue at the same levels (Brunell 2006). More broadly, local business ownership is a strong predictor of community and civic health on a number of indicators (Tolbert et al. 2002; Tolbert, Lyson, and Irwin 1998).</p><p>For rural areas, often dominated by a small number of employers or industries, the consequences of consolidation have been particularly devastating. Consider the case of agriculture. In the 1980s, 37 percent of every dollar consumers spent on food ended up with the farmer who produced it. Today, the farmer receives less than 15 percent (Kelloway 2019). Taking economic multipliers into account\u2014agriculture often forms the economic base of rural areas\u2014that change alone can plausibly account for a substantial portion of rural America\u2019s struggles. It has come largely because of consolidation among both farmers\u2019 suppliers and their customers. Where there used to be dozens of seed companies, now there are just three (Charles 2016). Prices for seed have risen accordingly. And where there were once many buyers for farm products, now there are just a handful: in meatpacking, for instance, four companies control 85 percent of the market for beef (Leonard 2014). This consolidation was a direct result of changes to the interpretation of antitrust law, and it could be reversed through updated policy.</p><p>Agriculture is just one sector where the results of consolidation have been especially pernicious for regional economies. Another example is air travel, which has been felt most noticeably by midsize cities. The number of major airlines has fallen steadily since deregulation in the 1970s, from more than twenty to just four as of this writing. As a result of consolidation, air service has become more concentrated in major cities, with connectivity to small and midsize airports dropping substantially since 2007 (Wittman and Swelbar 2014). The lack of convenient air service is a major constraint on cities\u2019 economic competitiveness and is often cited as a reason that corporate headquarters leave smaller cities and towns (Longman and Khan 2012).</p><p>The lack of effective antitrust enforcement over the past 40 years has been a major contributor to economic stagnation in many parts of the country, and a reinvigorated approach to enforcement offers a promising route to help restore prosperity across the country. If implemented carefully, with attention to potential policy feedbacks, a renewed antitrust movement could maintain and expand itself over time.</p><h>Policy Feedback Considerations in the Development of New Antitrust Policy</h><p>There are several features of antitrust enforcement as a political issue that make it a particularly promising federal regional development policy. These features occur with respect to all of the \u201cthree E\u2019s\u201d that Jacob Hacker mentions in his article in this issue (Hacker, this volume). Its bipartisan appeal to voters, potential to attract business support, and logistical ease of enactment make the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">establishment</emphasis> of a reinvigorated antitrust regime likely to be easier than many other regional development policies. Once established, initial successful antitrust actions are likely to change the politics of the issue in ways that make its <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">entrenchment</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">expansion</emphasis> more likely. Here I briefly describe these attractive features and potential for policy feedbacks, along with certain strategic recommendations related to sequencing and the use of federalism in the initial establishment phase.</p><p>Note that two types of regulatory action form the core of the antitrust toolkit. One is to block proposed mergers, preventing new monopolies from being created. The second is to break up currently existing companies with excess market power into their component parts. Both types of enforcement would benefit from the promising political considerations facilitating the establishment of a renewed antitrust movement. But many of the most promising feedback effects related to the entrenchment and expansion of such a movement will be felt most strongly with the successful breakups of currently existing firms. For this reason, a revitalized antitrust movement should strongly consider pursuing such breakups whenever possible, even though regulators have been hesitant to pursue them in the past (Wu 2018).</p><h>Features of antitrust enforcement that make its establishment more likely</h><p>Among possible federal regional development policies, reinvigorated antitrust enforcement stands out in several ways that make its establishment as a policy more likely. First, it is salient and familiar to voters. Most voters have encountered monopolies in their daily lives, whether they be airlines, utilities, internet providers, or tech platforms. Almost everyone has had a negative experience with a company too large or omnipresent to avoid in the future. Breaking such companies up offers a response to angry customers who would otherwise not have any way to express their frustration.</p><p>Moreover, aggressive antitrust enforcement has a long history in the United States, and it was widely practiced within the lifetimes of many voters. It has been a stated principle of capitalist economics since Adam Smith (Smith 1827), albeit one that has often been honored in the breach. In the United States specifically, antitrust enforcement fits with a longstanding American skepticism toward \u201cbigness\u201d (Lemann 2016; Rosen 2016). Perhaps for these reasons, the current antitrust movement has managed to find support among both liberals and conservatives. A poll conducted in September 2018, for instance, found that 65 percent of Americans\u2014and 54 percent of Trump voters\u2014think the government \u201cshould do more to break up corporate monopolies\u201d (Dayen 2018). And leading proponents of antitrust enforcement in Congress and the media are found on both sides of the aisle (Crane 2018).</p><p>Perhaps more important than its broad appeal among voters, antitrust enforcement has the potential to attract support, or at least avoid opposition, from a wide range of organized interest groups. Of particular note is the potential for corporate ambivalence on this issue. Unlike many progressive economic policies, many companies\u2014including quite powerful ones\u2014stand to benefit from a reinvigorated antitrust regime. Yelp, for instance, has been a major critic of Google\u2019s abuse of its search monopoly for several years (Dougherty 2017). When AT&amp;T attempted to acquire T-Mobile in 2010, some of the most vocal opposition came from competitor Sprint (Singel 2011), though that did not stop Sprint from initiating its own bid for T-Mobile recently. Even Walmart, the largest retailer in the country, recently joined with other brick and mortar retailers to call on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to examine \u201cpersistent oligopolies in other parts of the retail system,\u201d specifically singling out the market power of Amazon and Google (Dodge 2019). Companies like these could potentially become strong supporters of specific antitrust enforcement actions or a new antitrust movement in general.</p><p>This potential to attract corporate support is a key advantage of antitrust enforcement as a regional development policy. A major question will be whether proponents of the new enforcement regime will be able to secure support, or at least neutrality, from overarching corporate lobbying organizations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. As I discuss, choosing initial enforcement targets to maximize the possibility of such support or neutrality is a strategic imperative for the new antitrust movement.</p><p>A third advantage of antitrust enforcement relative to many potential federal redevelopment policies is the comparative ease with which it could be enacted. For the most part, the current antitrust movement is calling for better enforcement of laws already on the books, by agencies that already exist. This means that large parts of the policy could be implemented without creating new government entities or requiring large increases in federal spending, and perhaps even without new legislation.</p><p>These three features of reinvigorated antitrust enforcement\u2014its widespread support among voters, potential for ambivalence from corporations, and legislative ease of enactment\u2014suggest that it may be easier to establish than many other federal regional development policies. Should initial enforcement actions be successful, they are also likely to entrench the policy and lay the groundwork for further expansion.</p><h>Entrenchment and expansion: The finality of breaking up companies</h><p>Should initial enforcement actions succeed\u2014and specifically should existing oligopolistic companies be broken apart\u2014they are likely to alter the political landscape in ways that entrench the new antitrust regime and promote future regional development efforts in general.</p><p>When a company is successfully split apart, it no longer exists as an independent entity capable of political action. That in itself may remove the single biggest source of potential backlash to a given enforcement action\u2014as Patashnik describes in his contribution to this issue, sometimes the most effective way to reduce backlash is to fragment the organizations most likely to mobilize such backlash (Patashnik, this volume).</p><p>The entrenchment effects of breaking up existing monopolies extend beyond their particular enforcement action. Monopoly rents are a key source of political donations, either from the companies themselves or from the individuals who own them (Skocpol and Williamson 2012). Reducing those rents through increased competition will thus decrease the money available to fund future anti-enforcement lobbying.</p><p>Beyond reducing the availability of monopoly rents to fund future advocacy, successful enforcement actions may reduce the political clout of targeted industries by changing the number and nature of corporate players. In the case where one company is split horizontally into several competitors, this would occur by increasing the total number of actors that need to be coordinated for industry-wide lobbying, which is likely to make such coordination more difficult. In the case where a company is split vertically into firms that each occupy different stages in the chain of production, the successor firms may have policy interests that directly conflict. Amazon the online market platform and its client Amazon the bookseller are likely to have a tense relationship and might end up on opposite sides of debates about Internet policy.</p><p>A particularly promising dynamic, which is plausible though by no means guaranteed, would be if the successor companies created by one round of trustbusting become agitators for the next round. Firms in some cases pursue mergers and acquisitions defensively in response to observed or anticipated consolidation in their own or related industries (Gorton, Kahl, and Rosen 2009; Ahern and Harford 2014). This process can lead to vertical or horizontal merger waves where all tiers of an industry\u2019s supply chain quickly consolidate. If some of these mergers were undone, the resulting smaller companies might push for further antitrust enforcement up or down their supply chain to even the playing field once more. That could create a virtuous cycle in which the successor companies from one enforcement action lobby for the next action.</p><p>Should a more assertive antitrust regime become established, it is quite possible that it will induce beneficial feedback effects that could entrench and expand it relatively quickly. It is important to note that many of these feedback effects would stem from the changes to the marketplace and political arena that result from breaking up firms that are currently consolidated vertically or horizontally into their component pieces. This dynamic suggests that proponents of the new enforcement regime would be wise to push for the full breakup of consolidated companies rather than simply imposing fines or attempting to regulate them through consent decrees. A powerful firm that has just been hit with a major fine is likely to redouble its efforts at political influence; a firm that is split in two will likely find that its successor companies have both less total power and conflicting goals.</p><h>Strategic Considerations in Establishing a Reinvigorated Antitrust Regime</h><p>Despite the many features that make antitrust enforcement a promising candidate for establishment, it is important that advocates pursue the issue carefully and strategically. Here I briefly discuss some strategic considerations related to the initial establishment of a reinvigorated antitrust regime. These recommendations include embracing the political nature of antitrust enforcement, thinking carefully about the sequencing of enforcement actions, and taking advantage of federalism to force progress at the state level if federal regulators continue with a lax approach.</p><h>Embrace the political nature of antitrust</h><p>Antitrust policy is fundamentally a political issue. It centers on questions about resource distribution and power that are at the core of any political system. This means that any attempts to remove it from public debate and treat it as a purely technical question are likely to fail: entrenched interests will continue to correctly see it is as vitally important to their interests, and without a countermobilization bureaucrats will almost certainly succumb to their lobbying.</p><p>Rather than searching for an illusory econometric magic bullet, supporters of stronger antitrust enforcement should fully embrace its political nature. This means building an antitrust movement that mobilizes a large number of people, uses high-visibility platforms to describe the problems of consolidation\u2014and even the specific harms caused by specific companies\u2014and pressures public figures, both elected and unelected, to take clear stances in favor of competition. Antitrust is an issue with great power to energize everyday consumers and voters, and that power should be utilized.</p><p>A corollary to the political nature of antitrust is that, as with other political issues, fighting for greater enforcement and campaigning against predatory companies may result in political progress even in instances where the immediate objective is defeated. Just as an initial electoral loss can lay the groundwork for future victories, so each attempt to fight a merger or break up a monopoly moves the national conversation forward, generates awareness of the harms of consolidation, and makes further merger attempts appear more costly to businesses.</p><h>Careful sequencing to build momentum</h><p>Because a new antitrust enforcement regime is likely to face substantial pushback from entrenched interests, the initial targets for enforcement actions should be carefully chosen for political as well as legal viability. Enforcers should aim to set precedent and build momentum by choosing targets for enforcement that are in politically precarious positions and that offer the possibility of dividing corporate lobbies.</p><p>Companies that are already distrusted by consumers and politicians are in a politically weak state that may make them easier targets for initial enforcement. Facebook offers a potentially useful example. It is increasingly disliked by consumers after a multitude of hacking, fake news, and privacy scandals (Liao 2018). At the same time, it is distrusted by conservative politicians for its perceived liberal bias. This weak position means that government intervention to protect Facebook\u2019s customers may face less skepticism than similar action against a more popular company\u2014the need for some sort of corrective action is widely apparent. Equally important, while industry lobbying groups might be concerned about the implications of a successful dismantling of Facebook, they may hesitate to face the political consequences of aligning themselves with an unpopular company.</p><p>As described above, an important feature of antitrust enforcement is that many companies stand to benefit from it alongside consumers and workers. Antitrust advocates would do well to choose initial enforcement targets that maximize the chance of gaining support from other corporations and keeping industry- or economy-wide business lobbying groups on the sidelines. The most promising cases will be ones that have relatively powerful interests on both sides, such as Walmart and Amazon, mentioned above, or Google and News Corp, who recently squared off in Australia (Meade 2018).</p><p>By picking initial targets that are politically weak or have strong corporate opponents, antitrust enforcers will be more likely to win their initial cases in the courts of law and public opinion. Once some initial victories are achieved, further enforcement actions can build on their precedent and benefit from the more favorable political landscape.</p><h>Federalism and the advantageous position of state attorneys general</h><p>A third strategic consideration concerns the level of government at which to pursue establishment of a new antitrust regime. Ideally, aggressive enforcement should be pursued concurrently wherever possible, be that through the FTC, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Congress, or the states. However, action may not always be possible at the federal level, and in recent years the FTC and DOJ have generally looked favorably on mergers (Tepper 2019). Thus, it may be advantageous to initially pursue enforcement at the state level. A number of state attorneys general (AGs) have already begun investigations into Google and Facebook (Romm 2019), and ten state AGs recently sued to block the proposed merger between T-Mobile and Sprint (Harding McGill 2019).</p><p>Besides the possibility of short-term action, state AGs have a number of advantages as antitrust enforcers. The most important of these is that in most states they are elected politicians. This means that they are well equipped to treat antitrust as a political issue\u2014they have more reason than career bureaucrats to consider the political optics of particular stances and are more likely to be adept at communicating with the media and the public. They also stand to see personal electoral benefits from popular enforcement actions and are directly susceptible to pressure from organized advocates. State AGs thus occupy a unique position. Unlike federal enforcers at the DOJ or FTC, they are elected politicians who know how to mobilize voters and can be directly pressured to adopt procompetition stances. But unlike members of Congress, they have direct enforcement power.</p><p>A state-level strategy also offers the possibility of building enforcement momentum piecemeal. It may prove easier for antitrust advocates to secure the support of a handful of AGs, perhaps from states that are especially harmed by a particular conglomerate or potential merger, than to convince the FTC or DOJ to reverse several decades of harmful policies. As a suit progresses, other states or federal agencies may join in.</p><h>Conclusion: National Action for a National Problem</h><p>This article has considered the problem of economic divergence between regions of the United States. Over the past four decades, the United States has bifurcated economically, with increasing fractions of the population living in both exceptionally poor and exceptionally rich places. Many of the biggest challenges facing the country are intricately tied to this bifurcation, including the basic question of whether national political cohesion can be maintained. Here I have argued that the growing economic disparities among regions of the United States should be treated first and foremost as a national policy issue. This view is accurate because it takes into account the changes that have pulled regions apart, and it is valuable because it offers pathways to political action that might address the problem.</p><p>As an example of a national policy with important effects on regional economies, I have considered antitrust enforcement. Though difficult to quantify directly, the lax antitrust enforcement of the past few decades has likely contributed to the economic struggles of many cities and towns nationwide. A reinvigorated antitrust movement would thus likely disproportionately benefit those parts of the country that have been left behind. In addition to having unique characteristics that make its establishment more likely in this era of polarization and negative partisanship, antitrust offers the possibility of beneficial feedback effects that may make it easier to entrench and expand.</p><p>Antitrust is just one of many areas in which national policy shifts starting in the 1970s and 1980s exacerbated economic gaps among regions. Other policy areas include the devolution of welfare program administration from the federal government to the states (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose and Gill 2004); the relaxing of financial and telecommunications regulations; and the end of federal revenue sharing with state and local governments, which led to a dramatic increase in the fiscal stakes of regional economic competition (Pacewicz 2016). Policy-makers seeking to address regional disparities today would do well to remember the role federal action had in creating those disparities and to recognize its potential for reducing them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><h>REFERENCES</h><p>Ahern Kenneth R., Harford Jarrad,  . 2014.

A handful of rich coastal metros have seen their incomes grow substantially, while large regions of the country struggle with unemployment and stagnation. This regional inequality is uniquely consequential for U.S. politics because political power is distributed geographically, meaning that unlike other social groups, struggling places are guaranteed to keep their representation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this article, I argue that rising regional inequality should be thought of first and foremost as a consequence of national economic policy\u2014that is, it stems from political decisions made at the federal level. In addition to being an accurate reflection of the forces that have buffeted many parts of the United States since 1980, this framing will help to generate the political will to address regional divergence, particularly from within struggling regions themselves.</p><p>Second, I explore the policy feedback dynamics in one national policy area with important regional implications: antitrust enforcement. There is a growing movement to strengthen antitrust policy in light of rapid corporate consolidation in recent years. Here I describe why antitrust enforcement has important implications for regional economies and how a new antitrust regime could benefit from policy feedback effects that would help to entrench and expand its impact once established. I also highlight some advantages that may make antitrust enforcement easier to enact than other federal regional development policies, as well as some strategic considerations in the initial enactment.</p><h>The Geographic Concentration of Prosperity</h><p>One of the most wrenching social and economic shifts to hit the United States over the past 40 years has been the geographic concentration of prosperity. Since 1980, the income gap between the richest and poorest regions of the country has widened by 50 percent, a reversal of more than 100 years of economic convergence (Ganong and Shoag 2017). A handful of metro areas have seen concentrations of wealth almost unprecedented in human history, while a much larger set has seen their jobs evaporate and their economic bases contract. In addition to the direct economic pain this causes, it likely contributes to family instability (Autor, Dorn, and Hanson 2017; Wilson 1996), diminished mobility prospects for children (Sharkey 2013; Sharkey and Faber 2014), and declining social and political cohesion (Beramendi 2012).</p><p>The size of the change is shown in Figure 1, which plots mean family income by commuting zone (a definition of metro area comprising a central city and surrounding suburban counties) as a fraction of the national mean family income in 1980 and 2013. In 1980, the picture is one of relative consistency across most of the country. New York (specifically the New Jersey suburbs) and Washington, D.C., stand out as cities with mean incomes more than 20 percent higher than the nation as a whole, while rural parts of the Southeast and Southwest had incomes substantially lower than average. Across the rest of the country, average incomes fell into a tight band between 80 percent and 120 percent of the national mean.</p><h>Figure 1</h><p>Commuting Zone Mean Family Income as a Fraction of the National Average, 1980 and 2013</p><p>SOURCE: Reproduced from Manduca (2019).</p><p>By 2013, this was no longer true. Most of the East Coast had joined New York and D.C. in the highest income category, as had northern California and Minneapolis-St. Paul. At the same time, rural economies across the country had hollowed out, with most rural parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Midwest, and California joining those in the Southeast and Southwest in the bottom income category. In total, whereas just 12 percent of the U.S. population in 1980 lived in commuting zones with mean family incomes more than 20 percent higher or lower than the national average, by 2013 the share had climbed to 31 percent.</p><h>The unique political consequences of inequality between regions</h><p>Inequality between places is uniquely consequential for U.S. politics because declining areas retain their political representation. No matter how much a state\u2019s population shrinks, it keeps its two Senate seats. And while House districts are redrawn every 10 years, they are drawn based on residential, not voting, population. Because voting is strongly correlated with income (Leighley and Nagler 2013), this means that poor places maintain a political voice that poor people as individuals often do not. For example, in 2018 just 175,000 voters participated in the contested election for WV-03, a district with a median income of $36,000. This is fewer than half of the 370,000 votes cast in MO-02, another close election, but one held in a district with a median income of $79,000 (Golshan and Mark 2018). Yet both districts have equal representation in Congress. This means that the federal government is structurally predisposed to address the concerns of districts like WV-03 out of proportion to either their financial resources or political mobilization.</p><p>The geographical apportionment of representation should lead the federal government to spend disproportionate effort addressing the challenges facing struggling regions, all else equal. But such action has been largely absent. In part, this is because local economic performance is not typically discussed as a national political issue, but rather as the responsibility of local governments and civic leaders. This article argues that local economic performance should be treated as a national issue on both empirical and political grounds.</p><h>Local Economic Performance Is a National Political Issue</h><p>At first glance, it is not necessarily apparent that the economic performance of local regions should be thought of as a national issue. Just as an individual\u2019s economic success in the United States is often attributed primarily to his or her personal actions and character traits, so regional economic success is frequently described as stemming predominantly from local actions. Conversely, regional economic difficulties are often attributed to local failings.</p><p>This \u201clocal responsibility\u201d view of regional economic development pervades much of the writing, both academic and popular, that examines the plight of struggling regions. Popular writers have profiled successful regions in the hope that other places can adopt the strategies they have taken (Fallows and Fallows 2018). Academic researchers, too, have sought to identify the local characteristics that predict economic success, using both case studies (Saxenian 1996; Storper et al. 2015) and large-sample quantitative analyses (Benner and Pastor 2012; Kemeny and Storper 2012). Some findings of this literature have emphasized the importance of developing tightly knit \u201cclusters\u201d of interrelated industries (Porter 1998). Other studies have encouraged regions to develop urban amenities that can attract the highly skilled workers who currently command high wages (Clark et al. 2002; Florida 2002; Glaeser, Kolko, and Saiz 2001), while a third set has highlighted the role of interconnected leadership networks that allow diverse groups of local stakeholders to jointly solve local problems (Benner and Pastor 2015; Storper et al. 2015).</p><p>These recommendations are typically aimed at local policy-makers, suggesting actions that can be undertaken independently by individual regions. There are good reasons for this approach: in the absence of a concerted national effort, individual places can only control what goes on within their borders, and some places have been remarkably effective at navigating the twenty-first-century economy. But as a diagnosis of why so many places are currently struggling, and as a proposal for fixing this problem at scale, the local responsibility view is incorrect empirically and misguided politically.</p><h>Empirics: Regional disparities largely result from national trends</h><p>The local responsibility view of regional economic development, and the associated focus on restoring prosperity by improving local competitiveness, fundamentally misunderstands the changes that have caused regional disparities to increase. There has always been a vigorous economic competition between cities in the United States\u2014nineteenth-century civic boosters make that abundantly clear. But for more than 100 years up to the 1970s, poor regions still gained on rich ones on average (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1992). Starting in the late 1970s, some aspect of the competition changed, and rich regions began pulling further ahead. The core question about regional divergence, then, is not why some regions do better than others economically. It is why the gap between winners and losers suddenly started increasing in the late 1970s.</p><p>Much of the research studying this reversal has attributed it to a change in the spatial distribution of different types of workers. Starting around 1980, college-educated workers in particular began to cluster in a relatively small number of cities (Moretti 2012). Possible explanations for this concentration include the rise of industries with strong economies of agglomeration (Diamond 2016; Kemeny and Storper 2012), the increasing importance of urban amenities to high-income workers (Clark et al. 2002; Florida 2002; Glaeser, Kolko, and Saiz 2001), or the implementation of increasingly restrictive zoning and occupational licensing laws that make it more difficult for people to move to prosperous areas (Schleicher 2017; Ganong and Shoag 2017). In line with these findings, the most prominent policy proposals to reverse regional divergence have focused on undoing this sorting and spatially redistributing high-paying jobs and skilled workers back to struggling areas. Some would do this by subsidizing employment in struggling regions (Austin, Glaeser, and Summers 2018), while others would make it easier for lower-income workers to move to thriving metros (Avent 2011; Yglesias 2012), or directly relocate institutions and government agencies away from coastal metros (MacGillis 2010; Yglesias 2016).</p><p>These policies are unlikely to have success on their own because they misunderstand the core driver of regional economic divergence. While there has indeed been a spatial concentration of college educated workers, and a sorting of people across metro areas by income, its contribution to divergence is relatively small. A more important factor has been rising income inequality at the national level. If there had been no income sorting whatsoever, rising income inequality alone would still have increased the economic disparities between regions by more than half as much as actually occurred. But if income inequality had been kept constant, the observed amount of sorting would have only increased disparities between regions by about a quarter of the true amount (Manduca 2019). The widening gap between rich and poor regions is thus first and foremost a reflection of the widening gap between rich and poor people. And while the causes of rising inequality are hotly debated, they almost certainly include many changes to national economic policy made beginning in the 1970s and 1980s (Hacker and Pierson 2010).</p><p>Thus, purely as a matter of policy, reinvigorating the economies of struggling regions and reducing the gaps between rich and poor places are likely to require national action. Framing regional divergence as a national policy decision rather than a matter of local responsibility is also more likely to generate the political will needed to address it.</p><h>Political consequences of treating regional divergence as a national policy issue</h><p>In addition to being empirically accurate, framing regional disparities as the consequence and responsibility of federal economic policy rather than local failings is likely to be a potent political message. Rather than telling rural or rust belt voters that their hometown economic struggles are their fault and that their cities need to \u201cshrink to greatness\u201d (Glaeser 2010), this approach would rightly attribute economic difficulties to national policy changes made largely outside their control. It is far less condescending, more likely to match voters\u2019 lived experiences, and gives a clear direction for action: updating national economic policy to meet the needs of the regions it has left behind (Glastris 2019).</p><p>As commentators (e.g., Catte 2019; Kelloway 2019) have noted, while rural and rust belt areas are often viewed as conservative, that hides a strong strain of economic populism (Levitz 2019). Individual progressive economic policies can do very well in red states: Missouri decisively rejected a right to work referendum in 2018, just as Oklahoma rejected a so-called right to farm referendum in 2016. A platform of economic populism that explicitly draws the line between national economic policy and local economic struggles would likely be compelling to voters in these areas.</p><p>Addressing regional divergence with national policy is a promising strategy as a matter of both policy and politics. The remainder of this article considers one possible national policy with important regional effects: reinvigorated antitrust enforcement. It outlines how the lack of effective antitrust enforcement has contributed to regional divergence, how a renewed antitrust movement might build on itself through policy feedback effects, and how advocates of a new antitrust regime might design it to maximize its chance of success.</p><h>Antitrust Enforcement as Federal Regional Convergence Policy</h><p>An increasing number of scholars and policy-makers recognize that many American companies have gotten too big (Wu 2018). In industry after industry, the major players have consolidated until only a handful of firms control the large majority of the market. Some conglomerates, most infamously Amazon, have attained dominant positions in multiple markets simultaneously and adeptly use their position in one market as leverage over competitors in another (Khan 2017).</p><p>The result of this consolidation has been a rise in economic inequality. At the most fundamental level, when a firm acquires a competitor, it reduces the number of alternatives available to its employees, customers, and suppliers, increasing its power over anyone who interacts with it (Emerson 1962; Coleman 1982). As a result, firms in concentrated markets are able to hold down wages (Wilmers 2018; Azar et al. 2018). This is a core reason that the share of national income going to labor has declined by 6 percentage points since 1980 (Autor et al. 2017; Barkai 2016).</p><p>The negative consequences of market concentration for regional economies can be especially severe (Salerno 2017). The waves of corporate consolidation over the past four decades have deprived many cities and towns of the corporate headquarters and local businesses that used to be a source of high-paying jobs and demand for professional business services (Longman 2015). The loss of these jobs is amplified by economic multipliers: the local spending of each accountant or lawyer may support two or three restauranteurs or gas station attendants. Beyond strictly economic effects, local business owners are often a key source of charitable donations and civic leadership, roles that absentee owners do not continue at the same levels (Brunell 2006). More broadly, local business ownership is a strong predictor of community and civic health on a number of indicators (Tolbert et al. 2002; Tolbert, Lyson, and Irwin 1998).</p><p>For rural areas, often dominated by a small number of employers or industries, the consequences of consolidation have been particularly devastating. Consider the case of agriculture. In the 1980s, 37 percent of every dollar consumers spent on food ended up with the farmer who produced it. Today, the farmer receives less than 15 percent (Kelloway 2019). Taking economic multipliers into account\u2014agriculture often forms the economic base of rural areas\u2014that change alone can plausibly account for a substantial portion of rural America\u2019s struggles. It has come largely because of consolidation among both farmers\u2019 suppliers and their customers. Where there used to be dozens of seed companies, now there are just three (Charles 2016). Prices for seed have risen accordingly. And where there were once many buyers for farm products, now there are just a handful: in meatpacking, for instance, four companies control 85 percent of the market for beef (Leonard 2014). This consolidation was a direct result of changes to the interpretation of antitrust law, and it could be reversed through updated policy.</p><p>Agriculture is just one sector where the results of consolidation have been especially pernicious for regional economies. Another example is air travel, which has been felt most noticeably by midsize cities. The number of major airlines has fallen steadily since deregulation in the 1970s, from more than twenty to just four as of this writing. As a result of consolidation, air service has become more concentrated in major cities, with connectivity to small and midsize airports dropping substantially since 2007 (Wittman and Swelbar 2014). The lack of convenient air service is a major constraint on cities\u2019 economic competitiveness and is often cited as a reason that corporate headquarters leave smaller cities and towns (Longman and Khan 2012).</p><p>The lack of effective antitrust enforcement over the past 40 years has been a major contributor to economic stagnation in many parts of the country, and a reinvigorated approach to enforcement offers a promising route to help restore prosperity across the country. If implemented carefully, with attention to potential policy feedbacks, a renewed antitrust movement could maintain and expand itself over time.</p><h>Policy Feedback Considerations in the Development of New Antitrust Policy</h><p>There are several features of antitrust enforcement as a political issue that make it a particularly promising federal regional development policy. These features occur with respect to all of the \u201cthree E\u2019s\u201d that Jacob Hacker mentions in his article in this issue (Hacker, this volume). Its bipartisan appeal to voters, potential to attract business support, and logistical ease of enactment make the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">establishment</emphasis> of a reinvigorated antitrust regime likely to be easier than many other regional development policies. Once established, initial successful antitrust actions are likely to change the politics of the issue in ways that make its <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">entrenchment</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">expansion</emphasis> more likely. Here I briefly describe these attractive features and potential for policy feedbacks, along with certain strategic recommendations related to sequencing and the use of federalism in the initial establishment phase.</p><p>Note that two types of regulatory action form the core of the antitrust toolkit. One is to block proposed mergers, preventing new monopolies from being created. The second is to break up currently existing companies with excess market power into their component parts. Both types of enforcement would benefit from the promising political considerations facilitating the establishment of a renewed antitrust movement. But many of the most promising feedback effects related to the entrenchment and expansion of such a movement will be felt most strongly with the successful breakups of currently existing firms. For this reason, a revitalized antitrust movement should strongly consider pursuing such breakups whenever possible, even though regulators have been hesitant to pursue them in the past (Wu 2018).</p><h>Features of antitrust enforcement that make its establishment more likely</h><p>Among possible federal regional development policies, reinvigorated antitrust enforcement stands out in several ways that make its establishment as a policy more likely. First, it is salient and familiar to voters. Most voters have encountered monopolies in their daily lives, whether they be airlines, utilities, internet providers, or tech platforms. Almost everyone has had a negative experience with a company too large or omnipresent to avoid in the future. Breaking such companies up offers a response to angry customers who would otherwise not have any way to express their frustration.</p><p>Moreover, aggressive antitrust enforcement has a long history in the United States, and it was widely practiced within the lifetimes of many voters. It has been a stated principle of capitalist economics since Adam Smith (Smith 1827), albeit one that has often been honored in the breach. In the United States specifically, antitrust enforcement fits with a longstanding American skepticism toward \u201cbigness\u201d (Lemann 2016; Rosen 2016). Perhaps for these reasons, the current antitrust movement has managed to find support among both liberals and conservatives. A poll conducted in September 2018, for instance, found that 65 percent of Americans\u2014and 54 percent of Trump voters\u2014think the government \u201cshould do more to break up corporate monopolies\u201d (Dayen 2018). And leading proponents of antitrust enforcement in Congress and the media are found on both sides of the aisle (Crane 2018).</p><p>Perhaps more important than its broad appeal among voters, antitrust enforcement has the potential to attract support, or at least avoid opposition, from a wide range of organized interest groups. Of particular note is the potential for corporate ambivalence on this issue. Unlike many progressive economic policies, many companies\u2014including quite powerful ones\u2014stand to benefit from a reinvigorated antitrust regime. Yelp, for instance, has been a major critic of Google\u2019s abuse of its search monopoly for several years (Dougherty 2017). When AT&amp;T attempted to acquire T-Mobile in 2010, some of the most vocal opposition came from competitor Sprint (Singel 2011), though that did not stop Sprint from initiating its own bid for T-Mobile recently. Even Walmart, the largest retailer in the country, recently joined with other brick and mortar retailers to call on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to examine \u201cpersistent oligopolies in other parts of the retail system,\u201d specifically singling out the market power of Amazon and Google (Dodge 2019). Companies like these could potentially become strong supporters of specific antitrust enforcement actions or a new antitrust movement in general.</p><p>This potential to attract corporate support is a key advantage of antitrust enforcement as a regional development policy. A major question will be whether proponents of the new enforcement regime will be able to secure support, or at least neutrality, from overarching corporate lobbying organizations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. As I discuss, choosing initial enforcement targets to maximize the possibility of such support or neutrality is a strategic imperative for the new antitrust movement.</p><p>A third advantage of antitrust enforcement relative to many potential federal redevelopment policies is the comparative ease with which it could be enacted. For the most part, the current antitrust movement is calling for better enforcement of laws already on the books, by agencies that already exist. This means that large parts of the policy could be implemented without creating new government entities or requiring large increases in federal spending, and perhaps even without new legislation.</p><p>These three features of reinvigorated antitrust enforcement\u2014its widespread support among voters, potential for ambivalence from corporations, and legislative ease of enactment\u2014suggest that it may be easier to establish than many other federal regional development policies. Should initial enforcement actions be successful, they are also likely to entrench the policy and lay the groundwork for further expansion.</p><h>Entrenchment and expansion: The finality of breaking up companies</h><p>Should initial enforcement actions succeed\u2014and specifically should existing oligopolistic companies be broken apart\u2014they are likely to alter the political landscape in ways that entrench the new antitrust regime and promote future regional development efforts in general.</p><p>When a company is successfully split apart, it no longer exists as an independent entity capable of political action. That in itself may remove the single biggest source of potential backlash to a given enforcement action\u2014as Patashnik describes in his contribution to this issue, sometimes the most effective way to reduce backlash is to fragment the organizations most likely to mobilize such backlash (Patashnik, this volume).</p><p>The entrenchment effects of breaking up existing monopolies extend beyond their particular enforcement action. Monopoly rents are a key source of political donations, either from the companies themselves or from the individuals who own them (Skocpol and Williamson 2012). Reducing those rents through increased competition will thus decrease the money available to fund future anti-enforcement lobbying.</p><p>Beyond reducing the availability of monopoly rents to fund future advocacy, successful enforcement actions may reduce the political clout of targeted industries by changing the number and nature of corporate players. In the case where one company is split horizontally into several competitors, this would occur by increasing the total number of actors that need to be coordinated for industry-wide lobbying, which is likely to make such coordination more difficult. In the case where a company is split vertically into firms that each occupy different stages in the chain of production, the successor firms may have policy interests that directly conflict. Amazon the online market platform and its client Amazon the bookseller are likely to have a tense relationship and might end up on opposite sides of debates about Internet policy.</p><p>A particularly promising dynamic, which is plausible though by no means guaranteed, would be if the successor companies created by one round of trustbusting become agitators for the next round. Firms in some cases pursue mergers and acquisitions defensively in response to observed or anticipated consolidation in their own or related industries (Gorton, Kahl, and Rosen 2009; Ahern and Harford 2014). This process can lead to vertical or horizontal merger waves where all tiers of an industry\u2019s supply chain quickly consolidate. If some of these mergers were undone, the resulting smaller companies might push for further antitrust enforcement up or down their supply chain to even the playing field once more. That could create a virtuous cycle in which the successor companies from one enforcement action lobby for the next action.</p><p>Should a more assertive antitrust regime become established, it is quite possible that it will induce beneficial feedback effects that could entrench and expand it relatively quickly. It is important to note that many of these feedback effects would stem from the changes to the marketplace and political arena that result from breaking up firms that are currently consolidated vertically or horizontally into their component pieces. This dynamic suggests that proponents of the new enforcement regime would be wise to push for the full breakup of consolidated companies rather than simply imposing fines or attempting to regulate them through consent decrees. A powerful firm that has just been hit with a major fine is likely to redouble its efforts at political influence; a firm that is split in two will likely find that its successor companies have both less total power and conflicting goals.</p><h>Strategic Considerations in Establishing a Reinvigorated Antitrust Regime</h><p>Despite the many features that make antitrust enforcement a promising candidate for establishment, it is important that advocates pursue the issue carefully and strategically. Here I briefly discuss some strategic considerations related to the initial establishment of a reinvigorated antitrust regime. These recommendations include embracing the political nature of antitrust enforcement, thinking carefully about the sequencing of enforcement actions, and taking advantage of federalism to force progress at the state level if federal regulators continue with a lax approach.</p><h>Embrace the political nature of antitrust</h><p>Antitrust policy is fundamentally a political issue. It centers on questions about resource distribution and power that are at the core of any political system. This means that any attempts to remove it from public debate and treat it as a purely technical question are likely to fail: entrenched interests will continue to correctly see it is as vitally important to their interests, and without a countermobilization bureaucrats will almost certainly succumb to their lobbying.</p><p>Rather than searching for an illusory econometric magic bullet, supporters of stronger antitrust enforcement should fully embrace its political nature. This means building an antitrust movement that mobilizes a large number of people, uses high-visibility platforms to describe the problems of consolidation\u2014and even the specific harms caused by specific companies\u2014and pressures public figures, both elected and unelected, to take clear stances in favor of competition. Antitrust is an issue with great power to energize everyday consumers and voters, and that power should be utilized.</p><p>A corollary to the political nature of antitrust is that, as with other political issues, fighting for greater enforcement and campaigning against predatory companies may result in political progress even in instances where the immediate objective is defeated. Just as an initial electoral loss can lay the groundwork for future victories, so each attempt to fight a merger or break up a monopoly moves the national conversation forward, generates awareness of the harms of consolidation, and makes further merger attempts appear more costly to businesses.</p><h>Careful sequencing to build momentum</h><p>Because a new antitrust enforcement regime is likely to face substantial pushback from entrenched interests, the initial targets for enforcement actions should be carefully chosen for political as well as legal viability. Enforcers should aim to set precedent and build momentum by choosing targets for enforcement that are in politically precarious positions and that offer the possibility of dividing corporate lobbies.</p><p>Companies that are already distrusted by consumers and politicians are in a politically weak state that may make them easier targets for initial enforcement. Facebook offers a potentially useful example. It is increasingly disliked by consumers after a multitude of hacking, fake news, and privacy scandals (Liao 2018). At the same time, it is distrusted by conservative politicians for its perceived liberal bias. This weak position means that government intervention to protect Facebook\u2019s customers may face less skepticism than similar action against a more popular company\u2014the need for some sort of corrective action is widely apparent. Equally important, while industry lobbying groups might be concerned about the implications of a successful dismantling of Facebook, they may hesitate to face the political consequences of aligning themselves with an unpopular company.</p><p>As described above, an important feature of antitrust enforcement is that many companies stand to benefit from it alongside consumers and workers. Antitrust advocates would do well to choose initial enforcement targets that maximize the chance of gaining support from other corporations and keeping industry- or economy-wide business lobbying groups on the sidelines. The most promising cases will be ones that have relatively powerful interests on both sides, such as Walmart and Amazon, mentioned above, or Google and News Corp, who recently squared off in Australia (Meade 2018).</p><p>By picking initial targets that are politically weak or have strong corporate opponents, antitrust enforcers will be more likely to win their initial cases in the courts of law and public opinion. Once some initial victories are achieved, further enforcement actions can build on their precedent and benefit from the more favorable political landscape.</p><h>Federalism and the advantageous position of state attorneys general</h><p>A third strategic consideration concerns the level of government at which to pursue establishment of a new antitrust regime. Ideally, aggressive enforcement should be pursued concurrently wherever possible, be that through the FTC, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Congress, or the states. However, action may not always be possible at the federal level, and in recent years the FTC and DOJ have generally looked favorably on mergers (Tepper 2019). Thus, it may be advantageous to initially pursue enforcement at the state level. A number of state attorneys general (AGs) have already begun investigations into Google and Facebook (Romm 2019), and ten state AGs recently sued to block the proposed merger between T-Mobile and Sprint (Harding McGill 2019).</p><p>Besides the possibility of short-term action, state AGs have a number of advantages as antitrust enforcers. The most important of these is that in most states they are elected politicians. This means that they are well equipped to treat antitrust as a political issue\u2014they have more reason than career bureaucrats to consider the political optics of particular stances and are more likely to be adept at communicating with the media and the public. They also stand to see personal electoral benefits from popular enforcement actions and are directly susceptible to pressure from organized advocates. State AGs thus occupy a unique position. Unlike federal enforcers at the DOJ or FTC, they are elected politicians who know how to mobilize voters and can be directly pressured to adopt procompetition stances. But unlike members of Congress, they have direct enforcement power.</p><p>A state-level strategy also offers the possibility of building enforcement momentum piecemeal. It may prove easier for antitrust advocates to secure the support of a handful of AGs, perhaps from states that are especially harmed by a particular conglomerate or potential merger, than to convince the FTC or DOJ to reverse several decades of harmful policies. As a suit progresses, other states or federal agencies may join in.</p><h>Conclusion: National Action for a National Problem</h><p>This article has considered the problem of economic divergence between regions of the United States. Over the past four decades, the United States has bifurcated economically, with increasing fractions of the population living in both exceptionally poor and exceptionally rich places. Many of the biggest challenges facing the country are intricately tied to this bifurcation, including the basic question of whether national political cohesion can be maintained. Here I have argued that the growing economic disparities among regions of the United States should be treated first and foremost as a national policy issue. This view is accurate because it takes into account the changes that have pulled regions apart, and it is valuable because it offers pathways to political action that might address the problem.</p><p>As an example of a national policy with important effects on regional economies, I have considered antitrust enforcement. Though difficult to quantify directly, the lax antitrust enforcement of the past few decades has likely contributed to the economic struggles of many cities and towns nationwide. A reinvigorated antitrust movement would thus likely disproportionately benefit those parts of the country that have been left behind. In addition to having unique characteristics that make its establishment more likely in this era of polarization and negative partisanship, antitrust offers the possibility of beneficial feedback effects that may make it easier to entrench and expand.</p><p>Antitrust is just one of many areas in which national policy shifts starting in the 1970s and 1980s exacerbated economic gaps among regions. Other policy areas include the devolution of welfare program administration from the federal government to the states (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose and Gill 2004); the relaxing of financial and telecommunications regulations; and the end of federal revenue sharing with state and local governments, which led to a dramatic increase in the fiscal stakes of regional economic competition (Pacewicz 2016). Policy-makers seeking to address regional disparities today would do well to remember the role federal action had in creating those disparities and to recognize its potential for reducing them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><h>REFERENCES</h><p>Ahern Kenneth R., Harford Jarrad,  . 2014.

Neppl[1] Foley ...rdner LLP[2] Legal News Alert[3] Criticism of antitrust enforcement efforts undertaken by the federal antitrust agencies - the FTC and DOJ (Antitrust Division) - is nothing new. Reasonable minds can differ as to whether a particular merger or conduct challenge by the agencies advances the established goal of U.S. antitrust enforcement: to protect competition for the benefit of consumers.At the same time, however, there is a broader debate over the scope of that established goal and whether the objectives of antitrust enforcement should change and the tools of enforcement should be expanded. While this debate is not new either, it often seems to accelerate in advance of elections, as presidential (and congressional) candidates sometimes embrace antitrust enforcement 'reform' as a campaign issue. As antitrust enforcement policy can dovetail with broader political themes - including populism, 'big business' power, wealth inequality, labor protections, national security, and data privacy - this should come as no surprise.The most recent and aggressive 'reform' proposals have been advocated by presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. </p><p>For example, in 2017 Senators Warren and Schumer (and others) rolled out their 'Better Deal[4]' platform for the 2018 congressional elections. That proposal called for, among other things: New 'standards' for merger reviews, including agency scrutiny of whether mergers reduce wages, cut jobs, or hinder the ability of small businesses and entrepreneurs to compete; A presumption of illegality of large mergers, unless the merging firms can establish the benefits of the deal; Post-merger deal reviews, to identify agency-approved remedies that may have failed to achieve their intended outcomes; and A new competition 'advocate,' to recommend competition investigations to the FTC and DOJ In the 2020 presidential race, some proposed antitrust enforcement reforms are eclipsing that 'Better Deal' platform in scope. For example, Bernie Sanders recently proposed[5] antitrust enforcement changes, including: Replacing the consumer welfare standard for merger reviews; Breaking up 'existing monopolies and oligopolies' that have 'accumulated dominant market share and are able to wield their market power in anti-competitive ways;' Taking 'antitrust enforcement out of the control of the captured judiciary' and allowing the agencies (or at least FTC) to 'halt mergers without challenging them in federal court;' Reviewing and, 'when necessary,' unwinding previously approved transactions; Directing the agencies to 'establish new guidelines that restrict mergers and acquisitions,' which include a 'special focus on economic security, job security, and competition,' and 'bright-line merger guidelines that set caps for vertical mergers, horizontal mergers, and total market share;' Rejecting all mergers involving companies found to engage in certain behaviors: 'No merger will be approved for companies that engage in the behaviors identified by the FTC as harming workers, competition, or fair pricing;' and Banning the 'revolving door of personnel' between industries and regulators. Proposed antitrust enforcement 'reforms' were even discussed during the fourth televised debate of Democratic Party candidates, held on October 15, 2019. Senator Warren repeated her call to break up certain consummated mergers involving 'Big Tech' firms and has proposed a 'platform utility' rule' that would bar Big Tech firms from selling products that competed with third-party vendors on the platforms controlled by those firms. Senator Warren and other candidates have repeated calls for increased agency scrutiny of mergers.Presidential primary contests often invite surprising proposals, whether politically viable or not, intended to energize a candidate's political base, and the scope of the proposals for antitrust enforcement reform is no exception. The 'New Brandeis School' view of competition, moreover, a relatively new academic proposal that challenges the 'Chicago School' focus on consumer welfare, cites market structure as a better inquiry for competition policy, recognizes that numerous federal agencies (and state governments) exercise 'antimonopoly' powers already, and proposes direct government regulation of some large firms.Below we offer some reactions to some of these proposals, focusing not on the political viability of the proposals but rather on possible effects from, and difficulties to, their implementation. Consumer Welfare Standard This standard for merger reviews has been applied by U.S. courts and antitrust authorities across Republican and Democratic administrations for many decades and generally reflects the language of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, which addresses mergers where the effect 'may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.' Section 7 does not speak to labor, environmental, corporate governance, or other possible considerations (which could be affected by a particular merger), nor does Section 7 even state a preference for 'small business' over 'big business.' Replacing the consumer welfare standard with some broader standard that considers merger impacts unhinged to 'competition' or 'competitive effects' could substantially alter the predictability of antitrust enforcement by introducing a potentially broad range of considerations not identified by Section 7 as legally relevant to merger reviews. Such considerations could even lead to the rejection of highly synergistic mergers likely to generate pro-competitive price reductions benefiting consumers, an outcome inconsistent with the current scope of Section 7. This change would presumably require congressional action. Breaking Up Monopolies and Oligopolies Section 2 of the Sherman Act already addresses monopolization, providing the antitrust agencies with legal authority to challenge abuses of monopoly power. We view this proposal not as a call for additional legislative authority but to enforce Section 2 more aggressively. One potential danger in this proposal, however, is the recognition that some businesses require significant scale (because of capital requirements, network effects, etc.) to operate with economic efficiency (for the benefit of consumers as well as other stakeholders), and other businesses may achieve significant scale simply by outperforming their competitors. Current Section 2 jurisprudence, however, requires proof that a business has engaged in anticompetitive conduct to achieve or maintain monopoly power, not merely some ability to 'wield their market power in anti-competitive ways.' Applying an ability standard could threaten economically efficient scale achieved through superior business acumen, an outcome contrary to current Section 2 jurisprudence. Antitrust Agency Merger Halt Authority FTC and DOJ currently have no such power under the Clayton Act; rather, as with most dispute resolution in the United States, the federal courts are called upon to adjudicate merger challenges. (While FTC does have administrative authority to challenge mergers, FTC routinely seeks a preliminary injunction in federal court to prevent a deal from closing while FTC's administrative challenge is pending.) This use of federal courts to adjudicate merger challenges is consistent with the American concepts of due process and 'having one's day in court.' And the suggestion in one proposal, that the federal judiciary has been 'captured,' is belied by the fact that FTC and DOJ both 'win some and lose some' merger challenges. If the federal judiciary has been 'captured,' it is not obvious by whom. Unwind Previously Approved Transactions FTC and DOJ have this power already. Merger clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act (HSR) does not estop the agencies from later challenging a transaction, although once cleared such challenges are rare. In contrast, agency challenges to non-reportable and consummated transactions are not uncommon. A merger pre-clearance process such as HSR - which (presently) carries with it a high degree of review finality - is important to business confidence. New Merger Guidelines New merger guidelines that reflect non-competition considerations (such as job security) would modify the consumer welfare standard discussed above and, in the absence of new statutory authority, likely contravene Section 7 of the Clayton Act as currently drafted. One problem with such 'new guidelines' - unhinged from 'competition' or 'competitive effects' - is that successive administrations might amend (or reinterpret) such guidelines in response to whatever political issue du jour allowed that administration to win political power. While antitrust enforcement is not free of politics currently (i.e., the President does nominate the Assistant Attorney General (Antitrust Division), appoint the FTC Chairperson, and nominate FTC commissioners when openings arise, and the House and Senate subcommittees with antitrust enforcement oversight regularly hold hearings on high-profile mergers), both DOJ and FTC have a respectable history of pursuing enforcement efforts generally free from partisan politics. The issuance of new merger guidelines that reflect non-competition considerations may open the door to regular amendments to the guidelines and increase the likelihood that partisan politics could replace factual and economic analysis in merger evaluations. Such an outcome would not promote business confidence. Moreover, 'bright-line' merger guidelines - setting caps for vertical mergers, horizontal mergers, and total market share - would ignore the fact that vertical foreclosure risks and 'market power' are in practice not so easily quantifiable. The agencies already employ market share screens (such as HHI) to identify those mergers more likely to require close scrutiny. Bright-line caps, however, would necessarily threaten certain mergers that are competitively neutral, or even pro-competitive, through resulting efficiencies and synergies. Rejecting Mergers Based on Behaviors Blocking mergers based on agency findings of behavior 'harmful' to 'workers, competition, or fair pricing' opens the door to agency consideration of various non-merger-specific criteria. As market forces generally determine pricing, how would FTC and DOJ ascertain 'fair' pricing or practices 'harmful' to workers? Identifying and evaluating merger-specific competitive effects is already a challenge. Inserting additional behavioral criteria into the review mix potentially could convert the antitrust agencies from competition advocates into de facto labor and price regulators, reflecting a significant transformation from their present purpose as competition advocates. AAG Delrahim has previously expressed concern with merger-specific behavioral remedies based in part on a view that such remedies often require agency monitoring, imposing on DOJ regulator (as opposed to law enforcement) functions. Inserting behavioral criteria into the merger evaluation process could elevate this concern.While criticism of specific antitrust enforcement efforts by FTC and DOJ may sometimes be justified, proposals to transform the mission of these agencies should be approached with care and recognition of the possible effects of their implementation. 2019 Foley ...rdner LLP [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.natlawreview.com/author/gregory-e-neppl\">https://www.natlawreview.com/author/gregory-e-neppl</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.natlawreview.com/organization/foley-lardner-llp\">https://www.natlawreview.com/organization/foley-lardner-llp</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.foley.com/en/insights\">http://www.foley.com/en/insights</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2017/07/A-Better-Deal-on-Competition-and-Costs-1.pdf\">https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2017/07/A-Better-Deal-on-Competition-and-Costs-1.pdf</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://berniesanders.com/issues/corporate-accountability-and-democracy/\">https://berniesanders.com/issues/corporate-accountability-and-democracy/</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-NTLR1207091573234246436757761700091</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NTLR-120709</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFV-86W1-JCMN-Y1WX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1977\"/><timeReceived>5:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>National Law Review</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 8, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Corporate Business Organizations</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Antitrust Trade Regulation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Election Law / Legislative News</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>All Federal</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

If the agency ultimately delivers related antitrust guidance, as Chairman Joe Simons suggested, some expect it in 2020. Critics claim the standard contributed to lax antitrust enforcement, but one expert said that narrow discussion is distracting from broader antitrust doctrine concerns, which led to enforcement failings. The FTC didn't comment Monday.</p><p>The agency plans a \"fresh look\" at the consumer welfare standard and potential alternatives for antitrust enforcement, Simons said in November (see 1911180054). He also noted agency plans to issue antitrust guidance for digital markets. DOJ Antitrust Division Chief Makan Delrahim expressed interest in collaborating on joint guidance. Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter agreed with the need for review, saying there could be better standards to drive enforcement. The agency hosted policy hearings in 2018, with much discussion on consumer welfare (see 1809210056).</p><p>The major concern is the standard leads to undue focus on price, which is problematic given free models from \"free\" services like Google and Facebook, said Public Knowledge Senior Policy Counsel Charlotte Slaiman. The standard is supposed to include impacts on innovation, consumer choice and quality of product features like privacy. A related guidance document could be the result of what the agency learned from the 2018 hearings.</p><p>Claims the consumer welfare standard focuses entirely on price and doesn't account for innovation are \"plainly\" wrong, said Stanford University law professor Doug Melamed. Given importance of the political controversy over the principle, it makes sense Simons offered his \"fresh look\" comments, Melamed said, and maybe it makes sense to study the standard further. But the consumer welfare standard is \"working fine,\" and the discussion about it is a distraction from broader enforcement issues, said Melamed. The standard has been implemented with an excessive unwillingness to run a risk of false positives to avoid any risk of false negatives, he said.</p><p>Strengthening competition enforcement might require new laws, potentially a new agency, to focus directly on big tech, Slaiman said. Another alternative is establishing new authorities within the existing agencies.</p><p>The standard has evolved for decades, so expect it to continue evolving, said International Center for Law &amp; Economics Associate Director Kristian Stout. The standard is working as intended, but it's part of the common law process that has characterized antitrust since the 1890 Sherman Act, he emailed: \"The core value of the standard is that it focuses enforcers' attention on how both business practice and enforcement affects consumers ultimately -- that's the right metric and I expect the FTC will continue to use that as its guide star.\"</p><p>Given the overlap between privacy and free models, maybe it makes sense to develop a regulatory regime that can directly apply to big tech models, said antitrust lawyer Alicia Downey. She noted antitrust guidance is influential but nonbinding and won't dictate the outcome of litigation. If the FTC delivers guidance, expect it in 2020, she said: It's key the FTC and DOJ are in agreement because the most important thing to business is clarity on enforcement.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY2-PYG1-DYRJ-03T5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"555\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 07, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

He watched the majority of the House Judiciary Committee hearing earlier this week with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Reback still remembers a Senate hearing that put pressure on the government and led to the filing of United States v. Microsoft Corporation in 1998. That's why he focused more on lines of questioning this week than on answers from CEOs of companies that have amassed unprecedented wealth and power. 'To me, the core turning point was right at the beginning, basically,' he said, pointing to sharp and detailed questioning in reference to a range of documents obtained in the course of the committee's assessment. The question on Wednesday was whether tech giants have grown too powerful, and if you watched the hearings, many members of Congress leave no doubt that they believe the answer is yes. </p><p>In his opening remarks, for example, U.S. House Antitrust subcommittee chair David Cicilline (D-RI) said tech giants enjoy the power to pick winners and losers in the private market and that consumers have 'no escape from surveillance' because there are no alternatives. He added 'What's at stake is whether we let ourselves be governed by private monopolies.' VentureBeat spoke with Reback and other antitrust experts about what stood out during the hearing and what should happen next. Each favors some form of action or legislation to address the litany of anticompetitive practice allegations that emerged over nearly six hours of testimony.'We may have run out of options'During the hearing, a number of Democratic lawmakers argued that Washington needs to take steps to ensure a fair market. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) insisted that existing antitrust law is fine but needs enforcement. Reback pointed out that convoluted antitrust law makes it difficult to bring cases to court. He said Sensenbrenner was correct in the sense that new legislation might not have been necessary if action had been taken earlier, but he stressed that there isn't much antitrust enforcement happening today. Reback blamed the outsized growth of tech giants in part on the Obama administration's failure to take action. Nobody who understands antitrust law would suggest implementing restrictions cavalierly, Reback said, but regulators have already waited so long that it's tough to see any viable alternative to reform. 'By not doing anything for so long, we may have run out of options,' Reback said. 'The way anticompetitive practices work, if you deal with them quickly, if you deal with them in a rifle shot, you fix it and the companies go on competing and everything's fine. But if you don't fix it, then market power builds up and builds up and, in the case we have here, there are no competitors basically for at least three of these companies. They bought their competitors, put them out of business, whatever. And so that then is a problem in terms of how you expect a free market to fix this.' For context: Apple reported nearly $60 billion in profits and became the world's most valuable company on Friday[2]. On Thursday, Amazon reported revenue up 40%[3] to $88.9 billion, while Google's parent company Alphabet[4] and Facebook[5] reported revenue above analysts' estimates. Each of these companies has been accused of anticompetitive practices that harm democracy, consumers, and small businesses. And each enjoys majority control in a number of industry verticals, including:Facebook's control of social media platforms Facebook and InstagramApple and Google's control of mobile app markets Google's control in search Facebook and Google's control of online advertising Amazon's online shopping platform, which records nearly 75% of online sales Facebook's and Google's control of digital advertising, which has hurt journalism industry revenueStacy Mitchell is codirector of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR), a nonprofit organization that champions distributed, local control over corporate power. She found the committee to be very knowledgeable about how the four companies conduct business and argued that Amazon has a monopolistic hold on small businesses. Last week, Mitchell resigned her position as a fellow at the Yale University Thurmond Arnold Project, a group studying antitrust issues, after finding out that director Fiona Scott Morton is a paid advisor to Amazon and Apple[6]. ILSR also researches Amazon's anticompetitive practices and advocates breaking the ecommerce giant into separate companies. Mitchell watched the hearing with interest. 'I found it thrilling, really,' she said. 'Like, 'Oh, this is what it looks like when a democratic government actually addresses fundamental issues of power and control and takes an aggressive stance toward CEOs and really in some ways alters the power dynamics.'' She said an exchange between Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-PA) and Jeff Bezos during this week's antitrust hearing demonstrated the need for this kind of intervention. Under questioning, Bezos confirmed that the Buy Box algorithm favors products shipped with Prime and Amazon fulfillment services[7]. Bezos also said Amazon ties the use of its fulfillment services to winning the Buy Box. Mitchell highlighted the obvious pressure this puts on sellers. 'This is a pretty serious matter because effectively what Amazon has done is it has compelled sellers to use Amazon's fulfillment services in order to get the kind of placement on the site that actually results in sales.' Scanlon also cited a report ILSR released last week[8] that found Amazon pockets about 30% of sales from independent sellers, up from 19% five years ago. The fee brought in nearly twice the revenue Amazon Web Services did, and Mitchell said Amazon uses the money to subsidize other company divisions and dominate new industry verticals. That's part of why ILSR supports breaking major Amazon divisions into individual companies. 'Much of its power, and abuse of its power, comes from it being able to leverage one part of its operation to compel someone to do something in another part of its operation, like we were talking about with the fulfillment. A lot of the abuse lives in the in-between, and I think that's a pretty powerful case,' Mitchell said. In testimony Wednesday, Cicilline noted that Amazon internally refers to third-party sellers as 'internal competitors.' Bezos said Wednesday that he 'cannot guarantee' Amazon employees have not used data[9] about independent sellers to create the company's own products, which would be a violation of company policy. Lawmakers argued this practice undercuts small businesses that have no option but to sell their goods on Amazon's online marketplace. The Wall Street Journal reported in April that Amazon employees[10] used data about individual sellers to create competing Amazon products. Anticompetitive behavior accusations have also been lobbed at Amazon by startups who participated in its Alexa Fund, including Nucleus, which says Amazon stole its smart display and home intercom concept. AI startup DefinedCrowd and more than two dozen startup founders detailed similar practices last week[11]. Rep. Joe Neguse (D-CO) referred to this practice as an 'innovation kill zone' that puts fear into smaller businesses and makes fair competition impossible. During the hearing, Apple, Facebook, and Google were also accused of stealing ideas from other companies. (Each of the tech giants has growing investment fund arms.) 'Three of the companies [Amazon, Facebook, and Google] basically have the same set of accusations against them, which is that competitors come on your platform, you take their information, you preference your own results, compete against them, drive them out of business, or buy them cheap,' Reback said.Big tech too big for free markets?Both Mitchell and Reback repeatedly emphasized the contrast between the tone of the hearing Wednesday and congressional hearings held in 2018 following the Cambridge Analytica scandal with Mark Zuckerberg[12]. In that earlier hearing, members of Congress demonstrated an inability to understand technology or how Facebook applications work. What seemed to be missing back then, Mitchell and Reback said \u2014 but could be seen in exchanges Wednesday \u2014 was the ability to ask followup questions. Without a grasp of how a company operates, or its products and services, any line of questioning will yield little beyond the initial question. CEOs can then run out a portion of the five minutes allotted to each elected official by explaining technology or offering platitudes about how much their companies value things like privacy. Mitchell said the recent antitrust hearing had a different tone. 'This clearly was proceeding as part of an investigation and sort of had the feel of 'We've gathered all this data or information, and the process is that we're going to give you a chance to answer for it,'' Mitchell said. Sally Hubbard is director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute and testified before a House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust at its first big tech hearing in June 2019[13]. Last summer, Hubbard testified that Facebook and Google use their digital advertising monopoly in multiple ways to disadvantage independent journalism and newspapers that are deemed competitors. Both companies directly compete with the free press for attention while controlling the main traffic highways of search engines, smartphones, and social media. She said the hearing Wednesday in part restored her faith in democracy and institutions and gave her hope that meaningful action is possible. 'To me, it was the most impressive hearing that I can remember seeing in my lifetime of the members of Congress being so highly prepared, so in-the-know about complex issues, and willing to take on the most powerful companies in America and the world,' Hubbard said.Break up big tech?Hubbard said she could see the rollback of acquisitions like Google's AdMob and DoubleClick or Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp as part of potential solutions, but she pointed out that such measures aren't the only option. She wants lawsuits filed when anticompetitive behavior like the kind described in the hearing occurs, ongoing monitoring of exclusionary conduct, and scrutiny of mergers, especially acquisitions of small companies that may be viewed as a competitive threat. She also recommended passing legislation to support Senator Elizabeth Warren's (D-MA) suggestion that you can own a platform or sell goods on it, but you can't do both. Reback agrees. 'If we can't get antitrust enforcement on [these companies] we need legislation like the type Elizabeth Warren is suggesting, where if you own the platform then you can't own anything on it. That would be a big change, but if there's no way to police the [current] situation so that competitors get a fair shot and you don't run everybody else out of business by using their data against them, if there's no way to police that, then you don't have any alternative but new legislation,' he said. On the topic of the digital ad market's negative impact on journalism in the United States, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) talked Wednesday with Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai about Google's AdExchange operating in a way that resembles insider trading, adding in the context of independent news outlets. There's nothing revolutionary about stopping a single company from controlling both sides of the market to prevent adverse outcomes that resemble insider trading, and it's past time to bring the same concepts to the digital economy, Hubbard said. 'The point that I like to make a lot is that the online world somehow has avoided regulation, but it's not the cute little internet of the '90s anymore. The online world has basically eaten the offline world, so if we don't have any rules or regulations governing the online world or fair competition, then you don't have them in the offline world either,' Hubbard said, adding that the hearing will add momentum to other antimonopoly efforts and will help educate the public. Mitchell concluded that the hearing itself was just one step in the process and the committee's final report will convey the actual substance of the debate.

At its most basic, antitrust is regulation restricting certain business arrangements and decisions. In the U.S., the\u00a0stated aim\u00a0of antitrust law is preserving competition in the marketplace to the benefit of consumers.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Why was antitrust created and what's its history in the U.S.?</emphasis><br/>The earliest impulses towards federal antitrust legislation grew out of dissatisfaction with the railroads of the late nineteenth century, which were themselves government granted monopolies. When the problematic results of this government-created uneven playing field began to surface, so did political alliances calling for corrective government action. To that end, rate discrimination was outlawed with the passage of The Interstate Commerce Act passed in 1887. By 1888, antitrust planks appeared in both of the major political party's platforms.<br/>The most contentious point of antitrust law debate was to follow; Congress passed the Sherman Act in 1890. Whether the intent of the lawmakers was consumer welfare, outlawing certain business practices, preventing cartels, or blocking mergers has been the subject of debate ever since. Section I of the Sherman Act prohibits contracts, combinations, and conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce. Section II outlaws monopolization, conspiracies, and attempts to monopolize. There are also criminal consequences for violations and obligations for federal officers to institute equity proceedings on behalf of the public good.<br/>A series of court cases that were contradictory in their reasoning followed:\u00a0United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association,\u00a0Standard Oil Company of New Jersey v. United States\u00a0and, much later,\u00a0United States v. Alcoa.<br/>The Democratic Congress of 1914 made a two-pronged attempt to strengthen antitrust policy. The House created the Federal Trade Commission, while the Senate took the lead in creating the Clayton Act that same year. The Act attempted to provide clarity to the courts by expressing naming prohibited practices and forbade\u00a0tying\u00a0and\u00a0exclusive dealing\u00a0in situations where the practice could significantly reduce competition.<br/>The next century saw continued ambiguity and action in antitrust law.\u00a0 Cases included numerous\u00a0suits against IBM, the\u00a0National Bell telephone system being broken into so-called Baby Bells\u00a0by consent decree, and the case against\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0in the late 1990s.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was it effective in achieving its objective?</emphasis><br/>Since the true aim of antitrust law has been unclear from its inception, it's difficult to claim the policy has been a success. But the Microsoft trial is a useful example of the intrinsic failures of antitrust policy.<br/>The software company was accused of using anti-competitive means to leverage its monopoly of the Windows operating system to gain dominance in other markets.\u00a0 Specifically, Microsoft was forcing original equipment manufacturers and Internet service providers into exclusionary agreements, pricing the Internet Explorer browser at a predatory level, and bundling the browser in the Windows 98 operating system.\u00a0Microsoft settled the case in 2001, avoiding the harsh remedy of being split up by instead agreeing to allow rivals to integrate their software into the Windows operating system.<br/>The charges against Microsoft ring hollow to readers today. And for good reason; the market was already responding to technological changes toward high-speed Internet, web-based computing and ultimately today's handheld devices that render Microsoft's dominance in PCs vastly less influential. The charges illustrate that government antitrust enforcement is perilously slow compared to the creative destruction of the marketplace and highlight the hubris of regulators who think they can know the future of technology.\u00a0 Years of litigation and millions of dollars later, the case against Microsoft seems silly, wasteful, and superfluous - because it was.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Did it have any other effects?</emphasis><br/>The real cost of antitrust is the innovation it prevents, therefore it's hard to quantify the extent and specifics of the harmful, unintended consequences. But undeniably, the looming threat of antitrust action has hindered business decisions that may have proved beneficial for consumers and wealth accumulation by entrepreneurs.\u00a0 Antitrust has also certainly cost taxpayers plenty in public enforcement. Antitrust action has also introduced\u00a0a public choice problem\u00a0in that regulators may exercise their powers to promote their own preferred policy positions. This dynamic leads to intense lobbying by regulated entities for both relief from antitrust regulation and for benefits of barriers to entry that limit competition from new entrants in the market. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What alternatives to antitrust exist?</emphasis><br/>Creative destruction in the unfettered marketplace is a much better guarantor of consumer benefit than clumsy antitrust law. Economist Joseph Schumpeter aptly identifies creative destruction as the positive force that drives innovation and raises standards of living for consumers. It was this creative destructive in the marketplace, not antitrust law, that displaced Kodak, Blockbuster, MySpace, local taxi monopolies, and many more. Capitalism\u00a0has lifted more people out of poverty than any other socioeconomic system\u00a0ever attempted. Antitrust regulation slows this engine of growth, rather than improving it.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are those alternatives more or less effective?</emphasis><br/>Markets move faster and have\u00a0better information\u00a0than regulators.\u00a0 No depth of expert knowledge can rival the price signals and inherent incentives of the marketplace. Bureaucrats cannot predict the future and have failed, often tragically, when they attempt to do so. Markets are also more reliably objective than the whim of regulators or politicians. Federal Trade Commission regulators and Department of Justice lawyers are only human and commensurately vulnerable to biases and opinions.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What is Hipster Antitrust?</emphasis><br/>Sometimes called \"hipster antitrust\" or \"the new Brandeis School,\" there is a resurgent line of attack from enthusiasts for antitrust regulation that emphasizes that company size and consolidation are problematic in themselves, and that therefore companies like Amazon and Google should be the subject of antitrust action even if they are not monopolies in any generally-accepted sense. As such, far from being a new school of antitrust, it represents a throwback to the \"big is bad\" approach that characterized antitrust action before the adoption of the consumer welfare standard. Furthermore, the \"hipster antitrust\" approach has so far failed to\u00a0substantiate its claims, while its supposed benefits are speculative. Its approach therefore appears subject to the same criticisms outlined above.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What's the best way forward?</emphasis><br/>The Competitive Enterprise Institutes advocates abolishing antitrust law, removing the remaining government monopolies, and preventing the creation of new ones. It's the barriers to creative destruction caused by over-regulation that should be removed.\u00a0 For example, eliminating the financial regulation that makes launching an initial public offering of stock prohibitively expensive would spur more creative destruction in the marketplace. On the flip side of the coin, new regulation of today's big tech firms could do more to lock their dominance into place than to restrain them. If today's gang of FANG is allowed to trade curtailed behavior for barriers to entry of tomorrow's competitive threat, innovation will slow and consumers will suffer. Let the lawyers stamp out fraud and let the market do its job.<br/>Date:\u00a0Tuesday, November 27, 2018Experts:\u00a0Jessica MeluginRyan RadiaIain MurrayClyde Wayne CrewsPublication Type:\u00a0Web Memo         </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-43587</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRK1-F03R-W3XP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1312\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 CEI, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Competitive Enterprise Institute</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 27, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002PGX</classCode><className>ALCOA CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS331313 ALUMINA REFINING &amp;

The hearing is part of a probe into \"online platforms and market power.\" \"People are feeling frustrated with the way our society is organized, and antitrust is one tool to go after powerful companies,\" said Avery Gardiner, an antitrust expert at the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology.  Antitrust fever hits a peak in Washington this week with lawmakers set to grill top executives of four of the biggest US technology firms in what promises to be a rare political spectacle for the digital era.    The showdown Wednesday in the House of Representatives comes amid rising concerns over Big Tech dominance, which has become even more pronounced during the coronavirus pandemic.   The unprecedented joint appearance in the House Judiciary Committee will include chief executives Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google and its parent firm Alphabet. All will testify remotely.   The hearing is part of a probe into \"online platforms and market power,\" taking place as US federal agencies and states conduct their own investigations.   \"This is the Super Bowl of antitrust,\" said Avery Gardiner, an antitrust expert at the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology.   She said the hearing offers a timely way to focus on key issues around competition and concentration of economic power.   \"People are feeling frustrated with the way our society is organized, and antitrust is one tool to go after powerful companies,\" she said.   But current US antitrust laws make it difficult for enforcers to target companies simply for being large or dominant without showing harm to consumers or abuse of market power.    Because of that, \"the real purpose of the hearing is theatrical, and tied to the politicians' electoral interests,\" said Christopher Sagers, a law professor specializing in antitrust at Cleveland State University.   Eric Goldman, director of the High-Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said politicians see a benefit in attacking the tech firms and ironically, \"they will be looking for that viral YouTube moment.\"   The hearing takes place against a backdrop of antitrust investigations that are underway involving the US Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and nearly all state law enforcement agencies as well as authorities in Europe and elsewhere.   Muddying the waters   But the antitrust debate is being muddled by rising \"techlash\" over a range of issues from privacy to economic inequality.    Social media giants face attacks for allegedly using their dominance to stifle free speech due to a bias against conservatives, a claim made by President Donald Trump.   Other activists argue Facebook fails to curb hateful content promoting violence, including from Trump.   Any effort to use antitrust laws to enforce free speech would run into constitutional concerns, raising the specter of a \"government censor,\" according to Sagers.   \"My fear is that members of Congress will have a hard time sticking to antitrust and we'll hear a lot of questions about privacy, content moderation, worker conditions,\" said Gardiner.   \"These are important issues, but they are not about antitrust.\"   Facebook could come under scrutiny for its acquisition of nascent rivals which critics say squelched competition and increased its dominance of social media, according to Sagers.   Smaller rivals have long complained about the difficulties of competing against the giants: Yelp argues that Google favours its own sites and demotes the rival review service; Spotify says Apple Music has an unfair advantage on the iPhone maker's platform.    Slow wheels of change   Experts say there are limited remedies under existing law and precedent to deal with tech platform dominance.   But any quick revision of antitrust law seems unlikely, given the muddled political picture and Congress' slowness.   Antitrust enforcers face a delicate task because \"it is not illegal to be big,\" said Gardiner.   Investigators must identify \"abuse of market power\" which is difficult to define, she said.   Even then, it may be hard to craft a remedy in the public interest because of the benefits offered by the massive scale of the tech platforms.   \"You don't want to have to check 11 different social media sites for pictures of your kids on Halloween,\" Gardiner said.   \"There is a benefit to having more people on the platform.\"   Still, Gardiner sees a strong possibility of at least one antitrust lawsuit being filed this year, although \"I don't expect a resolution for at least three years.\"   Some analysts say antitrust enforcement may not be best way to deal with the abuses of dominant firms in areas such as privacy, fairness and data protection.   \"Antitrust cannot be the sole tool to address all the thorny issues that the platforms present,\" said Charlotte Slaiman of the consumer nonprofit group Public Knowledge.   \"The best solution would be creating a new digital platform-focused agency to regulate the platforms.

INTERNATIONAL NEWS - Antitrust fever hits a peak in Washington this week with lawmakers set to grill top executives of four of the biggest US technology firms in what promises to be a rare political spectacle for the digital era.   The showdown Wednesday in the House of Representatives comes amid rising concerns over Big Tech dominance, which has become even more pronounced during the coronavirus pandemic.   The unprecedented joint appearance in the House Judiciary Committee will include chief executives Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google and its parent firm Alphabet. All will testify remotely.   The hearing is part of a probe into \"online platforms and market power,\" taking place as US federal agencies and states conduct their own investigations.   \"This is the Super Bowl of antitrust,\" said Avery Gardiner, an antitrust expert at the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology.   She said the hearing offers a timely way to focus on key issues around competition and concentration of economic power.   \"People are feeling frustrated with the way our society is organized, and antitrust is one tool to go after powerful companies,\" she said.   But current US antitrust laws make it difficult for enforcers to target companies simply for being large or dominant without showing harm to consumers or abuse of market power.   Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Google's Sundar Pichai, Apple's Tim Cook and Amazon's Jeff Bezos are set to testify at a hearing in Congress on \"online platforms and market dominance\"   Because of that, \"the real purpose of the hearing is theatrical, and tied to the politicians' electoral interests,\" said Christopher Sagers, a law professor specializing in antitrust at Cleveland State University.   Eric Goldman, director of the High-Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said politicians see a benefit in attacking the tech firms and ironically, \"they will be looking for that viral YouTube moment.\"   The hearing takes place against a backdrop of antitrust investigations that are underway involving the US Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and nearly all state law enforcement agencies as well as authorities in Europe and elsewhere.   Muddying the waters   But the antitrust debate is being muddled by rising \"techlash\" over a range of issues from privacy to economic inequality.   Social media giants face attacks for allegedly using their dominance to stifle free speech due to a bias against conservatives, a claim made by President Donald Trump.   Other activists argue Facebook fails to curb hateful content promoting violence, including from Trump.   Any effort to use antitrust laws to enforce free speech would run into constitutional concerns, raising the specter of a \"government censor,\" according to Sagers.   \"My fear is that members of Congress will have a hard time sticking to antitrust and we'll hear a lof of questions about privacy, content moderation, worker conditions,\" said Gardiner.   \"These are important issues, but they are not about antitrust.\"   Facebook could come under scrutiny for its acquisition of nascent rivals which critics say squelched competition and increased its dominance of social media, according to Sagers.   Smaller rivals have long complained about the difficulties of competing against the giants: Yelp argues that Google favors its own sites and demotes the rival review service; Spotify says Apple Music has an unfair advantage on the iPhone maker's platform.   Slow wheels of change   Experts say there are limited remedies under existing law and precedent to deal with tech platform dominance.   But any quick revision of antitrust law seems unlikely, given the muddled political picture and Congress' slowness.   Antitrust enforcers face a delicate task because \"it is not illegal to be big,\" said Gardiner.   Investigators must identify \"abuse of market power\" which is difficult to define, she said.   Even then, it may be hard to craft a remedy in the public interest because of the benefits offered by the massive scale of the tech platforms.   \"You don't want to have to check 11 different social media sites for pictures of your kids on Halloween,\" Gardiner said.   \"There is a benefit to having more people on the platform.\"   Still, Gardiner sees a strong possibility of at least one antitrust lawsuit being filed this year, although \"I don't expect a resolution for at least three years.\"   Some analysts say antitrust enforcement may not be best way to deal with the abuses of dominant firms in areas such as privacy, fairness and data protection.   \"Antitrust cannot be the sole tool to address all the thorny issues that the platforms present,\" said Charlotte Slaiman of the consumer nonprofit group Public Knowledge.   \"The best solution would be creating a new digital platform-focused agency to regulate the platforms. Because antitrust cannot do enough by itself to expand competition and innovation, such an agency is needed to rein in potential abuses by dominant platforms.\"            Posted on: 15:30 Tue, 28 July 2020                   Back to Top</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNAF-42704096729</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNAF2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FX-80Y1-JCSC-J139-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">435761</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"933\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Mossel Bay Advertiser</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - Afrikaans</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>AFRIKAANS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>CENTER FOR DEMOCRACY &amp;

The showdown Wednesday in the House of Representatives comes amid rising concerns over Big Tech dominance, which has become even more pronounced during the coronavirus pandemic.   The unprecedented joint appearance in the House Judiciary Committee will include chief executives Tim Cook of Apple , Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google and its parent firm Alphabet. All will testify remotely.   The hearing is part of a probe into \"online platforms and market power,\" taking place as US federal agencies and states conduct their own investigations.   \"This is the Super Bowl of antitrust,\" said Avery Gardiner, an antitrust expert at the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology .   She said the hearing offers a timely way to focus on key issues around competition and concentration of economic power.   \"People are feeling frustrated with the way our society is organized, and antitrust is one tool to go after powerful companies,\" she said.   But current US antitrust laws make it difficult for enforcers to target companies simply for being large or dominant without showing harm to consumers or abuse of market power.   Because of that, \"the real purpose of the hearing is theatrical, and tied to the politicians' electoral interests,\" said Christopher Sagers, a law professor specializing in antitrust at Cleveland State University.   Eric Goldman, director of the High-Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said politicians see a benefit in attacking the tech firms and ironically, \"they will be looking for that viral YouTube moment.\" The hearing takes place against a backdrop of antitrust investigations that are underway involving the US Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and nearly all state law enforcement agencies as well as authorities in Europe and elsewhere.   - Muddying the waters - But the antitrust debate is being muddled by rising \"techlash\" over a range of issues from privacy to economic inequality.   Social media giants face attacks for allegedly using their dominance to stifle free speech due to a bias against conservatives, a claim made by President Donald Trump .   Other activists argue Facebook fails to curb hateful content promoting violence, including from  Trump .        Any effort to use antitrust laws to enforce free speech would run into constitutional concerns, raising the specter of a \" government censor,\" according to Sagers.   \"My fear is that members of Congress will have a hard time sticking to antitrust and we'll hear a lof of questions about privacy, content moderation, worker conditions,\" said Gardiner.   \"These are important issues, but they are not about antitrust.\" Facebook could come under scrutiny for its acquisition of nascent rivals which critics say squelched competition and increased its dominance of social media , according to Sagers.   Smaller rivals have long complained about the difficulties of competing against the giants: Yelp argues that Google favors its own sites and demotes the rival review service; Spotify says Apple  Music has an unfair advantage on the iPhone maker's platform.   - Slow wheels of change - Experts say there are limited remedies under existing law and precedent to deal with tech platform dominance.   But any quick revision of antitrust law seems unlikely, given the muddled political picture and Congress ' slowness.   Antitrust enforcers face a delicate task because \"it is not illegal to be big,\" said Gardiner.   Investigators must identify \"abuse of market power\" which is difficult to define, she said.   Even then, it may be hard to craft a remedy in the public interest because of the benefits offered by the massive scale of the tech platforms.   \"You don't want to have to check 11 different social media sites for pictures of your kids on Halloween,\" Gardiner said.   \"There is a benefit to having more people on the platform.\" Still, Gardiner sees a strong possibility of at least one antitrust lawsuit being filed this year, although \"I don't expect a resolution for at least three years.\" Some analysts say antitrust enforcement may not be best way to deal with the abuses of dominant firms in areas such as privacy, fairness and data protection.   \"Antitrust cannot be the sole tool to address all the thorny issues that the platforms present,\" said Charlotte Slaiman of the consumer nonprofit group Public Knowledge.   \"The best solution would be creating a new digital platform-focused agency to regulate the platforms. Because antitrust cannot do enough by itself to expand competition and innovation, such an agency is needed to rein in potential abuses by dominant platforms.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42696785284</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FT-28G1-JCSC-J0X7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"866\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>UrduPoint.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>CENTER FOR DEMOCRACY &amp;

The showdown Wednesday in the House of Represen...</p><p>Antitrust fever hits a peak in Washington this week with lawmakers set to grill top executives of four of the biggest US technology firms in what promises to be a rare political spectacle for the digital era.   The showdown Wednesday in the House of Representatives comes amid rising concerns over Big Tech dominance, which has become even more pronounced during the coronavirus pandemic.         The unprecedented joint appearance in the House Judiciary Committee will include chief executives Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Google and its parent firm Alphabet. All will testify remotely.         The hearing is part of a probe into \"online platforms and market power,\" taking place as US federal agencies and states conduct their own investigations.   \"This is the Super Bowl of antitrust,\" said Avery Gardiner, an antitrust expert at the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology.   She said the hearing offers a timely way to focus on key issues around competition and concentration of economic power.   \"People are feeling frustrated with the way our society is organized, and antitrust is one tool to go after powerful companies,\" she said.   But current US antitrust laws make it difficult for enforcers to target companies simply for being large or dominant without showing harm to consumers or abuse of market power.   Because of that, \"the real purpose of the hearing is theatrical, and tied to the politicians' electoral interests,\" said Christopher Sagers, a law professor specializing in antitrust at Cleveland State University.   Eric Goldman, director of the High-Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said politicians see a benefit in attacking the tech firms and ironically, \"they will be looking for that viral YouTube moment.\"   The hearing takes place against a backdrop of antitrust investigations that are underway involving the US Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and nearly all state law enforcement agencies as well as authorities in Europe and elsewhere.   - Muddying the waters -   But the antitrust debate is being muddled by rising \"techlash\" over a range of issues from privacy to economic inequality.   Social media giants face attacks for allegedly using their dominance to stifle free speech due to a bias against conservatives, a claim made by President Donald Trump.   Other activists argue Facebook fails to curb hateful content promoting violence, including from Trump.   Any effort to use antitrust laws to enforce free speech would run into constitutional concerns, raising the specter of a \"government censor,\" according to Sagers.   \"My fear is that members of Congress will have a hard time sticking to antitrust and we'll hear a lof of questions about privacy, content moderation, worker conditions,\" said Gardiner.   \"These are important issues, but they are not about antitrust.\"   Facebook could come under scrutiny for its acquisition of nascent rivals which critics say squelched competition and increased its dominance of social media, according to Sagers.   Smaller rivals have long complained about the difficulties of competing against the giants: Yelp argues that Google favors its own sites and demotes the rival review service; Spotify says Apple Music has an unfair advantage on the iPhone maker's platform.   - Slow wheels of change -   Experts say there are limited remedies under existing law and precedent to deal with tech platform dominance.   But any quick revision of antitrust law seems unlikely, given the muddled political picture and Congress' slowness.   Antitrust enforcers face a delicate task because \"it is not illegal to be big,\" said Gardiner.   Investigators must identify \"abuse of market power\" which is difficult to define, she said.   Even then, it may be hard to craft a remedy in the public interest because of the benefits offered by the massive scale of the tech platforms.   \"You don't want to have to check 11 different social media sites for pictures of your kids on Halloween,\" Gardiner said.   \"There is a benefit to having more people on the platform.\"   Still, Gardiner sees a strong possibility of at least one antitrust lawsuit being filed this year, although \"I don't expect a resolution for at least three years.\"   Some analysts say antitrust enforcement may not be best way to deal with the abuses of dominant firms in areas such as privacy, fairness and data protection.   \"Antitrust cannot be the sole tool to address all the thorny issues that the platforms present,\" said Charlotte Slaiman of the consumer nonprofit group Public Knowledge.   \"The best solution would be creating a new digital platform-focused agency to regulate the platforms. Because antitrust cannot do enough by itself to expand competition and innovation, such an agency is needed to rein in potential abuses by dominant platforms.\"   rl/jh</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42696415623</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FT-28M1-JCSC-J4C3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"858\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>MSN South Africa</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>CENTER FOR DEMOCRACY &amp;

Or taking quizzes that determined which celebrity they might have been in a previous life. Now that users realize that information is sold to advertisers for a handsome fee and used to pitch new restaurants, movies and even clothes and cars to them, some feel differently, said Makan Delrahim, the assistant attorney general for antitrust enforcement appointed by President Trump.Such concerns, fueled by the revelation that a consultant linked to Trump's 2016 campaign improperly accessed Facebook data to sway voters, has prompted an \"arms race\" to impose new regulations on large digital-platform operators that aren't well thought-out and may do more harm than good,\" Delrahim said in a Thursday speech at the University of Chicago.Urging the U.S., for instance, to simply \"declare that data is the new digital currency, that online platforms have been exploiting data without consent, that loss of informational control is anti-competitive, and then impose eye-popping penalties\" misses the reality that not all consumers value data the same way,\" Delrahim said. \"Money has face value, but privacy cannot yet be measured in nominal terms, and varies according to the type and utility of the data used,\" he added. A more effective strategy would be ensuring that potential competitors can break into the market for a particular platform and that consumers who prefer already-established services still have access, Delrahim said.He's not yet convinced that current antitrust enforcement's approach, which relies on consumer welfare as its lodestar and frequently uses price as a gauge of harm, can't properly respond to the risks posed by companies like Facebook and Google, which are free, and Amazon, which dominates e-commerce in part through lower prices than bricks-and-mortar competitors.\"There is no persuasive evidence that antitrust itself has 'failed,'\" Delrahim said. \"Over the past several decades, antitrust law has responded to new and innovative products and markets to protect against novel threats to the competitive process. Enforcement agencies have developed a strong expertise as new types of assets emerge and consumer preferences shift.\"The landmark case that the Justice Department filed against Microsoft in 2001 is one example demonstrating how the current approach can be adapted to new types of assets and markets \u2014 computer code and software, in that case \u2014 he said.\"The antitrust laws are flexible enough to address competition issues from emerging platforms,\" Delrahim argued. \"We must demand hard evidence of anticompetitive harm before rushing to condemn as unlawful business practices that fuel innovation and thus dynamic competition.\"The assistant attorney general's remarks offer additional insight into the tools the government might bring to bear against Big Tech, as concerns about the power of mammoth digital firms grow among lawmakers, the Trump administration, and free-market advocates.Such advocates, including the so-called hipster antitrust movement who want to break up the companies, don\u2019t cite the companies' mammoth size as the driving reason to break them up, even though Google\u2019s $718 billion market value makes it the largest publicly traded company in the U.S., and Amazon and Facebook are comfortably in the top 10.A critical question instead is the tech giants' control of platforms that give them a powerful advantage over business customers who are, at times, competitors. Facebook\u2019s social media apps and Amazon\u2019s e-commerce site are prime examples.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2029049564</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S5N-C791-JBHT-D50J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"609\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

The panel has probed the business practices of Silicon Valley giants with an eye to determining if they need to be regulated more heavily, or even broken up. In nearly 5 hours of testimony, Pichai and Zuckerberg, for instance, appeared discomfited when pressed about unsavoury aspects of their companies' businesses. Bezos also acknowledged that alleged misdeeds at Amazon - such as reports that the company has used data generated by independent sellers on its platform to compete against them - would be \"unacceptable\" if proven to be true.</p><p>Outside observers were able to draw radically different conclusions from the event.

Alternating Democra...</p><p>Well, we had an antitrust hearing.    A long one, too. The House Judiciary Committee\u2019s investigation into the market power of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google ran to nearly six hours, accounting for a handful of delays and intermissions. Alternating Democrats and Republicans asked the CEOs of those companies a combined 217 questions, ranging from pointed questions about how Facebook intimidates smaller competitors to comically self-interested inquiries into why members\u2019 fundraising emails are going to the spam folder.    In its lunatic whipsawing between companies, issues, and conspiracy theories, Wednesday\u2019s antitrust hearing resembled nothing so much as an endlessly scrolling social media feed. Every question shouted, every answer interrupted, nothing truly ventured, and very little learned. Polarized and polarizing. You want to look away, you can\u2019t look away. Another day in 2020.    And yet for everything there is to criticize about Wednesday\u2019s hearing, I came away from it mostly heartened. For the first time in half a century, Congress is taking its role as antitrust regulator seriously, and has undertaken a 13-month investigation that has so far produced 1.3 million documents laden with evidence. Members of the subcommittee have largely come to believe, as I do, that tech companies have grown too powerful and are in need of regulation. Wednesday offered them a chance to show us what they have found so far \u2014 and to hint at where they might be going next.    Let\u2019s take a look at where Congress pressed each company.    With Amazon, members focused on two key areas: the company\u2019s controversial use of data about third-party sellers on its platform to inform the development \u2014 and promotion \u2014 of its own products; and the proliferation of counterfeit goods on the site, and the harms that causes for buyers and sellers.    Amazon has a policy barring the practice, but lawmakers like Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) focused in on the company\u2019s enforcement of that policy.    \u201cLet me ask you, Mr. Bezos, does Amazon ever access and use seller data when making business decisions?\u201d Jayapal asked.    Bezos highlighted the company\u2019s policy banning the practice, but said, \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.\u201d He continued, \u201cWe continue to look into that very carefully. I\u2019m not yet satisfied that we\u2019ve gotten to the bottom of it, and we\u2019re going to keep looking at it. It\u2019s not as easy to do as you would think because some of the sources in the article are anonymous.\u201d    Bezos was calm and genial in his first time testifying before Congress, but was mostly interrupted before he could get out more than a couple of sentences. Still, there were stumbles: he said he didn\u2019t know if merchants were required to provide a name, address, or phone number before they could sign up to sell products on Amazon. And documents released by the committee outlined how Amazon executives schemed to undermine the parent company of Diapers.com, which once challenged it in the market for products for new parents. Amazon cut prices on diapers and eventually acquired the company for a fraction of its previous value.    Apple arguably got off the lightest of any of the companies in Wednesday\u2019s hearing, if only by volume of questions: Tim Cook got just 35, compared to 59 for Bezos, 62 for Mark Zuckerberg, and 61 for Sundar Pichai. It\u2019s not clear why, though the avenues of inquiry are clear. Apple makes at least 60 apps like Music and Mail that compete with third-party sellers but are not subject to the 30 percent tax that it places on them, reducing competition in the marketplace. Cook argued that there are many phones, and many operating systems, and more consumer choice than you can almost even imagine, and that the fees Apple charges are competitive with Google and other stores.    But documents released Wednesday offered evidence that the playing field is not level for all developers. Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman revealed how Apple was able to get Amazon\u2019s Prime Video app on its App Store in 2017: by taking half as much revenue from the company as it takes from everyone else.    Cook also had to answer for why Apple wiped out a whole category of apps that parents used to monitor their children\u2019s screen time while introducing a screen time measuring feature of its own. (I\u2019m sympathetic to Apple\u2019s position here \u2014 these apps used mobile device management features that were not designed for this sort of thing and could easily have been abused \u2014 but it does show the company\u2019s tremendous market power.)    One place where Cook was let off the hook almost entirely: there were very few questions about the company\u2019s reliance on China as a supplier or a market for its products.    For Facebook, the questions were mostly backward-looking: why did it buy Instagram? Was it to eliminate a competitor? With Nilay Patel, I took a look at this question in The Verge, looking at documents released by the committee. We wrote:    In late February 2012, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg emailed his chief financial officer, David Ebersman, to float the idea of buying smaller competitors, including Instagram and Path. \u201cThese businesses are nascent but the networks established, the brands are already meaningful, and if they grow to a large scale the could be very disruptive to us,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGiven that we think our own valuation is fairly aggressive and that we\u2019re vulnerable in mobile, I\u2019m curious if we should consider going after one or two of them. What do you think?\u201d    Ebersman was skeptical. \u201cAll the research I have seen is that most deals fail to create the value expected by the acquirer,\u201d he wrote back. \u201cI would ask you to find a compelling elucidation of what you are trying to accomplish.\u201d Ebersman went on to list four potential reasons to buy companies and his thoughts on each: neutralizing a competitor, acquiring talent, integrating products to improve the Facebook service, and \u201cother.\u201d    It\u2019s a combination of neutralizing a competitor and improving Facebook, Zuckerberg said in a reply. \u201cThere are network effect around social products and a finite number of different social mechanics to invent. Once someone wins at a specific mechanic, it\u2019s difficult for others to supplant them without doing something different.\u201d    In the hearing, Zuckerberg copped to buying a competitor, but said he thought it would be complementary to Facebook rather than an app that would one day rival its size:    \u201cI\u2019ve been clear that Instagram was a competitor in the space of mobile photo sharing,\u201d Zuckerberg told Congress on Wednesday. \u201cThere were a lot of others at the time. They competed with apps like VSCO Cam and PicPlz and companies like Path. It was a subset of the overall space of connecting that we exist in. And by having them join us, they certainly went from being a competitor in the space of being a mobile camera to an app that we could help grow and to help get more people to be able to use.\u201d    The question is whether members will find that satisfying, or whether the documents will be used to fuel a new effort to break up Facebook, requiring it to spin off Instagram and possibly WhatsApp. But no member of Congress openly advocated that during the hearing, at least that I heard.    Outside questions about Instagram, the subcommittee asked Zuckerberg lots of questions about content moderation. (How can a piece of harmful content get 20 million views in five hours? Are you biased against conservatives?) We\u2019ve heard those questions and his answers before. But mostly Congress just interrupted before he could answer.    Finally, Google took questions about the way its search engine often privileges results from Google-owned properties at the expense of small businesses. Rich Nieva captured the threat in CNET:    Of the four companies, Google is in the most imminent danger of antitrust action. The US Department of Justice is investigating Google\u2019s massive digital advertising business, and is expected to file a lawsuit against the search giant this summer. The company is also ensnared in another probe by a coalition of state attorneys general, led by Texas AG Ken Paxton.    Lawmakers are mainly focused Google\u2019s on dominance in web search, digital advertising and smartphone software. The company processes around 90% of all online searches in the US. That stranglehold on the market is the foundation of Google\u2019s massive advertising business, which generates almost all of the company\u2019s $160 billion in annual sales. Critics accuse Google of anticompetitive behavior with its ad business because the company owns all sides of the auction system, which could give Google an unfair edge.    The calm and soft-spoken Pichai responded to questions by arguing that advertisers have many choices, and that Google is only trying to give consumers what they want. When the Republicans began grilling him on why some conservatives have been banned from YouTube, Pichai said there are more conservative voices on YouTube today than there ever have been before.    The downside of Wednesday\u2019s format is that Congress struggled to make airtight antitrust cases while prosecuting four of them simultaneously. (The constant attempts by Republicans to derail the hearing with phony \u201cbias\u201d complaints were unfortunately successful.)    But the upside is that Congress actually mentioned, often by name, the many businesses that have been squashed as a result of anticompetitive behavior by the giants. Amazon was asked why, during the pandemic, its own Ring doorbells were deemed an \u201cessential good\u201d so as not to interrupt their distribution, where competitors Arlo and Eufy were not. Tim Cook was made to answer for why Basecamp had such a hell of a time getting an email app approved without giving Apple 30 percent of its revenue. Sundar Pichai had to take questions about the many ways in which the company has made life worse for Yelp.    In an age where these tech CEOs can feel all but untouchable, Wednesday showed us the beginnings of accountability. The giants were called on the carpet and interrogated. It was overdue, it was messy, and it was unsatisfying. In other words, it was democracy, and I for one was glad to see it.    And the tech CEOs were likely glad it all happened on Wednesday, rather than any later date. On Thursday the companies report earnings, and if you see a huge spike in sales at Apple or Amazon, you might understand why the companies were eager to reschedule their inquisition as soon as possible after it was delayed. With everything else they stand accused of, pandemic profiteering is something I don\u2019t imagine they want to take questions about.    In the end I\u2019m left with the words of Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) as he ended the hearing. \u201cThe companies as they exist today have monopoly power,\u201d he said. \u201cSome need to be broken up. All need to be properly regulated.\u201d    \u2013The Verge</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42734919410</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GP-22B1-JCSC-J0GS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1860\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Communications Today</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 1, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

While many on Capitol Hill have called for these monolithic companies to be broken up, Morgan Stanley Vice Chairman Robert Kindler has said he thinks the idea 'doesn't make any sense.''I think companies like Amazon have been absolutely terrific for the economy and for the consumer,' Kindler said in a CNBC interview[1].'What would we have done during this pandemic if we didn't have companies like Amazon?</p><p> I just can't imagine that people don't think that these are fantastic things that all of these huge companies have brought.'Kindler, who also handles global mergers and acquisitions for the multinational investment bank, said that despite the criticisms leveled against them, breaking up these major companies would offer little benefit for consumers. He added that breaking up some would be a net negative for consumers, as it would do away with some of the cheap and convenient services that they offer.'I don't see the reason why you would break them up,' Kindler continued. 'What are you going to spin out, Instagram? YouTube?...Do I think these companies have not served the consumer? Of course they have. I think it's been one of the great things that's happened to the consumer.'All four companiesinvolved in the hearing are being targeted for specific allegations of anti-competitive practices. Apple for its tight control of digital apps, Google for its huge footprint in digital ads, Facebook for its market share of social media following its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, and Amazon for its use of third-party seller data to create its own products. Altogether, these companies hold a staggering market value of nearly $5 trillion.Chamath Palihapitiya, a former executive at Facebook, has argued for the break-up of these market-leading mega-companies and said that it will be inevitable by the end of the decade.'Are they going to get broken up? Yes,' he said. 'Will every single government go after them? Absolutely. State, local, federal all around the world. First, they'll get taxed to death, then they'll get trust-busted.'

However, antitrust is just the tip of the iceberg, according to GlobalData, as regulators are expected to come after big tech companies in 10 different areas \u2013 with antitrust, misinformation and data privacy the most urgent issues.    Laura Petrone, senior analyst at GlobalData, comments: \u201cAt stake is the very future of the ad-funded business model that supports Facebook, Google and many others. Under this model, free services are provided in exchange for personal data, which is then used to serve targeted ads to users. Reduced security, alongside less reliable information, is the price that users have to pay.    \u201cAntitrust has been, and will continue to be, a major regulatory plague for big tech. However, in the future, control of data will be the key regulatory issue, with data privacy gaining prominence.    \u201cIn aspects such as content, online harm and obstruction of justice, the tech giants will be asked to adopt a duty of care or face tighter control, with internet ecosystems like Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Apple being particularly vulnerable.    \u201cIn these areas, including copyright, a big divide is emerging between traditional publishers and broadcasters that are, by and large, trusted for their reputable, high quality content, and tech giants that refuse to bear responsibility for the toxic and sometimes illegal content they publish.\u201d    Petrone adds: \u201cIn the digital era, the abuse of market power is real. The key to understanding it is to look at the control of customer data by big tech companies.    \u201cThe major internet ecosystems have established near-monopolies in their respective sectors by producing apps that combine user interface, software code and personal data, and are controlled from their own cloud servers. Most online data is siloed on the servers of companies such as Google, Facebook and Twitter, and is monetized through targeted advertising.    \u201cThis implies that, if users move to a rival service, they lose their data.    \u201cBig tech companies can use this wealth of data to spy on competitors, acquire important information on them, and use it to reinforce their own dominance. Congress\u2019s hearing showed that, while competition laws were not conceived for the digital economy, antitrust is a critical issue in for the tech giants and tackling it will probably require a reframing of existing legislation.\u201d    The post appeared first on IT-Online .</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42750250607</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H5-B821-JCSC-J3H2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"463\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>IT-Online</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 3, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>South Africa</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Africa</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Africa</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The term refers to copying what other companies are doing; acquiring companies as a way of gaining exclusive access to features; and killing apps after acquisition in order to deny them to customers on rival platforms   TheWashington Post[2] reports that the congressional antitrust committee has strong evidence of this approach. Some of the evidence lawmakers have amassed is set to be furnished publicly for the first time Wednesday. Rep. </p><p>Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), one of the panel members who will question the companies, said a few of the documents evince a 'copy-acquire-kill' strategy on the part of tech companies to buy or suppress potential rivals. The Democratic lawmaker said the committee has seen some 'very specific language from top-level executives about that,' but she declined to offer specifics. 'We need to move very quickly, as a Congress, to reassert our authority into regulation of these tech companies and [their] anticompetitive practices,' she said. Some of that language from 'top-level executives' is likely to have come from Tim Cook's emails[3], reviewed by congress during an earlier evidence-gathering phase on the investigation. It's likely to be argued that the 'copy acquire kill' approach harms both small businesses and consumers. Small businesses because they can see their ideas 'Sherlocked' by Apple. The term was named after Apple's precursor to Spotlight on the Mac, Sherlock. A popular third-party app called Watson supplemented Sherlock's capabilities, but was effectively killed when Apple copied its features and incorporated them into Mac OS X 10.2. Tech companies may do this with hardware as well as software. For example, Apple is expected to launch AirTags[4], which replicate and improve on the functionality of Tile tags[5]. Tile already complained to congress[6] about alleged anticompetitive behavior[7], with Apple subsequently announcing changes[8] in iOS 14 to create a more level playing field[9]. Consumers are hurt if they lose access to apps and services on their preferred platform after an acquisition. For example, Apple shut down the Android version[10] of the hugely popular weather app Dark Sky after buying the company[11]. 'This is the big moment for the [companies] to really show that what they're doing is pro-innovation and pro-consumer,' said Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, which counts some of those companies' officials on its board of directors. 'If they don't do that well, and if the members push back enough, you could see it as a turning point where from now on, it's going to be much harder slogging for the industry,' Atkinson said. Bloomberg Law[12] notes that the pace of acquisitions by tech giants like Apple has increased this year. The biggest U.S. technology companies have gone on a buying spree this year, waving off intense scrutiny from competition watchdogs and critics who say they've bolstered their power by snatching up nascent rivals. The number of acquisitions by the five largest companies \u2014 Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Facebook Inc., and Microsoft Corp. \u2014 came at the fastest pace through June since 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg [] Through June 30, the five companies announced 27 deals, according to Bloomberg data, up 29% from the same period last year, when they did 21 deals. The speeding up of tech deals could give ammunition to economists, lawyers and lawmakers who warn that the tech companies have used their abundant cash to gain leverage over existing competitors and increase already high market shares. The piece argues that these purchases mostly escape scrutiny because the deals are comparatively small, but that doesn't mean they are unimportant. An even bigger worry is that the tech companies are potentially choking off competition by acquiring firms that, while small, could one day emerge as robust rivals. After all, the tech giants were all startups once. This charge is likely to be more of an issue for Amazon, Facebook and Google than it is for Apple, but we heard yesterday about seven other questions[13] which may be put to the iPhone maker. We'll find out when the hearing takes place[14] from 12 noon tomorrow. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

They also confer legitimacy on antitrust authorities. </p><p>The International Competition Network[1] (ICN), a network of national and international antitrust authorities, has approved a framework[2] on procedures designed to promote procedural fairness and due process in antitrust law and enforcement. The framework is open to all antitrust authorities, whether members of the ICN or not. So far 62 antitrust authorities have agreed to participate, including from the U.S., EU (both the European Commission and national authorities), Brazil, Canada, Chile, and Singapore. More are expected to join in the coming months. In signing up, authorities commit to certain basic principles, including on non-discrimination, transparency and predictability, process and timing, confidentiality, rights of defence, and independent review. The framework is non-binding, but the ICN has put in place mechanisms to try to ensure compliance, such as reports on implementation and regular meetings. The framework stems from an initiative originally started by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2018. It builds on a significant body of previous work by the ICN and other international antitrust/industry organisations and is a clear sign that the global antitrust community is committed to achieving more consistent standards of procedural fairness and due process in antitrust proceedings. It remains to be seen, however, how quickly any changes to the processes in particular jurisdictions will take place in practice. For the time being, all eyes are on China's State Administration for Market Regulation, one of the key authorities which we understand is yet to sign up. UK steps up deterrence through director disqualificationA growing number of competition authorities across the globe target their competition enforcement at individuals as well as companies. In the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has in the space of a couple of weeks secured the disqualification of six individuals from acting as directors for their participation in cartel conduct - two former directors of construction company CPM Group Ltd[3], a former director of an estate agency[4] and three former directors of office fit-out companies[5]. The disqualification lengths are attention-grabbing: spanning from two to seven and a half years, and averaging four years and five months. Notably, one office fit-out individual had his immunity from disqualification withdrawn because he did not submit to a voluntary interview with the CMA. He has been disqualified for 5 years.These cases are clear evidence that the CMA is significantly ramping up its use of director disqualification provisions. The total number of disqualifications secured since December 2016 (when the CMA took the policy decision to actively use the power) is now nine. The CMA published updated guidance[6] on its powers in February. And a number of investigations are ongoing. Going forward we expect the CMA to continue to seek disqualification of directors, sending a strong compliance message to the sectors involved, and beyond.Hong Kong Competition Tribunal cartel rulings give guidance for future casesThe case law of mature antitrust regimes invariably influences the establishment and development of new regimes. Hong Kong's Competition Ordinance legislation came into effect in December 2015. The Competition Tribunal has now handed down its first two judgments, finding four IT companies [7]and 10 interior decorating firms [8]guilty of cartel conduct. The rulings provide greater legal certainty. First, the judge closely followed EU and UK precedent, for example the EU's interpretation of anti-competitive agreements and by-object infringements. This means that companies can safely rely on the rich source of EU and UK case law in future investigations to predict how the antitrust rules will be enforced. Second, the judge decided that a criminal standard of proof - proof beyond reasonable doubt - applied. Assuming that this is not appealed, this will impact how the Competition Commission chooses its future cases and how it conducts its investigations; cases involving complex behaviour will be harder to prove. Third, the judge found one IT firm not guilty on the basis of a 'rogue employee' defence - the person that participated in the cartel was a junior employee who acted beyond the scope of his employment. This is a welcome potential avenue for companies to escape liability.A further court hearing will determine what sanctions should be imposed in each case. The infringement decisions and any fines serve as a warning to businesses - especially in the IT and construction sectors - that the Hong Kong antitrust regime is up and running. The Competition Commission has welcomed[9] the judgments, noting that it is open to complaints from members of the public as well as leniency applications. Matthew Gearing QC, of A...acted as solicitor-advocate in relation to the IT case. European Commission fines AB InBev for restricting cross-border beer salesHot on the heels of last month's statement of objections [10]over alleged geo-blocking in the video games sector the European Commission has taken further enforcement action in relation to cross-border sales restrictions. It has fined[11] AB InBev EUR200m for abusing a dominant position on the Belgian beer market by limiting cheaper imports of its Jupiler beer from the Netherlands. The Commission found that the drinks company engaged in a strategy designed to maintain higher beer prices in Belgium, by: changing the packaging of some products (eg by removing the French language version of mandatory information from the label) to make them harder to sell in Belgium limiting the volumes of Jupiler beer supplied to a Dutch wholesaler refusing to sell key products to a retailer unless the retailer agreed to limited imports from the Netherlands making customer promotions offered to a retailer in the Netherlands conditional on the retailer not offering the same promotions in Belgium. The case is interesting for a number of reasons. First, it shows the Commission's continued appetite for vigorous enforcement of territorial restrictions. Second, the probe was started by the Commission on its own initiative following monitoring of the market, a clear reminder that many antitrust authorities actively look for potential antitrust infringements, and do not rely solely on whistleblowers or complainants. Third, the Commission is clear that even though it analysed this case as an abuse of dominance, conduct to limit imports within the EU may also amount to a breach of the prohibition against anti-competitive agreements, regardless of whether a supplier is dominant. And finally, the decision is another example of a settlement outside the cartel context [12]- in return for acknowledging the facts and the infringement, and proposing a remedy (to provide mandatory information in both French and Dutch on packaging for the next five years), AB InBev received a 15% reduction in fine. This follows similar fine reductions in the ARA[13], consumer electronics[14], and Guess[15]cases, and shows the Commission's willingness to reward cooperation which facilitates more streamlined investigations (see our Global Cartel Enforcement Report [16]for more information on this trend).Australian ACCC opposes telecoms consolidationAntitrust authorities worldwide have intervened in mergers between mobile service providers, triggering debate over whether there is an ideal number of players for a competitive and well-functioning market. The merger between TPG Telecom and Vodafone Hutchison Australia is the latest deal to face opposition on antitrust grounds. The Australian Competition ...nsumer Commission (ACCC) decision[17] centres on the loss of potential future competition. The Australian mobile services market is concentrated, with three mobile network operators - Telstra, Optus and Vodafone - having over 87% share. The ACCC has concluded that absent the merger there is a real chance that TPG, primarily a fixed broadband service provider, would roll out its own mobile network and become an innovative and independent fourth supplier. Pointing to TPG's track record of disrupting the telecoms sector and its capability and commercial incentive to resolve technical challenges as well as industry trends, the ACCC anticipates that it would offer cheaper mobile plans with large data allowances, competing vigorously against the incumbents.The head of the ACCC has reportedly denied that its opposition to the merger is a sign that the authority is becoming more interventionist. Both Vodafone and TPG plan to appeal the ACCC's decision to the Federal Court; they have extended the merger deadline to 31 August 2020. The ACCC's decision also made headlines for a different reason - it accidentally appeared on the ACCC's mergers webpage before the market had closed for the day and ahead of the ACCC's planned announcement. The ACCC's investigation into the disclosure found[18] that it was caused by a flaw in its website content management system, which has since been rectified.U.S. judge finds Qualcomm's licensing practices breach antitrust lawsThe intersection between antitrust rules and intellectual property has long been a hotly debated topic. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has scored a win after a district judge found[19] Qualcomm's licensing practices are in breach of antitrust laws and amount to an unreasonable restraint of trade. The judge agreed with the FTC that Qualcomm held a monopoly position in the market for certain modem chips. She went on to rule that a range of licensing practices employed by the company caused anti-competitive harm, including its 'no license, no chips' policy of supplying modem chips only on condition that mobile manufacturers agree to its license terms, charging unreasonably high royalty rates for standard essential patents (SEPs), and exclusive chip supply agreements. A permanent injunction was warranted, said the judge, and she recommended a number of remedies to address the concern that Qualcomm may repeat the infringements. Among these are a prohibition on Qualcomm making the supply of modem chips conditional on entering a license, a requirement to grant SEP licenses on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms, a bar on Qualcomm entering exclusive chip supply agreements, and a requirement for the company to submit to FTC monitoring for seven years.Qualcomm has requested a stay of the ruling and intends to appeal. Interestingly, FTC Commissioner Christine Wilson (speaking in a personal capacity) has published an op-ed [20]in the Wall Street Journal criticising the judge's decision and proposed remedies and urging higher courts to reconsider the judge's conclusions. The ruling comes only a month after Qualcomm and Apple settled their high-profile dispute involving similar allegations. Other antitrust authorities and courts around the globe have also either looked, or are looking, at Qualcomm's practices. In the U.S., at least, and depending on the outcome of any appeal, the case may act as a prompt for other SEP holders to review their own licensing models.U.S. Supreme Court green lights app purchasers' antitrust suit against AppleThere is currently much debate over whether antitrust law has a role to play in regulating big tech, and whether long-standing antitrust rules are fit to deal with our modern economy. Complaints particularly centre on platforms' ability to favour their own products over those of rivals. In the U.S. the Supreme Court - in a 5-4 split opinion[21], the majority comprising Trump appointee Brett Kavanaugh and the four liberal judges - has allowed a monopolisation action against Apple to proceed. A class of iPhone owners alleges Apple used its monopoly power over the retail apps market to charge anti-competitive prices, by imposing a 30% fee on all purchases through its App Store. The iPhone users claim that in a competitive environment with other retailers they would have been able to choose between buying apps from Apple and less expensive alternatives. The progress of their case turned on the interpretation of a 1977 Illinois Brick Supreme Court precedent that prevented indirect purchasers from pursuing damages against a producer or manufacturer of goods under the federal Sherman Act. After years of litigation, the Supreme Court has ruled in their favour - a majority finding that the iPhone users are direct purchasers with standing to sue as they technically buy apps from Apple's App Store rather than app developers. Some commentators had anticipated that the Court might use the case as an opportunity to formally revisit Illinois Brick. However it did not, and it will be interesting to see how these issues are dealt with in any future actions. For the parties, the proceedings are by no means over - the next step for the consumers is to argue the merits of their case. European Commission fines banks over a billion euros for forex cartelsFurther to the investigations into forex trading by U.S. and UK regulators in recent years, the European Commission has now fined[22] five banks EUR1.07bn for taking part in cartels relating to the spot foreign exchange market for 11 currencies. UBS escaped a fine by blowing the whistle in exchange for immunity. Nearly all of the other banks received reductions in fines for cooperating with the Commission under the leniency procedure. Discounts of 10% were also awarded for settlement, with the banks acknowledging their participation in the infringement. The decisions again highlight the possibility for firms to face liability, including significant fines, for the actions of just one, or a few, employees. Companies which do not already have in place a robust antitrust compliance programme should see this case as a reminder of the importance of regularly training staff on how to stay on the right side of the line. European Commission examines data poolingThe last couple of years have seen an increased focus on data in competition enforcement cases worldwide. And now the risk of antitrust action against 'data pools' has been thrown into the spotlight - the European Commission has opened[23] a formal investigation into an Irish insurance database administered by industry association InsuranceIreland. The Commission is clear that data pooling arrangements can often be pro-competitive, directly benefiting consumers by enabling effective competition in the market. Access to the data pool could, for example, enable new entry and increase consumers' choice of services and suppliers. It could also mean that providers are put in a position to offer better prices and services. However, the Commission flags two situations where data pooling systems may lead to restrictions on competition: where the conditions of access to and participation in a data pool mean certain market operators are placed at a competitive disadvantage; and where the data pooling arrangement enables market operators to become aware of the strategies of their competitors. In this case, the Commission appears to be looking only at the former, ie whether the conditions imposed on companies wishing to participate and access the database placed them at a competitive disadvantage on the Irish motor insurance market in comparison to companies already with access.In focusing on access conditions rather than the actual sharing of data, the probe stands out from previous investigations into allegedly anti-competitive information exchange. It comes in the wake of an EU expert report[24] on competition policy in the digital era (see the last edition of Antitrust in focus [25]for a summary), which calls for an assessment of data pooling and its pro- and anti-competitive aspects in order to provide more guidance. The Commission's conclusions in this case could well feed into the redrafting of its guidelines on horizontal cooperation agreements, the review of which is imminent. It is also worth noting that the Irish competition authority is investigating[26] the motor insurance sector in Ireland. Its probe, launched in 2016, covers potential price signalling by motor insurance firms and brokers, and is reportedly reaching 'latter stages'.German FCO bolsters merger intervention record with printing deal prohibitionThe German Federal Cartel Office (FCO) has blocked[27] the acquisition of MBO Group by Heidelberger Druckmaschinen. After an in-depth investigation it found that Heidelberger was the market leader in the European market for sheet folding machines (used in the printing industry), and that MBO was its main rival in this market. According to the FCO, the merger would have resulted in joint market shares of well over 50 per cent, in a market which is already concentrated with high barriers to entry.The FCO's record of merger control intervention has been strong in recent years. During 2017 and 2018 eight deals were frustrated by the FCO's antitrust concerns - one was prohibited and the remaining seven were abandoned by the parties. In addition to Heidelberger/MBO, so far in 2019 the authority has blocked[28] a metal parts joint venture between Miba and Zollern (currently being considered by the German economy minister after a request by the parties to override the prohibition on public interest grounds) and has just announced its intention to prohibit [29]the Remondis/DSD packaging recycling merger. Three further transactions have been abandoned. As things currently stand, the FCO looks set for a bumper year of merger control enforcement.U.S. FTC successfully challenges consummated mergerU.S. authorities have the power to investigate mergers that fall below Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act notification thresholds, either pre- or post-closing, in cases that potentially raise significant competition issues. The latest example is a consummated merger of two prosthetics manufacturers: Otto Bock's acquisition of FIH Group Holdings (the owner of Freedom Innovation). The transaction, which was not HSR reportable, closed in September 2017. However, an administrative law judge has upheld[30] the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)'s administrative complaint, agreeing with the FTC's view that the acquisition will significantly increase concentration in the relevant microprocessor prosthetic knees market, eliminate head-to-head competition between the two companies, remove a significant and disruptive competitor and entrench Otto Block's position as the dominant supplier. The judge's initial decision [31]requires Otto Bock to divest Freedom Innovations' assets, at no minimum price, to a FTC-approved buyer. Otto Bock is also required to hold the assets separately, provide transitional services to the buyer and give the buyer the opportunity to recruit and employ all Freedom Innovation employees. The FTC can appoint a monitor and a divestiture trustee to ensure Otto Bock's compliance. Otto Bock has filed its intention to appeal the initial decision to the FTC's five commissioners and so, for now, the judge's decision is not final. The case is not an isolated one - the U.S. agencies routinely intervene in deals which do not meet the notification thresholds. In the past two years they have challenged three such cases, two of which resulted in remedies. And this is not a power that is unique to the U.S. In recent years we have seen increasing instances of transactions being 'called in' by antitrust authorities in the absence of a filing obligation, including in Brazil, Canada and Ireland.

Large technology companies provide small businesses with secure, scalable and affordable digital tools that drive their success and the national economy. </p><p>\"I am amazed and a little dumbfounded that elected officials are attacking technology companies and digital platforms for being too big,\" said David Espinoza of Espinoza Book Maker in Phoenix, Arizona. \"Have people considered how important these companies are to small businesses like mine and countless more? I suspect they have not and that has me seriously concerned that politicians are rushing into something that will make it harder for me to run and grow my business.\"According to a study released by Deloitte today, 90 percent of all small businesses believe that digital tools have fostered innovation in their business, particularly in entering new markets and communicating with customers.\u00a0The consequences of these misguided activities by state AGs are increasing fears across industries and geographies, from bakeries in Brooklyn to online retailers in North Carolina. \"It is politically expedient to attack successful and sizable companies, but American small businesses deserve better,\" said 3C President Jake Ward. \"The men and women whose work and leadership employs nearly half of the U.S. workforce and drives the American economy, deserve to be heard and understood by the policymakers claiming to serve them. Access to online tools and services is the engine that drives American capitalism and small business success. Claiming otherwise and asserting that \"big tech\" stifles competition ignores countless economic analysis, market research and individual experiences to the contrary. 3C and thousands of members are eager to help state AGs and regulators better understand the realities of the interconnected digitally empowered economy.\"\"Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy, and I implore those that are supposed to be protecting my best interest to listen to us. Before states take action that could change how digital platforms work for small businesses, my hope is that they educate themselves and understand the small business economy. Getting this wrong could be disastrous to millions of hard-working Americans,\" pleads Courtney Caldwell of Texas's ShearShare.Former Army Green Beret and owner of GoRuck in Jacksonville Beach, Florida, Jason McCarthy states, \"Before our government attacks these companies and force changes in their operations or products, they must understand how important these products and services are to small business like mine. Access to these tools is mission-critical to my company. And changing the way these companies operate could have drastic effects on the way I grow and run my business. Once policymakers understand this, I'm sure they will understand why I am worried.\" About the Connected Commerce Council TheConnected Commerce Council(3C) is a non-profit membership organization with a single goal: to promote small businesses' access to essential digital technologies and tools. 3C provides small businesses with access to the market's most effective digital tools available, provides coaching to optimize growth and efficiency, and works to cultivate a policy environment that considers and respects the interests of today's small businesses.Media Contact: Spenser Wempe 202-769-3003SOURCE Connected Commerce Council<br/>Related Linkshttp://www.connectedcouncil.org<br/><br/>\u00d7<br/>Modal title<br/>Also from this source<br/><br/>Small Online Publishers Defend Google And Publishing Platforms...<br/><br/>Small Business Owners Concerned By Congressional Antitrust...<br/>ExploreMore news releases in similar topics<br/>&lt;ul&gt;<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Computer &amp;

It did not mention any major tech giant by name, but its stated interests track closely with Google's dominance in search, Facebook's leadership in social media and Amazon's position as the country's e-commerce leader. All three control vast amounts of data that give them an edge over smaller rivals, critics say.</p><p>Justice Department officials said they would \"seek redress\" if in the course of their investigation they find tech companies committed violations of federal competition laws.</p><p>The review taps into intensifying, bipartisan fears that tech giants have grown too large and powerful, threatening rivals, harming consumers and undermining innovations. It could sweep up the whole of Silicon Valley into the government's regulatory crosshairs, a broad inquiry that mirrors Justice Department probes from generations ago into entire industries, such as oil and gas.</p><p>\"It looks like the antitrust winter is over,\" said Columbia University law professor Tim Wu, who chronicled the subject in his book \"The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age.\"</p><p>Amazon and Facebook declined to comment. Google declined to comment on the Justice Department probe but pointed to previous testimony to Congress stressing it doesn't threaten competitors. Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.</p><p>The nascent probe appears to differ from a targeted government investigation into how Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook may have acted anti-competitively. Another Washington antitrust agency, the Federal Trade Commission, recently created a special task force to examine industry competition issues.</p><p>The new effort is led by Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general for antitrust, who raised concerns in a statement Tuesday that \"digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands.\"</p><p>In recent months, Delrahim appeared to offer a road map for the government's coming review. Speaking at a conference in Israel, he warned that Washington would take a broad view of what constitutes a threat to competition. He pointed to the U.S. government's case against Microsoft in the 1990s to show that federal regulators \"already have in our possession the tools we need to enforce the antitrust laws in cases involving digital technologies.\"</p><p>To start, Justice Department officials are planning a meeting this week with attorneys general from states such as Colorado, Nebraska and Iowa to examine the potential for bringing state-level cases against tech giants, according to two people familiar with the meetings who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Some of those states have urged the federal government to open competition probes of tech giants, and many attended a private gathering hosted by the Justice Department in September to discuss the power of online platforms, including concerns about competition, privacy and free speech. The department declined to provide further details about its plans.</p><p>The probe comes at the beckoning of Democrats and Republicans. President Trump has repeatedly swiped at Silicon Valley in recent months, at one point last month threatening unspecified lawsuits against Facebook and Google. Earlier this month, Trump convened a summit at the White House during which he attacked the industry for what he called the censoring of conservatives - and pledged to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech.\"</p><p>But many Democrats seeking the White House in 2020 have signaled their interest in probing tech companies, too. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) has been the most aggressive, calling for tech giants to be broken up. And Democrats and Republicans have joined on Capitol Hill to launch an investigation into Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google on competition grounds, holding a hearing with all four companies earlier this month.</p><p>Gene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department antitrust official now working as an adviser to the public interest advocacy group Public Knowledge, said Silicon Valley is ripe for a closer examination.</p><p>\"This is a welcome step to shine a light on whether there's antitrust problems and whether there needs to be updated laws to promote competition,\" Kimmelman said.</p><p>But the president's attacks prompted concerns among some experts about the rationale for the new review.</p><p>Thinking ahead to the 2020 election, \"if the Democrats are going to stake out an aggressive antitrust platform, this is a way for Republicans to neutralize it politically without actually doing anything,\" said Robert Litan, a partner in the law firm Korein Tillery and former deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's antitrust division who helped prosecute Microsoft. \"Another way to read this is that the administration doesn't like any of these tech firms because they think they all lean Democratic and stifle conservative voices, and this is just pure, raw-knuckles payback.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:elizabeth.dwoskin@washpost.com\">elizabeth.dwoskin@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:craig.timberg@washpost.com\">craig.timberg@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-acacdf7cada211e98e7703b30bc29f64</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMX-N6V1-DYX1-H20J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"924\"/><timeReceived>2:59 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 24, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It did not mention any major tech giant by name, but its stated interests track closely with Google's dominance in search, Facebook's leadership in social media and Amazon's position as the country's e-commerce leader. All three control vast amounts of data that give them an edge over smaller rivals, critics say.</p><p>Justice Department officials said they would \"seek redress\" if in the course of their investigation they find tech companies committed violations of federal competition laws.</p><p>The review taps into intensifying, bipartisan fears that tech giants have grown too large and powerful, threatening rivals, harming consumers and undermining innovations. It could sweep up the whole of Silicon Valley into the government's regulatory crosshairs, a broad inquiry that mirrors Justice Department probes from generations ago into entire industries, such as oil and gas.</p><p>\"It looks like the antitrust winter is over,\" said Columbia University law professor Tim Wu, who chronicled the subject in his book \"The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age.\"</p><p>Amazon and Facebook declined to comment. Google declined to comment on the Justice Department probe but pointed to previous testimony to Congress stressing it doesn't threaten competitors. Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.</p><p>The nascent probe appears to differ from a targeted government investigation into how Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook may have acted anti-competitively. Another Washington antitrust agency, the Federal Trade Commission, recently created a special task force to examine industry competition issues.</p><p>The new effort is led by Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general for antitrust, who raised concerns in a statement Tuesday that \"digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands.\"</p><p>In recent months, Delrahim appeared to offer a road map for the government's coming review. Speaking at a conference in Israel, he warned that Washington would take a broad view of what constitutes a threat to competition. He pointed to the U.S. government's case against Microsoft in the 1990s to show that federal regulators \"already have in our possession the tools we need to enforce the antitrust laws in cases involving digital technologies.\"</p><p>To start, Justice Department officials are planning a meeting this week with attorneys general from states such as Colorado, Nebraska and Iowa to examine the potential for bringing state-level cases against tech giants, according to two people familiar with the meetings who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Some of those states have urged the federal government to open competition probes of tech giants, and many attended a private gathering hosted by the Justice Department in September to discuss the power of online platforms, including concerns about competition, privacy and free speech. The department declined to provide further details about its plans.</p><p>The probe comes at the beckoning of Democrats and Republicans. President Trump has repeatedly swiped at Silicon Valley in recent months, at one point last month threatening unspecified lawsuits against Facebook and Google. Earlier this month, Trump convened a summit at the White House during which he attacked the industry for what he called the censoring of conservatives - and pledged to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech.\"</p><p>But many Democrats seeking the White House in 2020 have signaled their interest in probing tech companies, too. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) has been the most aggressive, calling for tech giants to be broken up. And Democrats and Republicans have joined on Capitol Hill to launch an investigation into Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google on competition grounds, holding a hearing with all four companies earlier this month.</p><p>Gene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department antitrust official now working as an adviser to the public interest advocacy group Public Knowledge, said Silicon Valley is ripe for a closer examination.</p><p>\"This is a welcome step to shine a light on whether there's antitrust problems and whether there needs to be updated laws to promote competition,\" Kimmelman said.</p><p>But the president's attacks prompted concerns among some experts about the rationale for the new review.</p><p>Thinking ahead to the 2020 election, \"if the Democrats are going to stake out an aggressive antitrust platform, this is a way for Republicans to neutralize it politically without actually doing anything,\" said Robert Litan, a partner in the law firm Korein Tillery and former deputy assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's antitrust division who helped prosecute Microsoft. \"Another way to read this is that the administration doesn't like any of these tech firms because they think they all lean Democratic and stifle conservative voices, and this is just pure, raw-knuckles payback.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:elizabeth.dwoskin@washpost.com\">elizabeth.dwoskin@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:craig.timberg@washpost.com\">craig.timberg@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-acacdf7c-ada2-11e9-8e77-03b30bc29f64</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMX-T581-DXXY-320J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"924\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Suburban Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 24, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In the last week, March 11-17, 2019, everyone from Senator Elizabeth Warren to The Wall Street Journal editorialist, Andy Kessler, to Arizona State Attorney General, Mark Brnovich, have weighed in on the subject of the rules surrounding competition in business and who should be officiating. </p><p>We would like to reexplain our position on this subject, because we believe it is a most critical question in U.S. long-term economic success, in economic inequality and in where to invest in the U.S. stock market.We were surprised that Senator Elizabeth Warren has come the closest to our perception of the problem.[1][1] 'Today's big tech companies have too much power\u2014too much power over our economy, our society and our democracy,' Ms. Warren said in an online post. 'They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.' The article continues: 'Ms. Warren's position, like others she has taken, places her on the left wing of the Democratic field and escalates comments she has made in recent years. She has repeatedly criticized U.S. antitrust enforcement as inadequate, under both Democratic and Republican leadership, at the two agencies tasked with protecting competition: the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission.' Do you have a sturdy chair? We agree with Mrs. Warren on this subject and sense that she and her staff have been working with Lina Khan, who has done the best writing and has been making the best arguments tied to rewriting our antitrust laws to include the ability to aggregate monopoly power via the internet. Normally, the existing rules and the existing referees could handle this job. Next, Andy Kessler, in an op-Ed titled 'Warren's Populist Puritanism' and Mark Brnovich, Arizona State Attorney General, came along. Kessler appears to be shilling for the tech behemoths, because he's probably been made wealthy via his own tech venture investments. Second, he is making a tired argument that is based on the old antitrust laws, not the updated ones which Ms. Khan and Mrs. Warren are arguing for. Here is an excerpt from Kessler's opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal:[2][2] 'Yet the Sherman Antitrust Act prohibits two specific types of business practices: anticompetitive agreements, or collusion, and conduct to limit competition. Judges define these violations by a consumer-welfare standard, assessing whether consumers are harmed by a lack of competition. 'Innocent monopolies' earned by merit are not illegal. Antitrust says nothing about bigness.' Kessler makes it look like he's working for Facebook, Amazon and Google by attacking Elizabeth Warren as a 'populist puritan.' You might guess that those of us who pick stocks for a living don't agree with many of Senator Warren's anti-business proposals. However, prior socialist-oriented proposals don't really have anything to do with the merits of creating updated antitrust laws 'internet style.' Kessler made the worn-out argument which says, under the existing antitrust laws, that consumers benefit from free social media, free search and free delivery (this is why we call them 'Three Identical Strangers'). Kessler forgets that American consumers are very much like a frog in a pot of water which was recently turned on high. By the time it is boiling, there will be no remedy. Without a rewrite of the rules and attention from well-qualified referees, these companies will have crushed any and all competition. Brnovich correctly points out that Washington politicians (especially Republicans who should understand Teddy Roosevelt's trust-busting activities in the early 1900s) have been asleep at the wheel on this subject and might not ever get anything done. Therefore, he said it is up to the state attorney generals to step up and force the Federal government to get to work. Ironically, former Missouri Attorney General and now U.S. Senator, Josh Hawley, was making this argument loudly as a candidate for his now-won Senate seat. We'd love to hear from him!Monopoly power has been easier to aggregate on the internet and is a huge threat to our economy. There are limits to how much success can go to too few people, before it destroys Democratic Capitalism. John D. Rockefeller wanted to own every oil well, oil refinery and gas station in the U.S. (can you see Jeff Bezos in this?). Teddy Roosevelt figured this out before it ruined the economy in the early 1900s. There were only 4,000 cars sold in the U.S. in 1900. Roosevelt broke up Standard Oil into nine companies by the time we had sold 3.5 million automobiles in 1925. What kind of economic success would we have had if one guy and his company had complete control over the price of gasoline? Economic inequality has exploded because a legendary part of the wealth in our society has been transferred from the businesses who have not aggregated power via the internet to three which have. One word from Amazon that they are coming into another business crushes stocks in affected industries. Scott Galloway, from NYU Business School, explains that when someone announces going into healthcare or groceries or entertainment, billions of dollars of stock market capitalization can be stripped off of the net worth of every shareholder from mom-and-pop to endowments and pension plans. Galloway would argue that it is too much power. Why should we think that outdated antitrust laws written between 1900-1920 should give the rules which cover commerce on an internet which Katie Couric couldn't understand in 1995?[3][3] The competition needs new rules and better officiating. These monopolistic tech behemoths have been allowed to grow power unchecked, because we haven't been rewriting the antitrust laws 'internet style.' Investors have flocked to the common shares of Facebook, Google and Amazon and ditched anyone who dared step into their path. Look at how growth stock investing has dominated value investing in the last ten years as investors chased these monopolists.Does one company having 95% market share in social media help anyone in society? Does getting 80% of the internet advertising in the U.S. and tracking everything thing you do via search cause your average neighborhood to prosper? Does getting a bargain on free delivery from Amazon, subsidized by web hosting the pornography industry, really head us in the direction which will make capitalism thrive in a democracy? We have no way of knowing when these new rules will be considered or adopted, though the stock market is an anticipatory vehicle. The popularity of these companies could continue for some time, but we believe investors would be wise to sift through the ashes of the companies burned by having the wrong rules and the 'look the other way' officiating. In the 1980 book The Money Masters by John Train, Warren Buffett[4] (Trades[5], Portfolio[6]) laid out his stock picking criteria. Number four on his list was beware of a company about to get regulated. Thanks to Senator Warren and Arizona Attorney General Brnovich, the 'Three Identical Strangers' better prepare for antitrust laws 'internet style.' In the meantime, we will look for contrary bargains in the industries most affected by their monopoly dreams, like healthcare, media, retailing and whatever they decide to go into next.

Here'sPeggy Noonan writing in the Wall Street Journa[1]l (June 6, 2019):But the mood in America is anti-big-tech. Everyone knows they're too powerful, too arrogant, loom too large in public life. ... Here's what they [Congress] should be thinking: Break them up. </p><p>Break them in two, in three; regulate them. Declare them to be what they've so successfully become: once a pleasure, now a utility.It all depends on Congress, which has been too stupid to move in the past and is too stupid to move competently now. That's what's slowed those of us who want reform, knowing how badly they'd do it.Yet now I find myself thinking: I don't care. Do it incompetently, but do something.When it comes to regulation of the big digital firms, we may end up with incompetence at the end of the day. But first, could we at least take a stab at thinking about what competent antitrust and regulation might look like? For guidance, I've seen three reports so far this year on antitrust and competition in the digital economy: One is a report done by an expert panel for the UK government. Jason Furman, Diane Coyle, Amelia Fletcher, Philip Marsden, and Derek McAuley,Unlocking Digital Competition: Report of the Digital Competition Expert Panel (March 2019).[2]One is a report done by outside advisers for the European Commission: Jacques[3]Crmer,[4]Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye, and Heike Schweitzer, Competition Policy for the Digital Era[5](April 2019).The remaining report was written by a committee composed of Fiona Scott Morton, Pascal Bouvier, Ariel Ezrachi, Bruno Jullien, Roberta Katz, Gene Kimmelman, A. Douglas Melamed, and Jamie Morgenstern, called Committee for the Study ofDigital Platforms: Market Structure and AntitrustSubcommittee Report[6], published by the Stigler Center at the University of Chicago (May 2019)The three report are all at least 100 pages in length. They are all written by prominent economists, and they have a lot of overlap with each other. Here, I'll just focus on some of the main points that caught my eye when reading them. But be aware that the topics and terms mentioned here typically come up in at least two of the three reports, and often in all three.Antitrust Policy is Not a One-Size-All Solution for Everything Antitrust policy is about attempting to ensure that competition arises. Pace Noonan, it's not about whether the firms or the people running them are powerful, arrogant, or large.Digital technologies raise all sorts of broad social issues that are not directly related to competition. For example, the appropriate treatment of personal information would still be an issue if there were four Facebook-like firms and five Google-like firms all in furious competition with each other. Indeed, it's possible that a bunch of new firms competing in these markets might be more aggressive in hoovering up personal education and passing it along to advertisers and others. The question of if or when certain content should be blocked from the digital sites will still be an issue no matter how many firms are competing in these markets.Digital firms use algorithms in many of their decisions about marketing and price, and such algorithms can end up building in various forms of bias. This is a problem that will exist with or without competition. The forces of corporate lobbying on the political process are a legitimate public issue, regardless of whether the lobbying comes from many smaller firms, or a larger firm, or an industry association.In other words, the digital economy raises lots of issues of public interest. Responding to those issues doesn't just mean flailing around with an antitrust hammer, hoping to connect with a few targets, but instead thinks about what problems need to be addressed and what policy tools are likely to be useful in addressing them.What is the Antitrust Issue with Digital Firms?In the US economy, at least, being big and being profitable are not violations of existing antitrust law. If a firm earns profits and becomes large by providing consumers with goods and services that they desire, at a price the consumes are willing to pay, that's fine. But if a firm earns profits and becomes large by taking actions that hinder and block the competition, those anticompetitive actions can be violation of antitrust law. The challenge with big digital firms is where to draw the line. When the internet was young, two decades ago, there was a widespread belief that it would not be a hospitable place for big companies. [T]he economic literature of the beginning of the 21st century assumed that competition between online firms would arise as consumers hopped from site to site, easily comparing their offers. The reality however quickly turned out to be very different. Very early in the history of the Internet, a limited number of 'gateways' emerged. With the benefit of hindsight, this might not be too surprising. Users have limited time and need curators to help them navigate the long tail of websites to find what they are looking for. These curators then developed a tendency to keep users on their platform, and by the end of the 1990s, it was common place to speak about AOL's 'walled garden'. AOL's market power however rested in great part on its role as an Internet service provider and both competition in that domain and, according to some observers, strategic mistakes after its merger with Time Warner eroded its power.Fast forwarding to today, a few ecosystems and large platforms have become the newgateways through which people use the Internet. Google is the primary means by which peoplein the Western world find information and contents on the Internet. Facebook/WhatsApp, with2.6 billion users, is the primary means by which people connect and communicate with oneanother, while Amazon is the primary means for people to purchase goods on the Internet.Moreover, some of those platforms are embedded into ecosystems of services and,increasingly, devices that complement and integrate with one another. Finally, the influence ofthese gateways is not only economic but extends to social and political issues. For instance,the algorithms used by social media and video hosting services influence the types of politicalnews that their users see while the algorithm of search engines determines the answerspeople receive to their questions.As all of these reports note, it is now apparent that when a large digital company becomes established, entry can be hard. There is a \"network effect,\" where a system that has more users is also attractive to more users. There's a \"platform\" effect, where most buyers and sellers head for Amazon because the most buyers and sellers are already on Amazon. There are economies of scale, where the startup costs of a new platform or network can be fairly high, but adding additional users has a marginal cost of near-zero. There are issues involving the collection and analysis of data, where more users mean more attraction to advertisers and more data, to which can then be monetized.None of these issues are new for antitrust. But the big digital firms bring these issues together in some new ways. The markets become prone to \"tipping,\" which means that when an established firm gets a certain critical mass, other firms can't attract enough users to survive. As economists sometimes say, it becomes a case where there is competition for the market, in the sense of which firm will become dominant in that market, but then there is little competition within the market.One consequence is that when a big firm becomes established, entry is hard and future competition can be thwarted. Thus, there is reason to be concerned that consumers may suffer along various dimensions: price, quality innovation. In the areas of innovationstartup in that area slows down dramatically. From the Scott Morton et al. report: By looking at the sub-industries associated with each firm\u2014social platforms (Facebook), internet software (Google), and internet retail (Amazon)\u2014a different trend emerges. Since 2009, change in startup investing in these sub-industries has fared poorly compared to the rest of software for Google and Facebook, the rest of retail for Amazon, and the rest of all VC for each of Google, Facebook, and Amazon. This suggests the existence of so-called 'kill-zones,' that is, areas where venture capitalists are reluctant to enter due to small prospects of future profits. In a study of the mobile app market, Wen Wen and Feng Zhu come to a similar conclusion: Big tech platforms do dampen innovation at the margin. Their study analyzed how Android app developers adjust their innovation strategies in response to entry (or threat of entry) by Google ... Some Oddities of a Market with a Price of ZeroBig digital firms provide a remarkable array of services with a market price of zero to consumers. They make their money by attracting users and selling ads, or by charges to producers. Is this a case where the market price should actually be negative--that is, the big tech firms should be paying consumers. The Scott-Morton et al. report offers some interesting thoughts on these lines: Barter is a common way in which consumers pay for digital services. They barter their privacy and information about what restaurants they would like to eat in and what goods they would like to buy in exchange for digital services. The platform then sells targeted advertising, which is made valuable by the bartered information. But, in principle, that information has a market price. It is not easy to see if the value of any one consumer's information is exactly equal to the value of the services she receives from the platform. However, many digital platforms are enormously profitable, and have been for many years, which suggests that in aggregate we do know the answer: the information is more valuable than the cost of the services. ...Online platforms offer many services for zero monetary price while they try to raise participation in order to generate advertising revenue. Free services are prevalent on the internet in part because internet firms can harness multi-sided network externalities. While the low price can be a blessing for consumers, it has drawbacks for competition and market structure in a world where institutions have not arisen to manage negative prices. Because there is currently no convenient way to pay consumers with money, platforms are able to mark up the competitive price all the way to zero. This constraint can effectively eliminate price competition, shifting the competitive process to quality and the ability of each competitor to generate network externalities. Depending on the context this may favor or impede entry of new products. For example, entry will be encouraged when a price of zero leads to supra-competitive profits, and impeded when a zero price prevents entrants from building a customer base through low price. Moreover, unlike traditional markets where several quality layers may coexist at different price levels (provided that some consumers favor lower quality at low price), markets where goods are free will be dominated by the best quality firm and others may compete only in so far as they can differentiate their offers and target different customers. This strengthens the firm's incentive to increase quality through increasing fixed costs in order to attract customers (known as the Sutton sunk cost effect) and further pushes the market toward a concentrated market structure. ...It is a puzzle that, to date, no entrepreneur or business has found a way to pay consumers for their data in money. For example, a consumer's wireless carrier could aggregate micropayments across all manner of digital destinations and apply the credit to her bill each month. ... Furthermore, a carrier that could bargain effectively with platforms on behalf of its subscribers for high payments would likely gain subscribers. Notice that an easy method to pay consumers, combined with price competition for those consumers, might significantly erode the high profits of many incumbent platforms. Platforms likely have no economic incentive to work diligently to operationalize negative prices.Of course, this idea of a market in which consumers barter attention for zero-marginal-price services isn't new. Television and before that radio operate on the same basic business model.Categories of DataThe ability to collect data from users, and then to collate it with other information and pass it along to advertisers, is clearly a central part of the business model for digital firms. There's a lot of quick-and-easy talk about \"my\" data and what \"they\" should or shouldn't be able to do with it. The Cremer et al. report offers some useful drilling down into different ways of acquiring data and different ways in which data might be used. Sensible rules will take these kinds of distinctions into account. They note: Data is acquired through three main channels. First, some data is volunteered, i.e. intentionally contributed by the user of a product. A name, email, image/video, calendar information, review, or a post on social media would qualify as volunteered data. Similarly, more structureddata\u2014directly generated by an individual\u2014like a movie rating, or liking a song or post wouldalso fall in the volunteered data category.Second, some data is observed. In the modern era, many activities leave a digital trace, and 'observed data' refers to more behavioural data obtained automatically from a user's or amachine's activity. The movement of individuals is traced by their mobile phone; telematicdata records the roads taken by a vehicle and the behaviour of its driver; every click on a pageweb can be logged by the website and third party software monitors the way in which itsvisitors are behaving. In manufacturing, the development of the Internet of Things meansthat every machine produces reams of data on how it functions, what its sensors arerecording, and what it is currently doing or producing. Finally, some data is inferred, that is obtained by transforming in a non-trivial mannervolunteered and/or observed data while still related to a specific individual or machine. Thiswill include a shopper's or music fan's profiles, e.g. categories resulting from clusteringalgorithms or predictions about a person's propensity to buy a product, or credit ratings. The distinction between volunteered, observed and inferred data is not always clear. ...[W]e will also consider how data is used. We will define four categories of uses: non-anonymous use of individual-level data,anonymous use of individual level data, aggregated data, and contextual data. The firstcategory, non-anonymous use of individual-level data, would be any individual-level data(volunteered, observed, or inferred) that was used to provide a service to the individual. For instance, a music app uses data about the songs a user has listened to in order to provide recommendations for new artists he or she might enjoy. Similarly, a sowing app uses data from farm equipment to monitor the evolution of the soil. Access to individual-level data can often be essential to switch service or to offer a complementary service.The second category, anonymous use of individual-level data, would include all cases when individual-level data was used anonymously. Access to the individual-level data is necessary but the goal is not to directly provide a service to the individual who generated the data in the first place. These would typically include cases of data being used to train machine-learningalgorithms and/or data used for purposes unrelated to the original purposes for which the datahas been collected. An example of this would be the use of skin image data to train a deeplearning (Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm to recognise skin lesions or the use of location data for trading purposes. In specific cases, the information extracted, e.g. thetrained algorithm, can then be used to provide a better service to some of the individuals whocontributed data. For instance, film reviews are used collectively to provide every individual with better recommendations (collaborative filtering). For the anonymous use of individual-leveldata, access to a large dataset may be essential to compete.The third category, aggregated data, refers to more standardised data that has been irreversibly aggregated. This is the case for e.g. sales data, national statistics information, andcompanies' profit and loss statements. Compared to anonymous use of individual-level data,the aggregation is standard enough that access to the individual-level data is not necessary.Finally, contextual data refers to data that does not derive from individual-level data. This category typically includes data such as road network information, satellite data and mapping data.It's interesting to consider whether people's objections about use of their data are rooted purely in principle, or are not about being paid. If firms used your observed data on location, shopping, and so on, but only sold aggregated versions of that data and paid you for the amount of data you contributed to the aggregate, would you still complain?Some Policy StepsAfter this probably over-long mention of what seemed to me like interesting points, what are the most useful potential margins for action in this area--at least if we want to take competent action? Here are two main categories of policies to consider: those related to mergers and anticompetitive behavior, and those related to data.1) Big dominant firms deserve heightened scrutiny for actions that might affect entry and competition. This is especially true when a firm has a \"bottleneck\" position when everyone (or almost everyone) needs to go through that firm to access certain service. One particular concern here is that big dominant firms buy up smaller companies that might, if they had remained independent, offered a form of competition or a new platform.Furman et al. write: There is nothing inherently wrong about being a large company or a monopoly and, in fact, in many cases this may reflect efficiencies and benefits for consumers or businesses. But dominant companies have a particular responsibility not to abuse their position by unfairly protecting, extending or exploiting it. Existing antitrust enforcement, however, can often be slow, cumbersome, and unpredictable. ...Acquisitions have included buying businesses that could have become competitors to the acquiring company (for example Facebook's acquisition of Instagram), businesses that have given a platform a strong position in a related market (for example Google's acquisition of DoubleClick, the advertising technology business), and data-driven businesses in related markets which may cement the acquirer's strong position in both markets (Google/YouTube, Facebook/WhatsApp). Over the last 10 years the 5 largest firms have made over 400 acquisitions globally. None has been blocked and very few have had conditions attached to approval, in the UK or elsewhere, or even been scrutinised by competition authorities.But along with mergers, there are a variety of other potentially actions which, when used by a dominant firm, may be potentially anticompetitive. Another concern is when big dominant firms start offering a range of other services on their own, and then use their dominance in one market to favor their own services in other markets. Yet another issue is when big dominant firms choose a certain technological standard that seems more about blocking competition than advancing its own business. Some dominant platform firms use \"best-price clauses,\" which guarantee that they will receive the lowest possible price from any provider. Such clauses also mean that if a new platform firm starts up, it cannot offer to undercut the original provider on price.In other words, if a large dominant firm keeps your business (and your attention) by providing you with the quality and price of services you want, and earns high profits as a result, so be it. But if that firm is earning high profits by seeking out innovative ways to hamstring the potential competitors, it's a legitimate antitrust problem.2) Data openness, portability, and interoperability.Data openness just means that companies need to be open with you about what data of yours they have on-hand--perhaps especially if that data was collected in some way that didn't involve you openly handing it over to them. Portability refers to the ability to move your data easily from one digital firm to another. For example, you might be more willing to try a different search engine, or email program, or a different bank or health care provider if all your past records could be ported easily to the new company. Interoperability refer to when technical standards allow your (email, shopping, health, financial or other) data to be used directly by two different providers, if you desire.Again, the underlying theme here is that if a big digital firm gets your attention with an attractive package of goods and services, that's fine; but if it hold you in place because it would be a mortal pain to transfer the data they have accumulated on you, that's a legitimate concern.Finally, I would add that it's easy to focus on the actions of big digital firms that one sees in the headlines, and as a result to pay less attention to other digital economy issues of equal or greater importance. For example, most of us face a situation of very limited competition when it comes to getting high-speed internet access[7]. In many ways, the growth of big digital firms doesn't raise new topics, but it should push some new thinking about those topics.

Today let's check in on how the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust case is developing.<br/>The first thing to say is that the case is developing slower than expected. Once on track to wrap up before the US presidential election, it now appears that the case will arrive afterward - if at all, Cecelia Kang reports in the New York Times:</p><p><br/>The investigation into whether the tech giant has broken antitrust laws continues to move along, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was private. A round of document production from the company and its rivals was done in the spring, and staff members appear to be preparing depositions of Facebook's top leadership, including its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, according to the people. The agency also began looking into concerns by rivals about Facebook's recent acquisition of Giphy, a search database for short video clips.<br/>But investigations often require multiple rounds of document requests, and the interviews will take time to complete, indicating that the agency is far from finishing its review and deciding whether to pursue a lawsuit, the people said.<br/>What's behind the delay? One explanation is that the federal government has chosen to focus instead on Google for the moment. But it's also taking the FTC longer than expected to develop a theory of the case about Facebook, Margaret Harding McGill and Ashley Gold report at Axios. One part of the agency, the Office of Policy Planning, wants to evaluate Facebook's market dominance through the question of whether it has raised prices for consumers. Another part of the agency, the Bureau of Competition, wants to investigate Facebook through the lens of competition, examining how the company's practice of making its services free to use has reduced the number of players in the space. Axios writes:<br/>One antitrust lawyer familiar with the workings of the FTC said the Office of Policy Planning \"would not want to move the needle much\" with antitrust guidelines, and is generally reluctant to consider new definitions for anticompetitive behavior.<br/>\"The policy people live in a world where there is a one-size-fits all formula,\" a person familiar with the back-and-forth said. \"They want it to be less messy, but the enforcers recognize that antitrust is inherently messy because it's fact-based.\"<br/>Also still up for debate: whether to depose Zuckerberg and Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg. Last year, when the FTC fined Facebook $5 billion, the terms were all but dictated by Facebook, Tony Romm reported in the Washington Post. The FTC later said it got a bigger settlement out of Facebook than it would have otherwise in part by excusing Zuckerberg and Sandberg from depositions.<br/>It seems strange to me that an inquiry into Facebook's market power would not involve sworn depositions from its top two executives. But then nothing about this investigation has so far proceeded in the way I thought it would.<br/>II.<br/>What is the best case that Facebook unfairly dominates the advertising market, uses its power to reduce competition, and has harmed consumers by doing so?<br/>The legal answer to that question, should it eventually be made by the FTC, will surely run dozens of pages, and be supported by mountains of supporting briefs and other documents. But if you want to look at the basic shape of it - what the FTC might say, and what Facebook might say back - you could start with this conversation last year between Wired editor in chief Nick Thompson and antitrust crusader Tim Wu. Thompson presents Facebook's case for itself as traditionally made by Zuckerberg, and Wu does his best to dismantle it.<br/>The Facebook case for itself goes something like: we have tons of competition, from consumer products to advertising products; our free services are a public good that, among other things, support the growth of millions of small businesses; and breaking us up would make all the problems that really worry you much worse. If you want a company to invest heavily in protecting the platform from bad actors, the argument goes, you want that company to be a giant. Finally, if you break us up, a giant technology company from China will likely emerge as the world's dominant social network, creating a beachhead for the expansion of Chinese soft power - and, along with it, censorship and authoritarianism. Perhaps you've heard of ByteDance?<br/>The Wu case goes something like: Facebook acquired Instagram to reduce competition. Facebook acquired WhatsApp to reduce competition. Facebook (with Google) now has an effective duopoly on digital advertising, and continues to acquire smaller social products that could threaten its dominance. This has harmed consumers by reducing the amount of innovation in the technology industry. It also turned Facebook into something like a single point of failure for the distribution of foreign propaganda, with famously dire results in 2016. Break up Facebook and force the new Baby Books to compete on innovation, including in the trust and safety services that Facebook now says only a company of its size can provide. As for China? Better to have a vibrant consumer technology industry than select a lightly regulated, monopolistic national champion to fight on America's behalf, as if in a Westerosi trial by combat.<br/>You'll note that these arguments don't have much to do with the price - in dollars - that consumers pay as a result of Facebook's outsized success. They can't: the services are free. The question looming over the Facebook antitrust case - and the one being debated by officials within the FTC - is whether the agency is willing to take other costs into account.<br/>If that agency won't, perhaps the nation's attorney generals or the Department of Justice, which are conducting their own antitrust investigations into Facebook, will.<br/>III.<br/>One reason some people are skeptical of antitrust cases is that tech companies often just fall apart by themselves. The US government sued Microsoft for bundling its Internet Explorer browser with Windows out of fears that doing so would permanently entrench its monopoly in personal computers. And then Google made Chrome, and Microsoft just kept making Internet Explorer, and Microsoft made a series of really bad mobile phones, and Apple made a good one, and within a few years Microsoft was an enterprise software company with a video game console division and it was hard to remember what the whole fuss had been about in the first place.<br/>Until recently, it has been hard to envision how something similar might happen to Facebook, since there has been so little growth in other social networks. Snapchat and Twitter tick up a bit each quarter, but their user bases remain a fraction of Facebook's. And even if a competitor did emerge, we know Facebook would either clone it, attempt to acquire it, or both.<br/>Then TikTok came along and challenged that view. Yes, it had to spend $1 billion on advertising to hit escape velocity. But it did, and now it has. Children now spend an average of 80 minutes a day on TikTok. If you're Facebook, that's the very definition of a competitive threat.<br/>For that reason, you might expect that Facebook executives reacted warmly to the news that the app has been banned in India. Facebook raced to bring its TikTok clone, Reels, to market in India, and has promised to roll it out in dozens more countries by next month. It looks like classic Facebook: working ruthlessly to disrupt a competitor in a moment of weakness.<br/>But Zuckerberg has told employees that he finds the move worrisome, I'm told. If India can ban one app used by 200 million people, citing rather vague national security concerns, it can ban others. Facebook already faces fights around the world from governments on both the left and the right related to issues that fit under the broad umbrella of national security: election interference, influence campaigns, hate speech, and even just plain-old democratic speech. Zuckerberg knows that the leap from banning TikTok on national security grounds to banning Facebook on national security grounds is more of a short hop.<br/>The so-called \"Splinternet\" is a long time in coming. When I wrote about it here last year, it was in the context of a new European internet emerging alongside the American and Sino-Russian authoritarian ones. When India banned TikTok, it added a new fault line to the global internet. And as those cracks continue to spread, they risk shrinking the size of Facebook more than even the FTC ever could.<br/>The Twitter hackLast week Twitter suffered a catastrophic security breach, with attackers managing to wrangle temporary control of the accounts of President Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and others. Since then, some new details have come to light.<br/>One unanswered question from last week was: could attackers access victims' direct messages? In eight cases, the answer appears to have been yes, according to a blog post Twitter put up Friday. But none of the accounts whose DMs may have been breached were verified accounts, Twitter said, throwing cold water on theories from last week that the Bitcoin scam perpetrated by the accounts was meant to be a distraction from some larger blackmail campaign or other scheme. All in all, attackers targeted 130 accounts for takeover and managed to crack 45, Twitter said.<br/>Meanwhile, the New York Times talked to some individuals who say they were involved in the attack. Key takeaway: the hackers' original interest had been in taking over short usernames - @6, @y, that sort of thing - and only belatedly realized they might be able to make more money taking over famous people's accounts. To the extent that gives you comfort that the attack was just about making money and not destabilizing the nature of our reality and / or starting nuclear war, there you go.<br/>Twitter says it's embarrassed. A former FTC official says the company's data security lapses, which are many, are \"egregious.\" Everyone who thinks about the prospect of something similar happening in the run up to Election Day shudders with fear.<br/>As for remaining questions, here are two. One, will the FTC or another branch of government take action against Twitter for this lapse? And two, Twitter hasn't said anything more about how its own employees may have been involved in the breach. Did the attackers have an inside man, or did they simply trick an employee into doing their bidding? Here's hoping we get an answer to that one, and soon.<br/>The RatioToday in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.<br/>Trending down: Anti-transgender Facebook content shared by right-wing news sources generated more engagement than content from pro-transgender or neutral sources combined. The news comes from a study of 225 viral posts by Media Matters for America. Feels like a difficult one for the \"fight bad speech with more speech\" crowd. What happens when the platform keeps amplifying the bad speech because it gets more engagement? (Tim Fitzsimons / NBC)<br/>Trending down: Microsoft is knee-deep in services for law enforcement, fostering an ecosystem of companies that provide police with software using Microsoft's cloud and other platforms. The company has evaded much of the scrutiny that companies like Amazon have gotten for working with law enforcement agencies. (Michael Kwet / The Intercept)<br/>Governing\u2b50 Fiona Scott Morton, a top antitrust expert known for her warnings that American tech giants are stifling competition, is also advising two of the biggest names in tech: Amazon and Apple. Both companies are facing antitrust investigations. Here's David McLaughlin at Bloomberg:<br/>She didn't disclose those relationships in papers she recently co-authored outlining how the U.S. could bring antitrust cases against Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc.<br/>Scott Morton, hailed in a 2019 article in the New Republic as an \"antitrust crusader,\" said she began consulting for Amazon in the last year, while her work for Apple dates back several years. She said she usually discloses her clients when speaking at conferences. The lack of disclosure on the Google and Facebook papers, she said, shouldn't be an issue because Apple and Amazon didn't pay her to write them. What's more, she added, those papers didn't focus on either Apple or Amazon.<br/>For years, tech giants have pushed op-eds from small business owners, think tanks, and academics into US newspapers without disclosing their involvement. The op-eds, which tend to advance the tech giants' policy positions, make it seem like they have more public support than they actually do. (Alex Kantrowitz / Big Technology)<br/>Google and Apple's COVID-19 exposure notification system was supposed to preserve people's privacy. But for the apps to work on smartphones with Google's Android operating system, users must first turn on the device location setting, which enables GPS and may allow Google to determine their locations. (Natasha Singer / The New York Times)<br/>Tech companies across the country are scrambling to figure out how they can remain in compliance with international privacy laws after Europe's highest court struck down the EU-US Privacy Shield. The court said the framework did not adequately protect European users from the US government's far-reaching surveillance laws. (Emily Birnbaum / Protocol)<br/>Mark Zuckerberg tried to shut down rumors that he's made a deal with Trump not to take action on the president's inflammatory posts. \"I've heard this speculation, too, so let me be clear: There's no deal of any kind,\" he said. \"Actually, the whole idea of a deal is pretty ridiculous.\" (Mike Allen / Axios)<br/>US District Judge Phyllis Hamilton denied NSO Group's request to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Facebook and WhatsApp. Facebook is accusing the spyware maker of creating accounts to send malware to mobile phones of 1,400 people to snoop on them. (Malathi Nayak / Bloomberg)<br/>As California attorney general, Sen. Kamala Harris saw Facebook and other big tech companies as allies rather than threats, according to a trove of emails obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. At times, she even teamed up with tech companies to market herself as a rising star in American politics. (Zach Carter / HuffPost)<br/>A fact-check of a viral climate misinformation article was quietly removed from Facebook earlier this month. Now, if users try to share the article, which argues that concern about climate change is overblown, there is no warning and no link to the fact-check. Facebook says it's opinion piece, and so this sort of nonsense is fair game. (Popular Information)<br/>Related: Sen. Elizabeth Warren is demanding more information about the reported \"loophole\" for climate misinformation in Facebook's fact-checking program. In a letter, she wrote: \"...the company must immediately acknowledge ... that the climate crisis is not a matter of opinion and act to close loopholes that allow climate disinformation to spread on its platform.\" (Rebecca Heilweil / Recode)<br/>Disney has dramatically slashed its advertising spending on Facebook amid an ongoing boycott from companies upset with its handling of hate speech and divisive content. Disney was Facebook's top US advertiser for the first six months of 2020. (Suzanne Vranica / The Wall Street Journal)<br/>The Global Alliance for Responsible Media, an industry body consisting of the world's biggest advertising companies, has agreed to evaluate how to better define hate speech across the industry. Facebook, Google, and Twitter are part of the group, as are Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever. Do we want a single industry-wide definition of harmful speech, or do we want to encourage competition here? Important question! (Sara Fischer / Axios)<br/>Twitter removed a campaign video that President Trump retweeted on Saturday over a copyright complaint. The Linkin Park song \"In the End\" was featured in the background of the video, which included images of President Trump and excerpts from his inauguration speech. The campaign used the song without permission. Law and order! (Kim Lyons / The Verge)<br/>Trump's presidential campaign is running ads on Facebook and Instagram urging supporters to sign a petition to ban TikTok. The move is part of an escalating fight between the White House and the video sharing app. (Kari Soo Lindberg / Bloomberg)<br/>Experts on China say that while concerns over TikTok's national security risks should not be dismissed, blocking the app would be a drastic measure. It would also mean United States is participating in the same Chinese-style internet sovereignty tactics it has long criticized. (Louise Matsakis / Wired)<br/>Democratic lawmakers tend to post more often and have more followers on Twitter than their Republican counterparts. But Republican members of Congress get more audience engagement across both Facebook and Twitter. (Pew Research Center)<br/>The \"Platform Accountability and Consumer Transparency Act\" is an intellectually serious effort to grapple with the operational challenges of content moderation at the enormous scale of the internet, argues this author. While you might not agree with it entirely, it's a welcome change from bills like FOSTA and EARN IT. (Daphne Keller / The Center for Internet and Society)<br/>Andrew Yang's plan to make social media companies pay you for your data doesn't add up, this piece argues. There are too many loopholes, the plan would be too expensive, and other plans like it have already failed. (Will Rinehart / Wired)<br/>A group of more than 30 moms created a barricade to protect hundreds of protesters from federal officers during demonstrations against police brutality in Portland, Oregon, on Saturday. \"We'll be out until no protester needs protecting,\" one of the mothers, who organized the Facebook group \"Wall of Moms,\" said. (Ryan Mac / BuzzFeed)<br/>Google removed the carousel of tweets from search result pages after dozens of prominent Twitter accounts were hacked last week. The Twitter carousel box usually comes up when searching for a well-known person or brand. (Barry Schwartz / Search Engine Land)<br/>Industry\u2b50 US companies are rushing to hire chief diversity officers amid pressure to address racial divisions and inequities within their organizations. But the role has long been marked by high turnover, with many leaving over a lack of resources, unrealistic expectations and inadequate support from senior executives. Chip Cutter and Lauren Weber at The Wall Street Journal have the story:<br/>Longtime diversity executives said the space can suffer from rhetoric when it is specific goals that matter. Gerri Mason Hall is the chief diversity and social responsibility officer for the Americas at Sodexo, a food service company. Her team sends out a scorecard to managers every month, listing the rates of hiring, retention and promotion by gender and race, among other things.<br/>She has a team of 10, reports to her CEO and said organizations tend to be successful when they treat diversity goals the way they do other business priorities that result in better profits. \"What is the company trying to accomplish?\" she asks. \"Is it really you just want to put on a show?\"<br/>TikTok pulled back from talks to open the headquarters for its non-China business in the United Kingdom after the government banned Chinese telecom firm Huawei from developing Britain's 5G mobile phone network. The move threatens the creation of roughly 3,000 jobs. (Phillip Inman / The Guardian)<br/>Evan Spiegel made Miranda Kerr a gingerbread house on their first date, and now they live in a three-bedroom house in Brentwood. This article, which is mostly about Spiegel and Kerr's relationship, also dives into Spiegel's refreshingly straightforward take on regulating hate speech on Snapchat. (Christina Binkley / The Wall Street Journal)<br/>Snapchat launched Headspace Minis, free meditations that live in the chat section of the app. The in-chat meditations are partly an attempt to encourage people to develop a mindfulness practice by making it something they can do with friends. (Rachel Kraus / Mashable)<br/>Cameo, the celebrity shout-out app, launched a new feature that allows businesses to buy endorsements from famous people. The feature lets companies bypass the legal hurdles and enormous price tags of traditional celebrity endorsements. (Rebecca Jennings / Vox)<br/>Logic signed to Twitch, in a deal worth roughly seven figures. The move comes days after the artist announced he would be retiring from music. (Bijan Stephen / The Verge)<br/>Twitch intervened to stop the US Army from using fake prize giveaways on its esports channel to redirect viewers to army recruitment pages. (James Vincent / The Verge)<br/>Things to doStuff to occupy you online during the quarantine.<br/>Read about how the top vaccine candidates are coming along. There's room for cautious optimism.

Big Pharma. Big Tobacco. America is no stranger to the perceived mistrust placed upon \"big\" industries.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There's a new group of top-competitors that regulators and lawmakers have initiated a litigation war with: Big Tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big Tech is comprised of the top-tech companies in the United States: Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google and occasionally, Microsoft.</p><p>Regulators and lawmakers have launched antitrust investigations into whether the four technology companies have used their size and wealth to end competition and expand their dominance. The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice are leading the investigations into these companies. The FTC is focusing on Amazon and Facebook, while the DOJ is responsible for the Google and Apple probe.</p><p>There was never any question as to if there would be a litigation war, but when. For a while now, these companies have faced public scrutiny as their influence-and business-grows. Now, they're target practice for regulators.</p><p>The antitrust arguments against the companies differ, just as their primary revenue sources vary. However, the major concern that still stands is whether too few companies possess too much power.</p><p>Facebook. How could one forget the Cambridge Analytica scandal and Mark Zuckerburg's brilliant idea to monetize his user's data? Recently, Facebook was hit with a $5 billion fine from the FTC after releasing over 400 million phone numbers of its users. It is the largest penalty ever levied against a tech company. As part of the settlement, the company agreed to improve and evaluate its user data policies.</p><p>Google makes the majority of its profit from its advertising network. In 2017, ads generated 86% of its revenues. Google is an advertising mastermind; it acquired Youtube, realizing its potential to generate ad revenue, while simultaneously tapping into a new market-video advertisement. However, Google has been accused of favoring its own services over other competitors, such as Yelp. Additionally, Google-owned Youtube was charged $170 million for collecting children's personal data and violating their privacy.</p><p>Congress questioned whether Amazon abuses data collected from other sellers, as a result killing companies with unfair practices by favoring its own products over third-party sellers. Congress has also accused Amazon whether the company's own products get \"preferential promotion on its site\" in terms of advertisement, according to the New York Times. According to TJI research, Amazon has more than 140 private labels. While in actuality, private labels represent fewer than one percent of Amazon's total sales.</p><p>Apple is facing a class-action lawsuit for inflating prices in its App Store. With IOS, owners can only purchase or download apps through the App Store. Apple's chief compliance officer Kyle Andeer discussed the company's business ethics and competition at a judiciary committee hearing. \"Our mission is to make the best products and services in the world in each of the markets where we compete - for us it's never been about making the most, it's always about making the best. We design our technology to be easy to use, and safe and secure for all our customers. We see our customers' privacy as a fundamental human right, and we embed that value in everything we create.\" Andeer went on to say that companies such as Lyft, Uber, Pinterest and Spotify have had success in the formation of their companies through the App Store. However, this isn't Apple's first probe. Just in 2018, the company was being investigated by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission over potential securities violations related to its disclosure of the software updates that slowed older iPhones.</p><p>Big Tech, according to the bipartisan dispute, is just one big monopoly. The government wants to break up these companies and the resources they have rightfully acquired. Facebook would cut ties with Whatsapp and Instagram. Google would let go of Youtube. Why would they do this? To create future competition.</p><p>But what is the need for future competition if these companies are purely innovative and successful in what they do?</p><p>As these companies continue to prosper, the rest of corporate America continues to envy their power-I can't help but admire their accelerated growth.</p><p>First, we must recognize that Big Tech isn't one large, demonizing monopoly the current rhetoric leads us to believe. Big Tech is five companies all in different businesses. So often now these companies are lumped together as Big Tech, though the view that they are one is false. They purely work well together and recognize each other's success in their own respective fields.</p><p>In a Bloomberg interview, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates expressed his distaste in the idea of breaking up Big Tech. \"If there's a way the company is behaving that you want to get rid of, then you should just say, 'OK, that's a banned behavior,'\" Gates said. \"Splitting the company in two and having two people doing the bad thing-that doesn't seem like a solution.\"</p><p>The one thing all of the companies have in common is their collection, analysis and exploitation of data, whether it be from consumers, advertisers or wholesalers.</p><p>One proposal I agree with most is one that would loosen the companies' control of user data. Former senior antitrust official at the Justice Department, A. Douglas Melamed, supports the idea that Big Tech companies should give smaller companies access to user data. Melamed served as a member of the Stigler Center study team that cited several data moves in a list of potential regulations and enforcement actions.</p><p>\"Data is a real trump card these platforms have,\" said Melamed. \"You let competitors have access to their back rooms for a reasonable fee.\" Essentially, if regulators want to give other companies a chance to compete with the tech giants, data ultimately can be accessed-at a price.</p><p>Breaking up large, thriving American companies is not the solution. Rest assured, neither is the continuation of fines. The democrats and republicans are cheering for the Big Tech break up, and consumers should be skeptical before they join in, too.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4252615</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X34-25X1-DY7P-T07R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1026\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bullet: Mary Washington</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 19, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

If Democrats triumph in the November elections, it could also be a major, multi-decade turning point in US antitrust policy. They want to curb not only Big Tech, but a number of other industries with dominant players - finance and pharmaceuticals - with more regulation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If that happens, we should thank not only Washington, but state and local officials who have been challenging corporate power in their own backyards for several years.</p><p>As a new report from the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR) lays out, they have been \"on the frontlines of the problems caused by excessive concentration\" in America, including food insecurity, power outages and poor broadband coverage.</p><p>Nationally, Democrats are focusing on corporate concentration as a campaign issue. They are pushing back against 40 years of neoliberal thinking that has measured economic success in terms of low consumer prices rather than high incomes and job security.</p><p>But well before antitrust became trendy, local communities were waging successful fights against corporate behemoths for practical rather than ideological reasons. Those battles have laid the groundwork for what may come at federal level.</p><p>North Dakota, for example, has decided to put community banks and credit unions at the heart of its financial sector, side-stepping the four megabanks that control 44 per cent of the assets of the US banking system.</p><p>That looks smart now that research has shown cities and states with more community banks are receiving more aid from the COVID-19 Paycheck Protection Program. Entrepreneurs have been able to look to local banks to support their applications, and that translates into improved solvency and higher employment in the crisis.</p><p>There are countless examples of communities that have successfully waged such David and Goliath battles. They have used not just state antitrust legislation but also rules around land use, tax policy and labour enforcement.</p><p>Very often, they end up economically better off. Communities with a greater share of their economy in the hands of small businesses are better at solving problems collectively, says Stacy Mitchell, the ILSR's co-director. They also have higher levels of civic participation, according to research.</p><p>\"Just as we know that concentrated power corrupts democracy, the opposite is true,\" she says. \"The more broadly economic decision-making is distributed, and the more say people have over their livelihoods, the more effective and engaged they are as citizens.\"</p><p>That is a key point to get across now, as Congress wrangles over the next COVID-19 relief package, and whether to offer more help to small businesses as well as state and local government.</p><p>Some believe policymakers should embrace creative destruction in a kind of Schumpeterian culling of what would surely be tens of thousands of small businesses in less productive sectors such as restaurants, services and personal care.</p><p>They argue this would encourage workers to retrain and redeploy in the digital economy. But that runs into the problem that each generation of Big Tech companies seems to be able to do more with fewer people. A handful of very large, very rich companies that need fewer and fewer workers doesn't add up to an economy.</p><p>Allowing certain kinds of small- and medium-sized enterprises to fail not because they are unsuccessful, but because they are not high-growth digital enterprises, would be a mistake. Economists obsessed with \"efficiency\" theory have been making it for years. They look simply at a few data points on a spreadsheet and ignore how SMEs support communities in ways that larger companies often do not.</p><p>Regions with a greater share of SMEs have less income inequality and faster household income growth, according to research gathered by the ILSR. Small businesses tend to be embedded in a web of economic relationships with other businesses. This creates resilience and sparks innovation.</p><p>Research shows that industries with a mix of firm sizes produce new inventions and processes at a faster clip. Indeed, this is an argument many Big Tech executives would put forward about Silicon Valley. It's that very ecosystem which helped launch generations of successful start-ups.</p><p>Battles with big corporations of any kind are hard to fight. EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager recently lost a tax case against Apple. But the smaller battles fought at the city and state level can have national impact.</p><p>During the 1920s, small-town protests over issues such as grocery monopolies and Wall Street control of family farms brought the attention of Franklin Roosevelt to antitrust issues. He began to give speeches about the topic - much as senator Elizabeth Warren, representative David Cicilline and Federal Trade commissioner Rohit Chopra do today. FDR led the last big crackdown on corporate monopolies. It's time for another.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc7bmgzgsou6qzm21i2nh</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GB-BWC1-F0J6-J029-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"860\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

On Wednesday, the chief executives of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google will be questioned in a House judiciary antitrust <url normalizedValue=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=3114\"> subcommittee hearing</url>.</p><p>This is perhaps the most important and high-profile conversation about monopolies since the Microsoft case of the 1990s. If Democrats triumph in the November elections, it could also be a major, multi-decade turning point in US antitrust policy. They want to curb not only Big Tech, but a number of other industries with dominant players \u2014 finance and pharmaceuticals \u2014 with more regulation.</p><p>If that happens, we should thank not only Washington, but state and local officials who have been challenging corporate power in their own backyards for several years. As a <url normalizedValue=\"https://ilsr.org/fighting-monopoly-power/\"> new report</url> from the Institute for Local Self-Reliance lays out, they have been \u201con the front lines of the problems caused by excessive concentration\u201d in America, including <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ec698f1-c97c-467b-99e3-009d7919af10\"> food insecurity</url>, power outages and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3697d0f8-7b0b-11ea-af44-daa3def9ae03\"> poor broadband coverage</url>. These vulnerabilities have been highlighted by the <url normalizedValue=\"http://ft.com/coronavirus\"> coronavirus pandemic</url>.</p><p>Nationally, Democrats are focusing on corporate concentration as a campaign issue. They are pushing back against <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4fa76d9-aa11-4ced-8329-6fc8c250bc45\"> 40 years of neoliberal thinking</url> that has measured economic success in terms of low consumer prices rather than high incomes and job security. But well before antitrust became trendy, local communities were waging successful fights against corporate behemoths for practical rather than ideological reasons. Those battles have laid the groundwork for what may come at federal level. \u00a0</p><p>North Dakota, for example, has made a purposeful decision to put community banks and credit unions at the heart of its financial sector, sidestepping the four megabanks that now control <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/lbr/current/default.htm\"> 44 per cent of the assets of the US banking system</url>. That looks smart now that research has shown that cities and states with more community banks are receiving more aid from the Covid-19 Paycheck Protection Program. Entrepreneurs have been able to look to local banks to support their applications, and that translates into improved solvency and higher employment in the crisis.\u00a0</p><p>There are countless examples of communities that have successfully waged such David and Goliath battles. They have used not just state antitrust legislation but also rules around land use, tax policy and labour enforcement. Very often, they end up economically better off. Communities with a greater share of their economy in the hands of small businesses are better at solving problems collectively, says Stacy Mitchell, the ILSR\u2019s co-director. They also have higher levels of civic participation, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227464606_The_health_and_wealth_of_US_counties_How_the_small_business_environment_impacts_alternative_measures_of_development\"> research</url>. \u201cJust as we know that concentrated power corrupts democracy, the opposite is true,\u201d she says. \u201cThe more broadly economic decision-making is distributed, and the more say people have over their livelihoods, the more effective and engaged they are as citizens.\u201d</p><p>That is a key point to get across now, as Congress wrangles over the next Covid-19 relief package, and whether to offer more help to small businesses as well as state and local government. Some believe policymakers should embrace <url normalizedValue=\"https://itif.org/publications/2020/07/20/five-ways-next-recovery-act-should-support-post-covid-economic-restructuring\"> creative destruction</url> in a kind of Schumpeterian culling of what would surely be tens of thousands of small businesses in less productive sectors such as restaurants, services and personal care. They argue this would encourage workers to retrain and redeploy in the digital economy. But that runs into the problem that each generation of Big Tech companies seems to be able to do more with fewer people. A handful of very large, very rich companies that need fewer and fewer workers doesn\u2019t add up to an economy.</p><p>Allowing certain kinds of small- and medium-sized enterprises to fail not because they are unsuccessful, but because they are not high-growth digital enterprises, would be a mistake. Economists obsessed with \u201cefficiency\u201d theory have been making it for years. They look simply at a few data points on a spreadsheet, and ignore how SMEs support communities in ways that larger companies often do not or cannot.</p><p>Regions with a greater share of SMEs have less income inequality and faster household income growth, according to research gathered by the ILSR. Small businesses tend to be embedded in a web of local and regional economic relationships with other businesses. This creates resiliency and also sparks innovation. <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00191-014-0352-x\"> Research shows</url> that industries with a mix of firm sizes produce new inventions and processes at a faster clip.\u00a0Indeed, this is an argument many Big Tech executives would put forward about Silicon Valley. It\u2019s that very ecosystem which helped launch generations of successful start-ups.</p><p>Battles with big corporations of any kind are hard to fight. EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/39a36847-c846-4666-b8b9-65943f5361ee\"> recently lost a tax case against Apple</url>. But the smaller battles fought at the city and state level can have national impact. During the 1920s, small-town protests over issues such as grocery monopolies and Wall Street control of family farms brought the attention of Franklin Roosevelt to antitrust issues. He began to give <url normalizedValue=\"https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/june-27-1936-democratic-national-convention\"> speeches</url> about the topic \u2014 much as Senator Elizabeth Warren, Representative David Cicilline and Federal Trade Commissioner Rohit Chopra do today. FDR led the last big crackdown on corporate monopolies. It\u2019s time for another.</p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow Rana Foroohar with\u00a0</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/rana-foroohar\"> myFT</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00a0and on\u00a0</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/RanaForoohar\">Twitter</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-943cb0f634954eb0a1b8e66ecc68215c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FG-DMD1-DXP9-914N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"917\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 26, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>INSTITUTE FOR LOCAL SELF-RELIANCE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Led by Subcommittee Chairman Mike Lee (R-Utah), this hearing should have less of the circus atmosphere than last month\u2019s House hearing on antitrust and big tech, which seemed more like an excuse for both parties to yell at Silicon Valley\u2019s most powerful CEOs for soundbites.</p><p><br/>This hearing comes in the shadow of a looming Department of Justice (DoJ) investigation into Google\u2019s business practices. It is widely expected that the DoJ will press forward with charges against alleged anti-competitive behavior against the tech giant. In addition, a number of the subcommittee\u2019s members, unfortunately from both parties, have expressed great interest in increasing the use of antitrust enforcement. Conservatives ought to be quite wary of the recent surge of bipartisanship interest in antitrust, as their means might align in a way that plays right into the big-government ends of the left.<br/>Conservative lawmakers must use caution not to fall into the progressive mindset that a company having a huge market share makes it ipso facto anti-competitive. If antitrust laws are to exist at all, they ought to remain properly limited within the legal bounds of demonstrating that a company has stifled its competition in a way that is both deliberate and that causes harm to consumers.<br/>Unfortunately, in their current anger and distrust \u2013 not always unmerited \u2013 that many conservatives hold towards Big Tech because of perceived bias in how they regulate the flow of information, some appear to be willing to wield antitrust enforcement as a weapon to \u201cget even\u201d with the hobgoblins of Silicon Valley. Ironically, some on the political left would agree, but for the exact opposite reason; whereas conservatives worry that various Big Tech platforms are stifling free speech, many on the far left keep bullying tech companies to censor far more.<br/>In both cases, antitrust is sought as a weapon to be used to right a social ill more than an economic one. What constitutes overly aggressive censorship of \u201cmisinformation,\u201d political speech, or \u201chate speech,\u201d however any of those things are defined, is inherently a value judgment. Neither the leftist speech police nor the conservatives worried about free speech seem particularly sympathetic to the fact that the tech companies are in a no-win position \u2013 they\u2019re never going to please all comers.<br/>Breaking up companies like Google or Facebook isn\u2019t going to make these questions or problems go away (neither will opening them up to liability for their moderation choices, but that\u2019s a subject for another day). Ultimately, the beauty of the current \u201cconsumer welfare\u201d standard that guides antitrust enforcement now is that it specifically measures for economic harms. That\u2019s much closer to an objective standard than the state of antitrust enforcement for nearly the first century of its existence.<br/>Reining in the prior \u201crule of reason\u201d standard for antitrust in favor of the present consumer welfare standard was one of the greatest victories of the conservative movement against the administrative leviathan. Antitrust enforcement used to be so arbitrary, based upon whatever a judge might deem \u201cunfair,\u201d that large companies could have little idea (outside of obvious practices like price fixing) whether they were at risk of the government\u2019s interference. That kind of uncertainty causes real economic harm and could threaten the dynamism and innovation that has made the U.S. the world\u2019s leader in technology.<br/>Unmoored from having to demonstrate economic harm, antitrust is an incredibly powerful tool to advance a progressive economic vision under which the government, not consumers, gets to determine when a company has become \u201ctoo big\u201d or when a new innovation is so successful that it becomes \u201canti-competitive.\u201d In truth, no company has ever been able to maintain a true monopoly unless propped up by the government, but progressives mistake cause and effect.<br/>As House Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) accused at the beginning of last month\u2019s flogging of Big Tech CEOs, \u201cconcentrated economic power also leads to concentrated political power.\u201d The one way to guarantee that becomes true is to further involve the government in setting the standards for what constitutes too much success. This won\u2019t only affect the digital economy; a broader use of antitrust could affect every sector of our economy.<br/>So while it is legitimate to investigate whether Google has leveraged its market dominance to deliberately stifle competition in the marketplace, conservatives should tread very lightly in the use of antitrust enforcement. Concerns about censorship, free speech, and their effect on democracy are understandable, but distorting free markets via antitrust policy is not the way to address them.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-113555</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VH-0RR1-DY1R-B0D5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"833\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 15, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

What constitutes overly aggressive censorship of \"misinformation,\" political speech, or \"hate speech,\" however any of those things are defined, is inherently a value judgment. Neither the leftist speech police nor the conservatives worried about free speech seem particularly sympathetic to the fact that the tech companies are in a no-win position they're never going to please all comers.</p><p>Breaking up companies like Google or Facebook isn't going to make these questions or problems go away (neither will opening them up to liability for their moderation choices, but that's a subject for another day). Ultimately, the beauty of the current \"consumer welfare\" standard that guides antitrust enforcement now is that it specifically measures for economic harms. That's much closer to an objective standard than the state of antitrust enforcement for nearly the first century of its existence.</p><p>Reining in the prior \"rule of reason\" standard for antitrust in favor of the present consumer welfare standard was one of the greatest victories of the conservative movement against the administrative leviathan. Antitrust enforcement used to be so arbitrary, based upon whatever a judge might deem \"unfair,\" that large companies could have little idea (outside of obvious practices like price fixing) whether they were at risk of the government's interference. That kind of uncertainty causes real economic harm and could threaten the dynamism and innovation that has made the U.S. the world's leader in technology.</p><p>Unmoored from having to demonstrate economic harm, antitrust is an incredibly powerful tool to advance a progressive economic vision under which the government, not consumers, gets to determine when a company has become \"too big\" or when a new innovation is so successful that it becomes \"anti-competitive.\" In truth, no company has ever been able to maintain a true monopoly unless propped up by the government, but progressives mistake cause and effect.</p><p>As House Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline (D-R.I.) accused at the beginning of last month's flogging of Big Tech CEOs, \"concentrated economic power also leads to concentrated political power.\" The one way to guarantee that becomes true is to further involve the government in setting the standards for what constitutes too much success. This won't only affect the digital economy; a broader use of antitrust could affect every sector of our economy.</p><p>So while it is legitimate to investigate whether Google has leveraged its market dominance to deliberately stifle competition in the marketplace, conservatives should tread very lightly in the use of antitrust enforcement. Concerns about censorship, free speech, and their effect on democracy are understandable, but distorting free markets via antitrust policy is not the way to address them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123952003</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VJ-GHW1-JCBF-S31M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"843\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 15, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

As Congress considers antitrust action against Amazon and Facebook, and new regulations directed at Google, it\u2019s important to consider the history of anti-tech antitrust cases, both recent and distant: Microsoft, IBM, and the Bell System monopoly all ended with settlements that left the companies intact after lengthy legal battles. America\u2019s biggest tech problem can\u2019t be fixed through antitrust \u2014 half of the country struggles to reliably get online at all. To address this, lawmakers should make a deal that conscripts the tech giants to address the digital divide and use the momentum for reform the country\u2019s most damaging tech woe.       Steven Puetzer/      For months now, the drumbeat for reining in Big Tech has been getting louder. Critics have suggested solutions from breaking up  Facebook and Amazon to regulating social networks and search engines as public utilities. This summer, the heads of major tech firms were hauled before Congress, and the House Antitrust Subcommittee reportedly is following up with a major report calling for a breakup of the biggest of the Big Tech companies as a capstone to its 15-month investigation.    As fall began, the Senate Commerce Committee announced plans to subpoena top social media company CEOs to compel testimony on the legal provision that provides them broad legal immunity around content on their platforms, and the  Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights prepared for hearings on antitrust enforcement. Most significantly, the Department of Justice (DOJ) reportedly started  briefing state attorneys general on its proposal to launch a landmark antitrust lawsuit against Google \u2014 the most important anti-tech antitrust action since the 1998 case against Microsoft.    There is clear legal, regulatory, and political momentum behind taking action, and soon there will be no turning back. The question is: Is anti-tech antitrust the right tool to address America\u2019s biggest technology problem?    Historic as this push to challenge the power of these companies may be, the long history of antitrust action against Big Tech is not encouraging \u2014 particularly if you are hoping for a big company to be broken up outright. In 1956, the  Bell System  monopoly was left intact after a seven-year legal saga. The antitrust action against IBM lasted 13 years. Outcome? You guessed it: The behemoth remained unbroken. The 1998 action against Microsoft, in which the government argued that bundling of applications programs into Microsoft\u2019s dominant operating system constituted monopolistic actions, ended three years later with a settlement and the company intact.    Today\u2019s technology industry is more complex than it was in the time of the Bell System, IBM, or Microsoft cases. Moreover, while public sentiment had swung against Big Tech after the 2016 presidential elections, revelations of social media manipulation, and breaches of privacy, it has also improved during Covid-19, as Americans rely on tech products more than ever.    Any antitrust action against these companies will be long and drawn-out \u2014 no matter its conclusion \u2014 for a number of reasons. First, the complaints against the industry are varied, ranging from anti-competitiveness to privacy issues, data protection, and vulnerability to misinformation. Second, there are multiple large companies in the crosshairs, with different products and different suggested remedies. Third, multiple agencies are pursuing action, from the DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission to the House initiative led by Democrats to the Senate initiative led by Republicans, and each has a different approach, motivation, and timeline. Fourth, the technology itself keeps evolving. Finally, there is a precedent for settling with the tech industry: Previous antitrust actions have resulted in settlements or consent decrees where lawmakers got something from each of the companies in exchange for leaving them intact, which might well encourage companies to drag the fight out as long as possible. Putting these considerations together, it reasonable to expect a lengthy process that risks frittering away the current momentum, and which ends with a settlement that resolves issues on the margins.    So, what can be done to make productive use of the momentum for reform? First, we need to ask just what tech problem we want to solve \u2014 and there are many jostling for attention. Lack of competition is one: Consumers have limited choices in search engines, social media platforms, and e-commerce platforms. Several applications or services are owned by platforms, giving the latter an unfair advantage \u2014 for instance, Amazon is a marketplace for third-party sellers, but it also competes with those merchants by selling Amazon-branded products. Privacy is another issue: Americans still do not have consistent data protection laws. Beyond that, users on social media are vulnerable to being fed misinformation.    While these problems have serious implications for competitiveness of markets, functioning of democratic institutions, and preservation of privacy, there is a deeper, more foundational problem that receives much less attention \u2013 and more urgently needs to be solved.    The United States\u2019 most serious tech problem is that half of Americans struggle to reliably get online at all. At a moment when nine out of 10 Americans say internet access is essential, according to a Pew research study , this is a devastating divide. Work, school, health care, socializing, and, often, shopping for essentials have largely moved online, which means the absence of a reliable digital connection can prove ruinous. If I am among the  162 million  Americans without access to a decent internet connection \u2014 with download speeds of at least 25 megabits per second (Mbps) and upload speeds of at least 3 Mbps \u2014 or who cannot afford the  most expensive  broadband access in the world, I have an urgent problem on my hands. My child may be attending school  online in a Taco Bell parking lot  or huddled under a blanket outside a closed school to piggyback on its wi-fi system, because those places happen to have the nearest internet connection. My telehealth visits with my doctor are likely interrupted because of a spotty internet signal. My employment is in jeopardy because I must log onto a jittery Zoom connection that\u2019s unreliable at best. For many consumers, the usual go-to places for getting on the internet \u2014 community centers, schools, libraries \u2014 are closed .    The access gap both mirrors and reinforces inequality in the United States. The picture is far worse for Black and Hispanic populations. Data analyzed by  our Imagining a Digital Economy for All (IDEA) 2030 research program, established with support from the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, suggests that depending on where one lives, the most basic digital product \u2014 reliable access to the internet \u2014 has failed the test of inclusive digital access to education, health care, and jobs. To make matters worse, the very parts of the country where schools are  digitally unprepared  to go remote \u2014 Mississippi, Louisiana, Kentucky, Alabama, Montana, and Arkansas, for example \u2014 overlap with the parts of the country where schools  should  be run remotely because of failing public health guidelines. These states also suffer from limited access to  telehealth ,  employment opportunities  and online government services.    Lawmakers and regulators have an unusual opportunity right now: They can use their leverage over the most innovative and best-performing technology companies to solve the problem of internet access. They can do this now, before any other issues get discussed en route to a full settlement. Lawmakers can press for the four Big Tech players that are their primary targets \u2014 Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple \u2014 to collaborate on identifying the broadband deserts in the U.S., and designing a plan to collectively fill the gaps in a way that is affordable to users and gives them no advantage as gatekeepers. Agreeing to be a part of this solution then gives the companies the permission to remain at the table for further negotiation. This will create the right incentives to the companies to participate and take action.    These companies are already in the business of providing internet access. Facebook provides free access to a limited version of the internet in more than 60 countries through its Facebook Connectivity initiative, with solutions ranging from low-cost wireless connections in dense urban areas to high-altitude platforms for connecting remote areas to free basic internet access in developing regions. Alphabet has a project for  fiber deployment  and  Loon , a unit of Alphabet, uses balloons, unmanned aircraft and high altitude platform stations. Amazon has plans for deploying more than  3,000 low earth orbit satellites , with the goal of offering broadband service everywhere, and Apple has a  similar project  in the works.    These companies have the resources, as the pandemic has driven already historic profits to even higher peaks, and would have an interest in cooperating if there is an expectation that it might help reach an eventual settlement on the other issues on the table. It could be in the self-interest of these companies, as expanding access also expands their consumer base. After all, these companies have already invested in expensive internet access projects for a reason. Clearly, it must be because they expect to see commercial value from expanding the market.    The pandemic has revealed the most fundamental of our digital vulnerabilities. In taking a historic step, let\u2019s turn to history again and that ancient deal from the  Communications Act of 1934  that permitted the Bell System to maintain a monopoly in exchange for ensuring universal service. Today, critics may denounce a deal with the tech giants a Faustian bargain, but it would represent a practical step forward \u2014 and one that recognizes where the process starting today will likely end up. Let\u2019s make a deal with the successors of the Bell System, and work to solve a problem that should never have existed in 2020.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43218674614</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YY-K721-JCSC-J1PG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1759\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Harvard Business Review</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 2, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Il recente intervento sul golden power per limitare le scalate di imprese italiane, oppure, in sede Ue, l'allentamento dei limiti alla concessione di aiuti di Stato, sono tutti interventi vanno nella direzione di una revisione delle norme antitrust per aiutare i singoli Stati membri a gestire la crisi. \u00abSembra poterci essere un contrasto tra golden power e antitrust: ma cos\u00ec non \u00e8. Il legislatore antitrust infatti vuole proteggere la concorrenza tra operatori che si contendono le quote di mercato attraverso sane dinamiche concorrenziali\u00bb, spiega Enrico Adriano Raffaelli, fondatore di Rucellai &amp; Raffaelli e presidente d'onore dell'Unione degli avvocati europei (Uae). \u00abTant'\u00e8 vero che ha istituito il controllo delle concentrazioni considerando queste uno strumento artificiale per conquistare quote di mercato causando una riduzione della concorrenza\u00bb. La Commissione Europea e l'Agcm si sono espresse a favore del golden power proprio perch\u00e9 hanno capito che un'alterazione dei mercati mediante lo sfruttamento degli effetti della Pandemia in atto non porterebbe niente di buono in termini di sana concorrenza. \u00abIn effetti le misure di golden power introdotte con il Decreto liquidit\u00e0 sono molto significative perch\u00e9 estendono il golden power in precedenza limitato ai settori della difesa, della sicurezza nazionale, dei trasporti, dell'energia, delle comunicazioni, delle reti di telecomunicazione elettronica anche a settori di natura completamente diversa quali quelli della sicurezza alimentare, della finanza, dell'intelligenza artificiale, dei semi-conduttori, delle biotecnologie, ecc\u00bb, aggiunge Raffaelli. </p><p>\u00abSi tratta di misure temporanee che \u2013 a mio avviso \u2013 dovrebbero invece diventare definitive. L'emergenza sanitaria che stiamo vivendo ha reso evidenti i limiti del mercato unico quando vi \u00e8 in gioco la sicurezza e la sopravvivenza stessa degli Stati membri; il nostro paese quindi dovrebbe preoccuparsi di difendere tutte quelle produzioni nazionali che abbiamo visto avere natura strategica e vanno ben al di l\u00e0 del settore difesa e di quello della sicurezza. \u00c8 tempo che anche l'Italia, come altri stati membri a cominciare dalla Francia, difenda i suoi \u00abcampioni nazionali\u00bb nei pi\u00f9 svariati settori\u00bb.\u00abPer far fronte all'emergenza economica scatenata dalla pandemia, l'Italia, al pari di quasi tutti gli altri Stati europei, ha fatto largo ricorso agli aiuti di Stato alle imprese, ordinariamente preclusi dall'articolo 107 del Trattato sul funzionamento dell'Unione europea. L'intervento statale nell'economia \u00e8, infatti, in genere \u00abnemico\u00bb della libera concorrenza, dal momento che le imprese sono chiamate ad operare sul mercato potendo contare unicamente sulle proprie risorse. Tuttavia, tenuto conto della situazione emergenziale, gli aiuti concessi sono stati sinora approvati dalla Commissione europea, in quanto destinati a porre rimedio a un \u00abgrave turbamento dell'economia di uno Stato membro\u00bb, dice Sabrina Borocci, responsabile del dipartimento italiano Antitrust, competition and economic regulation di Hogan Lovells. \u00abIn tutti questi casi la Commissione ha fatto applicazione del c.d. Temporary Framework, da essa stessa adottato ad hoc, per le misure di aiuto di Stato a sostegno dell'economia nell'attuale emergenza del Covid-19. Ci\u00f2 che sar\u00e0 importante monitorare, in una fase successiva, \u00e8 l'uso che di tali aiuti sar\u00e0 fatto dalle imprese; ci\u00f2 al fine di verificare che gli aiuti siano effettivamente utilizzati per far fronte alle perdite economiche generate dalla pandemia e non invece per attuare forme di concorrenza sleale sul mercato\u00bb. Per ci\u00f2 che concerne gli aiuti di Stato, l'articolo 107 del Trattato sul funzionamento dell'Unione europea offre diverse basi giuridiche per legittimarne la concessione. Di conseguenza, la Commissione europea sar\u00e0 chiamata a valutare con attenzione presupposti, proporzionalit\u00e0 e durata delle misure statali, in modo tale da evitarne un uso generalizzato e quindi illegittimo. \u00abCon riferimento agli accordi anticompetitivi e agli abusi di posizione dominante, l'odierna crisi richiede una necessaria attenuazione dell'applicazione delle rilevanti norme di diritto della concorrenza. La proporzionalit\u00e0 di tale attenuazione, cos\u00ec come la diretta discendenza di questa dalla crisi Covid-19, potr\u00e0 essere valutata dalle autorit\u00e0 competenti solamente tramite un approccio casistico, al momento difficilmente individuabile a priori. L'Agcm, ha almeno ad oggi mantenuto ferma la propria posizione rispetto ai c.d. \u00abcartelli di crisi\u00bb, quelle forme di coordinamento messe in atto dalle imprese per far fronte comune rispetto a fenomeni eccezionali che mettono a repentaglio la loro sopravvivenza e permanenza stessa sul mercato. Queste sono normalmente vietate ai sensi dell'art. 101 del Trattato sul funzionamento dell'Unione europea, come ogni altra condotta collusiva. C'\u00e8 da attendersi che l'Autorit\u00e0 non rimarr\u00e0 insensibile rispetto all'eccezionalit\u00e0 della situazione attuale e alle conseguenze che ne derivano, in ragione dell'appartenenza dell'Autorit\u00e0 italiana a organizzazioni sovranazionali\u00bb conclude Borocci.Secondo Filippo Fioretti responsabile del Dipartimento di Antitrust di Pavia e Ansaldo \u00abci saranno sicuramente numerose differenze tra i vari settori dell'economia, non essendo tutti stati coinvolti allo stesso modo dagli effetti diretti e indiretti delle misure di lockdown. Sicuramente, si porranno nuove sfide per quasi tutte le imprese. Nell'attuale stato di incertezza circa l'effettivo impatto economico e le prospettive di ripresa, \u00e8 facile pensare ad uno scenario in cui le imprese possano essere portate (e, perch\u00e9 no, incentivate) a collaborare per agevolare il processo di ripresa, con un probabile parziale ripensamento di concetti giuridici ed economici propri del diritto antitrust, come quello dei c.d. cartelli di crisi, dell'incentivo pubblico alla cooperazione e delle possibilit\u00e0 di riconversione produttiva delle aziende\u00bb. \u00abLa sospensione dei procedimenti amministrativi e giudiziari in molti paesi dell'Ue (valevole sia per procedimenti di merger, che per procedimenti su intese restrittive e abusi di dominanza) hanno senz'altro inciso sul timing delle operazioni societarie e delle pratiche relative agli accertamenti di illeciti anticoncorrenziali\u00bb, prosegue Fioretti. \u00abAl di l\u00e0 di questi effetti di tipo \u201coperativo\u201d, sicuramente \u00e8 possibile gi\u00e0 descrivere o prevedere alcuni effetti diretti sull'economia che coinvolgono le problematiche di diritto antitrust, come l'accennato scenario di incremento della cooperazione tra aziende (concorrenti e non). Proprio in tal senso lo scorso 23 marzo l'Ecn (European Competition Network) ha chiarito che, se, da un lato, non \u00e8 messa in dubbio l'applicazione della normativa a tutela della concorrenza dell'Ue, la crisi generata dalla diffusione del Covid-19 potrebbe innescare la necessit\u00e0 per le aziende di cooperare. Tuttavia \u00e8 ancora presto per valutare l'effettiva portata di tale aspetto che sar\u00e0 osservabile pi\u00f9 nel medio termine\u00bb.Pi\u00f9 prudente Michele Carpagnano, responsabile del dipartimento Antitrust di Dentons: \u00abla concorrenza, come fenomeno economico, non ha subito restrizioni significative dai provvedimenti del governo che, come noto, hanno riguardato il tessuto economico nel suo complesso. Anzi il diritto della concorrenza ha mostrato a livello nazionale e Ue di avere gli strumenti e la flessibilit\u00e0 tali per contribuire a garantire un assetto di norme stabile ma non insensibile alle nuove esigenze temporanee di flessibilit\u00e0 (ad esempio: in materia di aiuti di Stato o di cooperazione tra concorrenti) per consentire interventi a protezione dell'occupazione, del credito e delle attivit\u00e0 economiche pi\u00f9 duramente colpite dalle conseguenze del Covid-19. Tutti abbiamo notato, tra le misure adottate per contrastare il Covid-19, la nazionalizzazione di una compagnia aerea italiana proprio durante la procedura di vendita competitiva nel mercato. Non sarebbe un buon segnale per le imprese che operano in Italia e, soprattutto, per i consumatori italiani se la fase di riapertura delle attivit\u00e0 economiche non fosse accompagnata da una grande attenzione all'importanza dell'assetto competitivo del mercato\u00bb. \u00abIn una prospettiva pi\u00f9 strutturale, \u00e8 presumibile che l'emergenza determini profonde modificazioni dei mercati, con la fuoriuscita dell'imprese pi\u00f9 deboli finanziariamente e/o l'incremento del livello di concentrazione dei settori pi\u00f9 colpiti\u00bb, dice Stefano Grassani, responsabile del dipartimento antitrust di Gatti Pavesi Bianchi. \u00abQuesto potrebbe avere conseguenze sulle dinamiche concorrenziali di molti mercati. Nel breve periodo, la repentina crescita della domanda di alcune tipologie di beni potrebbe sollecitare comportamenti collusivi tra le imprese. Un esempio? I recenti dati Nielsen di marzo 2020 dimostrano un sensibile calo della quantit\u00e0 di prodotti in promozione rispetto al totale del venduto nei punti vendita della Gdol, in particolare nella quarta e nella quinta settimana dell'emergenza. Per Pietro Merlino, head del dipartimento italiano di Antitrust &amp; Competition di Orrick, \u00abil fermo di buona parte delle filiere produttive del nostro paese ha messo purtroppo seriamente a rischio la continuit\u00e0 aziendale di tutta una serie di imprese, in particolare di quelle medio-piccole. Ove questo rischio dovesse poi in parte materializzarsi determinando l'uscita dal mercato di alcune di queste realt\u00e0, vi sarebbe evidentemente un affievolimento delle pressioni concorrenziali nei mercati interessati dal fenomeno con corrispondente aumento del potere di mercato in capo alle aziende di maggiori dimensioni. L'attuale emergenza determina evidentemente un ulteriore rafforzamento delle grandi piattaforme digitali e, pi\u00f9 in generale, delle Big Tech, gi\u00e0 da tempo nel mirino delle autorit\u00e0 di concorrenza a livello globale e al centro di un intenso dibattito circa l'adeguatezza degli attuali strumenti di enforcement antitrust nell'ambito dei nuovi ecosistemi creati da questi operatori. Il lockdown infatti non incide sul loro giro di affari, ma semmai lo accresce, esaltandone al contempo i modelli di business. In ambito antitrust, l'emergenza sanitaria in corso sta gi\u00e0 avendo un impatto nel senso di ridefinire le priorit\u00e0 di enforcement dell'Agcm e della Commissione europea e di modificare l'approccio nei confronti di alcune fattispecie \u00abtipiche\u00bb del diritto della concorrenza. Nel medio periodo sar\u00e0 interessante vedere che atteggiamento avranno le autorit\u00e0 di concorrenza nei confronti di alcune condotte a rilevanza antitrust che le imprese potrebbero essere indotte ad adottare per far fronte alle gravi conseguenza economiche dell'emergenza. Penso ai c.d. cartelli di crisi, ovvero a quelli accordi con cui imprese concorrenti potrebbero tentare di controbilanciare lo squilibrio tra domanda e offerta determinato dall'emergenza coordinando capacit\u00e0 produttiva o prezzi. Nella valutazione di una fattispecie di questo tipo nel nuovo mondo post-Covid-19 le autorit\u00e0 di concorrenza potranno essere maggiormente disposte a prendere in considerazione i possibili effetti benefici di tali condotte in termini, ad es., di mantenimento dei livelli occupazionali ovvero di recupero di efficienza e produttivit\u00e0 del settore?\u00bb.\u00abMi pare necessario distinguere fra le disposizioni assunte con \u00abdecreti-leggi\u00bb (ad es. il CuraItalia) dalle \u00abordinanze del presidente del Consiglio\u00bb nonch\u00e9 dalle \u00abordinanze della Protezione civile\u00bb, commenta Andrea Stefanelli co fondatore di Stefanelli &amp; Stefanelli Studio legale. \u00abSono provvedimenti rivolti a platee diverse e aventi scopi differenti; le ordinanze del PdC e della P.C., infatti, mirano a risolvere problemi eccezionali e contingenti di salute pubblica (la cui tutela, quindi, risulta principio sovraordinato a qualsiasi altro), mentre i decreti legge sono interventi normativi \u00abdi sistema\u00bb e avendo, nel caso specifico, il Governo chiuso tutte le attivit\u00e0 produttive in ogni regione, nonch\u00e9 esteso la Cig in deroga a tutte le categorie, mi pare abbia salvaguardata in tutti i modi la concorrenza \u00abinterna\u00bb. Per quello che concerne invece quella con l'estero, la mancanza di un accordo - quantomeno a livello comunitario - su \u00abcosa chiudere\u00bb e \u00abquando riaprire\u00bb ritengo che, certamente, incider\u00e0 sul principio di concorrenza intracomunitario. In studio mi occupo d'appalti pubblici e il decreto \u00abCuraItalia\u00bb ha espressamente esteso - durante il periodo emergenziale - la possibilit\u00e0 d'affidare un'opera, una fornitura o un servizio pubblico tramite procedure \u00abnegoziate senza previa pubblicazione del bando\u00bb (per intenderci, la cd. 'trattativa privata'), ma conservando tuttavia l'obbligo, in capo alla Pa, d'invitare almeno 5 concorrenti (sminuendone la celerit\u00e0). L'Ue, con la sua comunicazione del 1/4/20, ha invece consigliato agli Stati membri, vista la situazione eccezionale, d'affidare \u00abin via diretta\u00bb: in altri termini la Ue \u00e8 risultata, ancora una volta, molto pi\u00f9 \u00abcoraggiosa\u00bb dell'Italia in questo settore\u00bb. Per Massimo Tavella, fondatore di Tavella Studio di Avvocati \u00abl'Agcm ha dato prova di notevole reattivit\u00e0 intervenendo su numerose pratiche commerciali scorrette finalizzare ad insidiare il consumatore in un momento in cui le difese fisiologiche sono messe a dura prova dalle paure e ansie generate dalla pandemia. Dalla promozione di medicinali anti-Covid al tentativo di lucrare sulle donazioni in favore dei presidi sanitari, non sono mancati anche gli avvocati - fortunatamente pochi - che hanno provato a cavalcare l'onda per accaparrarsi clientela per azioni di responsabilit\u00e0 medica. L'emergenza che stiamo vivendo \u00e8 un evento dirompente ed eccezionale, che dovr\u00e0 essere gestito con grandissima attenzione da chi erogher\u00e0 le tutele, in modo da non alterare - oltremisura - il corretto gioco concorrenziale\u00bb. \u00abNel settore farmaceutico gli effetti si sono certamente sentiti in quanto, al fine di fronteggiare l'emergenza sanitaria, si \u00e8 consentita l'attuazione di forme di cooperazione tra concorrenti in deroga alla disciplina vigente in tempi ordinari\u00bb, dice Francesca Sutti di WLex. \u00abL'Antitrust ha indirizzato i suoi sforzi in interventi tempestivi e puntuali a protezione del consumatore, scongiurando alcuni pericolosi abusi che venivano perpetrati. Segnalo la delibera del 21 aprile con cui l'Agcm ha invitato tutti i principali gestori di motori di ricerca a rimuovere e a non indicizzare alcuni siti che millantavano la vendita di farmaci contro il Covid-19\u00bb.\u00a9 Riproduzione riservata</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OGGI7-2638232</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OGGI72020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6005-G9K1-DYDY-936M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">277199</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2452\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ItaliaOggi Editori S.p.A.

Mayo;Mark Whitener</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After years of relative quiet, antitrust law and policy are back in the public eye. The Trump administration has targeted large technology-based firms for antitrust scrutiny. When she was running for president, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) proposed a plan to break up big tech companies and regulate them as utilities; other Democratic candidates echoed her sentiments, if not her specificity. Discussions of antitrust policy are clouded, however, by common myths about this century-old but widely misunderstood area of the law.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                        Myth No. 1          Monopolies are illegal.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 \"criminalized monopoly,\" writes the Open Markets Institute in a primer on \"monopoly basics.\" A Motley Fool article asserts the common misperception that \"pure monopolies are illegal.\" Yet the antitrust laws do not outlaw the possession of a monopoly.</p><p>That's because antitrust recognizes that the potential for economic rewards is what incentivizes investment and risk-taking. The resulting competition for marketplace supremacy can be fierce, and weaker firms often fail along the way. Those left standing should not be punished for their success - even if only one survives. As the Supreme Court said more than 50 years ago, monopolies should be targets of antitrust enforcement only when there is \"the willful acquisition or maintenance of [monopoly] power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident.\" Antitrust doesn't condemn a firm for developing a universally popular search engine, ketchup or pharmaceutical drug, even if that success leads to market dominance. It's how a monopoly is obtained or preserved that matters - not its mere existence.</p><p>          Myth No. 2          Antitrust protects smaller firms from their big rivals.          </p><p>Much rhetoric around antitrust law takes for granted that it's about protecting the small guys. \"Amazon crushes small companies by copying the goods they sell on the Amazon Marketplace and then selling its own branded version,\" according to Warren's antitrust plan. </p><p>Indeed, small competitors are often the most vocal advocates for using antitrust to restrain their large, powerful rivals - as when local taxi companies unsuccessfully tried to block Uber's entry into Philadelphia, even though Uber increased competition and lowered prices for consumers. </p><p>But the antitrust laws were enacted to protect <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">competition</emphasis>, not <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">competitors</emphasis>             . As the Supreme Court has said, their purpose \"is not to protect businesses from the working of the market; it is to protect the public from the failure of the market.\" Consumers are the main beneficiaries of competition, and antitrust is intended to protect them from business conduct that damages such competition. Knowing this, enforcers and courts tend to take competitors' complaints about their rivals' behavior with a grain of salt and focus on the impact on consumers. </p><p>          Myth No. 3          Antitrust laws are too old to be relevant to the tech economy.          </p><p>Axios recently remarked on the \"bipartisan consensus . . . that antitrust law is antiquated, written for an analog world of railroad and tobacco giants.\" In the same spirit, Rep. David N. Cicilline (D.-R.I.) has said the antitrust laws were mainly created \"during the railroad monopolies and in the time of the oil barons. It's a different economy now.\"</p><p>It's certainly true that many of the companies - and whole industries - drawing antitrust attention today didn't exist when the first antitrust law, the Sherman Act, was passed. Does this mean antitrust doctrine can't be effectively applied to 21st-century technologies and business models, including high-tech services (such as Internet search) that are nominally free?</p><p> In truth, the antitrust laws are no more \"outdated\" than the (much older) U.S. Constitution: Both employ an economy of language and establish broad principles that can be adapted to specific cases. In traditional industries like retail, antitrust analysis has long had to evolve to deal with shifting forms of competition, from local grocers to big-box stores to, now, online retailing. In the 1990s, there were concerns that the tech behemoth of the times (Microsoft) and its complex new products (browsers, operating systems) were beyond antitrust's comprehension. Yet the Justice Department prosecuted a successful case challenging Microsoft's unlawful actions to exclude competition and preserve its monopoly position. </p><p>Antitrust enforcers have a track record of challenging mergers and other practices involving new-economy issues, such as competition among digital platforms - as when the Federal Trade Commission sued to block the merger of fantasy-sports platforms DraftKings and FanDuel. Enforcers and courts will continue to grapple with precisely how to apply antitrust to new aspects of the tech economy, but they have shown that antitrust has the tools to remain relevant.</p><p>          Myth No. 4          Antitrust enforcers are asleep at the switch.          </p><p>A narrative has emerged that U.S. antitrust enforcers have gone soft. The Economist has called antitrust authorities \"unforgivably lax.\" A report from the Roosevelt Institute recently included \"lax competition policy\" among the factors that were \"entrenching the intrinsic advantages of wealth and power in society.\" This story line has been used to support calls for more aggressive enforcement and the passage of new, tougher antitrust legislation.</p><p>Whether the American economy has become less competitive over time is a complex issue that economists continue to study. But whether merger enforcement has become increasingly slack is a more easily answerable empirical question. A study one of us co-conducted, drawing on government enforcement data from 1979 through 2017, found that regulators have become more likely to challenge proposed mergers over time. Indeed, controlling for the number of merger proposals submitted to the agencies, the likelihood of a merger challenge has more than doubled over this period. </p><p>Advocates for more aggressive merger enforcement may point to particular mergers that they believe should have been challenged (such as Facebook's acquisition of Instagram), and the FTC recently announced that it is looking back at past tech deals to see if any problematic ones escaped notice. But the data does not support the idea that antitrust merger enforcement has declined.</p><p>          Myth No. 5          Antitrust enforcement can fix the tech-sector's problems.          </p><p>Some critics of Big Tech, including Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), say that issues such as privacy lapses on large tech platforms ought to attract the attention of antitrust enforcers: \"One of the reasons data privacy concerns are so pressing is because these companies are monopoly size,\" Hawley has said. Mississippi's attorney general has said that law enforcement officials' \"focus is going to be on antitrust and privacy. That's where our laws are.\" Many people have concerns about privacy, data security and the veracity of online content, among other issues. Don't such worries, along with the size and power of these firms, make antitrust an obvious solution? </p><p>The link between alleged anticompetitive behavior and other questionable actions by platforms is far from clear, however. Antitrust is narrowly tailored - as the Supreme Court has reaffirmed in decisions reflecting consensus across the court's ideological spectrum - to protect consumers from business conduct that harms the competitive process itself. The question courts will ask, therefore, is whether dubious behavior by companies results from diminished market rivalry - or rather, perhaps, from firms' independently following business models that tend to lead to controversial practices. They will probe whether lapses in privacy and data security stem from reduced competition, or whether they might exist even if there were three search behemoths, a couple of Facebook clones and several Amazon rivals. (Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) </p><p>Depending on how such questions are answered, antitrust may have a role to play. But other regulatory and legislative approaches may be more suitable. If you want to protect privacy, in other words, it may be more effective to regulate it directly than to stretch antitrust law.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mayoj@georgetown.edu\">mayoj@georgetown.edu</email></emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mw1115@georgetown.edu\">mw1115@georgetown.edu</email></emphasis></p><p>                 is the Elsa Carlson McDonough chair of business administration and a  professor of economics, business and public policy at Georgetown University. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mark Whitener</emphasis>, an adjunct professor and senior industry and innovation fellow at Georgetown's Center for Business and Public Policy, is a former enforcement official at the Federal Trade Commission.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-ead2a0726a1a11ea992357073adce27c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YGH-KK31-DYX1-H40Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1467\"/><timeReceived>11:09 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 22, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;
