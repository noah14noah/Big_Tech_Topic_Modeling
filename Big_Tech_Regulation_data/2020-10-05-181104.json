Corinne Weaver complained in a July 21 post[2]:Google users wouldn't know that conservative websites like NewsBusters, The Daily Wire, and Breitbart exist if they consulted an organic search result on the platform today.The company has seemingly blacklisted numerous conservative websites like NewsBusters, MRCTV, CNSNews, Free Beacon, Breitbart, The Resurgent, Twitchy, RedState, PJ Media, Judicial Watch, The Blaze, Townhall, Project Veritas, LifeNews, PragerU, and The Daily Wire. None of these websites show up in an organic search on Google. </p><p>While more than 3.5 billion Google searches are performed per day, certain conservative news sites appear prohibited from appearing in the general results.Mediaite reporter Charlie Nash noted that Google had 'removed several conservative websites from search results.' These sites included RedState, Breitbart, Daily Caller, and Human Events. Weaver is so dedicated to pushing the MRC's narrative that she censored the fact that Nash also noted[3] some left-leaning sites were also suffereing the same Google search issues. But since she's paid to push a narrative and not tell the full truth, Weaver rushed straight to conspiracy mode, huffing that \"It seems as if Google has a new blacklist from organic results.\" MRC chief Brent Bozell ranted on Twitter[4], \"We want official answers now! Congress needs to demand that Google tell why they temporarily blacklisted conservative sites. We know why it happened. And it's 100% unacceptable.\" Like his subordinate, Bozell too censored the fact that left-leaning sites were also \"blacklisted.\"For all this conspiracy-mongering, the actual cause appears to have been much more benign: a technical error[5]. But again, narrative trumps facts at the MRC; Alexander Hall dismissed[6] the cause as \"Lame!\": \"Talk about living down to expectations. Google gave a measly mea culpa after several conservative websites were delisted from its general search and appeared to have been blacklisted.\"Hall went on to mislead his readers by claiming that \"Liberal sites such as Newsweek, The Daily Beast, The Washington Post, HuffPost, and Teen Vogue, had no issue. Their websites showed up on Google organic search.\" As noted above, left-leaning sites were affected; Hall just cherry-picked ones that weren't. Hall also dug up another disgruntled ex-Google employee to push the conspiracy narrative:Google may have a 'secret blacklist' of conservative news outlets, former Google engineer Mike Wacker claimed.He suggested to Mediaite, 'It appears to have revealed the existence of another blacklist that disproportionately targets conservatives.'Wacker speculated: 'The glitch is that sites on this blacklist disappeared from Google search results, but the existence of the list is very much by design. And that raises a major question: Why was this blacklist created in the first place, and what else is it used for?'There's apparenly good reason why Wacker -- like James Damore, Kevin Cernekee and Zachary Vorhies[7] before him -- are former Google employees: it seems he was aggressively pushing his right-wing views at work. A statement from Google, as reported by Fox Business[8], stated that Wacker had been given multiple warnings 'related to a pattern of threatening communications to co-workers and managers' which eventually led to his dismissal.But, again, who needs facts when there's a narrative to push? A few days later, the MRC's \"Free Speech Alliance\" -- which cares only about \"free speech\" for right-wing ideologues -- sent a ranty letter[9] baselessly accusing Google of lying: \"This past Wednesday July 21, several conservative media platforms, including four of Media Research Center's (MRC) major sites, were removed from Google's search results. Google's official response was that this was the result of a technical glitch. We don't believe you. We believe Google is lying yet again. It's the same old game. ... You need to answer for this.\"Needless to say, the letter completely censored the fact that the glitch also blocked left-leaning sites. Bozell kept up the conspiracy-mongering and unproven accusations against Google in a July 28 column[10] published not at his own operation but, rather, at the right-wing Daily Caller: \"This past week, Google knocked more than a dozen prominent conservative sites off of its main search. The company claimed it had been a 'technical error,' not that anyone believes it. Former Google engineer Mike Wacker wondered if the company had a 'secret blacklist' of conservative sites.\" Again, no mention that left-leaning sites were also affected.Bozell's accusations because more grandiose in a July 29 statement[11], in which he asserted that \"Last week, the entire universe of conservative media vanished from Google's search results in the blink of an eye.\" But the original post by Weaver linked in the statement never claimed that \"the entire universe of conservative media vanished\" -- only randomly checked right-wing websites like those run by Bozell.Since the timing of this \"blacklisting\" coincided with a congressional hearing at which Google CEO Sundar Pichai would be present, the MRC made sure to exploit the situation with a \"demand\" for answers[12] about this, in the form of a question Republicans could ask him -- which ultimately argued that Google should be broken up:Mr. Pichai, Google inexplicably shut down the general search for at least 15 prominent conservative sites. Then those searches magically reappeared. How does something like that happen? Even if it's just a technical error, as Google claimed, why does any company have that incredible amount of power, and why should U.S. regulations facilitate it? Isn't your company simply too big, and doesn't it need to be broken up?(Note to Bozell: \"at least 15\" does not equal \"the entire universe.\") As you can see, the MRC has continued to embellish its \"blacklist\" narrative until it largely strayed from established facts. That's what happens when narratives are more important than facts.

But again, narrative trumps facts at the MRC; Alexander Hall dismissed[6] the cause as \"Lame!\": \"Talk about living down to expectations. Google gave a measly mea culpa after several conservative websites were delisted from its general search and appeared to have been blacklisted.\"Hall went on to mislead his readers by claiming that \"Liberal sites such as Newsweek, The Daily Beast, The Washington Post, HuffPost, and Teen Vogue, had no issue. Their websites showed up on Google organic search.\" As noted above, left-leaning sites were affected; Hall just cherry-picked ones that weren't. Hall also dug up another disgruntled ex-Google employee to push the conspiracy narrative:Google may have a 'secret blacklist' of conservative news outlets, former Google engineer Mike Wacker claimed.He suggested to Mediaite, 'It appears to have revealed the existence of another blacklist that disproportionately targets conservatives.'Wacker speculated: 'The glitch is that sites on this blacklist disappeared from Google search results, but the existence of the list is very much by design. And that raises a major question: Why was this blacklist created in the first place, and what else is it used for?'There's apparenly good reason why Wacker -- like James Damore, Kevin Cernekee and Zachary Vorhies[7] before him -- are former Google employees: it seems he was aggressively pushing his right-wing views at work. A statement from Google, as reported by Fox Business[8], stated that Wacker had been given multiple warnings 'related to a pattern of threatening communications to co-workers and managers' which eventually led to his dismissal.But, again, who needs facts when there's a narrative to push? A few days later, the MRC's \"Free Speech Alliance\" -- which cares only about \"free speech\" for right-wing ideologues -- sent a ranty letter[9] baselessly accusing Google of lying: \"This past Wednesday July 21, several conservative media platforms, including four of Media Research Center's (MRC) major sites, were removed from Google's search results. Google's official response was that this was the result of a technical glitch. We don't believe you. We believe Google is lying yet again. It's the same old game. ... You need to answer for this.\"Needless to say, the letter completely censored the fact that the glitch also blocked left-leaning sites. Bozell kept up the conspiracy-mongering and unproven accusations against Google in a July 28 column[10] published not at his own operation but, rather, at the right-wing Daily Caller: \"This past week, Google knocked more than a dozen prominent conservative sites off of its main search. The company claimed it had been a 'technical error,' not that anyone believes it. Former Google engineer Mike Wacker wondered if the company had a 'secret blacklist' of conservative sites.\" Again, no mention that left-leaning sites were also affected.Bozell's accusations because more grandiose in a July 29 statement[11], in which he asserted that \"Last week, the entire universe of conservative media vanished from Google's search results in the blink of an eye.\" But the original post by Weaver linked in the statement never claimed that \"the entire universe of conservative media vanished\" -- only randomly checked right-wing websites like those run by Bozell.Since the timing of this \"blacklisting\" coincided with a congressional hearing at which Google CEO Sundar Pichai would be present, the MRC made sure to exploit the situation with a \"demand\" for answers[12] about this, in the form of a question Republicans could ask him -- which ultimately argued that Google should be broken up:Mr. Pichai, Google inexplicably shut down the general search for at least 15 prominent conservative sites. Then those searches magically reappeared. How does something like that happen? Even if it's just a technical error, as Google claimed, why does any company have that incredible amount of power, and why should U.S. regulations facilitate it? Isn't your company simply too big, and doesn't it need to be broken up?(Note to Bozell: \"at least 15\" does not equal \"the entire universe.\") As you can see, the MRC has continued to embellish its \"blacklist\" narrative until it largely strayed from established facts. That's what happens when narratives are more important than facts.

Upgrading the Internet is a particularly smart kind of stimulus, one that would spread knowledge, promote entrepreneurship and make this country more competitive globally. </p><p>  The United States has long been the world leader in technology, but when it comes to the Internet, it is fast falling behind. America now ranks 15th in the world in access to high-speed Internet connections. A cornerstone of Mr. Obama's agenda is promoting universal, affordable high-speed Internet.</p><p>  Mr. Obama, who had notable success with online fund-raising and voter turnout, spoke during the presidential campaign about the transformative power of the Internet to improve Americans' quality of life. He argued that it could, among other things, reduce health care costs, create jobs and make it easier for citizens to participate in government decision-making.</p><p>  In a speech this month about his economic stimulus plan, he said that he intends to ensure that every child has a chance to get online and that he would use some of the stimulus money to connect libraries and schools. It is a critical goal. Children trapped on the wrong side of the digital divide are deprived of a fair chance to educate themselves and to compete for high-skill, high-paying jobs.</p><p>  Mr. Obama has also been a strong supporter of ''network neutrality,'' the principle that Internet service providers should not be able to discriminate against any of the information that they carry. Net neutrality laws are necessary to ensure that Internet service providers do not block content they disagree with or give financial breaks to big tech companies, squeezing out smaller competitors and stifling innovation.</p><p>  Mr. Obama will need to work with Congress -- and fight against corporate lobbyists -- to accomplish some of his goals.

S\u00e9bastien SORIANO fait quatre propositions pour redistribuer le pouvoir d'Internet et r\u00e9pondre aux \"effets de r\u00e9seau\" dont profitent les g\u00e9ants du num\u00e9rique <br/><br/>R\u00e9guler les g\u00e9ants du num\u00e9rique, non pour d\u00e9cider \u00e0 leur place mais pour \"rendre le pouvoir \u00e0 la multitude des innovateurs et des citoyens\". C'est le sens d'une note r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par M. S\u00e9bastien SORIANO appelant \u00e0 \"briser le monopole des Big Tech : r\u00e9guler pour lib\u00e9rer la multitude\". Publi\u00e9 cet automne par le Digital New Deal, ce document d'une cinquantaine de pages part du constat selon lequel \"il existe une concentration in\u00e9dite et persistante du pouvoir sur Internet autour d'une poign\u00e9e d'entreprises qui, \u00e0 partir d'une innovation pionni\u00e8re, ont construit des empires qui semblent s'\u00e9tendre sans fin\". Dans ce contexte, des \"effets de r\u00e9seau\" \"particuli\u00e8rement puissants\" sont \u00e0 l'oeuvre : ils \"alimentent une dynamique d'attraction et d'accumulation qui procure des avantages concurrentiels si importants que la m\u00e9canique m\u00eame de 'main invisible' et de 'destruction cr\u00e9atrice' du march\u00e9 est s\u00e9rieusement mise en danger\", pr\u00e9vient M. SORIANO, par ailleurs pr\u00e9sident de l'Autorit\u00e9 de r\u00e9gulation des communications \u00e9lectroniques et des postes (Arcep). </p><p><br/><br/>Fort de cet \u00e9tat des lieux, M. SORIANO formule \"quatre propositions en mati\u00e8re de redistribution du pouvoir d'Internet\". Ces pistes s'inspirent de r\u00e9gulations existantes dans les infrastructures, notamment \"les t\u00e9l\u00e9coms o\u00f9 la probl\u00e9matique des effets de r\u00e9seau est bien connue\", souligne-t-il. Et de pr\u00e9ciser que \"ce sont d'abord les grandes entreprises du num\u00e9rique, intentionnellement cibl\u00e9es et identifi\u00e9es par un statut particulier, que l'on entend soumettre \u00e0 un r\u00e9gime d'obligations pr\u00e9ventives, sur-mesure et \u00e9volutives\". <br/><br/>D\u00e9finir des r\u00e8gles de concurrence plus strictes pour les \"plates-formes structurantes\" <br/><br/>En premier lieu, le rapport sugg\u00e8re \"des r\u00e8gles de concurrence plus strictes pour les Big Tech\". A l'instar de ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 sur le march\u00e9 des t\u00e9l\u00e9com, \"nous pourrions d\u00e9velopper une approche pr\u00e9ventive s'appliquant aux acteurs les plus dominants\", d\u00e9veloppe M. SORIANO. La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape consisterait \u00e0 \"identifier les acteurs qui doivent \u00eatre r\u00e8glement\u00e9s\" ce qui implique de d\u00e9finir \"un concept juridique qui englobe ce qui caract\u00e9rise les Big Tech : le pouvoir de march\u00e9 et l'impact \u00e9conomique\". Aussi, M. SORIANO propose de retenir la notion de \"plates-formes structurantes\", qu'il convient d'entendre comme d\u00e9signant celles \"jouant un r\u00f4le de p\u00e9age vis-\u00e0-vis des startups et des PME cherchant \u00e0 innover et \u00e0 \u00e9largir leur march\u00e9, \u00e0 la source d'effets de r\u00e9seau forts ou b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant de tout autre facteur susceptible de verrouiller le march\u00e9\".  <br/><br/>La deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape consisterait \u00e0 \"d\u00e9finir l'ensemble des obligations qui s'appliqueraient \u00e0 cette cat\u00e9gorie d'acteurs puissants, \u00e0 partir des 'd\u00e9faillances du march\u00e9' d\u00fbment identifi\u00e9es\", ajoute M. SORIANO. A ses yeux, pourraient \u00eatre \"facilement\" appliqu\u00e9es \"les obligations d'acc\u00e8s, de transparence, de traitement non-discriminatoire et de s\u00e9paration des activit\u00e9s\".  <br/><br/>Par ailleurs, l'auteur de la note reprend, en substance, la proposition formul\u00e9e par l'\u00e9conomiste Jean TIROLE d'inverser la charge de la preuve dans les hypoth\u00e8ses de \"killer acquisitions\", comme par exemple la fusion entre Facebook et WhatsApp. \"Il appartiendrait donc aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s participant \u00e0 la fusion de prouver qu'elles ne nuiraient pas \u00e0 la concurrence ou \u00e0 l'innovation\", explique M. SORIANO, pr\u00e9cisant qu'une telle charge de la preuve s'appliquerait aux \"plates-formes structurantes\" d\u00e8s lors qu'elles acqui\u00e8rent une start-up. <br/><br/>Enfin, le pr\u00e9sident de l'Arcep rappelle que les r\u00e8gles europ\u00e9ennes en mati\u00e8re de t\u00e9l\u00e9coms ou de r\u00e8glementation financi\u00e8re notamment peuvent \"donner des id\u00e9es pour d\u00e9velopper des outils compl\u00e9mentaires au droit de la concurrence existant\". En outre, il pointe la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de \"d\u00e9finir un r\u00e9gime de supervision des acteurs dans des situations le justifiant\" inspir\u00e9 par celui \u00e0 l'oeuvre dans le secteur financier.  <br/><br/>Etendre aux terminaux le concept de neutralit\u00e9 du Net <br/><br/>Deuxi\u00e8me proposition formul\u00e9e par le rapport : prolonger le concept de neutralit\u00e9 du Net aux terminaux. \"Concr\u00e8tement, cela signifierait que les utilisateurs devraient toujours avoir le choix des services et des applications disponibles sur leur terminal\", d\u00e9crypte M. SORIANO. Alors qu'une proposition de loi en ce sens vient d'\u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au S\u00e9nat, le pr\u00e9sident de l'Arcep pr\u00e9cise : \"bien s\u00fbr, des options pourraient \u00eatre install\u00e9es par d\u00e9faut, mais avec un droit int\u00e9gr\u00e9 de ne pas activer cette option. Et il pourrait encore y avoir des exceptions, par exemple des r\u00e8gles pour garantir la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone ou le bon fonctionnement de l'appareil, mais cela devrait se faire de mani\u00e8re transparente, non-discriminatoire et proportionn\u00e9e\", ajoute-t-il. <br/><br/>En troisi\u00e8me lieu, M. SORIANO propose que les donn\u00e9es soient appr\u00e9hend\u00e9es \"en tant que bien commun\". Le partage des donn\u00e9es \"peut contribuer \u00e0 mieux servir l'int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\", explique-t-il \u00e0 l'appui de sa suggestion \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer, en substance, que les donn\u00e9es recueillies par les Big Tech, provenant de la foule, ne devraient pas \u00eatre gard\u00e9es enferm\u00e9es dans un silo \"pour l'usage exclusif des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s concern\u00e9es\" mais \"appartenir au plus grand nombre\". A son sens, les m\u00e9canismes de partage des donn\u00e9es, autres que personnelles et rendues anonymes pr\u00e9cise-t-il, pourraient \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s \u00e0 des fins concurrentielles. D'apr\u00e8s des travaux d'\u00e9conomistes auxquels il se r\u00e9f\u00e8re, un tel partage \"nous permettrait de retrouver notre capacit\u00e9 d'innovation\" dans la mesure o\u00f9 \"le partage des donn\u00e9es (volontaire ou non) \u00e9limine le m\u00e9canisme faisant basculer les march\u00e9s ax\u00e9s sur les donn\u00e9es\". <br/><br/>Dans le cadre de cette note, Mme Judith ROCHFELD, professeure de droit priv\u00e9 \u00e0 l'Ecole de droit de la Sorbonne (universit\u00e9 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne, Paris-1) se penche sur diff\u00e9rentes hypoth\u00e8ses relatives au partage de donn\u00e9es. Elle consid\u00e8re notamment deux mod\u00e8les distincts : l'un tendant \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer les donn\u00e9es comme des infrastructures essentielles, l'autre relatif \u00e0 l'institution d'un serveur neutre g\u00e9r\u00e9 par un tiers ind\u00e9pendant. <br/><br/>Reconna\u00eetre un droit \u00e0 l'interconnexion <br/><br/>Enfin, toujours dans le souci de \"redistribuer le pouvoir des quelques plates-formes dominantes\", le pr\u00e9sident de l'Arcep sugg\u00e8re dans sa note \"une r\u00e9gulation par les API\" (interfaces de programmation d'application). \"Aujourd'hui, ce sont les Big Tech elles-m\u00eames qui d\u00e9cident si d'autres d\u00e9veloppeurs peuvent se connecter pour contribuer ou collecter des donn\u00e9es depuis leurs plates-formes\", rel\u00e8ve M. SORIANO, \"elles jouissent d'une libert\u00e9 totale sur le d\u00e9veloppement de leurs API et donc sur le droit des autres plates-formes et services de s'interconnecter avec elles\". Concr\u00e8tement, d\u00e8s lors que des services d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s par ces Big Tech apportent des changements radicaux \u00e0 leurs API, ceux-ci ont \"un impact majeur sur des \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes entiers qui d\u00e9pendent d'eux\", assure-t-il. Il propose donc de reconna\u00eetre un droit aux startups \u00e0 s'interconnecter avec les Big Tech. \"Ce droit ne sait \u00e9videmment pas absolu, mais agirait notamment pour la protection des utilisateurs eux-m\u00eames\", pr\u00e9cise-t-il. <br/><br/>Une r\u00e8glementation sur les API permettrait d'exiger des plates-formes qu'elles ouvrent leurs interfaces \"\u00e0 d'autres services comparables afin de les rendre interop\u00e9rables ou, du moins, de faciliter la capacit\u00e9 des utilisateurs \u00e0 utiliser un h\u00e9bergement multiple\", poursuit M. SORIANO. Autrement dit, une personne utilisant un service pourrait communiquer avec des personnes utilisant un service diff\u00e9rent. \"L'interop\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 est le meilleur moyen de faire face aux effets de r\u00e9seau\", insiste l'auteur de la note, \"elle emp\u00eache la concentration du pouvoir entre les mains d'un seul acteur, en le distribuant entre concurrents et utilisateurs\". Il n'en reste pas moins qu'une telle r\u00e8glementation ne devrait pas \u00eatre synonyme d'entrave \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 d'innovation d'un service en particulier. En ce sens, poursuit-il, \"nous pourrions ainsi penser cela en termes de strates : nous aurions partag\u00e9 des blocs de construction de communication interop\u00e9rables et communs, et chaque plate-forme offrirait aux utilisateurs son propre ensemble d'avantages\". <br/><br/>\"L'interop\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 pourrait \u00e9galement donner aux utilisateurs un r\u00e9el contr\u00f4le sur leurs donn\u00e9es\", ajoute M. SORIANO. Le droit pour tout Europ\u00e9en d'obtenir une copie de ses donn\u00e9es personnelles aupr\u00e8s de toute entreprise num\u00e9rique (en vertu du RGDP) pourrait se combiner \u00e0 l'interop\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 et ce qui permettrait aux internautes de transf\u00e9rer leurs donn\u00e9es directement d'un service \u00e0 l'autre ou d'exploiter diff\u00e9rents services en utilisant des donn\u00e9es auto-h\u00e9berg\u00e9es. <br/>Dans cette perspective, les internautes seraient les gardiens de leurs donn\u00e9es et les gestionnaires de leurs choix, \"alors que les plates-formes devraient (leur) permettre de (se) connecter avec elles\", avance M. SORIANO. Il voit l\u00e0 \"un nouveau souffle\" donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'innovation \"puisque les nouvelles plates-formes ne seraient pas entrav\u00e9es par le comportement des plates-formes existantes\". De plus, il appartiendrait d\u00e9sormais aux plates-formes de rechercher le contenu que les internautes acceptent d'y publier. \"Cette inversion de perspective est importante\" aux yeux du responsable de l'Arcep : \"elles viendraient \u00e0 nous, nous n'irions pas \u00e0 elles\". Soulignant l\u00e0 un \"renversement total de la relation de souverainet\u00e9\", il juge que \"c'est exactement ce que nous avons besoin \u00e0 tous les niveaux : redistribuer le pouvoir au profit des personnes\". </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGPQP-QP20191108a001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGPQP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFY-7YX1-JB4M-421K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402541</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1590\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Presse (SGP) Tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>La Correspondance de la Presse</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"05054\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>vendredi 8 novembre 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Lettre d'information</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>FRENCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>FRAN\u00c7AIS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>R\u00c9GULATION DES TERMINAUX</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000989C</classCode><className>L\u00c9GISLATION SUR LES FUSIONS, LES ACQUISITIONS &amp; LES COENTREPRISES</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTRCNUQ1QjEyQjEyNDcyN0E2NjIxOUJGQUQ1MTYxNzI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkE4OEIzNzhFMEUxNEMwRkFENkZBNzlCRDcyNUEyRkI</classCode><className>Antitrust Statutes</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001581</classCode><className>PETITE &amp; MOYENNE ENTREPRISE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N926130QC</classCode><className>R\u00c9GLEMENTATION DES T\u00c9L\u00c9COMMUNICATIONS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI</classCode><className>Communications</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000261</classCode><className>CARTEL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001681</classCode><className>DROIT FISCAL</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI</classCode><className>Tax</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>N336412MM</classCode><className>CONSTRUCTION DE MOTEURS D'A\u00c9RONEFS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009G3S</classCode><className>R\u00c9GLEMENTATION &amp; POLITIQUE DES COMMUNICATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001693</classCode><className>T\u00c9L\u00c9COMMUNICATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N926130QC</classCode><className>R\u00c9GLEMENTATION DES T\u00c9L\u00c9COMMUNICATIONS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI</classCode><className>Communications</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N517000CC</classCode><className>SERVICE DE T\u00c9L\u00c9COMMUNICATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

We`re going to be talking music, COVID, Trump and a whole lot more, excited to have him, that`s tomorrow. Keep it right here right now on MSNBC.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">STEVE KORNACKI, MSNBC HOST: Good evening. I`m Steve Kornacki in New York.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It has been six weeks since the president announced federal guidelines on social distancing to stop the spread of the coronavirus. And tonight, those guidelines are going to expire. It is now up entirely to each state to decide how to go forward, what to open, when to open it, how to open it, or whether to keep things closed.</p><p>And those states are fully open right now, but some have been moving faster than others in that direction. According to The New York Times, ten states are in the process of partially reopening, 15 plan to follow suit within the week and 25 continue to have restrictions in place along with the District of Columbia.</p><p>Clearly eager to reopen, the president painted a rosy picture in a radio interview today saying the country can, quote, play this games anymore.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We`re having a lot of states open up but a lot of the governors are feeling like you and I, and they want to get it going, and maybe they`ll have to put out some hotspots, some embers or whatever it may be, and we`re getting good at that. We`re getting very good at that. But we have to get it going, Moon. We just can`t play this games anymore.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KORNACKI: At the same time, as NBC News reports, no state that is opted to reopen has come close to the federally recommended declines in cases over a 14-day period.</p><p>Today, Dr. Anthony Fauci warned that the virus could rebound in states that ignore that criteria and reopen too quickly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: The guidelines are very, very explicit and very clear.</p><p>But you have to have the core principles of the guidelines. You can`t just leap other things and get into a situation where you really tempting a rebound. That`s the thing I get concerned about. I hope they don`t do that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KORNACKI: The sight last week end off crowding at the reopen the beaches in Orange County, California has already prompted that state`s governor, Gavin Newsom, to pull back. Today, he ordered the closure of the county`s beaches.</p><p>Likewise, according to The Atlantic, Georgia, is requiring protecting gear for businesses reopening in that state, forcing companies to complete with medical workers to obtain it at their own expense.</p><p>Meanwhile, nearly 4 million additional Americans filed for unemployment, in the past week, bringing the total number of jobless claims to over 30 million, that in just six weeks. According to NBC News, that means that around 18 percent of the workforce is currently unemployed.</p><p>Joining me now, Democratic Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota, and Jill Colvin, Associated Press White House Correspondent. Thanks to both of you for being with us.</p><p>Senator, let me start with you. The onus is now on the states. The federal social distancing guidelines are going away tonight. The state that you represent is one of those states that has begun taking steps to reopening.</p><p>I want to put some statistics up on the screen here. On the current state of the coronavirus in Minnesota, you can see here, the overall numbers are low there are 4,600 cases, 319 deaths. But I know what we were just talking about. Anthony Fauci saying he wants to see a decline in the increase of cases before states reopening. In Minnesota, that`s not the case. The case number a week ago was 2,700. Right now, it`s 4,600.</p><p>With your state taking steps to reopen, are you doing it too soon?</p><p>SEN. TINA SMITH (D-MN): Well, I think what our governor is doing is taking cautious steps. He is consulting with the public health experts and with the doctors and following the best practices. And, you know, what we`re doing here is working. We are slowing the growth of the virus.</p><p>Now, we`ve had a hot spot down in Nobles County where we have a meat packing plant. What`s going on in these meat packing plants is just a terrible thing. But we have to take it at step -- just to take it a step at a time.</p><p>And as you`re saying, the virus is going to do what virus does. And we have to use the tools that we have, social distancing, testing, quarantine where it`s necessary, in order to slow the progress of this virus.</p><p>KORNACKI: What you`re saying is interesting though, because you seem to be on board with the approach that your state is taking, your governor is taking. And we can just tell folks that was industrial, in office jobs, they were allowed. I think there are about 80,000 of those, they were allowed to go back a week ago, recreational areas are open, schools are closed. I believe the new guidance on retail is retail will be allowed to reopen curbside. So that`s the basic picture.</p><p>But, again, the federal guidelines that Anthony Fauci has been talking about, had been saying states shouldn`t be doing any of this until they get a two-week decline in case load. But it seems like you`re saying, hey, in Minnesota, it can work without that.</p><p>SMITH: Well, I think the most important thing is that you maintain the social distancing guidelines that have been laid out. And I think that that`s exactly what the governor is doing.</p><p>And what we really have here is a complete contrast in leadership styles. Our governor is transparent. He is consulting with everybody. He is laying out how he is making decisions and he`s providing compassionate and clear leadership. Compare to what the president is doing, which is just making stuff up, he`s veering from one thing to the other. He seems to be continuing to fight this P.R. war that he thinks he`s trying to win. We actually have a public health crisis that we`re trying to resolve here.</p><p>KORNACKI: How are you looking at this Minnesota beginning to take these steps and, again, this expansion to retail and curbside, that`s a further step in that direction. The case numbers are increasing and the opening is proceeding. What are you looking at, data-wise? What do you need see, data- wise, in the next couple of weeks to know if this is working or not?</p><p>SMITH: Well, one of the things that we need to take a close look at it what we`re doing here in Minnesota with testing. The governor in partnership with the University of Minnesota and Mayo Clinic, has said that he wants to get 20,000 tests a day here in Minnesota, which would bet per capita. Our state is about 5.5 million people, one of the highest in the country.</p><p>This is also the direction that Mayor Garcetti is taking in Los Angeles, which just to dramatically expand testing. You know, I have forth a legislation that was passed in the second coronavirus package, which would make testing free for everybody.</p><p>We still have those such a shortcoming in the federal government`s response on testing. So when I hear the president say that we`re doing great and everything is wonderful when we are still not where we need to be on the federal efforts for testing. We`ve got a long way to go.</p><p>KORNACKI: We also have with us here, and let me bring in Dr. Vin Gupta, Pulmonologist and Global Health Policy Expert. Doctor, thank you for joining us as well.</p><p>I don`t know if you`re able to hear the conversation we`re having with Senator Smith, but I want to get your perspective on this question too as a public health expert. With the the onus on states now to decide whether they want to begin some process of reopening, whether they want to stay closed, you have these federal guidelines that have been out there for a few weeks that Anthony Fauci has been talking about, where he wants a two- week decline in the increase in new cases as a prerequisite for states to begin opening.</p><p>But what`s happening in Minnesota, and, frankly, every other state that`s taking steps to reopening right now, is they`re taking steps without that decline. Can you see that as being tenable?</p><p>DR. VIN GUPTA, MSNBC MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Of course not, Steve. And I want to just thank the senator for all of her service and leadership on this issue. But how do we even know that infections are on the decline when we`re only measuring maybe 2 percent of the the population at best? So we have such a high degree of blind spots here. It`s untenable to really understand how can any state meet this mark of a decline in cases over the prior 14 days if we`re not the mass testing?</p><p>I`m not going to say they`re going to focus more and more on the mass testing. The senators have already done that. I feel like everybody has says aid testing, testing, testing, contract tracing, how do we get there? And there isn`t even enough discussion, just how do we simply get there? I love what Mayor Garcetti said in L.A.</p><p>But there are tools at our disposals right now that can potentially get us there with federal leadership, like saliva testing at home. We think saliva testing, bases on studies at the Yale and Rutgers, is better than nasopharyngeal test in where you stick a swab up your nose.</p><p>And we can potentially even scale that at home. There are paradigms for that here in Seattle. At-home saliva collection is where we should be headed and we need federal government to support in both regulatory to get that approved to the FDA, number one, but then, number two, of course subsidies, to make sure that samples can be transited from the home to clearly certified labs, that`s done. We need that support.</p><p>But to say that it`s up to the states, some states has more resources than others to implement this type of infrastructure, this type of mass scaling, so that we can have informed decisions. Right now, it`s the blind leading the blind. We have no idea what`s happening in Georgia from a case detection rate. But the governor has decided to open it all up. We all think that`s irresponsible. I think, in Minnesota, you have responsible leadership. And you`re seeing an effort to mass scale, but they have limitations too.</p><p>So we should be focused on the evidence. We should have public health experts be able to talk about this issues, wrestle with them, as opposed to try to defend the indefensible, like this infection talk and all the other nonsense that`s been thrown around at pressers.</p><p>KORNACKI: I want to get some to make sure I`m clear on this because, again, I want to get your perspective on. There`re a range of actions being taken. You alluded to there is a difference between what`s happening in Georgia and Minnesota. You called Minnesota responsible. I just want to make sure. Because the question I`m asking here is, Minnesota is doing something that`s to a lesser degree than Georgia but they are both engaged in opening up their economies in some way right now. And neither of them, and this is true, again, for every state, none of the states have had this 14-day decline.</p><p>Are you -- when you say responsible, is it okay, in your view, for Minnesota to be doing this and for other states to be doing this?</p><p>GUPTA: There is what`s aspirational and aspiration here is that we have mass testing and contract tracing up front. The reality is no state has that. No state is meeting that mark right now.</p><p>Do I want us to have a clear handle on what`s happening in terms of case infection rates with some confidence to these models that we`re wearing on top can be even better informed? Of course, Steve, I want that. I`m sure the senator wants that. But the American people want a safe reopening in phases. And instead of saying, no, we can`t do that, the question needs to be, how can we do it more safely?</p><p>So, to your point here, do I think Minnesota is wronged in trying to open things up safely, no, I don`t think they`re wrong. I think they`re being thoughtful about this in ways that Georgia is not being thoughtful about this. There is a safe way to reopen. There is a safe path, that means, everybody wears mask, that means social distancing is the norm for the foreseeable future.</p><p>So we need to think about infection control is top of mind, that has not been the message from the very top of the leadership. We have a president and a vice president that in feeble the policies on wearing masks. As a pulmonologist, it`s offensive. It`s offensive to all my colleagues in public health. I was in the ICU last night, we all have to wear masks, the second we walk into a clinic or into the ICU unit. You know, Vice President Pence choosing to be the only person in a photo op in Mayo Clinic not wearing a mask, it`s inappropriate.</p><p>So I think if we sit there and say contract tracing, as informed maybe by big tech, using those apps, if we`re wearing masks in public, that`s helpful, social distancing at restaurants, that`s a safe path to an incremental approach to opening up, and I know the senator feels the same way.</p><p>KORNACKI: Senator, let me ask you from a different angle on this. And I was taking a look at some of the debate in your state. And I saw there were some comments from a small business owner, a woman who owns a dance studio, a dance education studio, I think, for young people. And she said, look, under the guidelines in Minnesota right now, I can`t do anything with curbside. Obviously, I`m not that kind of business here. But I`ve got a plan where I can have social distancing, I can have masks, I can keep people -- but I am barred from the state from opening right now, or for the foreseeable future, under what the governor is saying today, and I am going out of business if I can`t open. What do you say to somebody in a position like that?</p><p>SMITH: Well, I would say is that it is terrible what`s happening to small businesses around Minnesota and around this country. This are the dreams, the life bloods of communities and the dreams of people who have been building them for years.</p><p>And I think we also know, we know in Minnesota, the doctor knows, that the path to reopening our economy, getting the businesses open, is through a strong public health response. People aren`t going to be feel safe going to a restaurant or going to any kind of a retail establishment unless they know that they`re going to be safe there, and that there are plans to keep them safe.</p><p>Now, one of the things that`s happening here in Minnesota, is that we`re learning a lot from businesses that have been deemed essential businesses that have continued to operate and have learned how to do it safely with -- as we`re talking about with masks, with marks out on the floor, is where they`re working, where they can make sure that they keep the appropriate social distance. Those are the tools that we have right now.</p><p>But the path to this, is always going to be through a sound public health approach rather than through just acting as if there`s a choice between reopening the economy or putting health first. I mean, that`s not the choice that we face here.</p><p>KORNACKI: I mentioned at the start of segment, I think, that Jill Colvin was with us. We had some technical difficulties. I think she is now with us. There we go, Jill Colvin, thank you for your patience and apologies for the technical issues. We do have you on.</p><p>I wanted to ask you the discussion we`ve been having here is about the states now, it is on the states decide the course they are going to chart here. The president today had a governor from a state that`s been very hard hit with this, Phil Murphy of New Jersey, to the White House to speak with him. What came from that meeting? Was there an understanding between them? What emerged from there?</p><p>JILL COLVIN, ASSOCIATED PRESS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Murphy was very careful when he walked in that meeting. He was very complimentary to the president. The president was very complimentary to him. The president has made a show really bringing in Democratic governors and his campaign has been highlighting efforts by the president to work with the two -- to work together.</p><p>And Murphy was really in there though with an ask. He said that his state is desperately in need of federal funding. That state aid that Congress has been discussing, he says the need between $20 million and $30 million to continue paying for frontline workers to be there and Murphy was really looking for a commitment from the president on that, while also discussing the complicated process of opening up and testing. It doesn`t sound like they came to any commitment from that, but at least Murphy was able to kind of make his case directly to the president today.</p><p>KORNACKI: All right. Jill Colvin from the Associated Press, thank you for the cameo appearance in the end. I appreciate that. Sorry again for the technical difficulties there. Senator Tina Smith and Dr. Vin Gupta, thank you all for being with us. I appreciate that.</p><p>And coming up, searching for signs of hope, how optimistic should be -- should we be about remdesivir? Get use to hearing that name, at least for now. Are we anywhere near to break through also when it comes to a vaccine? Stay with us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: As a pharmacist, the world looks to medicine to treat and cure illnesses.</p><p>These physicians and care providers that normally respect and look for us for our answers and now we have them to look to us now and we`re in the same boat as everyone in the world. We don`t have the answers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KORNACKI: Welcome back.</p><p>Yesterday, Dr. Anthony Fauci announce in potentially very good news about the treatment of coronavirus. During an Oval Office meeting, Fauci, the Head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told reporters that a recent study that has been sponsored by his institute has provided some evidence in experimental antiviral drug called remdesivir could shorten the duration of the virus from 15 days to 11 days.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FAUCI: The data shows that remdesivir has a clear cut, significant positive effect in diminishing the time to recover. It is very important proof of concept. Because what it has proven is that a drug can block this virus.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KORNACKI: And while this is good news, we should note, it`s not a cure. Instead, it represents the first time that any medication has shown the promise of helping patients recover faster from the coronavirus, which, of course, so far, has killed nearly 200,000 people around the world.</p><p>For more, I`m joined by Dr. Kavita Patel, physician fellow at the Brookings Institution, and Lloyd Minor, the dean of Stanford Medical School. And Stanford Medicine is participating in two clinical trials of this drug, of remdesivir.</p><p>So, Dr. Minor, let me just start with you.</p><p>I`m a complete layman here. I`m looking for optimistic news wherever I can find it. This caught my attention.</p><p>I see shortens the duration from 15 days to 11 days as the effect of this drug. In terms of curing people, what does that mean?</p><p>DR. LLOYD MINOR, DEAN, STANFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: Well, Steve, thank you. It`s good to be with you.</p><p>I think the results of both trials are encouraging and do provide reason for optimism. The trial that Dr. Fauci spoke about in the remarks that you showed just a moment ago is a blinded trial -- that is, it`s a placebo controlled trial -- in patients with moderate disease.</p><p>And as Dr. Fauci reported, it did shorten the duration of the disease.</p><p>Also, from that trial, there was an indication that there could perhaps be a reduction in mortality in people treated with remdesivir, rather than placebo. But that difference did not reach statistical significance.</p><p>In addition to that trial, also yesterday the results of an open label trial in patients with more severe disease, a trial organized here at Stanford and led by Dr. Aruna Subramanian, who is a faculty member here, the results of that open label trial was also reported and showed encouraging evidence as well that a five-day course of remdesivir was as effective as a 10-day course in meeting a number of treatment milestones.</p><p>Both trials, taken together, do provide reason for optimism that remdesivir can stop or attenuate the replication and growth of the virus and then lead to improved clinical outcomes.</p><p>But neither is a silver -- neither trial indicates that remdesivir is a silver bullet. There`s still a lot of work to be done. But it`s important to have evidence that we do have a drug that`s effective in treating this - - this condition.</p><p>KORNACKI: So, Dr. Patel, the implications of this are -- I think one thing that I have been thinking about and certainly hearing all the experts talk about is this idea that we may get through the summer OK, but, in the fall, there could be a really big second punch from this thing.</p><p>And there`s the idea that potentially we have a window here to find remdesivir. Maybe this is promising. Maybe there are other promising drugs that can be developed in this time that might change the way the fall looks? Is that a fair way of looking at it?</p><p>DR. KAVITA PATEL, MSNBC MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely.</p><p>I mean, we`re definitely in a race against time. And remdesivir is the first of dozens of treatments that are in some phase of clinical study.</p><p>But, as you point out, those studies -- there will be early readouts from some of the studies which are very promising, antibodies, convalescent serum, things like that. But we will also be fighting time, because some of those trials also will not give us results until much later in the year or next year.</p><p>But this was a promising signal. It reminds me and probably Dr. Minor of early HIV research, where AZT had a similar kind of promising first drug effect. And then, after a series of trials with other drugs, we learned over years that that was probably a modest effect.</p><p>And you`re seeing a little bit of the same thing play out with antiviral treatments for coronavirus.</p><p>KORNACKI: Yes, Dr. Minor, just on that, the comparison to HIV, I think some people think back, they say, wow, that took a long time, though. That took years in between there.</p><p>But it seems like -- again, as a layman Here, it seems like, from my perspective, every smart mind in medicine in the world must be thinking about this right now. Is that -- is that a fair assessment? And what does that do to the potential to get breakthroughs?</p><p>MINOR: Yes, I think that every smart mind in medicine.</p><p>Also, you have the focus of the big pharmaceutical companies, smaller biotechs. A lot of intellectual capital and monetary capital is being devoted to discovering and developing more effective prevention and treatment for this disease.</p><p>I do think Dr. Patel is entirely correct. I think the analogy to the early days of HIV is appropriate. I hope that it won`t take as long. First of all, we know a lot more about antivirals today than we did turning the clock back 30-plus years ago to the early days of HIV.</p><p>But I think the analogy to the AZT is a good one, in that room remdesivir is showing an effect, a beneficial effect. But it was only with multidrug regimens that we were able to really have the type of benefit for the treatment of HIV and, ultimately, the antiviral protection from infection with HIV that we have today.</p><p>That took multiple drugs and multiple trials to get -- get to that place. And I think -- I hope in a more accelerated pace, but I think we will need multiple trials, particularly focusing in the outpatient arena, because what we want to do is to move into a phase where, with expanded testing, we`re going to be diagnosing infections with SARS-CoV-2 much earlier.</p><p>And we want to be able to offer treatments in the outpatient setting that will prevent patients from getting so ill that they require hospitalization.</p><p>I think, moving forward, there will be a lot of focus on testing, developing, implement getting those outpatient therapies.</p><p>KORNACKI: So we`re talking about this now from the standpoint of drugs for treatments of folks who have the coronavirus.</p><p>There`s also this question of vaccines. On that front, Pfizer has announced that it will begin testing an experimental vaccine in the United States as early as next week. Oxford University will also pair up with British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to develop and manufacture a potential vaccine for the coronavirus, if their tests are successful.</p><p>Dr. Patel, obviously, that`s the 20 trillion, 20-gazillion-dollar-word there: if.</p><p>Talk me through this, because I hear two different things here. I hear just about all the experts out there saying, look, if you get a vaccine in 18 months, if you get it within two years, that is already light years faster than anything we have done in the past, and that would be an incredibly wonderful, optimistic scenario.</p><p>I also hear from one of the scientists who`s working on this out at Oxford saying, we think this is it. We think we`re going to have this by September.</p><p>How do you -- how do you square those two? Is there cause for the kind of optimism that would -- that would have this even faster than 18 months?</p><p>PATEL: Well, there`s cause in a similar analogy to the development of some of the treatments. There`s actually been kind of existing work against like SARS-CoV-1, and even analogies of the Ebola vaccine.</p><p>These are all kind of lessons that researchers are building upon. So I do think it`s incredibly optimistic to say, in September, we will have some sort of global vaccine.</p><p>But, Steve, I`m just going to make a point here. This is exactly and precisely the moment that we actually need a completely coordinated effort to actually -- different researchers, different development, and have kind of our moonshot strategy.</p><p>And that requires national leadership, quite frankly, international leadership, and it`s not going to benefit us to have different companies, no matter how large they are, doing different things, because, at some point, once we do have a vaccine, everyone`s going to want it.</p><p>And we`re going to have the same supply chain issues that we see right now with tests and masks. So, this should be something that we are spending a lot more attention, coordinated attention on. But it is going to take time.</p><p>KORNACKI: Yes.</p><p>Dr. Minor, I`m curious, what are you seeing on that front? You`re involved with one of these trials. In terms of cooperation, in terms of coordination, how does it look on that front?</p><p>MINOR: I think we`re seeing unparalleled cooperation and coordination among pharmaceutical companies, also between academics and pharmaceutical companies, the National Institutes of Health.</p><p>I agree completely with Dr. Patel. It`s going to take a coordinated, collaborative approach to defeat this virus. And it`s going to take multiple shots on goal to work towards vaccine development, also work on more effective antivirals.</p><p>There isn`t going to be a single approach that gets us to where we need to be. It`s going to be multiple approaches, but multiple approaches that are coordinated, and that also leverage the talents of different institutions, different governmental agencies and different industries.</p><p>KORNACKI: All right, Dr. Lloyd Minor, Dr. Kavita Patel, thank you both for being with us.</p><p>MINOR: Thank you.</p><p>KORNACKI: And, Dr. Minor, good luck to you on this -- on this research. Really appreciate the update on that.</p><p>Coming up: The coronavirus pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the economy, forcing nearly four million more Americans to file for unemployment. That brings the total number of jobless claims since the start of this crisis to 30 million.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Impacted a lot because, right now, I`m unemployed. Right now, a lot of people are hurting sitting at home not working.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It will great to start working ASAP, especially now. It`s getting ugly. I would love a job, though. A job would be awesome.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KORNACKI: All right, welcome back.</p><p>Well, usually, we`re up here showing you election data, polls, demographics, trends in the election. But, of course, we`re in a very different place right now. And we have been getting a very different kind of data lately.</p><p>And, today, we got another batch of it, very, very troubling, unsettling, dire economic news.</p><p>Let`s take you through, though, just to give you a fair and accurate portrait of where things stand right now on that front. We will give you a couple of numbers here.</p><p>First of all, this one came out earlier this week, this particular number, the quarterly gross domestic product. And you can see here, typically, it rises. Doesn`t always rise by a lot, but typically it rises, through 2017, 2018, 2019.</p><p>And then, boom, all of a sudden, we got the number for the first quarter, for the first three months of 2020. And there it is. Look at that. It`s minus-4.8 percent. You have not seen a number like that in our GDP since -- you guessed it -- the 2008 meltdown.</p><p>And, of course, the worst news on this front, as you say, first quarter of 2008, January, February, March, you think back. Of course, the coronavirus didn`t really start wrecking havoc in this country until well into that. And so you can only imagine, if the first quarter, which was partially affected by coronavirus, you can only imagine when you get to April, May, June, the second-quarter numbers.</p><p>We`re a ways away from getting those, but it`s probably get a fair bit worse than that minus-4.8 percent there. That`s one indicator. Of course, there is this. We mentioned this at the top of the show. These are the weekly unemployment insurance claims here.</p><p>And you can just track this going back. Again, this is just about the time here late March when you suddenly had the country grinding to a halt, folks being furloughed, filing those first-time claims.</p><p>Look, and the same week, March 21 this year, in the same week last year, this is a pretty normal number that we have been seeing for a while now. It was just over 200,000. In the March 21st week, this year, it was 3.2 million, 215,000, 3.2 million this year. And it just hasn`t stopped, I mean, 6.6 million the next week, again, about 200,000 last year.</p><p>You just keep seeing this, 6.6 million again, 5.2 million, 4.4 million, and then today, again, the number is down, but it`s 3.8 million. It was 230,000 a year ago.</p><p>You add all of these together, and you have seen, in the course the last six weeks, 30 million Americans file for unemployment. So that is just something -- I mean, what can you even compare that to at this point?</p><p>The unemployment rate, again, it was 4.4 percent, up point 0.9 percent when we first checked it. But that was a month ago. We`re getting the new one. We`re about to find out what that number is and how much it`s gone up. And get ready for that.</p><p>And, of course, here`s the one number -- we say terrible, terrible economic news. Weirdly enough, here`s the one thing that hasn`t tracked with that, Wall Street, the stock market. Start of the month, this was the Dow Jones industrial average. It was 20943. Today, last day of the month, trading closed, look at this, 24345.72. It`s up.</p><p>This was the highest one-month increase the stock market has seen in 33 years. And we got it amidst the coronavirus pandemic. Of course, remember, it had those big, big drops. Wall Street apparently has accounted for it. And, in the month of April, you did see that go up.</p><p>So, you got everything else going this way, and you got the stock market going that way, at least for now, though. Let`s see where it all goes.</p><p>Still ahead: Cities are having to make some very tough decisions, trying to balance public health with their economic well-being.</p><p>We`re going to ask the mayor of Austin, Texas, how to make those tough calls.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. GREG ABBOTT (R-TX): It`s time to set a new course, and a course that responsibly opens up business in Texas.</p><p>We will open in a way that uses safe standards -- safe standards for businesses, for their employees, as well as for their customers. Standards based upon data, and on doctors.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KORNACKI: Welcome back.</p><p>That was Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Monday, announcing that he will let a stay at home order expire tonight as his state moves into phase one of its reopening.</p><p>Starting tomorrow in Texas, retail stores, restaurants, movie theaters, museums, libraries and malls are allowed to reopen with limited capacity. No more than 25 percent, that means, and a second round of reopenings for personal care, businesses and gyms could come as soon as May 18th, provided there is not a spike in cases.</p><p>Texas state parks reopened for daytime use last week. The current order also allows outdoor sports if there are no more than four participants. Texas is one of biggest states moving to reopen. It`s a population of nearly 30 million, and a stand-alone economy that is the world`s tenth largest.</p><p>Texas right now has more than 28,000 confirmed cases of the virus and at least 782 people have died in the state. During his announcement on Monday, Governor Abbott emphasized that his order opening up businesses supersedes all local orders.</p><p>And I`m joined now by somebody who is affected directly by that decision and that is the mayor of Austin, Texas, Steve Adler.</p><p>Mr. Mayor, thank you for joining us.</p><p>So, you`re not going to really get a say in this. This is -- the governor says it and says, when I say go to cities and towns and cities like yours. I have seen you quoted expressing some displeasure with this. Take me through -- you`re saying 25 percent capacity at restaurants or retail establishments, movie theaters. As I understand it, bars are closed, and there are a lot of those in Austin certainly.</p><p>Are you uncomfortable with all of this or just some of this?</p><p>MAYOR STEVE ADLER (D-TX), AUSTIN: I think that everybody is scared. Obviously, the economy is hurting, and people are looking to see what happens next.</p><p>But no one knows what`s going to happen with the governor`s actions. The governor doesn`t know. The doctors, the scientists, they don`t know.</p><p>All we know is that we have been successful in really stopping this virus almost completely, by getting to a place where we have 90, 94 percent of reduction in virus transmission.</p><p>We don`t know what`s going to happen now that the governor is doing this. But we do know from the model is if we drop below 80 percent, and we`re going to be back to the second surge that you were talking about a little bit earlier. So, we`re going to have to watch it really carefully. I wish we have waited another week or two to get testing in place and contract tracing in place.</p><p>But we`re going to monitor it now. We will continue to do the things we can do and, frankly, as a community, we get to decide a lot of things, by our conduct, by our culture and by our actions. And that`s what we`re going to rely on now.</p><p>KORNACKI: So, that`s question. I mean, it`s one thing to say, the restrictions are lifted. Businesses can open under these circumstances. It`s another thing for the business owner to decide, OK, I`m going to do that, and it`s another thing yet still for customers, for citizens to say, OK, I`m comfortable going out, going in to the business and being a customer again.</p><p>Practically speaking, how much do you think Austin is going to be reopened in the next week?</p><p>ADLER: You know, I think that most people are going to be pretty cautious about this. I got asked this morning whether I was going to be in any restaurant or mall this weekend. The answer is no. And my family won`t be there either.</p><p>And everybody has got to make their own choices. I was disappointed that our governor said we couldn`t make mandatory, we couldn`t have penalties for people that didn`t wear face coverings. And all the public officials, health officials tell us that we should, he said we should, the lieutenant governor said we should. But they are trying to stop the cities from trying to enforce that.</p><p>My hope is that our community just does that. We`ve gotten used to doing it now. It`s going to save lives. It`s going to stop the virus from transmitting and I hope people don`t go into business establishments that aren`t requiring people to do it in their businesses. It`s going to take a lot of that conduct right now I think.</p><p>KORNACKI: You mentioned, the first question I asked you, you said you wish it was happening a week or two from now. You like to see more testing in place. It does suggest -- and this is what I`m curious about -- it does suggest you think the state is at least close to being ready, to begin reopening. Is that -- is that a fair statement?</p><p>ADLER: You know, different parts of the state are dealing with different kind of challenges right now. Here in Austin, I think we`re probably a week or two away from being able to try something. I probably would have started a more limited than what the governor is doing.</p><p>But what we have learned over the last six weeks is we have the ability to be able to monitor the signals pretty quickly. We know we can shut this thing down and get a handle on it.</p><p>So, every day, we`re going to be taking a look at hospitalizations, new cases. We`re going to be plotting those on the maps and on the trends to see what curves, and we`re going to decide as we start this process what are the triggers that we`ll eventually see, if things go bad. What are the triggers that will require us to act quickly?</p><p>And then the whole community is going to be able to watch those numbers, watch that data. We`re all going to be following it together, pretty transparent and open, we`ll all know how we`re doing.</p><p>I hope the governor`s plan works. I hope that we don`t get on those curves. I do anything I can to make the governor successful by wearing my face covering. And I hope other people do too.</p><p>KORNACKI: You know, we`re talking about this earlier with Minnesota. Another state that`s doing -- it`s doing a more limited version of partial reopening than Texas is.</p><p>But you have these guidelines from the federal level, from Anthony Fauci, saying the states need a two-week decline to even begin in his view -- his recommendation, to even begin reopening.</p><p>And yet, Texas, Minnesota, all thee other states, Georgia, Colorado, are embarking on this a little bit. And to hear you talk right now, it sounds like it`s something you`re thinking about too.</p><p>It just strikes me, red states and blue states are reopening right now. It seems that on the ground in some of these states, there`s maybe a view that that two-week decline is not necessarily something that has to be in place.</p><p>ADLER: You know, I -- we`re close to that here in Austin, the numbers that we -- that we see. But again, no one knows the answer. The real critical point is to now have a much better handle on the data we had before.</p><p>You know, the governor has indicated that he`s going to wait two weeks and then he`ll go to the next phase. I`m real concerned about that because there`s a two-week lag before a policy today has its first day when you see numbers change.</p><p>So, what is happening today in our communities, because of the policies two weeks ago, what the governor is going to see in two weeks from now as a result of policies we have on -- we have today. His policies over the next two weeks, we really need to have two weeks and then a week to ten days of seeing those results. So I`m concerned.</p><p>KORNACKI: All right. Austin Mayor Steve Adler, you, your city, your state are embarking on something tomorrow I think we will all be watching closely -- good luck to you.</p><p>ADLER: Thank you very much.</p><p>KORNACKI: All right, and up next, students and educators across the country are trying to figure out how to salvage the school year. Is it salvageable? And how soon will America`s education system bounce back?</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I never realized how much I miss school until I don`t get to go to school, or how much I miss outside.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KORNACKI: Welcome back.</p><p>With schools around the country closed for the foreseeable future, millions of children now face a lost school year.</p><p>A striking new study from the Northeast Evaluation Association which assesses learning throughout the country projects that students will return in the fall with approximately 70 percent of the learning gains they would typically have in reading and less than 50 percent of the gains they would usually make in math, nearly a full year behind in some grades.</p><p>While school systems are using remote classes to try to make up for those learning gaps, not every family has the same capability to facilitate that kind of education.</p><p>NBC News senior national correspondent Chris Jansing takes a closer look at the effect coronavirus is having on one school system in Cleveland.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHRIS JANSING, NBC NEWS SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: When you hear Damian Goggins playing, you can feel his longing for a bigger life than the world around him, for a degree and a career in music therapy.</p><p>But now that dream is increasingly uncertain.</p><p>DAMIAN GOGGINS, STUDENT: Feels like I have to grow up fast.</p><p>JANSING: How does that make you feel?</p><p>GOGGINS: I don`t know.

A survey finds 36 percent of students in low income schools are essentially truant, not logging into classes or making any contact.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The students who are most vulnerable in the classroom are the same students it`s harder to contact now. But you got holistically, even the students are engaging right now, I still feel like they will be behind.</p><p>GORDON: We`re looking at a recovery that`s going to take a minimum of the next couple years.</p><p>JANSING: And the coronavirus pandemic is taking another unforeseen toll. Cleveland schools are 68 percent black and people of color have been especially vulnerable to COVID-19.</p><p>So children of color are far more likely to lose a family member or know someone who has or have a parent with a job suddenly deemed essential and they`re home unsupervised.</p><p>GOGGINS: When I move to senior year, I want to be able to understand what teachers are talking about.

ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY)</emphasis>:  After you do the testing, states have a second big task put together an army of tracers who then trace each person tested positive.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ANNOUNCER</emphasis>:  This is an MSNBC special report \"Testing and the Road to Reopening.\"   </p><p>      (END VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRIAN WILLIAMS, MSNBC HOST</emphasis>:  Well, good evening. Brian Williams here with you, along with Nicolle Wallace.  </p><p>      And over the course of the next two hours, we're going to examine two very important steps to reopening our country -- coronavirus testing on a massive scale and contact tracing.   </p><p>      Right now, over 868,000 people have tested positive for coronavirus in our country with more than 49,000 souls gone. Today, we learned another 4.4 million Americans filed jobless claims last week, bringing the five-week total to more than 26 million people that we know of.   </p><p>      One key in returning people to work, getting back to normal is, of course, widespread testing. So, tonight, we're going to look at the importance of both diagnostic and antibody testing and hear about the number of tests that we need to safely reopen.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBC HOST</emphasis>:  And, Brian, another important issue is contact tracing. We're going to be hearing a lot about this. It's the process of tracking down everyone who may have been exposed to the virus. We'll go through how it's conducted and why it's absolutely critical to stopping new infections.   </p><p>      Tonight, we'll be joined by three key people working hard to fight coronavirus. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York, and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.   </p><p>      We also have a full team of correspondents standing by with the latest reporting here in the U.S. and overseas, as well as the team of doctors.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  Bill Gates sat down for an exclusive conversation with Savannah Guthrie earlier today to talk about where he thinks we are right now in this pandemic, the dangers of states reopening too quickly, a possible resurgence of the virus in the fall and winter, and his thoughts about a prediction he made back in 2015 in a TED Talk that a future pandemic was indeed coming.   </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAVANNAH GUTHRIE, NBC NEWS ANCHOR</emphasis>:  You have made fighting infectious disease really your life's work -- at least the second half of your life. Just where we are right now in terms of this pandemic? That famous saying, are we at the end of the beginning or at the beginning of the end?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Well, I wish I could say that we're halfway through, but I don't think so. It takes time to make a vaccine. The social distancing that we've had to engage in has huge economic effects. It's very tough on people. There's a lot about the disease we don't understand.   </p><p>      So we know that we can get out of this, but it's going to be awhile before things go back to normal.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GUTHRIE</emphasis>:  You talk a lot about not the new normal but the new semi-normal and what that might look like for us, the time before we get a vaccine but when we can start to return to some activity.   </p><p>      How do you envision that?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  We're going to learn as we go, and the key thing is to have these tests where they have been prioritized and you're getting quick results. That will allow you to change the policies before you get back to filling up the hospitals and having a high death rate.  </p><p>      And so sadly, we can't promise people as we open up that we won't have to go back, that some locations or some activities will see that they're causing a spread and have to restrict those things even more. You know, I'm hopeful the high priority things like a lot of manufacturing, construction and even schools will fit into this but, you know, we're going to learn as we go and we need to watch.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GUTHRIE</emphasis>:  Let's talk about what's happening right now. There are states like Georgia poised to reopen some parts of their economy and even nail salons they're talking about, tattoo parlors. Is there anywhere in the country that's ready for that kind of reopening?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Well, the intensity of the infection has varied a lot across the country, but we know that if you go fully back to normal mixing, that then you get on to that exponential growth curve. And so, it's a question of prioritization.   </p><p>      In Asia, they have been fairly slow to reopen. They require masks. They don't even have all the employees going in yet.   </p><p>      The good news is that they've largely avoided a rebound. The numbers and disease will tell us where to go on this. You know, I'm afraid we'll have some people and some states that move too quickly and have to back off.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GUTHRIE</emphasis>:  We are a nation of states, and it's going to be a patch work response, it has to be because every state will do something differently or at least it seems as it's shaping up that way. How do you think that plays out?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  So, the U.S. is kind of unusual that the federal level, you know, has said that testing is fine when in fact, for opening up, you know, we're at least a factor of three or four below where you would really catch things in a quick way. Some states will sadly give us the information about what -- what is too much and, you know, citizens will also very pretty widely in terms of some aren't going to come out and do much for a long time, whereas a few, you know, are like chomping at the bit or maybe aren't adhering to what the restrictions are.   </p><p>      You know, it's too bad that -- to have it be a political thing. Adherence, you know, ideally would be widespread that we understand that you can infect other people. So, it's not just your individual choices but you're affecting all of society in how you behave.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GUTHRIE</emphasis>:  And as you well know and understand, the issue is, is that there is a very severe economic price to be paid for these public health measures that are so important, and that's the balance that's trying to be struck here. Some people are going to look and say, did we overreact? And others will look at it and say, perhaps we underreacted.   </p><p>      Where do you come down on that?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Well, certainly, everybody looking back wishes they had reacted faster. If you catch this at a very low level like a few countries did, you know, because you got community testing and contact tracing, then you don't have to do the shutdown. As people see the infection rates, as they see the stories about the emergency rooms, you know, they weren't going to be traveling to theme parks or, you know, going to sports stadiums.  </p><p>      And so, it's a false choice to say it's the government who is solely responsible for this economic activity going down. People, you know, fear getting sick themselves or infecting their parents and so we just didn't have a choice.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GUTHRIE</emphasis>:  You famously talked about a coming pandemic at this nightmare scenario back in 2015 on the heels of the Ebola crisis and you said in your TED Talk that you worried about a virus that could be 1,000 times worse. Is this that virus?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Yes. The human to human respiratory spread is the scariest scenario and I showed a simulation in that 2015 talk that, you know, showed you could have tens of millions of deaths and trillions of economic costs. So, this did. It's a respiratory virus that is causing that damage. And so, it's a nightmare.  </p><p>      You know, I wish it had come, you know, five or ten years later than governments might have done the preparation to move quickly like a few governments did and the technologies would have been further along.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GUTHRIE</emphasis>:  I went back and looked at the numbers. On March 1st, we had had two deaths in this country. Thirty days later on April 1st, we had 4,800 deaths. Today, as we sit here, not even 30 days later, we have 47,000 deaths.   </p><p>      Can you just talk about that exponential growth and exponential decline?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Yes, so if I'm infecting two other people for every active infection, you know, then over the course of the month, you can go from a small part of the population to a very large part, and so clearly, in March, the infections were exponential and then you have about an 18-day leg between infections and deaths.   </p><p>      And so, April, exactly as you said, we've had huge numbers of deaths. If we maintain the isolation, the deaths out in the summer would be very, very small. Very quickly, it can go from barely detectable to huge and, you know, I think people will be shocked that in some locations, the ICU will hardly have anyone in it at all within the next few months.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GUTHRIE</emphasis>:  I read that you said that we are nearing the peak in this country, hopefully. And then you've also said we're really not anywhere near the end of this, and I can't be alone in thinking, well, how does that work out? How can we be almost at the peak but yet so far away from a solution and an end to this and a return to normal?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Well, the vaccine is the most likely solution, and so, great scientists are rushing to get that done. And actually, I've been surprised how quickly they're moving. There is a number that have even begun that human testing that's key there.   </p><p>      And so, it could be that in a year, we have lots of a vaccine and then once you get it out to lots of people, then you -- you're -- you have enough community immunity that you won't see this widespread problem again.   </p><p>      You know, we have this first peak in the U.S. With the right policies, we'll have small, some areas that go back and have infections, but we shouldn't see countrywide anything like this but a -- you know, miracle therapeutic or the vaccine are the only thing that we'll be able to say, OK, we're back to normal.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GUTHRIE</emphasis>:  I do want to ask you about the second wave, this notion that the virus could come back in the fall. We heard the CDC director saying it could be even potentially more difficult in the fall and winter because the seasonal flu will also be going on.   </p><p>      Dr. Fauci said he's certain there will be a second wave of this virus.   </p><p>      What's your perspective on how bad it could be?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Well, if we're -- if we're still being careful about social contact, if we're wearing masks, if we're doing distancing where possible, if we got the testing capacity up, I'm hopeful that the fall will not be nearly as bad as this first peak. The flu is a challenge because the symptoms are common enough that knowing exactly who to test, you know, which are people with symptoms, will be a little confused because of all those flu infections that will be taking place.  </p><p>      But the vigilance of not getting too relaxed when you're seeing pictures of empty ICUs, that's not intuitive because you could get back on that ramp.   </p><p>      (END VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  Part of Bill Gates' conversation with Savannah Guthrie.   </p><p>      Here is a billionaire willing to spend his own money and a billionaire who spends his time thinking about this.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  And when Savannah asks him is this that virus, he calmly answers yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Yes, to hear him use the words nightmare scenario, I was watching it and thinking about just how long Bill Gates has been a giant in the public health arena. He was talking about the sorts of things people were afraid of when I was in government.  </p><p>      I mean, it's been reported by \"The New York Times\" this week that George W. Bush became obsessed with pandemics and had all of us reading some of the same books that I know Bill Gates talked about in that TED Talk, and that this was the nightmare scenario the last three presidents were scared of. That President Obama had a team that handed this team a plan to deal with something like this. George W. Bush had done some work on that plan, too, and to hear Bill Gates talk about that brings back all that muscle memory that you just don't see in this more sort of chaotic administration on full display.   </p><p>      But there were a lot of other science headlines in there and lucky for us, we're able to get reaction from Dr. Michael Osterholm. He's the director of the Center for Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota and the author of \"Deadliest Enemy:  Our War Against Killer Germs.\"   </p><p>      I saw you earlier today on this network and there were so many practical pieces to what Bill Gates was saying about we don't get to normal until there are some really powerful therapies or a vaccine.   </p><p>      How far off is that?   </p><p>      MICHAEL OSTERHOLM, PHD, CENTER FOR DISEASE RESEARCH &amp; POLICY </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DIRECTOR</emphasis>:  Well, we don't know right now if we're going to have a vaccine. I just have to be very honest with you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OSTERHOLM</emphasis>:  We hope we will have one, but hope is not a strategy.   </p><p>      Drugs will be very important in reducing the severity of illness and hope for preventing deaths, but it won't stop the transmission. People are infectious in the earliest stages of their illness even before in some cases they get sick, so the drug would come after that.   </p><p>      So, the epidemiology or meaning, occurrence of cases will continue to occur. And I think one of the things that's being missed here is that when we talk about, are we going to have the curve flatten, what's going to come back? Look at it this way, as we know in this country between 5 and maybe 10 percent of the population has been infected even in the metropolitan areas. You heard in New York today, it maybe 14 percent.  </p><p>      This virus is not going to stop transmitting among people until it hits 60 or 70 percent of the people. So, either we've got to do that with a vaccine and get them to be immune from that perspective, or they're going t get it through natural infection. That's a lot of additional cases to occur over the months a ahead.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  Doctor, I will not forget the first time you and I spoke. It was in the midst of our political coverage, this virus while dangerous seemed so far off and it was a vague threat. It's now very real.   </p><p>      I know we're mostly talking about testing tonight, but absent any political considerations, what do you see people doing wrong right now because you know the strength of this opponent?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OSTERHOLM</emphasis>:  Well, first of all, again, I keep looking at the 16 to 18-month course and keeping that in mind is that's what we're embarking upon. Far too many people look at this as a sprint and we're just about over. We're debating can we reopen now with the idea that's the end of it.  </p><p>      And in fact, we could have many, many more peaks. Those of us who study infectious disease, and I've spent the last 45 years of my life studying this very thing, we don't know if this coronavirus, will there be a big peak in the next fall? There could be. Will there just be slow burn constantly seeing infections occur like we're seeing right now in countries like Singapore and Japan that one time had it under control or will we see a series of peaks like Mr. Gates talked about? We don't know.   </p><p>      But we know one thing, this virus won't stop until it infects as many as 50 -- 60 to 70 percent of us. So, we have to have a battle plan not just about this week or this month or next month. We're in this for the long haul.   </p><p>      I unfortunately promise you, we will be having this same discussion where some form of it one year from tonight.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  That's such an ominous prediction. I'm sure you're correct.   </p><p>      But I wonder if we're not out of the gates yet in terms of being able to talk about reopening, can you just clarify what the three -- are the three legs of that stool for identifying our starting point, the diagnostic testing, the antibody testing and contact tracing. Or is there another step? It's confusing to know where we even start with a clear picture of where we are today.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OSTERHOLM</emphasis>:  Well, first of all, we have to do testing, but we've got to also stop talking about the way we have. We have far too many people that come on shows like this or write articles saying, test, test, test. We have to understand we have a major shortage of reagents today.   </p><p>      The world was not ready to suddenly supply all these test kits, and so, it's not a matter of money. It's a matter of physics. We don't have the reagents.   </p><p>      We have to build these manufacturing facilities to do that. Our government has not helped facilitate that. We needed a Marshall Plan to build that up.   </p><p>      So testing is critical. We need it. Second of all, we have to make sure that we have surge capacity in our hospitals so when the testing shows us that the cases are starting to come back, that we can handle them. We don't want to overload the hospitals.   </p><p>      And, by the way, that surge capacity doesn't mean just beds, it also means protecting our health care workers.   </p><p>      The third thing that we absolutely must do in all of this is then do what you just said about contract tracing, have a way so we can constantly try to hold this virus down. Until you have those kinds of things in place, it's very hard to reopen and not get caught with suddenly this very rapidly rising number of cases.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  Well, Doctor, you just said the magic phrase to me, the Marshall Plan and I'll do it one better -- a Manhattan Project. If this is indeed going to be the event that perhaps marks the rest of our adult lives as Americans, why not?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OSTERHOLM</emphasis>:  Well, I actually in an op-ed piece I wrote in \"The New York Times\" almost month ago, which I predicted we'd have a shortage right now that we see if reagents, I actually did call for a Manhattan Project, an intellectual one, that covers all these issues. My Marshall Plan is just about testing reagents.  </p><p>      But I think you're right on the mark, Brian. We need to bring together that right now and what this country is missing is a core. We're missing a leadership component that can bring everyone together without regard to partisan politics, without regard to age, race, gender, location.   </p><p>      You know, I said on your network just three weeks ago that one day, it wouldn't be a red and bluish shoe. It would be a COVID color issue. Look what's happened in the Midwest right now. All those red counties are turning COVID because of what we're seeing happen.   </p><p>      So I think that you're exactly right. We need a Manhattan Project, where one, tell the truth. We need straight talk. What's really happening, what's not?   </p><p>      I don't want to hear another time we have enough testing. The 50 governors will tell you, that's not true. We need to understand, are we going to have more cases or not? Don't tell the public we're not going to have any more cases because they may go away with more sunshine or warm. There's no truth to that. That's like defying gravity.   </p><p>      So, I think that's part of what will make a Manhattan Project work if we all come together to solve a common problem that is this virus and it's going to be here for awhile, so let's get on with it right now doing that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Dr. Michael Osterholm, I think it might solve more than coronavirus to give people something like that to work on together, you're right. That's what people are hungry for.   </p><p>      Thank you so much for joining us.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OSTERHOLM</emphasis>:  Thank you very much.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  We have much -- we have much more of our colleague Savannah Guthrie's exclusive conversation with Bill Gates throughout this program tonight.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  The Gates Foundation is in the thick of that hunt for a vaccine. Up next, hear what Bill Gates says he feels hopeful that we may be on the optimistic side of the timeline to find a vaccine and the unprecedented steps now being taken right now to find a vaccine and mass produce it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  Plus, does Bill Gates think the U.S. is doing a good job at testing presently? That's all next.   </p><p>      There is much more still ahead this hour. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo will join us to talk about the day he learned this stunning fact -- more than one in five New York city residents tested found to have antibodies to the virus, meaning far more New Yorkers might have had coronavirus without becoming sick or showing symptoms.   </p><p>      Stay with us.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  Welcome back to our special broadcast tonight.   </p><p>      In a new op-ed in \"The Washington Post\" today, Bill Gates who talked about World War II as the galvanizing event for his parents' generation writes this and we, quote:  There is one big difference between a world war and a pandemic. All of humanity can work together to learn about the disease and develop the capacity to fight it.   </p><p>      He argues the U.S. needs to invest in creating new approaches to expand testing and contact tracing to track the spread of the virus before we can safely, in quotes, reopen our country.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Only about 1.4 percent of the U.S. population has been tested coronavirus so far and there is little organization from the federal government on contact tracing.   </p><p>      In part two of Savannah's exclusive interview, Bill Gates details some of the innovations in testing that his foundation is working on, his assessment of why the U.S. is lagging in testing and why he says he's optimistic about the timeline for a vaccine.   </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GUTHRIE</emphasis>:  The Gates Foundation is very much at the forefront on this hunt for a vaccine. We've all learned by now the timeline, the hopeful timeline of 12 to 18 months. That is a highly expedited track, a fast track for a vaccine. Can you explain why?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  For most diseases, you don't pursue more than one or two approaches. Here, because of all the incredibly negative effects, the sooner the better. And so, we're going to pursue -- there are 100 efforts, but maybe 10 of those should get the resources to build factories and go full speed ahead, and it will be multiple companies, which that's not typical, and it will be at risk because those are billions of dollars that when they're successful will save the trillions of dollars of broad damage.   </p><p>      So, you know, the best scientists working hard on this and I'm hopeful. In fact, in the last few weeks, I've seen signs that we may get to the optimistic side of that time projection.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GUTHRIE</emphasis>:  What about treatments? That's -- you said, if we could get a miracle drug, a miracle treatment that would, you know, take care of it for 95 percent of people, then maybe we could all be at the baseball game next spring. You've said you don't think that's likely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GUTHRIE</emphasis>:  But where is the hope on the treatment track?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Well, there's a huge number of compounds being tried. The public knows about remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, you know, whenever one it is, you know, most will fail but a few I think will have substantial effects.   </p><p>      As far as I know, none of the trials have had that kind of, you know, amazing result where you stop it early and go, hey, we have to get this out. So, you know, even if those lead compounds do not have significant benefit, believe me, there are so many good ideas that some will.   </p><p>      So, no one should put their hope behind a particular approach -- and hydroxy, it may have a modest effect. That's all, by the end of May, will be clear.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GUTHRIE</emphasis>:  I think if there has been any area that seems to have been bedeviling during this crisis, it's testing.   </p><p>      I wonder how you assess how the U.S. has done in testing, and what seems to be the issue here? What's the breakdown? What's the problem? What should have been better?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATESS</emphasis>:  Well, many countries decided that at the national level, they would orchestrate the testing and, you know, do that very early so all of these machines called PCR machines would be used 24 hours a day, and you would be testing the right people. That hasn't happened in the United States. It might not happen.   </p><p>      But, you know, the access to tests is just, you know, chaotic. If you're a low income person, your access is less than a high income person.   </p><p>      We should focus on the symptomatics and the contact tracing.   </p><p>      So, I don't know whether this will get organized. The capacity is going up but, you know, when you get the results late, it's almost worthless and so we can improve. A number of invasions have been driven. We were involved in proving that the patient doing the self-swab just at the tip of the nose, that's as good as having the medical worker do the more invasive procedure.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GUTHRIE</emphasis>:  Yes, I was going to ask about that because there seems to be a couple of innovations on the horizon, both having to do with at home testing. One, the nasal swab, you do yourself and I think you send it off to a lab. And the other, you've said is kind of like a home pregnancy test and that you do the test --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GUTHRIE</emphasis>:  -- and you get the results right there. Different method, I know.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  That's right. The swab (inaudible) the self-swab is in common, whether you send it back for the PCR processing hopefully very quickly, less than 24 hours, or if you simply take the swab, put it in liquid, pour the liquid on to a piece of paper, and then it turns one color if you have virus and another color if you don't. If we can make those in large numbers and it has the right sensitivity, then we could open testing up and go beyond symptomatics.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE</emphasis>:  Until we have a vaccine, as I understand it, you have to be able to test and you have to be able to contact trace. In other words, you're in a community and you're watching to see where the cases flare up and then you trace all the contacts so you can kind of encircle them and contain them.   </p><p>      And there's a lot of talk right now about, A, whether or not we have sufficient resources, human resources to do that contact tracing, and B, whether there's a big role for big tech, your old business, to play. Cell phones, that kind of thing. How do you see that coming to pass?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Well, South Korea was able to avoid a countrywide shutdown by doing the testing and contact tracing in a professional way. Now, they did it in a way that they grabbed your data immediately without your opting into that. And so the exact approach to do that contact tracing in the U.S. and other western countries may not be identical, but the basic approach, even if it's mostly through interview, is very important to keep the numbers down.   </p><p>      And so we're going to have to hire up people to do those interviews, and this is another case where the federal government really hasn't stepped up to it. So it's mostly the state saying, OK, who's volunteering to do this, and can software facilitate it? So this is a new effort that will make a big difference.   </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Brian, it's amazing how much your question about a Manhattan project comes through and just what Bill Gates is talking about. And he's not pulling any punches in terms of the deficiencies and inadequacies of the federal effort, but there is such an outsized role for technology, for innovation, for sort of human ingenuity if you listen to him talk about the contact tracing.   </p><p>      That's basically going to be investigative epidemiology. I mean, that's going to be people that have the ability to sit down and try to get to the bottom of every single contact that a human being had. It really is a massive, massive undertaking.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  Also, opens your mind to what could be possible. Science, when it works best, merges with medicine and makes our lives easier. What he was describing there is a home pregnancy test. In effect, it's the same process and chemical makeup, only this would tell you if you're COVID positive or COVID negative in real-time right before your eyes.   </p><p>      Well, be that as it may, we're going to move on and get more on this topic of contact tracing. You've seen pictures. We've showed some of them briefly. Folks in some countries, in Asia, swiping QR codes, having their temperatures taken before they get on a train or enter a building. How might that work in a country like ours? How soon could it be put to work in a country like ours? Steve Kornacki crunches numbers for a living, and he's with us to explain.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  And Brian, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is actually helping New York coordinate a testing and tracing effort, which Governor Cuomo described today as a super-ambitious undertaking. Michael Bloomberg joins us to talk about that, next.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  It is called contact tracing, and suddenly, for good reason, it is the phrase of the moment, a very important tool to be used in this fight against coronavirus. It does what it indicates. It takes all of the people you've come in contact with, all of those you can remember and identify, and goes back through them to see if any of them have tested positive.   </p><p>      The World Health Organization estimates that each infected person can in turn infect multiples making the coronavirus more contagious than the seasonal flu. If we want to flatten the curve, which is happening through social distancing, but also shrink the curve and prevent infections, keep that number down, we have to have a nationwide system for this contact tracing.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Joining us now to explain more about contact tracing is our colleague, Steve Kornacki.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEVE KORNACKI, NBC NEWS NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT</emphasis>:  Yes, Nicolle, that's right. And contact tracing really is - it is a tool to be used for the reopening phase. If you're going to try to reopen the country in some way without having a vaccine, what you want to be able to do is be in a position to find any potential outbreak and to nip it in the bud. And here's what's involved in that process. Let's take you through how contact tracing works.   </p><p>      So let's say it's a person who suddenly develops symptoms and says I might have the coronavirus. Well, in this ideal world of rapid testing and mass testing and contact tracing, that person can very quickly, maybe in a drive-through clinic, maybe a walk in clinic, maybe at an at-home test, get a test, get an answer, and find out if they're infected.   </p><p>      And if that person is infected, then the next step is to talk to and to work with a public health official, a contact tracer, and to try to go through the people that - the infected person, the people that person has been around for the last couple days, basically the people that person has been around within six feet and for at least 10 minutes. That's the key. Somebody you've been around for at least 10 minutes of time within a space of at least - of inside six feet.   </p><p>      So let's say, that opened up 12 possibilities or so. The infected person works with the contact tracer to find out and to identify who all of those people might be. And then the contact tracer will then get in touch with each one of those people and will simply say you have been in proximity to, you have potentially been exposed to the coronavirus.   </p><p>      And then the idea there is, again, rapid, widely available testing. Get those people tested. Find out, do any of them have it. If a couple of them have it, you repeat this whole process. Get them in touch with a contact tracer, get in touch with that person's circle of associates, circle of contacts, and you basically try to find out who in all these sort of succeeding rings here has been exposed, who has it, get them quarantined, nip it in the bud. So that is the idea to be doing this all over the country.   </p><p>      There are some obvious major challenges that go with this. First of all, obviously - look, asymptomatic. You can be walking around with this and not know you have it. That's obviously a major challenge. Resources, think about that. A contact tracer trying to track down all of these people who a person has been in contact with. That is resource intense. That takes time.   </p><p>      A person who has been infected will give you some names they've been in touch with, but it could also be, hey, I was with some people in a subway, I have no idea who they were. Contact tracer has got to help try to figure that out, and of course, privacy concerns here too. There are all sorts of tools of technology that can be used to help in this GPS tracking, surveillance cameras and that sort of thing. How much are we comfortable with though actually being used for a tracking program, a contact tracing program.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Steve Kornacki, it's so interesting how protective that six-foot barrier is, that for contact tracing, you rule out everyone who you kept a safe distance from and you only rule in the people that broke that sort of six-foot mote around you. It's fascinating stuff. Thank you, Steve.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KORNACKI</emphasis>:  Thanks.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  Nicolle, it is the medical equivalent of that small nick in your windshield that can oftentimes--  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  --spider across your entire field of view and envelope your world looking for it. But enough mixed metaphors.   </p><p>      Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has volunteered to develop a coronavirus contact tracing program just to help the incredibly hard hit New York, New Jersey, Connecticut tri-state area. Bloomberg Philanthropies, which of course was founded by him, will contribute $10.5 million as well as tech support and assistance to this program. I spoke with the former mayor earlier tonight.   </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  Mr. Mayor, tell us about this program. You have decided to spend your money on in the area of public health.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR</emphasis>:  Well, the virus is what's called a communicable disease compared to cancer, which is a non-communicable disease. You get cancer from smoking or being obese or other things, but you don't catch it from somebody else. A communicable disease, you catch from somebody else. So if you don't want to get it, you just got to make sure you don't go near anybody who has it.   </p><p>      Now, problems are we don't know who has it. The tests aren't perfect. It's not easy to get a test yet. And once they have it, you've got to depend on them to tell you whether they have it so you know to stay away, or stay away from everybody. And a lot of people will wear a mask. That stops you from breathing the same air that the other person who may have the disease does. You have to stop touching the same things other people touch. If they are infected, you have a very good chance of getting it.   </p><p>      So what we're trying to do here is to find out for somebody that has the disease, who else they talked to or were close to, and then warn those people and get them to stay in an area where nobody else can catch it from them if they've caught it. And you'll know after two weeks whether that person has caught it from the first person.   </p><p>      And so what we're trying to do is put together a group, which will interview people that have it, say where were you, who did you talk to, and then go to those people and say you were exposed to somebody that had it and so you've got to take precautions. You don't want to get - if you've caught it, you don't want to give it to your loved ones. So, go and lock yourself away for two weeks because you're with somebody who had it and because you don't want to give it to somebody else.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  This is such a vast spider web of contacts. If you and I saw each other in a Manhattan restaurant and one of us learned later that we were asymptomatic but carriers, think of the vortices that would come off that one meeting.   </p><p>      I have to ask, given the state of the economy, is this going to mean jobs for people who need the work, need the money as contact tracing interviewers and researchers?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLOOMBERG</emphasis>:  Well, we've already done the worst part. We closed the restaurants. So the question now is to find out who you've talked to other than that. If you take the subway, it's pretty hard to get the names of everybody that's on the subway car.   </p><p>      If you had been in a restaurant, the restaurant probably doesn't know the names of everybody else that was there. But if you just go around and stay out of the stores and stay out of the restaurants and stay in your home, you will not be touching anybody else who might have it.   </p><p>      If you do touch somebody and you find out, then we can go and interview those people. You could interview the doorman in your building. You could interview the delivery man that brought the food to your house. And we need people to do that, and they have to be trained and they have to know which questions to ask, and we want to make sure they don't divulge any personal information.   </p><p>      But this is serious stuff, and particularly, as you get older, it's more serious. Older people have a higher incidence of getting very sick and even dying from this disease. Younger people aren't immune, but they're more secure than if they were older.   </p><p>      And somebody like my age, it's really as much more serious thing than if you were the age of my daughter, or my grand kid is even less likely to catch it from somebody. But Johns Hopkins is designing a program. We're trying to hire the people and train them and then make sure that they get the information to the right people and not to the wrong people.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  And final question, you mentioned testing. We're talking about testing on this broadcast here tonight. Absent rock-solid big numbers in testing, how much of a crimp does that put in this effort you've decided to finance?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLOOMBERG</emphasis>:  Well, the fewer people that have it, the less likely somebody else is to be with somebody who has it. So what you're trying to do is keep everybody that has it off the streets and then nobody else will have it. And if the people that have it get over it, then they can go back on the streets but they won't infect anybody.   </p><p>      So it's not going to make it any worse, quite the contrary. If you can tell people that they were close to somebody who had it, they can then isolate themselves, which they would not do if you didn't have this process. So that's why Governor Cuomo is in favor of this program, and that's why we've had Johns Hopkins design the program.   </p><p>      And if we can get it to work in New York, we can get it to work elsewhere as well. But every country is trying to do the same thing. Some have a more professional program than others. We want to make sure that New York has a very professional program run by people who are well trained and who you can depend upon, not to take your personal information and give it to people who shouldn't have it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  Former Mayor of the City of New York, former presidential candidate, Mike Bloomberg, thank you for spending a few minutes with us tonight.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BLOOMBERG</emphasis>:  You're welcome, Brian. Good to be with you. Stay safe.   </p><p>      (END VIDEOTAPE)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  Coming up for us, another break in our broadcast. As we go to break, think of this. We've had a doctor tonight warn us we're still going to be having this conversation a year from now. We will ask a noted epidemiologist if she agrees with that, after this.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  Welcome back to this special broadcast we're calling \"Testing and the Road to Reopening.\" We're happy to be joined tonight by a frequent guest of ours, Dr. Anne Rimoin, Professor of Epidemiology at the UCLA School of Public Health.   </p><p>      And Anne, I have to ask you, we had Dr. Osterholm with us earlier in the hour. Scary, yes, but also he's very much a realist. He said that a year from tonight, we'll still be having this conversation. Do you agree with that? And talk about whether or not you see that if we launched a Manhattan project on testing, would that still sadly be the case?   </p><p>      DR. ANNE RIMOIN, UCLA SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSOR OF </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</emphasis>:  It's anybody's guess where we're going to be. And everything is also speculation at this point. I do think that if we had a Manhattan project type of situation, we would be doing better. But here's the thing. Everybody is working on vaccines now. And I think we do have a lot of work happening. We have a lot of work on vaccines. We have a lot of work on therapeutics. Things are moving forward.   </p><p>      So I think we need to take heed of what's happened in other countries. We need to really focus on getting our act together, moving forward. But we can't forget it is not just tests - it's not just vaccines and therapeutics, it's going to ride on also contact tracing and testing. We need everything. And we need to be hitting it at all fronts.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Dr. Rimoin, I know you just said it's speculative, but I think that's all people have at this point. And one of the conversations I have most often is speculation and wondering when our kids will ever go back to school. And I'm not asking to speculate on when that could happen, especially in a place like New York, but how would that happen? Which of these pieces would need to be in place for states to open schools again?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RIMOIN</emphasis>:  Well, this is the question that everybody is asking, and it's not just an issue for schools. When you say schools, I think many people are thinking about children that are from elementary school through high school. But it's a big question for universities, colleges around the country as well. So these are very big questions.   </p><p>      The likelihood is we're not going to have a vaccine by the summer. And so at least for the foreseeable future, we have to rely on these blunt measures like social distancing, contact tracing, and making sure that we have testing in place. And if we had all of those things in place, we could start opening up. But you really need, as Dr. Osterholm said, you really need to be able to identify who is sick, who is not, and to be able to make decisions based on that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  Dr. Rimoin, California, of course--  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RIMOIN</emphasis>:  I know it didn't really answer your question exactly, but the--  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  I was just going to say California is Nicolle's--  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RIMOIN</emphasis>:  --I didn't answer it exactly, but--  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  --is Nicolle's home state. Sorry. This satellite delay during these times is tough to deal with. California is Nicolle's home state. Your governor, Governor Newsom, is almost alone among governors in talking about the COVID architecture that has to follow this pandemic and the way we need to do things differently publicly. Talk about that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RIMOIN</emphasis>:  Well, I think that Governor Newsom has been ahead of the pack. He's laid out a very clear plan that includes testing as a corner piece and is really pushing forward. California, I was very, very heartened today to see that California is going to be testing asymptomatic people as well - focusing on testing asymptomatic - looking for asymptomatic infection in health care workers and first responders and essential workers.   </p><p>      I think that this is going to go a long way in terms of curbing the spread. But I think that having this kind of plan that is so straightforward that we have benchmarks and that everybody understands what the rules of the game are, is just really a fantastic way of moving forward. And I think that that's why California has really - has succeeded.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  Dr. Anne Rimoin, thank you for joining us from L.A. tonight.   </p><p>      We have much more still ahead. In our next hour, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on what it will take to reopen the City and State of New York. And after his high-profile meeting at the White House this week, the Governor tells us what the federal government has agreed to do to help with testing.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Plus, an in-depth look at how some countries are managing to rein in coronavirus. Today, German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned, quote, \"We are still at the beginning of this crisis.\" Yet Germany is starting to open up. Richard Engel will join us with a new report about how they're able to do that.   </p><p>      Stay with us. You're watching MSNBC's special report, \"Testing and the Road to Reopening.\"   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  Brian Williams and Nicolle Wallace back with you. As we cross the top of the hour into what is normally \"The 11th Hour\" broadcast, we're continuing our special coverage of the critical roles that testing and contact tracing will play in what is called reopening our country eventually.   </p><p>      A number of states are eager to reopen amid troubling unemployment news. Tomorrow, the State of Georgia will begin opening some businesses even though experts have warned it's too early and even though the President publicly broke with Georgia's Governor just a few hours ago. Meanwhile, other states are taking things, as they must, much slower.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  This hour we'll hear from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose state is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak here in the U.S.New York just released the results of an antibody testing study today. We'll also have much more from our exclusive interview with Microsoft Co-Founder Bill Gates. He responds to the conspiracy theory that blames him for the entire pandemic. But first here are his thoughts on where things stand.  </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  My first question is just where we are right now in terms of this pandemic. That famous saying, are we at the end of the beginning or at the beginning of the end?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Well, I wish I could say that we're halfway through, but I don't think so. It takes time to make a vaccine. The social distancing that we've had to engage in has huge economic effects. It's very tough on people. There's a lot about the disease we don't understand. So we know that we can get out of this, but it's going to be a while before things go back to normal.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  You famously talked about a coming pandemic, this nightmare scenario back in 2015 on the heels of the Ebola crisis, and you said in your Ted Talk that you worried about a virus that could be a thousand times worse. Is this that virus?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Yes. The human-to-human respiratory spread is the scariest scenario, and I showed a simulation in that 2015 talk that, you know, showed you could have tens of millions of deaths and trillions of economic cost. So this fits. It's a respiratory virus that is causing that damage. The vaccine is the most likely solution, and so great scientists are rushing to get that done. And actually I've been surprised how quickly they're moving. There's a number that have even begun that human testing that's key there. And so it could be that in a year, we have lots of a vaccine. The economic effects have been, you know, unbelievable, and so we'll be dealing with that literally for years to come. But a, you know, miracle therapeutic or the vaccine are the only thing that we'll be able to say, OK, we're back to normal.  </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  OK. So it turns out coronavirus spread throughout American cities undetected much, much earlier than anyone realized at the time. That's according to a new report from The New York Times. On March 1st, five major U.S. Cities, New York, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, and Seattle had a total of 23 confirmed cases of coronavirus. But a model of infection rates by researchers at northeastern university estimates that there could have actually been 28,000 undetected infections in those cities by that time.  </p><p>      This visualization from The Times shows the remarkable disparity between those two sets of numbers. The model suggests that by the time New York had its first confirmed case of coronavirus, there were already 10,000 people infected. This new information as New York begins work on a plan for widespread testing and contact tracing.  </p><p>      Joining us now, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Governor, we meet on a day of some pretty momentous political headlines and pretty momentous science headlines. I want to start with the science. You shared some information in your briefing today about antibodies. Is that encouraging? And can you take us through how many New Yorkers, based on this early study, may have already been exposed to COVID?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CUOMO</emphasis>:  Yeah. No, it was surprising. We had about -- we did a 3,000-person survey, which is fairly extensive all throughout the state. Statewide, it was about 14 percent of the people had the antibodies, which means 14 percent of the people had the virus. That's about 2.7 million people in our state. New York City was close to 20 percent.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Wow.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CUOMO</emphasis>:  Which was surprising. Yeah. So the good news is these are people who have the antibodies. They can then donate blood for the convalescent plasma, which is probably one of the best therapeutic that show promise.  </p><p>      The other good news is, you know, we talk about the death rate. We have about 15,000 people who have died in New York. That's hospitalizations and nursing homes. That doesn't count the at-home deaths which we still have to calculate. But it's 15,000 on a much larger denominator. So the death rate is like 0.5. The normal flu is like 0.1 to 0.3. So it gives a perspective on the death rate if you're looking for a silver lining.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  I think we're all looking for silver linings, and I think it makes clear how much of the science is unfolding as we navigate the crisis. Another piece of reporting on that front is The New York Times report that suggests that there were as many as 10,000 infections in New York at the beginning of March. What do you make of some of the news reporting and some of the studies that show that it was here much earlier than we thought?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CUOMO</emphasis>:  Well, look, it's an eye-opener. I think it's important because we have to do a retrospective on this because I'm afraid it's not only in the past. It's going to be in the future. They've been talking about a possibility of a global pandemic for many, many years, but it never really happened. And until it happens, it doesn't really get people's attention, and it's not actualized. But now, look, we're learning. When they say that China has a virus last November, last December, then I think the flares have to go up at that point because if China has a virus, that virus is going to get on a plane. It's going to go to Europe.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CUOMO</emphasis>:  It's going to get on another plane. It's going to come to New York. It's going to come to California. So they're now saying that the virus was here in February, maybe January. So all these actions we're taking in March, the horse is out of the barn.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Well, and your message this week, we talked as you were leaving a meeting with President Trump -- was testing, testing, testing. At this point, how does that fit into your strategy moving forward or any attempt to open up the state? It seems to me like it's a snapshot. It's a moment in time. But without it, it's hard to understand how you even draw up plans for doing anything close to normal.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CUOMO</emphasis>:  Yeah. Nicolle, it's snapshot, but then it's snapshot, snapshot, snapshot, right? And you put those snapshots together, and you have a motion picture. Reopening, reopening. All right. The only guideposts you have on reopening are the virus infection, which you can only find from testing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CUOMO</emphasis>:  The calibration is always going to be we want to reopen as fast as possible, yes. But we want to make sure we don't increase the virus spread. The only way you can find that out and calibrate it and gauge it is if you are testing. So you take a snapshot. We took a snapshot today. OK, it was 20 percent. It was 14 percent statewide. Now let's see how that progresses, how that changes. If people show the same discipline, you start to reopen. You have a little more activity. The weather is getting warm. Watch the gauge. Watch the meter.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Yeah.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CUOMO</emphasis>:  And the meter is the virus inspection that you see from the testing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  You went to see the President to ask for some sort of a partnership. Can you talk about what you got and if there's been any follow-up since you were at the White House this week?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CUOMO</emphasis>:  Yeah. There's been a lot of back-and-forth on testing. Everybody says we have to test, right? It's now been left up to the states, and there was a back-and-forth. Do the states test? Does the federal government test? The federal government stands up at the briefings, and they talk about what they're doing on testing, but then there's a disconnect because some people say it should be left to the states.  </p><p>      So I just wanted to iron it out so to speak. This is a new frontier, this whole testing. Between the states and the federal government, who does what? Who does what? I have the private labs in my state. I have about 300 commercial labs. I can regulate them. I can administer the testing planning, the tracing operation, which is also extensive. But the manufacturers of the lab equipment can't get the supplies, so they can't provide it to my commercial labs. That supply chain for the national manufacturers that should be the responsibility of the federal government. Let them figure out how to deal with China or South Korea.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Did they commit to doing that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CUOMO</emphasis>:  Yes, yes, and that was the division of responsibility. So the feds will take that piece. I will take the front-end piece. The states will be responsible for the testing. They will be responsible for the supply chain to the national manufacturers so my labs get the test kits and the reagents, and we agreed to a very aggressive plan of doubling the number of tests we're now taking from 20,000 to 40,000 tests, which are the maximum capacity for my commercial labs.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Mitch McConnell today basically left it to the states to also pay for themselves and if they can't, to file for bankruptcy. You had some strong words for him. Do you care to elaborate?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CUOMO</emphasis>:  Look, this is just one of the dumb ideas of all time, and pardon my bluntness. But I don't know what else you say about it. First, everyone said, the House passed a bill, did not have funding for state and local governments in it. Everybody said don't worry, don't worry, don't worry. We'll do it in the next bill.  </p><p>      As soon as the Senate passes it, Mitch McConnell comes out and he says he's not interested in it. The states should declare bankruptcy, right? They want to get the economy running. Do you really want to have states across this nation declaring bankruptcy? You want to see that stock market go through the cellar? Let a state or a couple of states declare bankruptcy. You want to see the economy in this nation suffer in a way that it won't come back for years? Let states declare bankruptcy. I mean from an economic point of view, it was bizarre. And then to say that reimbursing states for coronavirus costs is a bailout of the blue states, these are states that lost thousands of people. It's not red or blue. Is there ever a moment in this country, in Washington, when these guys are going to stop playing politics? Even with people dying from the coronavirus, he's going to say, well, they died in blue states, so they're Democrats.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Yeah.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CUOMO</emphasis>:  I mean they're Americans who died. Just at one point this corrosive partisanship has to stop. And if it doesn't stop when it comes to coronavirus, it will never stop.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  I want to ask you about the personal toll this is taking on you. I worked for George W. Bush on 9/11, and there was nothing that moved him more than the courage and the sacrifice and the service of the first responders, especially folks who were working down at ground zero for months and years. And I wonder if there's a parallel there, what this has been like for you to be in contact with the hospitals in crisis. One was described as apocalyptic as it neared the peak. To be advocating on behalf of health care workers who have been called everything from hoarders to liars by the folks down in Washington. And just the toll, I mean the toll on our state. I live in New York City, on my city. How has that affected you?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CUOMO</emphasis>:  You know, I'm not even sure I've figured that out, Nicolle. I can tell you this. When the pressure is on, not just in this situation, as a society, as a collective, but you really see what people are made of when the pressure is on, right? You see the good, the bad, and the ugly. You see some people who you thought were better just crumble. And then you see people who you didn't expect anything from who actually rise to the occasion. I think you're seeing both extremes here. You see people who really got scared and ran away, and then you have people who have shown such courage and resilience. These nurses, these doctors who are in these emergency rooms, I don't know how they did it day after day after day. I ordered hospitals to increase capacity by 50 percent. So every hospital was at 150 percent. The emergency rooms were packed. People were petrified. They didn't know what this was, coronavirus, right? It reminded me of the early days of HIV. Nobody knew what it was. Nobody wanted to go near it. But these people got up every day. The outpouring from across the nation reminded me of 9/11.  </p><p>      You know, after 9/11, you had people from across the country just show up in New York.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Yeah.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CUOMO</emphasis>:  Just to help. I can't tell you how many beautiful letters I've gotten, how many phone calls, how many gifts, how many cards that just break your heart, the beauty of the American people. So you have both, right? You have the worst, and you have the best, and you get the strength from the best to keep going. And they give you the courage and the inspiration to deal with the worst. But it is a -- look, it's been every day for about two months, right? And the human toll, the death toll, you know, we went through 9/11, as you mentioned. 2,700 people died. We're at 15,000 deaths now. So living with that every day takes a tremendous, tremendous toll.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Governor Cuomo, thank you for joining us. Thank you for spending some time with us tonight. We're grateful for your time.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CUOMO</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Brian, I thought it was so striking when he said you see the worst and you see the best.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  What if I had told you on 9/12 something would come along in a generation and kill more people in New York? It is unbelievable. The virus doesn't discriminate. The virus doesn't pick the politicians that it's going to call upon in this death and absence to be leaders, but here's a guy who has emerged, three-term Governor of New York, the second Governor Cuomo of New York.  </p><p>      Coming up, Richard Engel reports on the countries that are managing at least thus far to start to tame this coronavirus.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  And two doctors will tell us if we can do it here. Don't go away. We'll be right back.  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  Welcome back. And as countries around the world struggle to control the spread of this coronavirus, researchers are rushing to develop a successful vaccine as we've been discussing. But as much our country remains under these stay-at-home orders, other countries have managed to control the virus enough to start to re-emerge. One thing they all seem to have in common is extensive testing. Our Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel has that story.  </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RICHARD ENGEL, NBC NEWS CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over)</emphasis>:  Scientists have warned time and time again that this coronavirus hollowing out world capitals can't be defeated without a vaccine. But several nations have proven it can be tamed.  </p><p>Germany is already opening again, but it only came after months of countermeasures. Germany, with a large population, a quarter of the U.S., found a three-part formula to choke off the virus, and it's not very complicated. Honesty, testing, and isolating the sick. While President Trump downplayed the virus as just a nasty cold in the early weeks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES</emphasis>:  It's a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ENGEL</emphasis>:  Chancellor Angela Merkel took the exact opposite approach, leveling with Germans in March that 70 percent of them could become infected. Germany began testing extensively. By now it's tested twice as many people per capita as the United States. And that wasn't rocket science either. The tests aren't complicated to make, and they've been available internationally for a while. In early March, I visited a lab in Germany, a company called Qiagen was making testing machines.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ENGEL (on camera)</emphasis>:  This will tell you if they have the coronavirus, if they don't have the coronavirus, and what they probably do have, what they really have?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE</emphasis>:  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it will tell you that in just one hour.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ENGEL (voice-over)</emphasis>:  There were hundreds of these testing machines already in the United States at the time, but they didn't get approval from the FDA to turn them on until nearly a month after my visit.  </p><p>      Germany didn't lose that critical time, and now Germany is delivering care directly to people who need it so they can stay isolated. It's a program called the corona taxi, but really it's just old-fashioned house calls. And it's not Germany. South Korea and the United States had their first confirmed COVID cases on the same day in January. Yet by March 8th, South Korea had done 700 times more tests per capita than the United States, which only recently caught up. And South Korea has been doing aggressive contact tracing using mobile phones and making the data available so people know where the hot spots are.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE</emphasis>:  Right now across the street, there would be a store that the patient had visited on April 4th.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ENGEL</emphasis>:  The United States these days reports tens of thousands of new virus cases a day. South Korea today reported eight. Dr. Irwin Redlener is the Director of Columbia University's Center of Disaster Preparedness and an NBC Analyst.  </p><p>      (On camera) When you look at how the United States has rallied in times of national crisis, during World War II when all the factories were converted into making war machines, what happened this time? We seem to have been unable to rise to this challenge on a government level.  </p><p>      DR. IRWIN REDLENER, DIRECTOR OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY'S CENTER OF </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DISASTER PREPAREDNESS</emphasis>:  Yeah. Well, without being too political about this, what happened was Donald Trump. We had a President come into office that made a habit of misrepresenting facts and reality. So what the public got and what governors and mayors got was a very disorganized series of untruths, misstatements, and so on that created a tremendous amount of confusion.  </p><p>      (END VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ENGEL</emphasis>:  There isn't a secret plan for taming COVID-19. It's obvious, be honest, test, isolate the sick and vulnerable, and do it without vacillating or theater. Some countries have done it. The U.S. has not. Brian, Nicolle.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  It's an unbelievably simple and painful truth to talk about it, we're joined now by Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, infectious diseases physician and Medical Director for the Special Pathogens Unit at Boston Medical Center. And Dr. Vin Gupta, Pulmonologist and Global Health Policy Expert. Dr. Gupta, I'll start with you. Can we catch up? I mean, is it too late for us to do what South Korea and Germany have done?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DR. VIN GUPTA, MSNBC MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR</emphasis>:  Absolutely, Nicolle, we can absolutely catch up. But I think, you know, here's the thing about something that Mr. Engel didn't manage, which Italy, which Wuhan, which other countries, South Korea, implemented successfully in parallel with testing. That was strict social distancing measures. There was none of this patchwork approach in Georgia, tattoo parlors are going to open up, and in New York and Washington State, we're going to be really regimented. There was none of that.  </p><p>      And so let's be honest here. We need that approach, that policy consistent across all 50 states with scaling in home testing. So you talked about the drive-through they were doing in South Korea, the van that was doing these swab-and-sends. We need more of that. We need more saliva testing at home, more send-in swabs of nasal tests at home. We need to make it easier because we have bottlenecks that currently exist. But we also need social distancing. We need it now.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  Dr. Bhadelia, when we are able to rely on doctors and nurses and put a case in your hands and ask you to change with circumstances the medical industry in our country has proven remarkably able to turn on a dime. When it's become known that patients sometimes do better on their stomachs, when it's become known that young adults are having a problem with stroke. Medicine's moving in that direction to try to address both of those, but I guess you can only do so much and you depend on the data coming in.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DR. NAHID BHADELIA, MSNBC MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR</emphasis>:  We do. You know, I think underlying all of this response is a strong network of physicians, of scientists that are actually in real time communicating with each other about these phenomenon. So we need the official structure, the research infrastructure that allows us to share this data. But it's not just the scientists and the doctors taking care of the patients. Hospitals are sharing their experiences about how to decontaminate respirators to use them again.  </p><p>      There's only so much of a limit we can reach to. But just circling back to the testing point, there was data yesterday that said the earliest deaths in the United States were actually two cases in California a whole two weeks before the one in Washington State that was noticed. That means this disease was here since January in multiple cases as was mentioned in the northeastern modeling study. If that's the case, we were missing the forest from the trees. We were still testing people with just travel history to China. So part of this is the testing is important for the individual, but moving forward, if we don't have an idea of how big the problem is, where the clusters are, where the hot spots are, how are we going to have any kind of strategy to control anything once society opens?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Dr. Bhadelia, if I could follow up, to your point, The New York Times also reporting tonight that there were 10,000 cases in New York and 23,000 cases in five of the largest cities by March 1st, which is much earlier than the whole country was shut down and practicing social distancing. I wonder what moving forward we do to sort of address those blind spots of the past. What have we learned from the things that we missed in February and March?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BHADELIA</emphasis>:  I think that one of the major things of course is that there are little details. You know, you just can't say testing kits are available. There are little details along the entire pathway that make it impossible for us to get a picture of where the disease is, right? To do a test, you need a health care worker with personal protective equipment, with a swab, with the viral media that keeps the virus on the swab alive, all the way to everything that's needed in the laboratory.  </p><p>      There are so many pinch points, all of which as Governor Cuomo said are actually applicable to national supply chains that haven't been answered. But beyond that, we need a strategy for how we will efficiently test people, not just immediately everybody who needs it, but over time, over time as we continue to loosen criteria, going back to the same population and retesting them. What's the strategy? And a huge part of this is going to be identifying hot spots. There were studies this week that showed that huge percentage of patients in homeless shelters from multiple cities have high rates of this infection without realizing that they have it. Those are exactly the hot spots we're looking for, and that kind of surveillance over time is going to be necessary.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  Dr. Gupta, it seems like I ask you at least once a week the following question, which I've found to be true thus far. Is your ability to get a test still largely dependent on your zip code, where you live and where you are on the social scale in terms of income?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GUPTA</emphasis>:  Yes. And, you know, I mean one thing to note is a lot of people are consuming telemedicine, telehealth. The ecosystem of primary health care is changing to be more connected. But here's the thing. To actually get to a physician or to a provider to potentially see if you need a test, you need a smartphone. You can't just have a phone conversation for that interaction to be reimbursed. And so it's not going to be provided. So these racial disparities we talk about, we could have an easy fix. Let's get rid of the smartphone requirement, the audio/visual component. Let's allow people to just chat on the phone, see if they meet certain criteria to get a test, or let's scale up home testing. They're doing it here in Seattle. Let's do it for the country.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Dr. Gupta, you mentioned disparity. There's also a real racial disparity in terms of who is paying some of the highest cost in terms of loss of life in cities like Chicago, Mayor Lightfoot said she was shocked when the first round of data came through. And I think of as, oh, 70 percent of the people who died in Chicago are African Americans and they represent a much smaller percentage than 70 percent in the city of Chicago. What's being done on the science and medicine side to serve the communities hardest hit?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DR. VIN GUPTA, GLOBAL HEALTH POLICY EXPERT</emphasis>:  Well, Nicolle, I mean, I think on the science side, we are trying to understand, are there other drivers other than what we know is already common, that across the socioeconomic spectrum, there are inequalities. And health care access, and you tend to have more -- you see more pre-existing lung disease, heart disease amongst those that don't have access to care.  </p><p>      So is it as simple as that, which is a complicated socioeconomic social problem we've been wrestling with for a long time? Are there genetic drivers? We're trying to figure that piece out. So there are some unknowns there, but there's clearly health equity, health access issues that are driving poor outcomes in certain segments of society.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BRIAN WILLIAMS, MSNBC HOST</emphasis>:  Just in the last break, I read a tweet that I sent to a physician friend of mine in the Twin Cities. It reads, telemedicine is now just medicine. It is very true. It still involves human doctors and two of the best have been our guests here in this segment tonight, Dr. Nahid Bhadelia and Dr. Vin Gupta. Our thanks as we always, thank you for coming on and finding time to take our questions.  </p><p>      Coming up for us, more of Savannah's interview with Bill Gates. How he rates our federal government's response to the pandemic and why the U.S. should continue to support the World Health Organization. And we'll hear his response to becoming a right-wing target of conspiracy theories.  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  We are back into the final part of what was a fascinating conversation, Savannah Guthrie asks Bill Gates here about the decision to withhold funding from the World Health Organization and the many good ideas he says might come out of what we're living through.  </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GUTHRIE</emphasis>:  I know that you do your best to stay out of politics, and I'll try to respect that. But I do wonder how you assess the response of our government in general, what grade you give. What is your view of how the federal government, how the states have responded to this crisis and where they could do better?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Well, you would have expected the U.S. not to have such widespread disease. The CDC is the best in the world. We'll have plenty of time to go back and look at, you know, what happened before the disease hit that we haven't rehearsed. You know, that retrospective work, you know, this is not the time for it. Now, it's to get these drug trials going, you know, studying which opening up policies work well, get the contact tracing going. You know, it's a tough situation but, you know, this is where we find ourselves and, you know, we've got to end it as quickly as possible.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GUTHRIE</emphasis>:  The president has said that he's going to put funding for the World Health Organization on hold. Your wife, Melinda Gates, also your partner in this work, has said that that was a mistake. What effect do you think that will have right now, pulling that funding in the midst of a pandemic, and what's your view of that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Well, I'm hopeful that the U.S. that historically is by far the biggest supporter of WHO. And, you know, reducing childhood deaths. You know, the U.S. was a leader in smallpox eradication. I'm hopeful that we won't cut that money off. In fact, you know, WHO needs more resources during this time to step up to their role of international coordination.  </p><p>      And so, you know, although, you know, no one gets a perfect score in this thing, WHO is very, very important, and I hope the review will say, look, WHO, we're with you. You know, when it's over, we'll look at how you can do even better. But the world needs to help here, and usually U.S. leadership helps the world deal with crises. The world wants the U.S. to play that role in terms of research and funding and collaboration.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GUTHRIE</emphasis>:  Unfortunately, we do live in a time where disinformation abounds, and sometimes bad facts go viral. And you, yourself, have been a victim of that recently in the darkest corners of the internet. Some have even suggested that you were behind the pandemic. We don't need to dignify those conspiracy theories, but I just wonder what you think about that and what your reaction is to that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Well, you know, at one level, it's serious. At one level, it's, you know, so bizarre it's hard to believe. You know, our foundation works on vaccines that have saved lives, millions and millions of lives. And that idea that we should have health equity globally, we should use the latest science, you know, we stand for that and, you know, we ought to be willing to withstand some criticism if it's based on facts.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GUTHRIE</emphasis>:  Let's talk about the world going forward. I've given a lot of thought to this, and I'm sure you have too, about what's changed, and possibly what's changed forever. It's an economic question. It's a health question. It's a philosophical question. Dr. Fauci said the other day, I think he was half joking, that maybe handshaking is a thing of the past now or should be. Have you thought about what's changed forever?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  I do think some of the digital approaches that were catching on anyway have been accelerated. You know, even I'm surprised that doing these meetings digitally for a lot of things works pretty well. You know, so business travel may get reduced even in normal times. You know, the idea that we really need experts in government, and they need to think through these scenarios to protect us, including, you know, for any future pandemic. I think that'll be so clear to people that this time we will prepare for the next pandemic.  </p><p>      You know, beyond that, you know, everybody hopes that the cause they believed in before this happened somehow it fits in. So, you know, I think the speculation is great. I think it will be a lot of change. I hope it's more about the world working together to solve big, big problems.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GUTHRIE</emphasis>:  Yes, you've likened this fight against the coronavirus to a world war except for this time we're all on the same side. We're all fighting the same thing, this virus. How hopeful are you about ingenuity? You know, we saw innovation after World War II, incredible leaps in technology. Is this that kind of opportunity as well?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Well, I definitely think in terms of some of the health approaches, you know, making vaccines cheap and quickly, coming up with new classes of drugs that can address these things, the speed with which diagnostics can get out and, you know, sharing what you're seeing through symptoms on the cellphone internet basis. There's going to be some amazing innovation, and that will make us less vulnerable.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GUTHRIE</emphasis>:  Well, that's a hopeful note to end on, but I also have to ask you, you're home as well. I know you're working on behalf of the Gates Foundation, so your self-isolation is not equal to ours. I guess you're not watching \"Tiger King\" on Netflix or eating too much. But, what are you doing with the extra time you may find yourself with these days?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Well, my daughter did get me to watch \"Tiger King\", you know, at night, a little distraction is allowed even though it's a busy time. You know, thank goodness the internet both brings us information and brings us entertainment and lets us do these meetings online. You know, online schooling, some place is good, not good. But, you know, we're, you know, crammed into less space, but there's some virtues to that in terms of, you know, being together as we deal with something that is, you know, shocking and completely unexpected.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GUTHRIE</emphasis>:  Bill Gates, thank you so much for your time. We really appreciate it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GATES</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      (END VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  Nicolle, think of it. At a time when income inequality has been right there, a front-burner issue in our country, and we're watching the effects of it as so many people get crushed.  </p><p>      We have featured tonight in a two-hour special two billionaires. What do they have in common? They made their money in tech. They are giving the money they made in their adult business lives away, and they are heavily involved in this fight. We have also learned that when this is over, what we're going to have in common is a used face mask and we all will have seen \"Tiger King\".  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  I had nightmares about the snakes in the mailbox after one episode. But I have to say those two that we featured are doing a lot. They're going to have to do more. I mean, this is going to be a brutal, brutal, brutal economic -- period of economic despair, to be blunt, for --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  Oh yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  -- people all over the world, not just in this country. And so I applaud their efforts. Everyone, everyone, we -- it is going to be a brutal reality. The things that we have to do to protect our communities and protect our loved ones are going to have really, really devastating economic impacts. They're going to lead to economic insecurity, and we have to address that with the same sort of fervor, the same sort of moonshot marshal plan that we address the pandemic. And I'm sure that we'll rise or I hope that we'll rise to that occasion as well.  </p><p>      Still ahead for us, experts agree that until there's a vaccine, testing, testing, testing, testing is our very best way to get a handle on the pandemic. Is the U.S. doing as much testing as it needs to, and do states have the materials and the capability to administer those tests? NBC's Stephanie Gosk will join us with the breakdown. And NBC technology correspondent Jacob Ward will join us on the Google-Apple partnership hoping to mobilize your mobile phone to stop the spread of the virus. We'll be right back.  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  As we've established, as you're hearing day and night, across the country, there's this urgent need for testing and contact tracing on a massive scale. And so our reporting team has the latest on the race to contain this virus.  </p><p>NBC News technology correspondent Jacob Ward reports that contact tracing apps could soon help track the spread of this in this country. But first, NBC News correspondent Stephanie Gosk has our report on testing and the road to reopening.  </p><p>      (END VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEPHANIE GOSK, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over)</emphasis>:  The battle in the fight against COVID boils down to one thing, testing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, (D) NEW YORK</emphasis>:  No one ever imagined this testing system was going to become hyper relevant to survival.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOSK</emphasis>:  A new study in Los Angeles indicates the number of people that have or had COVID-19 may be up to 55 times higher than previously known. Public health experts say it is not something states can handle alone.  </p><p>      DR. DAN HANFLING, CO-CHAIR, NATIONAL ACADEMY OF MEDICINE, </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MEDICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS</emphasis>:  To ask the states to go about finding their own solutions is a recipe for disaster.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOSK</emphasis>:  Dr. Dan Hanfling has worked on national preparedness planning programs for presidents Obama and Trump. He says the Trump administration's guidelines don't go far enough.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HANFLING</emphasis>:  It misses the mark widely because we don't have the means for either testing or contact tracing. Both critically important if we are to understand prevalence of disease. It's a fantasy to think that we're going to be able to reopen safely in the absence of those capabilities.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOSK</emphasis>:  Right now, a million people are being tested a week, a number experts say needs to triple. Vice Admiral Raquel Bono oversees Washington State's response to COVID-19. She says state labs could be processing more than twice the number of tests but lack critical supplies.  </p><p>      RET. VICE ADMIRAL RAQUEL BONO, DIRECTOR, WASHINGTON STATE</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COVID-19 HEALTH SYSTEM RESPONSE MANAGEMENT</emphasis>:  It's swabs and transport medium as well as reagent. The person who is using the swab and taking the sample also has to be in PPE.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOSK</emphasis>:  And each state is competing for these supplies.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BONO</emphasis>:  We're all pitted against each other trying to get the supplies that we know we need.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOSK</emphasis>:  Another obstacle, test accuracy, health officials tell NBC News they're seeing inaccurate diagnostic and antibody tests, showing false positives or false negatives.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BONO</emphasis>:  It is less accurate than we had hoped, and so there was a whole lot of false positives. It points out to the importance of being able to accurately and rigorously develop these tests so that we don't inadvertently put people at harm.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOSK</emphasis>:  Without testing on a massive scale, we lack a clear picture of when stay-at-home orders can be lifted. But a recent report by 48 economists and social scientists suggests it can be done quickly. Dr. Danielle Allen of Harvard University is the lead author.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DANIELLE ALLEN, HARVARD UNIVESITY PROFESSOR</emphasis>:  The best approach for economic recovery is one where we get to open and stay open. The way you open and stay open is by having the capacity to control the disease.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOSK</emphasis>:  Controlling the disease, she says, will require 5 million tests a day in order to start lifting restrictions in June, ramping up to 20 million tests a day by August.  </p><p>      But the key to getting there is national coordination. She suggests the federal government create a pandemic testing board to supervise testing, contact tracing, and supply chain issues.  </p><p>      How important is that centralized effort to having success in testing?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALLEN</emphasis>:  You really do need that centralized coordination in order to move things faster than the market itself could achieve.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOSK</emphasis>:  The argument among those who want to open up quickly is that we are going to have such dramatic economic costs in this country that it is -- the pain is not going to be worth it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALLEN</emphasis>:  The argument we make with them is that the path we're proposing gives you a stronger recovery.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOSK</emphasis>:  That plan estimates national testing, tracing and isolation would cost $15 billion a month compared to the cost of stay-at-home orders, $350 billion a month. And if no action is taken and restrictions lifted, there would be a sharp increase in deaths costing $15 to $20 trillion. The researchers say economic growth and testing go hand in hand.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALLEN</emphasis>:  This is a moment for (INAUDIBLE) America to show up. We can do this. Again, no law of physics has to be broken. It is purely a question of organizing ourselves to deliver on the capacity that we already have.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOSK</emphasis>:  Stephanie Gosk, NBC News.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JACOB WARD, NBC NEWS TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over)</emphasis>:  I'm Jake Ward in San Francisco. If we're going to reopen America, experts say we need a way to keep track of who is infected, who is not and where their paths have crossed. But we don't have enough investigators to follow each other around. A human researcher can track down the past contacts of maybe two people a day. But for the first time, we're talking about contact tracing hundreds of thousands of people.  </p><p>      DR. ART REINGOLD, EPIDEMIOLOGIST, UC BERKELEY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HEALTH</emphasis>:  Contact tracing is more than just were you in touch with Mr. Jones? Were you in 10 feet of proximity of Mrs. Smith? Technology could help with the process in a number of ways.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARD</emphasis>:  Scale is where technology can really help. Nearly all of the phones here in the United States run either Google or Apple operating systems. That's why a Google-Apple contact tracing app due out in May is such a big deal. You want to know if you've been exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID? Maybe those phones can tell you.  </p><p>      (on camera):  Let's say I go running in my neighborhood and I pass a couple of people pretty closely. Well, their phone and my phone would be registered together as part of a contact history, and then if any of them were to test positive for COVID-19, well, I might be notified that I should probably be quarantined for two weeks.  </p><p>      (voice-over):  The companies say you can choose whether to opt in. It'll use Bluetooth to detect other phones rather than the GPS data that countries like China have been using. And your information won't leave your phone unless you agree to share it. Oxford University researchers say 56 percent of the population has to use such an app for it to be effective.  </p><p>      The idea is that it's all up to you. You decide if you want to report your test results. And if you were near someone who tested positive, the app will only offer advice on what to do. But health data is extremely personal data, and even if it's kept secure, let's imagine a world where a single notification from your phone changes your life.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE</emphasis>:  To what extent are there follow-on limitations to my liberty or to my economic prosperity that comes from being tagged in this way?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARD</emphasis>:  The huge reach of these companies makes them the fastest way to monitor the nation. The question is, are we prepared for a world in which a computer program tells you whether you should stay home from work for the public good? Jake Ward, NBC News, San Francisco.  </p><p>      (END VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  So, Nicolle, the smart reporting also knows to leave us with a little hope, and these are hopeful nuggets amid a death toll you and I have just watched grow staggeringly high.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Yes, and it's the theme we keep coming back to, American ingenuity, everyone doing their part. I think that, you know, when you watch that reporting about technology, there's just a piece of me that worries that so many people will be distrustful because of the battering that our institutions have taken over the last decade of sort of American public life. So hope springs eternal. I guess we all order things on Amazon, or most of us do.  </p><p>      So there's that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  There's still more to come though from us when our MSNBC special report \"Testing and the Road to Reopening\" continues. Don't go anywhere.  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>      DR. NAJY MASRI, LSU DIRECTOR, HOSPITALIST SERVICES, OCHSNER </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MEDICAL CENTER</emphasis>:  We need more testing. We need expedited testing. We need to identify all of those individuals out there who are infected so we can get them to quarantine and self-isolate. And we need validation on that testing. We need to be able to trust a negative so that if we tell someone that they have a negative COVID test, we are comfortable that they are not infectious, that it's a true negative and they can return to society and whatever the new normal is going to be.  </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  Dr. Najy Masri in a city I love, New Orleans, Louisiana, pleading for validated tests. They passed a sad rubicund there today. The Governor John Bel Edwards announced that more people in his state have now died of coronavirus than died in Hurricane Katrina. Governor Edwards also said he hopes to start phase one of reopening Louisiana early on in the state of May. Nicolle?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  It's one thing that every single person in this country seems to agree on that more and better tests, more readily available tests, more user-friendly tests would help this country, would go a long way. The truth is right now as we sit here, Brian, we have a president who thinks the testing is just great, that it's perfect.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WILLIAMS</emphasis>:  Yes, that's a problem. I -- it all goes back to Crimson Tide for me. Even though Denzel was -- Gene Hackman was mean to Denzel, but that's a subject for another time. Gene Hackman as captain of the submarine decided to hold a missile drill during a kitchen fire. He said that's the best time to hold a missile drill. We're having a kitchen fire that could consume the house. I worry about the missile drill. I worry, God forbid, about anything worse, and we have to all hope that the election is secured coming up in November.  </p><p>      For us, for now, these are all topics for another time. That's going to do it for our two hours coverage.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WALLACE</emphasis>:  Thanks for joining us tonight. \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" starts right now.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YRS-1KT1-JDPT-T1BJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY):  After you do the testing, states have a second big task put together an army of tracers who then trace each person tested positive.</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  This is an MSNBC special report \"Testing and the Road to Reopening.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRIAN WILLIAMS, MSNBC HOST:  Well, good evening. Brian Williams here with you, along with Nicolle Wallace.</p><p>And over the course of the next two hours, we're going to examine two very important steps to reopening our country -- coronavirus testing on a massive scale and contact tracing.</p><p>Right now, over 868,000 people have tested positive for coronavirus in our country with more than 49,000 souls gone. Today, we learned another 4.4 million Americans filed jobless claims last week, bringing the five-week total to more than 26 million people that we know of.</p><p>One key in returning people to work, getting back to normal is, of course, widespread testing. So, tonight, we're going to look at the importance of both diagnostic and antibody testing and hear about the number of tests that we need to safely reopen.</p><p>NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBC HOST:  And, Brian, another important issue is contact tracing. We're going to be hearing a lot about this. It's the process of tracking down everyone who may have been exposed to the virus. We'll go through how it's conducted and why it's absolutely critical to stopping new infections.</p><p>Tonight, we'll be joined by three key people working hard to fight coronavirus. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York, and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.</p><p>We also have a full team of correspondents standing by with the latest reporting here in the U.S. and overseas, as well as the team of doctors.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Bill Gates sat down for an exclusive conversation with Savannah Guthrie earlier today to talk about where he thinks we are right now in this pandemic, the dangers of states reopening too quickly, a possible resurgence of the virus in the fall and winter, and his thoughts about a prediction he made back in 2015 in a TED Talk that a future pandemic was indeed coming.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE, NBC NEWS ANCHOR:  You have made fighting infectious disease really your life's work -- at least the second half of your life. Just where we are right now in terms of this pandemic? That famous saying, are we at the end of the beginning or at the beginning of the end?</p><p>GATES:  Well, I wish I could say that we're halfway through, but I don't think so. It takes time to make a vaccine. The social distancing that we've had to engage in has huge economic effects. It's very tough on people. There's a lot about the disease we don't understand.</p><p>So we know that we can get out of this, but it's going to be awhile before things go back to normal.</p><p>GUTHRIE:  You talk a lot about not the new normal but the new semi-normal and what that might look like for us, the time before we get a vaccine but when we can start to return to some activity.</p><p>How do you envision that?</p><p>GATES:  We're going to learn as we go, and the key thing is to have these tests where they have been prioritized and you're getting quick results. That will allow you to change the policies before you get back to filling up the hospitals and having a high death rate.</p><p>And so sadly, we can't promise people as we open up that we won't have to go back, that some locations or some activities will see that they're causing a spread and have to restrict those things even more. You know, I'm hopeful the high priority things like a lot of manufacturing, construction and even schools will fit into this but, you know, we're going to learn as we go and we need to watch.</p><p>GUTHRIE:  Let's talk about what's happening right now. There are states like Georgia poised to reopen some parts of their economy and even nail salons they're talking about, tattoo parlors. Is there anywhere in the country that's ready for that kind of reopening?</p><p>GATES:  Well, the intensity of the infection has varied a lot across the country, but we know that if you go fully back to normal mixing, that then you get on to that exponential growth curve. And so, it's a question of prioritization.</p><p>In Asia, they have been fairly slow to reopen. They require masks. They don't even have all the employees going in yet.</p><p>The good news is that they've largely avoided a rebound. The numbers and disease will tell us where to go on this. You know, I'm afraid we'll have some people and some states that move too quickly and have to back off.</p><p>GUTHRIE:  We are a nation of states, and it's going to be a patch work response, it has to be because every state will do something differently or at least it seems as it's shaping up that way. How do you think that plays out?</p><p>GATES:  So, the U.S. is kind of unusual that the federal level, you know, has said that testing is fine when in fact, for opening up, you know, we're at least a factor of three or four below where you would really catch things in a quick way. Some states will sadly give us the information about what -- what is too much and, you know, citizens will also very pretty widely in terms of some aren't going to come out and do much for a long time, whereas a few, you know, are like chomping at the bit or maybe aren't adhering to what the restrictions are.</p><p>You know, it's too bad that -- to have it be a political thing. Adherence, you know, ideally would be widespread that we understand that you can infect other people. So, it's not just your individual choices but you're affecting all of society in how you behave.</p><p>GUTHRIE:  And as you well know and understand, the issue is, is that there is a very severe economic price to be paid for these public health measures that are so important, and that's the balance that's trying to be struck here. Some people are going to look and say, did we overreact? And others will look at it and say, perhaps we underreacted.</p><p>Where do you come down on that?</p><p>GATES:  Well, certainly, everybody looking back wishes they had reacted faster. If you catch this at a very low level like a few countries did, you know, because you got community testing and contact tracing, then you don't have to do the shutdown. As people see the infection rates, as they see the stories about the emergency rooms, you know, they weren't going to be traveling to theme parks or, you know, going to sports stadiums.</p><p>And so, it's a false choice to say it's the government who is solely responsible for this economic activity going down. People, you know, fear getting sick themselves or infecting their parents and so we just didn't have a choice.</p><p>GUTHRIE:  You famously talked about a coming pandemic at this nightmare scenario back in 2015 on the heels of the Ebola crisis and you said in your TED Talk that you worried about a virus that could be 1,000 times worse. Is this that virus?</p><p>GATES:  Yes. The human to human respiratory spread is the scariest scenario and I showed a simulation in that 2015 talk that, you know, showed you could have tens of millions of deaths and trillions of economic costs. So, this did. It's a respiratory virus that is causing that damage. And so, it's a nightmare.</p><p>You know, I wish it had come, you know, five or ten years later than governments might have done the preparation to move quickly like a few governments did and the technologies would have been further along.</p><p>GUTHRIE:  I went back and looked at the numbers. On March 1st, we had had two deaths in this country. Thirty days later on April 1st, we had 4,800 deaths. Today, as we sit here, not even 30 days later, we have 47,000 deaths.</p><p>Can you just talk about that exponential growth and exponential decline?</p><p>GATES:  Yes, so if I'm infecting two other people for every active infection, you know, then over the course of the month, you can go from a small part of the population to a very large part, and so clearly, in March, the infections were exponential and then you have about an 18-day leg between infections and deaths.</p><p>And so, April, exactly as you said, we've had huge numbers of deaths. If we maintain the isolation, the deaths out in the summer would be very, very small. Very quickly, it can go from barely detectable to huge and, you know, I think people will be shocked that in some locations, the ICU will hardly have anyone in it at all within the next few months.</p><p>GUTHRIE:  I read that you said that we are nearing the peak in this country, hopefully. And then you've also said we're really not anywhere near the end of this, and I can't be alone in thinking, well, how does that work out? How can we be almost at the peak but yet so far away from a solution and an end to this and a return to normal?</p><p>GATES:  Well, the vaccine is the most likely solution, and so, great scientists are rushing to get that done. And actually, I've been surprised how quickly they're moving. There is a number that have even begun that human testing that's key there.</p><p>And so, it could be that in a year, we have lots of a vaccine and then once you get it out to lots of people, then you -- you're -- you have enough community immunity that you won't see this widespread problem again.</p><p>You know, we have this first peak in the U.S. With the right policies, we'll have small, some areas that go back and have infections, but we shouldn't see countrywide anything like this but a -- you know, miracle therapeutic or the vaccine are the only thing that we'll be able to say, OK, we're back to normal.</p><p>GUTHRIE:  I do want to ask you about the second wave, this notion that the virus could come back in the fall. We heard the CDC director saying it could be even potentially more difficult in the fall and winter because the seasonal flu will also be going on.</p><p>Dr. Fauci said he's certain there will be a second wave of this virus.</p><p>What's your perspective on how bad it could be?</p><p>GATES:  Well, if we're -- if we're still being careful about social contact, if we're wearing masks, if we're doing distancing where possible, if we got the testing capacity up, I'm hopeful that the fall will not be nearly as bad as this first peak. The flu is a challenge because the symptoms are common enough that knowing exactly who to test, you know, which are people with symptoms, will be a little confused because of all those flu infections that will be taking place.</p><p>But the vigilance of not getting too relaxed when you're seeing pictures of empty ICUs, that's not intuitive because you could get back on that ramp.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Part of Bill Gates' conversation with Savannah Guthrie.</p><p>Here is a billionaire willing to spend his own money and a billionaire who spends his time thinking about this.</p><p>WALLACE:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And when Savannah asks him is this that virus, he calmly answers yes.</p><p>WALLACE:  Yes, to hear him use the words nightmare scenario, I was watching it and thinking about just how long Bill Gates has been a giant in the public health arena. He was talking about the sorts of things people were afraid of when I was in government.</p><p>I mean, it's been reported by \"The New York Times\" this week that George W. Bush became obsessed with pandemics and had all of us reading some of the same books that I know Bill Gates talked about in that TED Talk, and that this was the nightmare scenario the last three presidents were scared of. That President Obama had a team that handed this team a plan to deal with something like this. George W. Bush had done some work on that plan, too, and to hear Bill Gates talk about that brings back all that muscle memory that you just don't see in this more sort of chaotic administration on full display.</p><p>But there were a lot of other science headlines in there and lucky for us, we're able to get reaction from Dr. Michael Osterholm. He's the director of the Center for Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota and the author of \"Deadliest Enemy:  Our War Against Killer Germs.\"</p><p>I saw you earlier today on this network and there were so many practical pieces to what Bill Gates was saying about we don't get to normal until there are some really powerful therapies or a vaccine.</p><p>How far off is that?</p><p>MICHAEL OSTERHOLM, PHD, CENTER FOR DISEASE RESEARCH &amp; POLICY DIRECTOR:  Well, we don't know right now if we're going to have a vaccine. I just have to be very honest with you.</p><p>WALLACE:  Yes.</p><p>OSTERHOLM:  We hope we will have one, but hope is not a strategy.</p><p>Drugs will be very important in reducing the severity of illness and hope for preventing deaths, but it won't stop the transmission. People are infectious in the earliest stages of their illness even before in some cases they get sick, so the drug would come after that.</p><p>So, the epidemiology or meaning, occurrence of cases will continue to occur. And I think one of the things that's being missed here is that when we talk about, are we going to have the curve flatten, what's going to come back? Look at it this way, as we know in this country between 5 and maybe 10 percent of the population has been infected even in the metropolitan areas. You heard in New York today, it maybe 14 percent.</p><p>This virus is not going to stop transmitting among people until it hits 60 or 70 percent of the people. So, either we've got to do that with a vaccine and get them to be immune from that perspective, or they're going t get it through natural infection. That's a lot of additional cases to occur over the months a ahead.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Doctor, I will not forget the first time you and I spoke. It was in the midst of our political coverage, this virus while dangerous seemed so far off and it was a vague threat. It's now very real.</p><p>I know we're mostly talking about testing tonight, but absent any political considerations, what do you see people doing wrong right now because you know the strength of this opponent?</p><p>OSTERHOLM:  Well, first of all, again, I keep looking at the 16 to 18-month course and keeping that in mind is that's what we're embarking upon. Far too many people look at this as a sprint and we're just about over. We're debating can we reopen now with the idea that's the end of it.</p><p>And in fact, we could have many, many more peaks. Those of us who study infectious disease, and I've spent the last 45 years of my life studying this very thing, we don't know if this coronavirus, will there be a big peak in the next fall? There could be. Will there just be slow burn constantly seeing infections occur like we're seeing right now in countries like Singapore and Japan that one time had it under control or will we see a series of peaks like Mr. Gates talked about? We don't know.</p><p>But we know one thing, this virus won't stop until it infects as many as 50 -- 60 to 70 percent of us. So, we have to have a battle plan not just about this week or this month or next month. We're in this for the long haul.</p><p>I unfortunately promise you, we will be having this same discussion where some form of it one year from tonight.</p><p>WALLACE:  That's such an ominous prediction. I'm sure you're correct.</p><p>But I wonder if we're not out of the gates yet in terms of being able to talk about reopening, can you just clarify what the three -- are the three legs of that stool for identifying our starting point, the diagnostic testing, the antibody testing and contact tracing. Or is there another step? It's confusing to know where we even start with a clear picture of where we are today.</p><p>OSTERHOLM:  Well, first of all, we have to do testing, but we've got to also stop talking about the way we have. We have far too many people that come on shows like this or write articles saying, test, test, test. We have to understand we have a major shortage of reagents today.</p><p>The world was not ready to suddenly supply all these test kits, and so, it's not a matter of money. It's a matter of physics. We don't have the reagents.</p><p>We have to build these manufacturing facilities to do that. Our government has not helped facilitate that. We needed a Marshall Plan to build that up.</p><p>So testing is critical. We need it. Second of all, we have to make sure that we have surge capacity in our hospitals so when the testing shows us that the cases are starting to come back, that we can handle them. We don't want to overload the hospitals.</p><p>And, by the way, that surge capacity doesn't mean just beds, it also means protecting our health care workers.</p><p>The third thing that we absolutely must do in all of this is then do what you just said about contract tracing, have a way so we can constantly try to hold this virus down. Until you have those kinds of things in place, it's very hard to reopen and not get caught with suddenly this very rapidly rising number of cases.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, Doctor, you just said the magic phrase to me, the Marshall Plan and I'll do it one better -- a Manhattan Project. If this is indeed going to be the event that perhaps marks the rest of our adult lives as Americans, why not?</p><p>OSTERHOLM:  Well, I actually in an op-ed piece I wrote in \"The New York Times\" almost month ago, which I predicted we'd have a shortage right now that we see if reagents, I actually did call for a Manhattan Project, an intellectual one, that covers all these issues. My Marshall Plan is just about testing reagents.</p><p>But I think you're right on the mark, Brian. We need to bring together that right now and what this country is missing is a core. We're missing a leadership component that can bring everyone together without regard to partisan politics, without regard to age, race, gender, location.</p><p>You know, I said on your network just three weeks ago that one day, it wouldn't be a red and bluish shoe. It would be a COVID color issue. Look what's happened in the Midwest right now. All those red counties are turning COVID because of what we're seeing happen.</p><p>So I think that you're exactly right. We need a Manhattan Project, where one, tell the truth. We need straight talk. What's really happening, what's not?</p><p>I don't want to hear another time we have enough testing. The 50 governors will tell you, that's not true. We need to understand, are we going to have more cases or not? Don't tell the public we're not going to have any more cases because they may go away with more sunshine or warm. There's no truth to that. That's like defying gravity.</p><p>So, I think that's part of what will make a Manhattan Project work if we all come together to solve a common problem that is this virus and it's going to be here for awhile, so let's get on with it right now doing that.</p><p>WALLACE:  Dr. Michael Osterholm, I think it might solve more than coronavirus to give people something like that to work on together, you're right. That's what people are hungry for.</p><p>Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>OSTERHOLM:  Thank you very much.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  We have much -- we have much more of our colleague Savannah Guthrie's exclusive conversation with Bill Gates throughout this program tonight.</p><p>WALLACE:  The Gates Foundation is in the thick of that hunt for a vaccine. Up next, hear what Bill Gates says he feels hopeful that we may be on the optimistic side of the timeline to find a vaccine and the unprecedented steps now being taken right now to find a vaccine and mass produce it.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Plus, does Bill Gates think the U.S. is doing a good job at testing presently? That's all next.</p><p>There is much more still ahead this hour. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo will join us to talk about the day he learned this stunning fact -- more than one in five New York city residents tested found to have antibodies to the virus, meaning far more New Yorkers might have had coronavirus without becoming sick or showing symptoms.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Welcome back to our special broadcast tonight.</p><p>In a new op-ed in \"The Washington Post\" today, Bill Gates who talked about World War II as the galvanizing event for his parents' generation writes this and we, quote:  There is one big difference between a world war and a pandemic. All of humanity can work together to learn about the disease and develop the capacity to fight it.</p><p>He argues the U.S. needs to invest in creating new approaches to expand testing and contact tracing to track the spread of the virus before we can safely, in quotes, reopen our country.</p><p>WALLACE:  Only about 1.4 percent of the U.S. population has been tested coronavirus so far and there is little organization from the federal government on contact tracing.</p><p>In part two of Savannah's exclusive interview, Bill Gates details some of the innovations in testing that his foundation is working on, his assessment of why the U.S. is lagging in testing and why he says he's optimistic about the timeline for a vaccine.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GUTHRIE:  The Gates Foundation is very much at the forefront on this hunt for a vaccine. We've all learned by now the timeline, the hopeful timeline of 12 to 18 months. That is a highly expedited track, a fast track for a vaccine. Can you explain why?</p><p>GATES:  For most diseases, you don't pursue more than one or two approaches. Here, because of all the incredibly negative effects, the sooner the better. And so, we're going to pursue -- there are 100 efforts, but maybe 10 of those should get the resources to build factories and go full speed ahead, and it will be multiple companies, which that's not typical, and it will be at risk because those are billions of dollars that when they're successful will save the trillions of dollars of broad damage.</p><p>So, you know, the best scientists working hard on this and I'm hopeful. In fact, in the last few weeks, I've seen signs that we may get to the optimistic side of that time projection.</p><p>GUTHRIE:  What about treatments? That's -- you said, if we could get a miracle drug, a miracle treatment that would, you know, take care of it for 95 percent of people, then maybe we could all be at the baseball game next spring. You've said you don't think that's likely.</p><p>GATES:  Yes.</p><p>GUTHRIE:  But where is the hope on the treatment track?</p><p>GATES:  Well, there's a huge number of compounds being tried. The public knows about remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, you know, whenever one it is, you know, most will fail but a few I think will have substantial effects.</p><p>As far as I know, none of the trials have had that kind of, you know, amazing result where you stop it early and go, hey, we have to get this out. So, you know, even if those lead compounds do not have significant benefit, believe me, there are so many good ideas that some will.</p><p>So, no one should put their hope behind a particular approach -- and hydroxy, it may have a modest effect. That's all, by the end of May, will be clear.</p><p>GUTHRIE:  I think if there has been any area that seems to have been bedeviling during this crisis, it's testing.</p><p>I wonder how you assess how the U.S. has done in testing, and what seems to be the issue here? What's the breakdown? What's the problem? What should have been better?</p><p>GATESS:  Well, many countries decided that at the national level, they would orchestrate the testing and, you know, do that very early so all of these machines called PCR machines would be used 24 hours a day, and you would be testing the right people. That hasn't happened in the United States. It might not happen.</p><p>But, you know, the access to tests is just, you know, chaotic. If you're a low income person, your access is less than a high income person.</p><p>We should focus on the symptomatics and the contact tracing.</p><p>So, I don't know whether this will get organized. The capacity is going up but, you know, when you get the results late, it's almost worthless and so we can improve. A number of invasions have been driven. We were involved in proving that the patient doing the self-swab just at the tip of the nose, that's as good as having the medical worker do the more invasive procedure.</p><p>GUTHRIE:  Yes, I was going to ask about that because there seems to be a couple of innovations on the horizon, both having to do with at home testing. One, the nasal swab, you do yourself and I think you send it off to a lab. And the other, you've said is kind of like a home pregnancy test and that you do the test --</p><p>GATES:  Yes.</p><p>GUTHRIE:  -- and you get the results right there. Different method, I know.</p><p>GATES:  That's right. The swab (inaudible) the self-swab is in common, whether you send it back for the PCR processing hopefully very quickly, less than 24 hours, or if you simply take the swab, put it in liquid, pour the liquid on to a piece of paper, and then it turns one color if you have virus and another color if you don't. If we can make those in large numbers and it has the right sensitivity, then we could open testing up and go beyond symptomatics.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Until we have a vaccine, as I understand it, you have to be able to test and you have to be able to contact trace. In other words, you're in a community and you're watching to see where the cases flare up and then you trace all the contacts so you can kind of encircle them and contain them.</p><p>And there's a lot of talk right now about, A, whether or not we have sufficient resources, human resources to do that contact tracing, and B, whether there's a big role for big tech, your old business, to play. Cell phones, that kind of thing. How do you see that coming to pass?</p><p>GATES:  Well, South Korea was able to avoid a countrywide shutdown by doing the testing and contact tracing in a professional way. Now, they did it in a way that they grabbed your data immediately without your opting into that. And so the exact approach to do that contact tracing in the U.S. and other western countries may not be identical, but the basic approach, even if it's mostly through interview, is very important to keep the numbers down.</p><p>And so we're going to have to hire up people to do those interviews, and this is another case where the federal government really hasn't stepped up to it. So it's mostly the state saying, OK, who's volunteering to do this, and can software facilitate it? So this is a new effort that will make a big difference.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Brian, it's amazing how much your question about a Manhattan project comes through and just what Bill Gates is talking about. And he's not pulling any punches in terms of the deficiencies and inadequacies of the federal effort, but there is such an outsized role for technology, for innovation, for sort of human ingenuity if you listen to him talk about the contact tracing.</p><p>That's basically going to be investigative epidemiology. I mean, that's going to be people that have the ability to sit down and try to get to the bottom of every single contact that a human being had. It really is a massive, massive undertaking.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Also, opens your mind to what could be possible. Science, when it works best, merges with medicine and makes our lives easier. What he was describing there is a home pregnancy test. In effect, it's the same process and chemical makeup, only this would tell you if you're COVID positive or COVID negative in real-time right before your eyes.</p><p>Well, be that as it may, we're going to move on and get more on this topic of contact tracing. You've seen pictures. We've showed some of them briefly. Folks in some countries, in Asia, swiping QR codes, having their temperatures taken before they get on a train or enter a building. How might that work in a country like ours? How soon could it be put to work in a country like ours? Steve Kornacki crunches numbers for a living, and he's with us to explain.</p><p>WALLACE:  And Brian, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is actually helping New York coordinate a testing and tracing effort, which Governor Cuomo described today as a super-ambitious undertaking. Michael Bloomberg joins us to talk about that, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  It is called contact tracing, and suddenly, for good reason, it is the phrase of the moment, a very important tool to be used in this fight against coronavirus. It does what it indicates. It takes all of the people you've come in contact with, all of those you can remember and identify, and goes back through them to see if any of them have tested positive.</p><p>The World Health Organization estimates that each infected person can in turn infect multiples making the coronavirus more contagious than the seasonal flu. If we want to flatten the curve, which is happening through social distancing, but also shrink the curve and prevent infections, keep that number down, we have to have a nationwide system for this contact tracing.</p><p>WALLACE:  Joining us now to explain more about contact tracing is our colleague, Steve Kornacki.</p><p>STEVE KORNACKI, NBC NEWS NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Nicolle, that's right. And contact tracing really is - it is a tool to be used for the reopening phase. If you're going to try to reopen the country in some way without having a vaccine, what you want to be able to do is be in a position to find any potential outbreak and to nip it in the bud. And here's what's involved in that process. Let's take you through how contact tracing works.</p><p>So let's say it's a person who suddenly develops symptoms and says I might have the coronavirus. Well, in this ideal world of rapid testing and mass testing and contact tracing, that person can very quickly, maybe in a drive-through clinic, maybe a walk in clinic, maybe at an at-home test, get a test, get an answer, and find out if they're infected.</p><p>And if that person is infected, then the next step is to talk to and to work with a public health official, a contact tracer, and to try to go through the people that - the infected person, the people that person has been around for the last couple days, basically the people that person has been around within six feet and for at least 10 minutes. That's the key. Somebody you've been around for at least 10 minutes of time within a space of at least - of inside six feet.</p><p>So let's say, that opened up 12 possibilities or so. The infected person works with the contact tracer to find out and to identify who all of those people might be. And then the contact tracer will then get in touch with each one of those people and will simply say you have been in proximity to, you have potentially been exposed to the coronavirus.</p><p>And then the idea there is, again, rapid, widely available testing. Get those people tested. Find out, do any of them have it. If a couple of them have it, you repeat this whole process. Get them in touch with a contact tracer, get in touch with that person's circle of associates, circle of contacts, and you basically try to find out who in all these sort of succeeding rings here has been exposed, who has it, get them quarantined, nip it in the bud. So that is the idea to be doing this all over the country.</p><p>There are some obvious major challenges that go with this. First of all, obviously - look, asymptomatic. You can be walking around with this and not know you have it. That's obviously a major challenge. Resources, think about that. A contact tracer trying to track down all of these people who a person has been in contact with. That is resource intense. That takes time.</p><p>A person who has been infected will give you some names they've been in touch with, but it could also be, hey, I was with some people in a subway, I have no idea who they were. Contact tracer has got to help try to figure that out, and of course, privacy concerns here too. There are all sorts of tools of technology that can be used to help in this GPS tracking, surveillance cameras and that sort of thing. How much are we comfortable with though actually being used for a tracking program, a contact tracing program.</p><p>WALLACE:  Steve Kornacki, it's so interesting how protective that six-foot barrier is, that for contact tracing, you rule out everyone who you kept a safe distance from and you only rule in the people that broke that sort of six-foot mote around you. It's fascinating stuff. Thank you, Steve.</p><p>KORNACKI:  Thanks.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Nicolle, it is the medical equivalent of that small nick in your windshield that can oftentimes--</p><p>WALLACE:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  --spider across your entire field of view and envelope your world looking for it. But enough mixed metaphors.</p><p>Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has volunteered to develop a coronavirus contact tracing program just to help the incredibly hard hit New York, New Jersey, Connecticut tri-state area. Bloomberg Philanthropies, which of course was founded by him, will contribute $10.5 million as well as tech support and assistance to this program. I spoke with the former mayor earlier tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Mr. Mayor, tell us about this program. You have decided to spend your money on in the area of public health.</p><p>MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR:  Well, the virus is what's called a communicable disease compared to cancer, which is a non-communicable disease. You get cancer from smoking or being obese or other things, but you don't catch it from somebody else. A communicable disease, you catch from somebody else. So if you don't want to get it, you just got to make sure you don't go near anybody who has it.</p><p>Now, problems are we don't know who has it. The tests aren't perfect. It's not easy to get a test yet. And once they have it, you've got to depend on them to tell you whether they have it so you know to stay away, or stay away from everybody. And a lot of people will wear a mask. That stops you from breathing the same air that the other person who may have the disease does. You have to stop touching the same things other people touch. If they are infected, you have a very good chance of getting it.</p><p>So what we're trying to do here is to find out for somebody that has the disease, who else they talked to or were close to, and then warn those people and get them to stay in an area where nobody else can catch it from them if they've caught it. And you'll know after two weeks whether that person has caught it from the first person.</p><p>And so what we're trying to do is put together a group, which will interview people that have it, say where were you, who did you talk to, and then go to those people and say you were exposed to somebody that had it and so you've got to take precautions. You don't want to get - if you've caught it, you don't want to give it to your loved ones. So, go and lock yourself away for two weeks because you're with somebody who had it and because you don't want to give it to somebody else.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  This is such a vast spider web of contacts. If you and I saw each other in a Manhattan restaurant and one of us learned later that we were asymptomatic but carriers, think of the vortices that would come off that one meeting.</p><p>I have to ask, given the state of the economy, is this going to mean jobs for people who need the work, need the money as contact tracing interviewers and researchers?</p><p>BLOOMBERG:  Well, we've already done the worst part. We closed the restaurants. So the question now is to find out who you've talked to other than that. If you take the subway, it's pretty hard to get the names of everybody that's on the subway car.</p><p>If you had been in a restaurant, the restaurant probably doesn't know the names of everybody else that was there. But if you just go around and stay out of the stores and stay out of the restaurants and stay in your home, you will not be touching anybody else who might have it.</p><p>If you do touch somebody and you find out, then we can go and interview those people. You could interview the doorman in your building. You could interview the delivery man that brought the food to your house. And we need people to do that, and they have to be trained and they have to know which questions to ask, and we want to make sure they don't divulge any personal information.</p><p>But this is serious stuff, and particularly, as you get older, it's more serious. Older people have a higher incidence of getting very sick and even dying from this disease. Younger people aren't immune, but they're more secure than if they were older.</p><p>And somebody like my age, it's really as much more serious thing than if you were the age of my daughter, or my grand kid is even less likely to catch it from somebody. But Johns Hopkins is designing a program. We're trying to hire the people and train them and then make sure that they get the information to the right people and not to the wrong people.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  And final question, you mentioned testing. We're talking about testing on this broadcast here tonight. Absent rock-solid big numbers in testing, how much of a crimp does that put in this effort you've decided to finance?</p><p>BLOOMBERG:  Well, the fewer people that have it, the less likely somebody else is to be with somebody who has it. So what you're trying to do is keep everybody that has it off the streets and then nobody else will have it. And if the people that have it get over it, then they can go back on the streets but they won't infect anybody.</p><p>So it's not going to make it any worse, quite the contrary. If you can tell people that they were close to somebody who had it, they can then isolate themselves, which they would not do if you didn't have this process. So that's why Governor Cuomo is in favor of this program, and that's why we've had Johns Hopkins design the program.</p><p>And if we can get it to work in New York, we can get it to work elsewhere as well. But every country is trying to do the same thing. Some have a more professional program than others. We want to make sure that New York has a very professional program run by people who are well trained and who you can depend upon, not to take your personal information and give it to people who shouldn't have it.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Former Mayor of the City of New York, former presidential candidate, Mike Bloomberg, thank you for spending a few minutes with us tonight.</p><p>BLOOMBERG:  You're welcome, Brian. Good to be with you. Stay safe.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Coming up for us, another break in our broadcast. As we go to break, think of this. We've had a doctor tonight warn us we're still going to be having this conversation a year from now. We will ask a noted epidemiologist if she agrees with that, after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Welcome back to this special broadcast we're calling \"Testing and the Road to Reopening.\" We're happy to be joined tonight by a frequent guest of ours, Dr. Anne Rimoin, Professor of Epidemiology at the UCLA School of Public Health.</p><p>And Anne, I have to ask you, we had Dr. Osterholm with us earlier in the hour. Scary, yes, but also he's very much a realist. He said that a year from tonight, we'll still be having this conversation. Do you agree with that? And talk about whether or not you see that if we launched a Manhattan project on testing, would that still sadly be the case?</p><p>DR. ANNE RIMOIN, UCLA SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSOR OF EPIDEMIOLOGY:  It's anybody's guess where we're going to be. And everything is also speculation at this point. I do think that if we had a Manhattan project type of situation, we would be doing better. But here's the thing. Everybody is working on vaccines now. And I think we do have a lot of work happening. We have a lot of work on vaccines. We have a lot of work on therapeutics. Things are moving forward.</p><p>So I think we need to take heed of what's happened in other countries. We need to really focus on getting our act together, moving forward. But we can't forget it is not just tests - it's not just vaccines and therapeutics, it's going to ride on also contact tracing and testing. We need everything. And we need to be hitting it at all fronts.</p><p>WALLACE:  Dr. Rimoin, I know you just said it's speculative, but I think that's all people have at this point. And one of the conversations I have most often is speculation and wondering when our kids will ever go back to school. And I'm not asking to speculate on when that could happen, especially in a place like New York, but how would that happen? Which of these pieces would need to be in place for states to open schools again?</p><p>RIMOIN:  Well, this is the question that everybody is asking, and it's not just an issue for schools. When you say schools, I think many people are thinking about children that are from elementary school through high school. But it's a big question for universities, colleges around the country as well. So these are very big questions.</p><p>The likelihood is we're not going to have a vaccine by the summer. And so at least for the foreseeable future, we have to rely on these blunt measures like social distancing, contact tracing, and making sure that we have testing in place. And if we had all of those things in place, we could start opening up. But you really need, as Dr. Osterholm said, you really need to be able to identify who is sick, who is not, and to be able to make decisions based on that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Dr. Rimoin, California, of course--</p><p>RIMOIN:  I know it didn't really answer your question exactly, but the--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I was just going to say California is Nicolle's--</p><p>RIMOIN:  --I didn't answer it exactly, but--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  --is Nicolle's home state. Sorry. This satellite delay during these times is tough to deal with. California is Nicolle's home state. Your governor, Governor Newsom, is almost alone among governors in talking about the COVID architecture that has to follow this pandemic and the way we need to do things differently publicly. Talk about that.</p><p>RIMOIN:  Well, I think that Governor Newsom has been ahead of the pack. He's laid out a very clear plan that includes testing as a corner piece and is really pushing forward. California, I was very, very heartened today to see that California is going to be testing asymptomatic people as well - focusing on testing asymptomatic - looking for asymptomatic infection in health care workers and first responders and essential workers.</p><p>I think that this is going to go a long way in terms of curbing the spread. But I think that having this kind of plan that is so straightforward that we have benchmarks and that everybody understands what the rules of the game are, is just really a fantastic way of moving forward. And I think that that's why California has really - has succeeded.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Dr. Anne Rimoin, thank you for joining us from L.A. tonight.</p><p>We have much more still ahead. In our next hour, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on what it will take to reopen the City and State of New York. And after his high-profile meeting at the White House this week, the Governor tells us what the federal government has agreed to do to help with testing.</p><p>WALLACE:  Plus, an in-depth look at how some countries are managing to rein in coronavirus. Today, German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned, quote, \"We are still at the beginning of this crisis.\" Yet Germany is starting to open up. Richard Engel will join us with a new report about how they're able to do that.</p><p>Stay with us. You're watching MSNBC's special report, \"Testing and the Road to Reopening.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Brian Williams and Nicolle Wallace back with you. As we cross the top of the hour into what is normally \"The 11th Hour\" broadcast, we're continuing our special coverage of the critical roles that testing and contact tracing will play in what is called reopening our country eventually.</p><p>A number of states are eager to reopen amid troubling unemployment news. Tomorrow, the State of Georgia will begin opening some businesses even though experts have warned it's too early and even though the President publicly broke with Georgia's Governor just a few hours ago. Meanwhile, other states are taking things, as they must, much slower.</p><p>WALLACE:  This hour we'll hear from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose state is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak here in the U.S. New York just released the results of an antibody testing study today. We'll also have much more from our exclusive interview with Microsoft Co-Founder Bill Gates. He responds to the conspiracy theory that blames him for the entire pandemic. But first here are his thoughts on where things stand.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  My first question is just where we are right now in terms of this pandemic. That famous saying, are we at the end of the beginning or at the beginning of the end?</p><p>GATES:  Well, I wish I could say that we're halfway through, but I don't think so. It takes time to make a vaccine. The social distancing that we've had to engage in has huge economic effects. It's very tough on people. There's a lot about the disease we don't understand. So we know that we can get out of this, but it's going to be a while before things go back to normal.</p><p>WALLACE:  You famously talked about a coming pandemic, this nightmare scenario back in 2015 on the heels of the Ebola crisis, and you said in your Ted Talk that you worried about a virus that could be a thousand times worse. Is this that virus?</p><p>GATES:  Yes. The human-to-human respiratory spread is the scariest scenario, and I showed a simulation in that 2015 talk that, you know, showed you could have tens of millions of deaths and trillions of economic cost. So this fits. It's a respiratory virus that is causing that damage. The vaccine is the most likely solution, and so great scientists are rushing to get that done. And actually I've been surprised how quickly they're moving. There's a number that have even begun that human testing that's key there. And so it could be that in a year, we have lots of a vaccine. The economic effects have been, you know, unbelievable, and so we'll be dealing with that literally for years to come. But a, you know, miracle therapeutic or the vaccine are the only thing that we'll be able to say, OK, we're back to normal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  OK. So it turns out coronavirus spread throughout American cities undetected much, much earlier than anyone realized at the time. That's according to a new report from The New York Times. On March 1st, five major U.S. Cities, New York, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, and Seattle had a total of 23 confirmed cases of coronavirus. But a model of infection rates by researchers at northeastern university estimates that there could have actually been 28,000 undetected infections in those cities by that time.</p><p>This visualization from The Times shows the remarkable disparity between those two sets of numbers. The model suggests that by the time New York had its first confirmed case of coronavirus, there were already 10,000 people infected. This new information as New York begins work on a plan for widespread testing and contact tracing.</p><p>Joining us now, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Governor, we meet on a day of some pretty momentous political headlines and pretty momentous science headlines. I want to start with the science. You shared some information in your briefing today about antibodies. Is that encouraging? And can you take us through how many New Yorkers, based on this early study, may have already been exposed to COVID?</p><p>CUOMO:  Yeah. No, it was surprising. We had about -- we did a 3,000-person survey, which is fairly extensive all throughout the state. Statewide, it was about 14 percent of the people had the antibodies, which means 14 percent of the people had the virus. That's about 2.7 million people in our state. New York City was close to 20 percent.</p><p>WALLACE:  Wow.</p><p>CUOMO:  Which was surprising. Yeah. So the good news is these are people who have the antibodies. They can then donate blood for the convalescent plasma, which is probably one of the best therapeutic that show promise.</p><p>The other good news is, you know, we talk about the death rate. We have about 15,000 people who have died in New York. That's hospitalizations and nursing homes. That doesn't count the at-home deaths which we still have to calculate. But it's 15,000 on a much larger denominator. So the death rate is like 0.5. The normal flu is like 0.1 to 0.3. So it gives a perspective on the death rate if you're looking for a silver lining.</p><p>WALLACE:  I think we're all looking for silver linings, and I think it makes clear how much of the science is unfolding as we navigate the crisis. Another piece of reporting on that front is The New York Times report that suggests that there were as many as 10,000 infections in New York at the beginning of March. What do you make of some of the news reporting and some of the studies that show that it was here much earlier than we thought?</p><p>CUOMO:  Well, look, it's an eye-opener. I think it's important because we have to do a retrospective on this because I'm afraid it's not only in the past. It's going to be in the future. They've been talking about a possibility of a global pandemic for many, many years, but it never really happened. And until it happens, it doesn't really get people's attention, and it's not actualized. But now, look, we're learning. When they say that China has a virus last November, last December, then I think the flares have to go up at that point because if China has a virus, that virus is going to get on a plane. It's going to go to Europe.</p><p>WALLACE:  Right.</p><p>CUOMO:  It's going to get on another plane. It's going to come to New York. It's going to come to California. So they're now saying that the virus was here in February, maybe January. So all these actions we're taking in March, the horse is out of the barn.</p><p>WALLACE:  Well, and your message this week, we talked as you were leaving a meeting with President Trump -- was testing, testing, testing. At this point, how does that fit into your strategy moving forward or any attempt to open up the state? It seems to me like it's a snapshot. It's a moment in time. But without it, it's hard to understand how you even draw up plans for doing anything close to normal.</p><p>CUOMO:  Yeah. Nicolle, it's snapshot, but then it's snapshot, snapshot, snapshot, right? And you put those snapshots together, and you have a motion picture. Reopening, reopening. All right. The only guideposts you have on reopening are the virus infection, which you can only find from testing.</p><p>WALLACE:  Right.</p><p>CUOMO:  The calibration is always going to be we want to reopen as fast as possible, yes. But we want to make sure we don't increase the virus spread. The only way you can find that out and calibrate it and gauge it is if you are testing. So you take a snapshot. We took a snapshot today. OK, it was 20 percent. It was 14 percent statewide. Now let's see how that progresses, how that changes. If people show the same discipline, you start to reopen. You have a little more activity. The weather is getting warm. Watch the gauge. Watch the meter.</p><p>WALLACE:  Yeah.</p><p>CUOMO:  And the meter is the virus inspection that you see from the testing.</p><p>WALLACE:  You went to see the President to ask for some sort of a partnership. Can you talk about what you got and if there's been any follow-up since you were at the White House this week?</p><p>CUOMO:  Yeah. There's been a lot of back-and-forth on testing. Everybody says we have to test, right? It's now been left up to the states, and there was a back-and-forth. Do the states test? Does the federal government test? The federal government stands up at the briefings, and they talk about what they're doing on testing, but then there's a disconnect because some people say it should be left to the states.</p><p>So I just wanted to iron it out so to speak. This is a new frontier, this whole testing. Between the states and the federal government, who does what? Who does what? I have the private labs in my state. I have about 300 commercial labs. I can regulate them. I can administer the testing planning, the tracing operation, which is also extensive. But the manufacturers of the lab equipment can't get the supplies, so they can't provide it to my commercial labs. That supply chain for the national manufacturers that should be the responsibility of the federal government. Let them figure out how to deal with China or South Korea.</p><p>WALLACE:  Did they commit to doing that?</p><p>CUOMO:  Yes, yes, and that was the division of responsibility. So the feds will take that piece. I will take the front-end piece. The states will be responsible for the testing. They will be responsible for the supply chain to the national manufacturers so my labs get the test kits and the reagents, and we agreed to a very aggressive plan of doubling the number of tests we're now taking from 20,000 to 40,000 tests, which are the maximum capacity for my commercial labs.</p><p>WALLACE:  Mitch McConnell today basically left it to the states to also pay for themselves and if they can't, to file for bankruptcy. You had some strong words for him. Do you care to elaborate?</p><p>CUOMO:  Look, this is just one of the dumb ideas of all time, and pardon my bluntness. But I don't know what else you say about it. First, everyone said, the House passed a bill, did not have funding for state and local governments in it. Everybody said don't worry, don't worry, don't worry. We'll do it in the next bill.</p><p>As soon as the Senate passes it, Mitch McConnell comes out and he says he's not interested in it. The states should declare bankruptcy, right? They want to get the economy running. Do you really want to have states across this nation declaring bankruptcy? You want to see that stock market go through the cellar? Let a state or a couple of states declare bankruptcy. You want to see the economy in this nation suffer in a way that it won't come back for years? Let states declare bankruptcy. I mean from an economic point of view, it was bizarre. And then to say that reimbursing states for coronavirus costs is a bailout of the blue states, these are states that lost thousands of people. It's not red or blue. Is there ever a moment in this country, in Washington, when these guys are going to stop playing politics? Even with people dying from the coronavirus, he's going to say, well, they died in blue states, so they're Democrats.</p><p>WALLACE:  Yeah.</p><p>CUOMO:  I mean they're Americans who died. Just at one point this corrosive partisanship has to stop. And if it doesn't stop when it comes to coronavirus, it will never stop.</p><p>WALLACE:  I want to ask you about the personal toll this is taking on you. I worked for George W. Bush on 9/11, and there was nothing that moved him more than the courage and the sacrifice and the service of the first responders, especially folks who were working down at ground zero for months and years. And I wonder if there's a parallel there, what this has been like for you to be in contact with the hospitals in crisis. One was described as apocalyptic as it neared the peak. To be advocating on behalf of health care workers who have been called everything from hoarders to liars by the folks down in Washington. And just the toll, I mean the toll on our state. I live in New York City, on my city. How has that affected you?</p><p>CUOMO:  You know, I'm not even sure I've figured that out, Nicolle. I can tell you this. When the pressure is on, not just in this situation, as a society, as a collective, but you really see what people are made of when the pressure is on, right? You see the good, the bad, and the ugly. You see some people who you thought were better just crumble. And then you see people who you didn't expect anything from who actually rise to the occasion. I think you're seeing both extremes here. You see people who really got scared and ran away, and then you have people who have shown such courage and resilience. These nurses, these doctors who are in these emergency rooms, I don't know how they did it day after day after day. I ordered hospitals to increase capacity by 50 percent. So every hospital was at 150 percent. The emergency rooms were packed. People were petrified. They didn't know what this was, coronavirus, right? It reminded me of the early days of HIV. Nobody knew what it was. Nobody wanted to go near it. But these people got up every day. The outpouring from across the nation reminded me of 9/11.</p><p>You know, after 9/11, you had people from across the country just show up in New York.</p><p>WALLACE:  Yeah.</p><p>CUOMO:  Just to help. I can't tell you how many beautiful letters I've gotten, how many phone calls, how many gifts, how many cards that just break your heart, the beauty of the American people. So you have both, right? You have the worst, and you have the best, and you get the strength from the best to keep going. And they give you the courage and the inspiration to deal with the worst. But it is a -- look, it's been every day for about two months, right? And the human toll, the death toll, you know, we went through 9/11, as you mentioned. 2,700 people died. We're at 15,000 deaths now. So living with that every day takes a tremendous, tremendous toll.</p><p>WALLACE:  Governor Cuomo, thank you for joining us. Thank you for spending some time with us tonight. We're grateful for your time.</p><p>CUOMO:  Thank you.</p><p>WALLACE:  Brian, I thought it was so striking when he said you see the worst and you see the best.</p><p>WALLACE:  What if I had told you on 9/12 something would come along in a generation and kill more people in New York? It is unbelievable. The virus doesn't discriminate. The virus doesn't pick the politicians that it's going to call upon in this death and absence to be leaders, but here's a guy who has emerged, three-term Governor of New York, the second Governor Cuomo of New York.</p><p>Coming up, Richard Engel reports on the countries that are managing at least thus far to start to tame this coronavirus.</p><p>WALLACE:  And two doctors will tell us if we can do it here. Don't go away. We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Welcome back. And as countries around the world struggle to control the spread of this coronavirus, researchers are rushing to develop a successful vaccine as we've been discussing. But as much our country remains under these stay-at-home orders, other countries have managed to control the virus enough to start to re-emerge. One thing they all seem to have in common is extensive testing. Our Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel has that story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RICHARD ENGEL, NBC NEWS CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Scientists have warned time and time again that this coronavirus hollowing out world capitals can't be defeated without a vaccine. But several nations have proven it can be tamed.</p><p>Germany is already opening again, but it only came after months of countermeasures. Germany, with a large population, a quarter of the U.S., found a three-part formula to choke off the virus, and it's not very complicated. Honesty, testing, and isolating the sick. While President Trump downplayed the virus as just a nasty cold in the early weeks.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It's a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for.</p><p>ENGEL:  Chancellor Angela Merkel took the exact opposite approach, leveling with Germans in March that 70 percent of them could become infected. Germany began testing extensively. By now it's tested twice as many people per capita as the United States. And that wasn't rocket science either. The tests aren't complicated to make, and they've been available internationally for a while. In early March, I visited a lab in Germany, a company called Qiagen was making testing machines.</p><p>ENGEL (on camera):  This will tell you if they have the coronavirus, if they don't have the coronavirus, and what they probably do have, what they really have?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it will tell you that in just one hour.</p><p>ENGEL (voice-over):  There were hundreds of these testing machines already in the United States at the time, but they didn't get approval from the FDA to turn them on until nearly a month after my visit.</p><p>Germany didn't lose that critical time, and now Germany is delivering care directly to people who need it so they can stay isolated. It's a program called the corona taxi, but really it's just old-fashioned house calls. And it's not Germany. South Korea and the United States had their first confirmed COVID cases on the same day in January. Yet by March 8th, South Korea had done 700 times more tests per capita than the United States, which only recently caught up. And South Korea has been doing aggressive contact tracing using mobile phones and making the data available so people know where the hot spots are.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right now across the street, there would be a store that the patient had visited on April 4th.</p><p>ENGEL:  The United States these days reports tens of thousands of new virus cases a day. South Korea today reported eight. Dr. Irwin Redlener is the Director of Columbia University's Center of Disaster Preparedness and an NBC Analyst.</p><p>(On camera) When you look at how the United States has rallied in times of national crisis, during World War II when all the factories were converted into making war machines, what happened this time? We seem to have been unable to rise to this challenge on a government level.</p><p>DR. IRWIN REDLENER, DIRECTOR OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY'S CENTER OF DISASTER PREPAREDNESS:  Yeah. Well, without being too political about this, what happened was Donald Trump. We had a President come into office that made a habit of misrepresenting facts and reality. So what the public got and what governors and mayors got was a very disorganized series of untruths, misstatements, and so on that created a tremendous amount of confusion.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ENGEL:  There isn't a secret plan for taming COVID-19. It's obvious, be honest, test, isolate the sick and vulnerable, and do it without vacillating or theater. Some countries have done it. The U.S. has not. Brian, Nicolle.</p><p>WALLACE:  It's an unbelievably simple and painful truth to talk about it, we're joined now by Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, infectious diseases physician and Medical Director for the Special Pathogens Unit at Boston Medical Center. And Dr. Vin Gupta, Pulmonologist and Global Health Policy Expert. Dr. Gupta, I'll start with you. Can we catch up? I mean, is it too late for us to do what South Korea and Germany have done?</p><p>DR. VIN GUPTA, MSNBC MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR:  Absolutely, Nicolle, we can absolutely catch up. But I think, you know, here's the thing about something that Mr. Engel didn't manage, which Italy, which Wuhan, which other countries, South Korea, implemented successfully in parallel with testing. That was strict social distancing measures. There was none of this patchwork approach in Georgia, tattoo parlors are going to open up, and in New York and Washington State, we're going to be really regimented. There was none of that.</p><p>And so let's be honest here. We need that approach, that policy consistent across all 50 states with scaling in home testing. So you talked about the drive-through they were doing in South Korea, the van that was doing these swab-and-sends. We need more of that. We need more saliva testing at home, more send-in swabs of nasal tests at home. We need to make it easier because we have bottlenecks that currently exist. But we also need social distancing. We need it now.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Dr. Bhadelia, when we are able to rely on doctors and nurses and put a case in your hands and ask you to change with circumstances the medical industry in our country has proven remarkably able to turn on a dime. When it's become known that patients sometimes do better on their stomachs, when it's become known that young adults are having a problem with stroke. Medicine's moving in that direction to try to address both of those, but I guess you can only do so much and you depend on the data coming in.</p><p>DR. NAHID BHADELIA, MSNBC MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR:  We do. You know, I think underlying all of this response is a strong network of physicians, of scientists that are actually in real time communicating with each other about these phenomenon. So we need the official structure, the research infrastructure that allows us to share this data. But it's not just the scientists and the doctors taking care of the patients. Hospitals are sharing their experiences about how to decontaminate respirators to use them again.</p><p>There's only so much of a limit we can reach to. But just circling back to the testing point, there was data yesterday that said the earliest deaths in the United States were actually two cases in California a whole two weeks before the one in Washington State that was noticed. That means this disease was here since January in multiple cases as was mentioned in the northeastern modeling study. If that's the case, we were missing the forest from the trees. We were still testing people with just travel history to China. So part of this is the testing is important for the individual, but moving forward, if we don't have an idea of how big the problem is, where the clusters are, where the hot spots are, how are we going to have any kind of strategy to control anything once society opens?</p><p>WALLACE:  Dr. Bhadelia, if I could follow up, to your point, The New York Times also reporting tonight that there were 10,000 cases in New York and 23,000 cases in five of the largest cities by March 1st, which is much earlier than the whole country was shut down and practicing social distancing. I wonder what moving forward we do to sort of address those blind spots of the past. What have we learned from the things that we missed in February and March?</p><p>BHADELIA:  I think that one of the major things of course is that there are little details. You know, you just can't say testing kits are available. There are little details along the entire pathway that make it impossible for us to get a picture of where the disease is, right? To do a test, you need a health care worker with personal protective equipment, with a swab, with the viral media that keeps the virus on the swab alive, all the way to everything that's needed in the laboratory.</p><p>There are so many pinch points, all of which as Governor Cuomo said are actually applicable to national supply chains that haven't been answered. But beyond that, we need a strategy for how we will efficiently test people, not just immediately everybody who needs it, but over time, over time as we continue to loosen criteria, going back to the same population and retesting them. What's the strategy? And a huge part of this is going to be identifying hot spots. There were studies this week that showed that huge percentage of patients in homeless shelters from multiple cities have high rates of this infection without realizing that they have it. Those are exactly the hot spots we're looking for, and that kind of surveillance over time is going to be necessary.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Dr. Gupta, it seems like I ask you at least once a week the following question, which I've found to be true thus far. Is your ability to get a test still largely dependent on your zip code, where you live and where you are on the social scale in terms of income?</p><p>GUPTA:  Yes. And, you know, I mean one thing to note is a lot of people are consuming telemedicine, telehealth. The ecosystem of primary health care is changing to be more connected. But here's the thing. To actually get to a physician or to a provider to potentially see if you need a test, you need a smartphone. You can't just have a phone conversation for that interaction to be reimbursed. And so it's not going to be provided. So these racial disparities we talk about, we could have an easy fix. Let's get rid of the smartphone requirement, the audio/visual component. Let's allow people to just chat on the phone, see if they meet certain criteria to get a test, or let's scale up home testing. They're doing it here in Seattle. Let's do it for the country.</p><p>WALLACE:  Dr. Gupta, you mentioned disparity. There's also a real racial disparity in terms of who is paying some of the highest cost in terms of loss of life in cities like Chicago, Mayor Lightfoot said she was shocked when the first round of data came through. And I think of as, oh, 70 percent of the people who died in Chicago are African Americans and they represent a much smaller percentage than 70 percent in the city of Chicago. What's being done on the science and medicine side to serve the communities hardest hit?</p><p>DR. VIN GUPTA, GLOBAL HEALTH POLICY EXPERT:  Well, Nicolle, I mean, I think on the science side, we are trying to understand, are there other drivers other than what we know is already common, that across the socioeconomic spectrum, there are inequalities. And health care access, and you tend to have more -- you see more pre-existing lung disease, heart disease amongst those that don't have access to care.</p><p>So is it as simple as that, which is a complicated socioeconomic social problem we've been wrestling with for a long time? Are there genetic drivers? We're trying to figure that piece out. So there are some unknowns there, but there's clearly health equity, health access issues that are driving poor outcomes in certain segments of society.</p><p>BRIAN WILLIAMS, MSNBC HOST:  Just in the last break, I read a tweet that I sent to a physician friend of mine in the Twin Cities. It reads, telemedicine is now just medicine. It is very true. It still involves human doctors and two of the best have been our guests here in this segment tonight, Dr. Nahid Bhadelia and Dr. Vin Gupta. Our thanks as we always, thank you for coming on and finding time to take our questions.</p><p>Coming up for us, more of Savannah's interview with Bill Gates. How he rates our federal government's response to the pandemic and why the U.S. should continue to support the World Health Organization. And we'll hear his response to becoming a right-wing target of conspiracy theories.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  We are back into the final part of what was a fascinating conversation, Savannah Guthrie asks Bill Gates here about the decision to withhold funding from the World Health Organization and the many good ideas he says might come out of what we're living through.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GUTHRIE:  I know that you do your best to stay out of politics, and I'll try to respect that. But I do wonder how you assess the response of our government in general, what grade you give. What is your view of how the federal government, how the states have responded to this crisis and where they could do better?</p><p>GATES:  Well, you would have expected the U.S. not to have such widespread disease. The CDC is the best in the world. We'll have plenty of time to go back and look at, you know, what happened before the disease hit that we haven't rehearsed. You know, that retrospective work, you know, this is not the time for it. Now, it's to get these drug trials going, you know, studying which opening up policies work well, get the contact tracing going. You know, it's a tough situation but, you know, this is where we find ourselves and, you know, we've got to end it as quickly as possible.</p><p>GUTHRIE:  The president has said that he's going to put funding for the World Health Organization on hold. Your wife, Melinda Gates, also your partner in this work, has said that that was a mistake. What effect do you think that will have right now, pulling that funding in the midst of a pandemic, and what's your view of that?</p><p>GATES:  Well, I'm hopeful that the U.S. that historically is by far the biggest supporter of WHO. And, you know, reducing childhood deaths. You know, the U.S. was a leader in smallpox eradication. I'm hopeful that we won't cut that money off. In fact, you know, WHO needs more resources during this time to step up to their role of international coordination.</p><p>And so, you know, although, you know, no one gets a perfect score in this thing, WHO is very, very important, and I hope the review will say, look, WHO, we're with you. You know, when it's over, we'll look at how you can do even better. But the world needs to help here, and usually U.S. leadership helps the world deal with crises. The world wants the U.S. to play that role in terms of research and funding and collaboration.</p><p>GUTHRIE:  Unfortunately, we do live in a time where disinformation abounds, and sometimes bad facts go viral. And you, yourself, have been a victim of that recently in the darkest corners of the internet. Some have even suggested that you were behind the pandemic. We don't need to dignify those conspiracy theories, but I just wonder what you think about that and what your reaction is to that.</p><p>GATES:  Well, you know, at one level, it's serious. At one level, it's, you know, so bizarre it's hard to believe. You know, our foundation works on vaccines that have saved lives, millions and millions of lives. And that idea that we should have health equity globally, we should use the latest science, you know, we stand for that and, you know, we ought to be willing to withstand some criticism if it's based on facts.</p><p>GUTHRIE:  Let's talk about the world going forward. I've given a lot of thought to this, and I'm sure you have too, about what's changed, and possibly what's changed forever. It's an economic question. It's a health question. It's a philosophical question. Dr. Fauci said the other day, I think he was half joking, that maybe handshaking is a thing of the past now or should be. Have you thought about what's changed forever?</p><p>GATES:  I do think some of the digital approaches that were catching on anyway have been accelerated. You know, even I'm surprised that doing these meetings digitally for a lot of things works pretty well. You know, so business travel may get reduced even in normal times. You know, the idea that we really need experts in government, and they need to think through these scenarios to protect us, including, you know, for any future pandemic. I think that'll be so clear to people that this time we will prepare for the next pandemic.</p><p>You know, beyond that, you know, everybody hopes that the cause they believed in before this happened somehow it fits in. So, you know, I think the speculation is great. I think it will be a lot of change. I hope it's more about the world working together to solve big, big problems.</p><p>GUTHRIE:  Yes, you've likened this fight against the coronavirus to a world war except for this time we're all on the same side. We're all fighting the same thing, this virus. How hopeful are you about ingenuity? You know, we saw innovation after World War II, incredible leaps in technology. Is this that kind of opportunity as well?</p><p>GATES:  Well, I definitely think in terms of some of the health approaches, you know, making vaccines cheap and quickly, coming up with new classes of drugs that can address these things, the speed with which diagnostics can get out and, you know, sharing what you're seeing through symptoms on the cellphone internet basis. There's going to be some amazing innovation, and that will make us less vulnerable.</p><p>GUTHRIE:  Well, that's a hopeful note to end on, but I also have to ask you, you're home as well. I know you're working on behalf of the Gates Foundation, so your self-isolation is not equal to ours. I guess you're not watching \"Tiger King\" on Netflix or eating too much. But, what are you doing with the extra time you may find yourself with these days?</p><p>GATES:  Well, my daughter did get me to watch \"Tiger King\", you know, at night, a little distraction is allowed even though it's a busy time. You know, thank goodness the internet both brings us information and brings us entertainment and lets us do these meetings online. You know, online schooling, some place is good, not good. But, you know, we're, you know, crammed into less space, but there's some virtues to that in terms of, you know, being together as we deal with something that is, you know, shocking and completely unexpected.</p><p>GUTHRIE:  Bill Gates, thank you so much for your time. We really appreciate it.</p><p>GATES:  Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Nicolle, think of it. At a time when income inequality has been right there, a front-burner issue in our country, and we're watching the effects of it as so many people get crushed.</p><p>We have featured tonight in a two-hour special two billionaires. What do they have in common? They made their money in tech. They are giving the money they made in their adult business lives away, and they are heavily involved in this fight. We have also learned that when this is over, what we're going to have in common is a used face mask and we all will have seen \"Tiger King\".</p><p>WALLACE:  I had nightmares about the snakes in the mailbox after one episode. But I have to say those two that we featured are doing a lot. They're going to have to do more. I mean, this is going to be a brutal, brutal, brutal economic -- period of economic despair, to be blunt, for --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Oh yes.</p><p>WALLACE:  -- people all over the world, not just in this country. And so I applaud their efforts. Everyone, everyone, we -- it is going to be a brutal reality. The things that we have to do to protect our communities and protect our loved ones are going to have really, really devastating economic impacts. They're going to lead to economic insecurity, and we have to address that with the same sort of fervor, the same sort of moonshot marshal plan that we address the pandemic. And I'm sure that we'll rise or I hope that we'll rise to that occasion as well.</p><p>Still ahead for us, experts agree that until there's a vaccine, testing, testing, testing, testing is our very best way to get a handle on the pandemic. Is the U.S. doing as much testing as it needs to, and do states have the materials and the capability to administer those tests? NBC's Stephanie Gosk will join us with the breakdown. And NBC technology correspondent Jacob Ward will join us on the Google-Apple partnership hoping to mobilize your mobile phone to stop the spread of the virus. We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  As we've established, as you're hearing day and night, across the country, there's this urgent need for testing and contact tracing on a massive scale. And so our reporting team has the latest on the race to contain this virus.</p><p>NBC News technology correspondent Jacob Ward reports that contact tracing apps could soon help track the spread of this in this country. But first, NBC News correspondent Stephanie Gosk has our report on testing and the road to reopening.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEPHANIE GOSK, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The battle in the fight against COVID boils down to one thing, testing.</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, (D) NEW YORK:  No one ever imagined this testing system was going to become hyper relevant to survival.</p><p>GOSK:  A new study in Los Angeles indicates the number of people that have or had COVID-19 may be up to 55 times higher than previously known. Public health experts say it is not something states can handle alone.</p><p>DR. DAN HANFLING, CO-CHAIR, NATIONAL ACADEMY OF MEDICINE, MEDICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS:  To ask the states to go about finding their own solutions is a recipe for disaster.</p><p>GOSK:  Dr. Dan Hanfling has worked on national preparedness planning programs for presidents Obama and Trump. He says the Trump administration's guidelines don't go far enough.</p><p>HANFLING:  It misses the mark widely because we don't have the means for either testing or contact tracing. Both critically important if we are to understand prevalence of disease. It's a fantasy to think that we're going to be able to reopen safely in the absence of those capabilities.</p><p>GOSK:  Right now, a million people are being tested a week, a number experts say needs to triple. Vice Admiral Raquel Bono oversees Washington State's response to COVID-19. She says state labs could be processing more than twice the number of tests but lack critical supplies.</p><p>RET. VICE ADMIRAL RAQUEL BONO, DIRECTOR, WASHINGTON STATE COVID-19 HEALTH SYSTEM RESPONSE MANAGEMENT:  It's swabs and transport medium as well as reagent. The person who is using the swab and taking the sample also has to be in PPE.</p><p>GOSK:  And each state is competing for these supplies.</p><p>BONO:  We're all pitted against each other trying to get the supplies that we know we need.</p><p>GOSK:  Another obstacle, test accuracy, health officials tell NBC News they're seeing inaccurate diagnostic and antibody tests, showing false positives or false negatives.</p><p>BONO:  It is less accurate than we had hoped, and so there was a whole lot of false positives. It points out to the importance of being able to accurately and rigorously develop these tests so that we don't inadvertently put people at harm.</p><p>GOSK:  Without testing on a massive scale, we lack a clear picture of when stay-at-home orders can be lifted. But a recent report by 48 economists and social scientists suggests it can be done quickly. Dr. Danielle Allen of Harvard University is the lead author.</p><p>DANIELLE ALLEN, HARVARD UNIVESITY PROFESSOR:  The best approach for economic recovery is one where we get to open and stay open. The way you open and stay open is by having the capacity to control the disease.</p><p>GOSK:  Controlling the disease, she says, will require 5 million tests a day in order to start lifting restrictions in June, ramping up to 20 million tests a day by August.</p><p>But the key to getting there is national coordination. She suggests the federal government create a pandemic testing board to supervise testing, contact tracing, and supply chain issues.</p><p>How important is that centralized effort to having success in testing?</p><p>ALLEN:  You really do need that centralized coordination in order to move things faster than the market itself could achieve.</p><p>GOSK:  The argument among those who want to open up quickly is that we are going to have such dramatic economic costs in this country that it is -- the pain is not going to be worth it.</p><p>ALLEN:  The argument we make with them is that the path we're proposing gives you a stronger recovery.</p><p>GOSK:  That plan estimates national testing, tracing and isolation would cost $15 billion a month compared to the cost of stay-at-home orders, $350 billion a month. And if no action is taken and restrictions lifted, there would be a sharp increase in deaths costing $15 to $20 trillion. The researchers say economic growth and testing go hand in hand.</p><p>ALLEN:  This is a moment for (INAUDIBLE) America to show up. We can do this. Again, no law of physics has to be broken. It is purely a question of organizing ourselves to deliver on the capacity that we already have.</p><p>GOSK:  Stephanie Gosk, NBC News.</p><p>JACOB WARD, NBC NEWS TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  I'm Jake Ward in San Francisco. If we're going to reopen America, experts say we need a way to keep track of who is infected, who is not and where their paths have crossed. But we don't have enough investigators to follow each other around. A human researcher can track down the past contacts of maybe two people a day. But for the first time, we're talking about contact tracing hundreds of thousands of people.</p><p>DR. ART REINGOLD, EPIDEMIOLOGIST, UC BERKELEY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH:  Contact tracing is more than just were you in touch with Mr. Jones? Were you in 10 feet of proximity of Mrs. Smith? Technology could help with the process in a number of ways.</p><p>WARD:  Scale is where technology can really help. Nearly all of the phones here in the United States run either Google or Apple operating systems. That's why a Google-Apple contact tracing app due out in May is such a big deal. You want to know if you've been exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID? Maybe those phones can tell you.</p><p>(on camera):  Let's say I go running in my neighborhood and I pass a couple of people pretty closely. Well, their phone and my phone would be registered together as part of a contact history, and then if any of them were to test positive for COVID-19, well, I might be notified that I should probably be quarantined for two weeks.</p><p>(voice-over):  The companies say you can choose whether to opt in. It'll use Bluetooth to detect other phones rather than the GPS data that countries like China have been using. And your information won't leave your phone unless you agree to share it. Oxford University researchers say 56 percent of the population has to use such an app for it to be effective.</p><p>The idea is that it's all up to you. You decide if you want to report your test results. And if you were near someone who tested positive, the app will only offer advice on what to do. But health data is extremely personal data, and even if it's kept secure, let's imagine a world where a single notification from your phone changes your life.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  To what extent are there follow-on limitations to my liberty or to my economic prosperity that comes from being tagged in this way?</p><p>WARD:  The huge reach of these companies makes them the fastest way to monitor the nation. The question is, are we prepared for a world in which a computer program tells you whether you should stay home from work for the public good? Jake Ward, NBC News, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  So, Nicolle, the smart reporting also knows to leave us with a little hope, and these are hopeful nuggets amid a death toll you and I have just watched grow staggeringly high.</p><p>WALLACE:  Yes, and it's the theme we keep coming back to, American ingenuity, everyone doing their part. I think that, you know, when you watch that reporting about technology, there's just a piece of me that worries that so many people will be distrustful because of the battering that our institutions have taken over the last decade of sort of American public life. So hope springs eternal. I guess we all order things on Amazon, or most of us do.</p><p>So there's that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes.</p><p>WALLACE:  There's still more to come though from us when our MSNBC special report \"Testing and the Road to Reopening\" continues. Don't go anywhere.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. NAJY MASRI, LSU DIRECTOR, HOSPITALIST SERVICES, OCHSNER MEDICAL CENTER:  We need more testing. We need expedited testing. We need to identify all of those individuals out there who are infected so we can get them to quarantine and self-isolate. And we need validation on that testing. We need to be able to trust a negative so that if we tell someone that they have a negative COVID test, we are comfortable that they are not infectious, that it's a true negative and they can return to society and whatever the new normal is going to be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Dr. Najy Masri in a city I love, New Orleans, Louisiana, pleading for validated tests. They passed a sad rubicund there today. The Governor John Bel Edwards announced that more people in his state have now died of coronavirus than died in Hurricane Katrina. Governor Edwards also said he hopes to start phase one of reopening Louisiana early on in the state of May. Nicolle?</p><p>WALLACE:  It's one thing that every single person in this country seems to agree on that more and better tests, more readily available tests, more user-friendly tests would help this country, would go a long way. The truth is right now as we sit here, Brian, we have a president who thinks the testing is just great, that it's perfect.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, that's a problem. I -- it all goes back to Crimson Tide for me. Even though Denzel was -- Gene Hackman was mean to Denzel, but that's a subject for another time. Gene Hackman as captain of the submarine decided to hold a missile drill during a kitchen fire. He said that's the best time to hold a missile drill.

Brian Williams here with you, along with Nicolle Wallace.</p><p>And over the course of the next two hours, we`re going to examine two very important steps to reopening our country -- coronavirus testing on a massive scale and contact tracing.</p><p>Right now, over 868,000 people have tested positive for coronavirus in our country with more than 49,000 souls gone. Today, we learned another 4.4 million Americans filed jobless claims last week, bringing the five-week total to more than 26 million people that we know of.</p><p>One key in returning people to work, getting back to normal is, of course, widespread testing. So, tonight, we`re going to look at the importance of both diagnostic and antibody testing and hear about the number of tests that we need to safely reopen.</p><p>NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBC HOST: And, Brian, another important issue is contact tracing. We`re going to be hearing a lot about this. It`s the process of tracking down everyone who may have been exposed to the virus. We`ll go through how it`s conducted and why it`s absolutely critical to stopping new infections.</p><p>Tonight, we`ll be joined by three key people working hard to fight coronavirus. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York, and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.</p><p>We also have a full team of correspondents standing by with the latest reporting here in the U.S. and overseas, as well as the team of doctors.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Bill Gates sat down for an exclusive conversation with Savannah Guthrie earlier today to talk about where he thinks we are right now in this pandemic, the dangers of states reopening too quickly, a possible resurgence of the virus in the fall and winter, and his thoughts about a prediction he made back in 2015 in a TED Talk that a future pandemic was indeed coming.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE, NBC NEWS ANCHOR: You have made fighting infectious disease really your life`s work -- at least the second half of your life. Just where we are right now in terms of this pandemic? That famous saying, are we at the end of the beginning or at the beginning of the end?</p><p>GATES: Well, I wish I could say that we`re halfway through, but I don`t think so. It takes time to make a vaccine. The social distancing that we`ve had to engage in has huge economic effects. It`s very tough on people. There`s a lot about the disease we don`t understand.</p><p>So we know that we can get out of this, but it`s going to be awhile before things go back to normal.</p><p>GUTHRIE: You talk a lot about not the new normal but the new semi-normal and what that might look like for us, the time before we get a vaccine but when we can start to return to some activity.</p><p>How do you envision that?</p><p>GATES: We`re going to learn as we go, and the key thing is to have these tests where they have been prioritized and you`re getting quick results. That will allow you to change the policies before you get back to filling up the hospitals and having a high death rate.</p><p>And so sadly, we can`t promise people as we open up that we won`t have to go back, that some locations or some activities will see that they`re causing a spread and have to restrict those things even more. You know, I`m hopeful the high priority things like a lot of manufacturing, construction and even schools will fit into this but, you know, we`re going to learn as we go and we need to watch.</p><p>GUTHRIE: Let`s talk about what`s happening right now. There are states like Georgia poised to reopen some parts of their economy and even nail salons they`re talking about, tattoo parlors. Is there anywhere in the country that`s ready for that kind of reopening?</p><p>GATES: Well, the intensity of the infection has varied a lot across the country, but we know that if you go fully back to normal mixing, that then you get on to that exponential growth curve. And so, it`s a question of prioritization.</p><p>In Asia, they have been fairly slow to reopen. They require masks. They don`t even have all the employees going in yet.</p><p>The good news is that they`ve largely avoided a rebound. The numbers and disease will tell us where to go on this. You know, I`m afraid we`ll have some people and some states that move too quickly and have to back off.</p><p>GUTHRIE: We are a nation of states, and it`s going to be a patch work response, it has to be because every state will do something differently or at least it seems as it`s shaping up that way. How do you think that plays out?</p><p>GATES: So, the U.S. is kind of unusual that the federal level, you know, has said that testing is fine when in fact, for opening up, you know, we`re at least a factor of three or four below where you would really catch things in a quick way. Some states will sadly give us the information about what -- what is too much and, you know, citizens will also very pretty widely in terms of some aren`t going to come out and do much for a long time, whereas a few, you know, are like chomping at the bit or maybe aren`t adhering to what the restrictions are.</p><p>You know, it`s too bad that -- to have it be a political thing. Adherence, you know, ideally would be widespread that we understand that you can infect other people. So, it`s not just your individual choices but you`re affecting all of society in how you behave.</p><p>GUTHRIE: And as you well know and understand, the issue is, is that there is a very severe economic price to be paid for these public health measures that are so important, and that`s the balance that`s trying to be struck here. Some people are going to look and say, did we overreact? And others will look at it and say, perhaps we underreacted.</p><p>Where do you come down on that?</p><p>GATES: Well, certainly, everybody looking back wishes they had reacted faster. If you catch this at a very low level like a few countries did, you know, because you got community testing and contact tracing, then you don`t have to do the shutdown. As people see the infection rates, as they see the stories about the emergency rooms, you know, they weren`t going to be traveling to theme parks or, you know, going to sports stadiums.</p><p>And so, it`s a false choice to say it`s the government who is solely responsible for this economic activity going down. People, you know, fear getting sick themselves or infecting their parents and so we just didn`t have a choice.</p><p>GUTHRIE: You famously talked about a coming pandemic at this nightmare scenario back in 2015 on the heels of the Ebola crisis and you said in your TED Talk that you worried about a virus that could be 1,000 times worse. Is this that virus?</p><p>GATES: Yes. The human to human respiratory spread is the scariest scenario and I showed a simulation in that 2015 talk that, you know, showed you could have tens of millions of deaths and trillions of economic costs. So, this did. It`s a respiratory virus that is causing that damage. And so, it`s a nightmare.</p><p>You know, I wish it had come, you know, five or ten years later than governments might have done the preparation to move quickly like a few governments did and the technologies would have been further along.</p><p>GUTHRIE: I went back and looked at the numbers. On March 1st, we had had two deaths in this country. Thirty days later on April 1st, we had 4,800 deaths. Today, as we sit here, not even 30 days later, we have 47,000 deaths.</p><p>Can you just talk about that exponential growth and exponential decline?</p><p>GATES: Yes, so if I`m infecting two other people for every active infection, you know, then over the course of the month, you can go from a small part of the population to a very large part, and so clearly, in March, the infections were exponential and then you have about an 18-day leg between infections and deaths.</p><p>And so, April, exactly as you said, we`ve had huge numbers of deaths. If we maintain the isolation, the deaths out in the summer would be very, very small. Very quickly, it can go from barely detectable to huge and, you know, I think people will be shocked that in some locations, the ICU will hardly have anyone in it at all within the next few months.</p><p>GUTHRIE: I read that you said that we are nearing the peak in this country, hopefully. And then you`ve also said we`re really not anywhere near the end of this, and I can`t be alone in thinking, well, how does that work out? How can we be almost at the peak but yet so far away from a solution and an end to this and a return to normal?</p><p>GATES: Well, the vaccine is the most likely solution, and so, great scientists are rushing to get that done. And actually, I`ve been surprised how quickly they`re moving. There is a number that have even begun that human testing that`s key there.</p><p>And so, it could be that in a year, we have lots of a vaccine and then once you get it out to lots of people, then you -- you`re -- you have enough community immunity that you won`t see this widespread problem again.</p><p>You know, we have this first peak in the U.S. With the right policies, we`ll have small, some areas that go back and have infections, but we shouldn`t see countrywide anything like this but a -- you know, miracle therapeutic or the vaccine are the only thing that we`ll be able to say, OK, we`re back to normal.</p><p>GUTHRIE: I do want to ask you about the second wave, this notion that the virus could come back in the fall. We heard the CDC director saying it could be even potentially more difficult in the fall and winter because the seasonal flu will also be going on.</p><p>Dr. Fauci said he`s certain there will be a second wave of this virus.</p><p>What`s your perspective on how bad it could be?</p><p>GATES: Well, if we`re -- if we`re still being careful about social contact, if we`re wearing masks, if we`re doing distancing where possible, if we got the testing capacity up, I`m hopeful that the fall will not be nearly as bad as this first peak. The flu is a challenge because the symptoms are common enough that knowing exactly who to test, you know, which are people with symptoms, will be a little confused because of all those flu infections that will be taking place.</p><p>But the vigilance of not getting too relaxed when you`re seeing pictures of empty ICUs, that`s not intuitive because you could get back on that ramp.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Part of Bill Gates` conversation with Savannah Guthrie.</p><p>Here is a billionaire willing to spend his own money and a billionaire who spends his time thinking about this.</p><p>WALLACE: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And when Savannah asks him is this that virus, he calmly answers yes.</p><p>WALLACE: Yes, to hear him use the words nightmare scenario, I was watching it and thinking about just how long Bill Gates has been a giant in the public health arena. He was talking about the sorts of things people were afraid of when I was in government.</p><p>I mean, it`s been reported by \"The New York Times\" this week that George W. Bush became obsessed with pandemics and had all of us reading some of the same books that I know Bill Gates talked about in that TED Talk, and that this was the nightmare scenario the last three presidents were scared of. That President Obama had a team that handed this team a plan to deal with something like this. George W. Bush had done some work on that plan, too, and to hear Bill Gates talk about that brings back all that muscle memory that you just don`t see in this more sort of chaotic administration on full display.</p><p>But there were a lot of other science headlines in there and lucky for us, we`re able to get reaction from Dr. Michael Osterholm. He`s the director of the Center for Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota and the author of \"Deadliest Enemy: Our War Against Killer Germs.\"</p><p>I saw you earlier today on this network and there were so many practical pieces to what Bill Gates was saying about we don`t get to normal until there are some really powerful therapies or a vaccine.</p><p>How far off is that?</p><p>MICHAEL OSTERHOLM, PHD, CENTER FOR DISEASE RESEARCH &amp; POLICY DIRECTOR: Well, we don`t know right now if we`re going to have a vaccine. I just have to be very honest with you.</p><p>WALLACE: Yes.</p><p>OSTERHOLM: We hope we will have one, but hope is not a strategy.</p><p>Drugs will be very important in reducing the severity of illness and hope for preventing deaths, but it won`t stop the transmission. People are infectious in the earliest stages of their illness even before in some cases they get sick, so the drug would come after that.</p><p>So, the epidemiology or meaning, occurrence of cases will continue to occur. And I think one of the things that`s being missed here is that when we talk about, are we going to have the curve flatten, what`s going to come back? Look at it this way, as we know in this country between 5 and maybe 10 percent of the population has been infected even in the metropolitan areas. You heard in New York today, it maybe 14 percent.</p><p>This virus is not going to stop transmitting among people until it hits 60 or 70 percent of the people. So, either we`ve got to do that with a vaccine and get them to be immune from that perspective, or they`re going t get it through natural infection. That`s a lot of additional cases to occur over the months a ahead.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Doctor, I will not forget the first time you and I spoke. It was in the midst of our political coverage, this virus while dangerous seemed so far off and it was a vague threat. It`s now very real.</p><p>I know we`re mostly talking about testing tonight, but absent any political considerations, what do you see people doing wrong right now because you know the strength of this opponent?</p><p>OSTERHOLM: Well, first of all, again, I keep looking at the 16 to 18-month course and keeping that in mind is that`s what we`re embarking upon. Far too many people look at this as a sprint and we`re just about over. We`re debating can we reopen now with the idea that`s the end of it.</p><p>And in fact, we could have many, many more peaks. Those of us who study infectious disease, and I`ve spent the last 45 years of my life studying this very thing, we don`t know if this coronavirus, will there be a big peak in the next fall? There could be. Will there just be slow burn constantly seeing infections occur like we`re seeing right now in countries like Singapore and Japan that one time had it under control or will we see a series of peaks like Mr. Gates talked about? We don`t know.</p><p>But we know one thing, this virus won`t stop until it infects as many as 50 -- 60 to 70 percent of us. So, we have to have a battle plan not just about this week or this month or next month. We`re in this for the long haul.</p><p>I unfortunately promise you, we will be having this same discussion where some form of it one year from tonight.</p><p>WALLACE: That`s such an ominous prediction. I`m sure you`re correct.</p><p>But I wonder if we`re not out of the gates yet in terms of being able to talk about reopening, can you just clarify what the three -- are the three legs of that stool for identifying our starting point, the diagnostic testing, the antibody testing and contact tracing. Or is there another step? It`s confusing to know where we even start with a clear picture of where we are today.</p><p>OSTERHOLM: Well, first of all, we have to do testing, but we`ve got to also stop talking about the way we have. We have far too many people that come on shows like this or write articles saying, test, test, test. We have to understand we have a major shortage of reagents today.</p><p>The world was not ready to suddenly supply all these test kits, and so, it`s not a matter of money. It`s a matter of physics. We don`t have the reagents.</p><p>We have to build these manufacturing facilities to do that. Our government has not helped facilitate that. We needed a Marshall Plan to build that up.</p><p>So testing is critical. We need it. Second of all, we have to make sure that we have surge capacity in our hospitals so when the testing shows us that the cases are starting to come back, that we can handle them. We don`t want to overload the hospitals.</p><p>And, by the way, that surge capacity doesn`t mean just beds, it also means protecting our health care workers.</p><p>The third thing that we absolutely must do in all of this is then do what you just said about contract tracing, have a way so we can constantly try to hold this virus down. Until you have those kinds of things in place, it`s very hard to reopen and not get caught with suddenly this very rapidly rising number of cases.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, Doctor, you just said the magic phrase to me, the Marshall Plan and I`ll do it one better -- a Manhattan Project. If this is indeed going to be the event that perhaps marks the rest of our adult lives as Americans, why not?</p><p>OSTERHOLM: Well, I actually in an op-ed piece I wrote in \"The New York Times\" almost month ago, which I predicted we`d have a shortage right now that we see if reagents, I actually did call for a Manhattan Project, an intellectual one, that covers all these issues. My Marshall Plan is just about testing reagents.</p><p>But I think you`re right on the mark, Brian. We need to bring together that right now and what this country is missing is a core. We`re missing a leadership component that can bring everyone together without regard to partisan politics, without regard to age, race, gender, location.</p><p>You know, I said on your network just three weeks ago that one day, it wouldn`t be a red and bluish shoe. It would be a COVID color issue. Look what`s happened in the Midwest right now. All those red counties are turning COVID because of what we`re seeing happen.</p><p>So I think that you`re exactly right. We need a Manhattan Project, where one, tell the truth. We need straight talk. What`s really happening, what`s not?</p><p>I don`t want to hear another time we have enough testing. The 50 governors will tell you, that`s not true. We need to understand, are we going to have more cases or not? Don`t tell the public we`re not going to have any more cases because they may go away with more sunshine or warm. There`s no truth to that. That`s like defying gravity.</p><p>So, I think that`s part of what will make a Manhattan Project work if we all come together to solve a common problem that is this virus and it`s going to be here for awhile, so let`s get on with it right now doing that.</p><p>WALLACE: Dr. Michael Osterholm, I think it might solve more than coronavirus to give people something like that to work on together, you`re right. That`s what people are hungry for.</p><p>Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>OSTERHOLM: Thank you very much.</p><p>WILLIAMS: We have much -- we have much more of our colleague Savannah Guthrie`s exclusive conversation with Bill Gates throughout this program tonight.</p><p>WALLACE: The Gates Foundation is in the thick of that hunt for a vaccine. Up next, hear what Bill Gates says he feels hopeful that we may be on the optimistic side of the timeline to find a vaccine and the unprecedented steps now being taken right now to find a vaccine and mass produce it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Plus, does Bill Gates think the U.S. is doing a good job at testing presently? That`s all next.</p><p>There is much more still ahead this hour. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo will join us to talk about the day he learned this stunning fact -- more than one in five New York city residents tested found to have antibodies to the virus, meaning far more New Yorkers might have had coronavirus without becoming sick or showing symptoms.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Welcome back to our special broadcast tonight.</p><p>In a new op-ed in \"The Washington Post\" today, Bill Gates who talked about World War II as the galvanizing event for his parents` generation writes this and we, quote: There is one big difference between a world war and a pandemic. All of humanity can work together to learn about the disease and develop the capacity to fight it.</p><p>He argues the U.S. needs to invest in creating new approaches to expand testing and contact tracing to track the spread of the virus before we can safely, in quotes, reopen our country.</p><p>WALLACE: Only about 1.4 percent of the U.S. population has been tested coronavirus so far and there is little organization from the federal government on contact tracing.</p><p>In part two of Savannah`s exclusive interview, Bill Gates details some of the innovations in testing that his foundation is working on, his assessment of why the U.S. is lagging in testing and why he says he`s optimistic about the timeline for a vaccine.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GUTHRIE: The Gates Foundation is very much at the forefront on this hunt for a vaccine. We`ve all learned by now the timeline, the hopeful timeline of 12 to 18 months. That is a highly expedited track, a fast track for a vaccine. Can you explain why?</p><p>GATES: For most diseases, you don`t pursue more than one or two approaches. Here, because of all the incredibly negative effects, the sooner the better. And so, we`re going to pursue -- there are 100 efforts, but maybe 10 of those should get the resources to build factories and go full speed ahead, and it will be multiple companies, which that`s not typical, and it will be at risk because those are billions of dollars that when they`re successful will save the trillions of dollars of broad damage.</p><p>So, you know, the best scientists working hard on this and I`m hopeful. In fact, in the last few weeks, I`ve seen signs that we may get to the optimistic side of that time projection.</p><p>GUTHRIE: What about treatments? That`s -- you said, if we could get a miracle drug, a miracle treatment that would, you know, take care of it for 95 percent of people, then maybe we could all be at the baseball game next spring. You`ve said you don`t think that`s likely.</p><p>GATES: Yes.</p><p>GUTHRIE: But where is the hope on the treatment track?</p><p>GATES: Well, there`s a huge number of compounds being tried. The public knows about remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, you know, whenever one it is, you know, most will fail but a few I think will have substantial effects.</p><p>As far as I know, none of the trials have had that kind of, you know, amazing result where you stop it early and go, hey, we have to get this out. So, you know, even if those lead compounds do not have significant benefit, believe me, there are so many good ideas that some will.</p><p>So, no one should put their hope behind a particular approach -- and hydroxy, it may have a modest effect. That`s all, by the end of May, will be clear.</p><p>GUTHRIE: I think if there has been any area that seems to have been bedeviling during this crisis, it`s testing.</p><p>I wonder how you assess how the U.S. has done in testing, and what seems to be the issue here? What`s the breakdown? What`s the problem? What should have been better?</p><p>GATESS: Well, many countries decided that at the national level, they would orchestrate the testing and, you know, do that very early so all of these machines called PCR machines would be used 24 hours a day, and you would be testing the right people. That hasn`t happened in the United States. It might not happen.</p><p>But, you know, the access to tests is just, you know, chaotic. If you`re a low income person, your access is less than a high income person.</p><p>We should focus on the symptomatics and the contact tracing.</p><p>So, I don`t know whether this will get organized. The capacity is going up but, you know, when you get the results late, it`s almost worthless and so we can improve. A number of invasions have been driven. We were involved in proving that the patient doing the self-swab just at the tip of the nose, that`s as good as having the medical worker do the more invasive procedure.</p><p>GUTHRIE: Yes, I was going to ask about that because there seems to be a couple of innovations on the horizon, both having to do with at home testing. One, the nasal swab, you do yourself and I think you send it off to a lab. And the other, you`ve said is kind of like a home pregnancy test and that you do the test --</p><p>GATES: Yes.</p><p>GUTHRIE: -- and you get the results right there. Different method, I know.</p><p>GATES: That`s right. The swab (inaudible) the self-swab is in common, whether you send it back for the PCR processing hopefully very quickly, less than 24 hours, or if you simply take the swab, put it in liquid, pour the liquid on to a piece of paper, and then it turns one color if you have virus and another color if you don`t. If we can make those in large numbers and it has the right sensitivity, then we could open testing up and go beyond symptomatics.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Until we have a vaccine, as I understand it, you have to be able to test and you have to be able to contact trace. In other words, you`re in a community and you`re watching to see where the cases flare up and then you trace all the contacts so you can kind of encircle them and contain them.</p><p>And there`s a lot of talk right now about, A, whether or not we have sufficient resources, human resources to do that contact tracing, and B, whether there`s a big role for big tech, your old business, to play. Cell phones, that kind of thing. How do you see that coming to pass?</p><p>GATES: Well, South Korea was able to avoid a countrywide shutdown by doing the testing and contact tracing in a professional way. Now, they did it in a way that they grabbed your data immediately without your opting into that. And so the exact approach to do that contact tracing in the U.S. and other western countries may not be identical, but the basic approach, even if it`s mostly through interview, is very important to keep the numbers down.</p><p>And so we`re going to have to hire up people to do those interviews, and this is another case where the federal government really hasn`t stepped up to it. So it`s mostly the state saying, OK, who`s volunteering to do this, and can software facilitate it? So this is a new effort that will make a big difference.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Brian, it`s amazing how much your question about a Manhattan project comes through and just what Bill Gates is talking about. And he`s not pulling any punches in terms of the deficiencies and inadequacies of the federal effort, but there is such an outsized role for technology, for innovation, for sort of human ingenuity if you listen to him talk about the contact tracing.</p><p>That`s basically going to be investigative epidemiology. I mean, that`s going to be people that have the ability to sit down and try to get to the bottom of every single contact that a human being had. It really is a massive, massive undertaking.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Also, opens your mind to what could be possible. Science, when it works best, merges with medicine and makes our lives easier. What he was describing there is a home pregnancy test. In effect, it`s the same process and chemical makeup, only this would tell you if you`re COVID positive or COVID negative in real-time right before your eyes.</p><p>Well, be that as it may, we`re going to move on and get more on this topic of contact tracing. You`ve seen pictures. We`ve showed some of them briefly. Folks in some countries, in Asia, swiping QR codes, having their temperatures taken before they get on a train or enter a building. How might that work in a country like ours? How soon could it be put to work in a country like ours? Steve Kornacki crunches numbers for a living, and he`s with us to explain.</p><p>WALLACE: And Brian, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is actually helping New York coordinate a testing and tracing effort, which Governor Cuomo described today as a super-ambitious undertaking. Michael Bloomberg joins us to talk about that, next.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It is called contact tracing, and suddenly, for good reason, it is the phrase of the moment, a very important tool to be used in this fight against coronavirus. It does what it indicates. It takes all of the people you`ve come in contact with, all of those you can remember and identify, and goes back through them to see if any of them have tested positive.</p><p>The World Health Organization estimates that each infected person can in turn infect multiples making the coronavirus more contagious than the seasonal flu. If we want to flatten the curve, which is happening through social distancing, but also shrink the curve and prevent infections, keep that number down, we have to have a nationwide system for this contact tracing.</p><p>WALLACE: Joining us now to explain more about contact tracing is our colleague, Steve Kornacki.</p><p>STEVE KORNACKI, NBC NEWS NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Nicolle, that`s right. And contact tracing really is - it is a tool to be used for the reopening phase. If you`re going to try to reopen the country in some way without having a vaccine, what you want to be able to do is be in a position to find any potential outbreak and to nip it in the bud. And here`s what`s involved in that process. Let`s take you through how contact tracing works.</p><p>So let`s say it`s a person who suddenly develops symptoms and says I might have the coronavirus. Well, in this ideal world of rapid testing and mass testing and contact tracing, that person can very quickly, maybe in a drive-through clinic, maybe a walk in clinic, maybe at an at-home test, get a test, get an answer, and find out if they`re infected.</p><p>And if that person is infected, then the next step is to talk to and to work with a public health official, a contact tracer, and to try to go through the people that - the infected person, the people that person has been around for the last couple days, basically the people that person has been around within six feet and for at least 10 minutes. That`s the key. Somebody you`ve been around for at least 10 minutes of time within a space of at least - of inside six feet.</p><p>So let`s say, that opened up 12 possibilities or so. The infected person works with the contact tracer to find out and to identify who all of those people might be. And then the contact tracer will then get in touch with each one of those people and will simply say you have been in proximity to, you have potentially been exposed to the coronavirus.</p><p>And then the idea there is, again, rapid, widely available testing. Get those people tested. Find out, do any of them have it. If a couple of them have it, you repeat this whole process. Get them in touch with a contact tracer, get in touch with that person`s circle of associates, circle of contacts, and you basically try to find out who in all these sort of succeeding rings here has been exposed, who has it, get them quarantined, nip it in the bud. So that is the idea to be doing this all over the country.</p><p>There are some obvious major challenges that go with this. First of all, obviously - look, asymptomatic. You can be walking around with this and not know you have it. That`s obviously a major challenge. Resources, think about that. A contact tracer trying to track down all of these people who a person has been in contact with. That is resource intense. That takes time.</p><p>A person who has been infected will give you some names they`ve been in touch with, but it could also be, hey, I was with some people in a subway, I have no idea who they were. Contact tracer has got to help try to figure that out, and of course, privacy concerns here too. There are all sorts of tools of technology that can be used to help in this GPS tracking, surveillance cameras and that sort of thing. How much are we comfortable with though actually being used for a tracking program, a contact tracing program.</p><p>WALLACE: Steve Kornacki, it`s so interesting how protective that six-foot barrier is, that for contact tracing, you rule out everyone who you kept a safe distance from and you only rule in the people that broke that sort of six-foot mote around you. It`s fascinating stuff. Thank you, Steve.</p><p>KORNACKI: Thanks.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Nicolle, it is the medical equivalent of that small nick in your windshield that can oftentimes--</p><p>WALLACE: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: --spider across your entire field of view and envelope your world looking for it. But enough mixed metaphors.</p><p>Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has volunteered to develop a coronavirus contact tracing program just to help the incredibly hard hit New York, New Jersey, Connecticut tri-state area. Bloomberg Philanthropies, which of course was founded by him, will contribute $10.5 million as well as tech support and assistance to this program. I spoke with the former mayor earlier tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Mr. Mayor, tell us about this program. You have decided to spend your money on in the area of public health.</p><p>MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Well, the virus is what`s called a communicable disease compared to cancer, which is a non- communicable disease. You get cancer from smoking or being obese or other things, but you don`t catch it from somebody else. A communicable disease, you catch from somebody else. So if you don`t want to get it, you just got to make sure you don`t go near anybody who has it.</p><p>Now, problems are we don`t know who has it. The tests aren`t perfect. It`s not easy to get a test yet. And once they have it, you`ve got to depend on them to tell you whether they have it so you know to stay away, or stay away from everybody. And a lot of people will wear a mask. That stops you from breathing the same air that the other person who may have the disease does. You have to stop touching the same things other people touch. If they are infected, you have a very good chance of getting it.</p><p>So what we`re trying to do here is to find out for somebody that has the disease, who else they talked to or were close to, and then warn those people and get them to stay in an area where nobody else can catch it from them if they`ve caught it. And you`ll know after two weeks whether that person has caught it from the first person.</p><p>And so what we`re trying to do is put together a group, which will interview people that have it, say where were you, who did you talk to, and then go to those people and say you were exposed to somebody that had it and so you`ve got to take precautions. You don`t want to get - if you`ve caught it, you don`t want to give it to your loved ones. So, go and lock yourself away for two weeks because you`re with somebody who had it and because you don`t want to give it to somebody else.</p><p>WILLIAMS: This is such a vast spider web of contacts. If you and I saw each other in a Manhattan restaurant and one of us learned later that we were asymptomatic but carriers, think of the vortices that would come off that one meeting.</p><p>I have to ask, given the state of the economy, is this going to mean jobs for people who need the work, need the money as contact tracing interviewers and researchers?</p><p>BLOOMBERG: Well, we`ve already done the worst part. We closed the restaurants. So the question now is to find out who you`ve talked to other than that. If you take the subway, it`s pretty hard to get the names of everybody that`s on the subway car.</p><p>If you had been in a restaurant, the restaurant probably doesn`t know the names of everybody else that was there. But if you just go around and stay out of the stores and stay out of the restaurants and stay in your home, you will not be touching anybody else who might have it.</p><p>If you do touch somebody and you find out, then we can go and interview those people. You could interview the doorman in your building. You could interview the delivery man that brought the food to your house. And we need people to do that, and they have to be trained and they have to know which questions to ask, and we want to make sure they don`t divulge any personal information.</p><p>But this is serious stuff, and particularly, as you get older, it`s more serious. Older people have a higher incidence of getting very sick and even dying from this disease. Younger people aren`t immune, but they`re more secure than if they were older.</p><p>And somebody like my age, it`s really as much more serious thing than if you were the age of my daughter, or my grand kid is even less likely to catch it from somebody. But Johns Hopkins is designing a program. We`re trying to hire the people and train them and then make sure that they get the information to the right people and not to the wrong people.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And final question, you mentioned testing. We`re talking about testing on this broadcast here tonight. Absent rock-solid big numbers in testing, how much of a crimp does that put in this effort you`ve decided to finance?</p><p>BLOOMBERG: Well, the fewer people that have it, the less likely somebody else is to be with somebody who has it. So what you`re trying to do is keep everybody that has it off the streets and then nobody else will have it. And if the people that have it get over it, then they can go back on the streets but they won`t infect anybody.</p><p>So it`s not going to make it any worse, quite the contrary. If you can tell people that they were close to somebody who had it, they can then isolate themselves, which they would not do if you didn`t have this process. So that`s why Governor Cuomo is in favor of this program, and that`s why we`ve had Johns Hopkins design the program.</p><p>And if we can get it to work in New York, we can get it to work elsewhere as well. But every country is trying to do the same thing. Some have a more professional program than others. We want to make sure that New York has a very professional program run by people who are well trained and who you can depend upon, not to take your personal information and give it to people who shouldn`t have it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Former Mayor of the City of New York, former presidential candidate, Mike Bloomberg, thank you for spending a few minutes with us tonight.</p><p>BLOOMBERG: You`re welcome, Brian. Good to be with you. Stay safe.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Coming up for us, another break in our broadcast. As we go to break, think of this. We`ve had a doctor tonight warn us we`re still going to be having this conversation a year from now. We will ask a noted epidemiologist if she agrees with that, after this.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Welcome back to this special broadcast we`re calling \"Testing and the Road to Reopening.\" We`re happy to be joined tonight by a frequent guest of ours, Dr. Anne Rimoin, Professor of Epidemiology at the UCLA School of Public Health.</p><p>And Anne, I have to ask you, we had Dr. Osterholm with us earlier in the hour. Scary, yes, but also he`s very much a realist. He said that a year from tonight, we`ll still be having this conversation. Do you agree with that? And talk about whether or not you see that if we launched a Manhattan project on testing, would that still sadly be the case?</p><p>DR. ANNE RIMOIN, UCLA SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSOR OF EPIDEMIOLOGY: It`s anybody`s guess where we`re going to be. And everything is also speculation at this point. I do think that if we had a Manhattan project type of situation, we would be doing better. But here`s the thing. Everybody is working on vaccines now. And I think we do have a lot of work happening. We have a lot of work on vaccines. We have a lot of work on therapeutics. Things are moving forward.</p><p>So I think we need to take heed of what`s happened in other countries. We need to really focus on getting our act together, moving forward. But we can`t forget it is not just tests - it`s not just vaccines and therapeutics, it`s going to ride on also contact tracing and testing. We need everything. And we need to be hitting it at all fronts.</p><p>WALLACE: Dr. Rimoin, I know you just said it`s speculative, but I think that`s all people have at this point. And one of the conversations I have most often is speculation and wondering when our kids will ever go back to school. And I`m not asking to speculate on when that could happen, especially in a place like New York, but how would that happen? Which of these pieces would need to be in place for states to open schools again?</p><p>RIMOIN: Well, this is the question that everybody is asking, and it`s not just an issue for schools. When you say schools, I think many people are thinking about children that are from elementary school through high school. But it`s a big question for universities, colleges around the country as well. So these are very big questions.</p><p>The likelihood is we`re not going to have a vaccine by the summer. And so at least for the foreseeable future, we have to rely on these blunt measures like social distancing, contact tracing, and making sure that we have testing in place. And if we had all of those things in place, we could start opening up. But you really need, as Dr. Osterholm said, you really need to be able to identify who is sick, who is not, and to be able to make decisions based on that.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Dr. Rimoin, California, of course--</p><p>RIMOIN: I know it didn`t really answer your question exactly, but the--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: I was just going to say California is Nicolle`s--</p><p>RIMOIN: --I didn`t answer it exactly, but--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: --is Nicolle`s home state. Sorry. This satellite delay during these times is tough to deal with. California is Nicolle`s home state. Your governor, Governor Newsom, is almost alone among governors in talking about the COVID architecture that has to follow this pandemic and the way we need to do things differently publicly. Talk about that.</p><p>RIMOIN: Well, I think that Governor Newsom has been ahead of the pack. He`s laid out a very clear plan that includes testing as a corner piece and is really pushing forward. California, I was very, very heartened today to see that California is going to be testing asymptomatic people as well - focusing on testing asymptomatic - looking for asymptomatic infection in health care workers and first responders and essential workers.</p><p>I think that this is going to go a long way in terms of curbing the spread. But I think that having this kind of plan that is so straightforward that we have benchmarks and that everybody understands what the rules of the game are, is just really a fantastic way of moving forward. And I think that that`s why California has really - has succeeded.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Dr. Anne Rimoin, thank you for joining us from L.A. tonight.</p><p>We have much more still ahead. In our next hour, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on what it will take to reopen the City and State of New York. And after his high-profile meeting at the White House this week, the Governor tells us what the federal government has agreed to do to help with testing.</p><p>WALLACE: Plus, an in-depth look at how some countries are managing to rein in coronavirus. Today, German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned, quote, \"We are still at the beginning of this crisis.\" Yet Germany is starting to open up. Richard Engel will join us with a new report about how they`re able to do that.</p><p>Stay with us. You`re watching MSNBC`s special report, \"Testing and the Road to Reopening.\"</p><p>WILLIAMS: Brian Williams and Nicolle Wallace back with you. As we cross the top of the hour into what is normally \"The 11th Hour\" broadcast, we`re continuing our special coverage of the critical roles that testing and contact tracing will play in what is called reopening our country eventually.</p><p>A number of states are eager to reopen amid troubling unemployment news. Tomorrow, the State of Georgia will begin opening some businesses even though experts have warned it`s too early and even though the President publicly broke with Georgia`s Governor just a few hours ago. Meanwhile, other states are taking things, as they must, much slower.</p><p>WALLACE: This hour we`ll hear from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose state is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak here in the U.S. New York just released the results of an antibody testing study today. We`ll also have much more from our exclusive interview with Microsoft Co-Founder Bill Gates. He responds to the conspiracy theory that blames him for the entire pandemic. But first here are his thoughts on where things stand.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: My first question is just where we are right now in terms of this pandemic. That famous saying, are we at the end of the beginning or at the beginning of the end?</p><p>GATES: Well, I wish I could say that we`re halfway through, but I don`t think so. It takes time to make a vaccine. The social distancing that we`ve had to engage in has huge economic effects. It`s very tough on people. There`s a lot about the disease we don`t understand. So we know that we can get out of this, but it`s going to be a while before things go back to normal.</p><p>WALLACE: You famously talked about a coming pandemic, this nightmare scenario back in 2015 on the heels of the Ebola crisis, and you said in your Ted Talk that you worried about a virus that could be a thousand times worse. Is this that virus?</p><p>GATES: Yes. The human-to-human respiratory spread is the scariest scenario, and I showed a simulation in that 2015 talk that, you know, showed you could have tens of millions of deaths and trillions of economic cost. So this fits. It`s a respiratory virus that is causing that damage. The vaccine is the most likely solution, and so great scientists are rushing to get that done. And actually I`ve been surprised how quickly they`re moving. There`s a number that have even begun that human testing that`s key there. And so it could be that in a year, we have lots of a vaccine. The economic effects have been, you know, unbelievable, and so we`ll be dealing with that literally for years to come. But a, you know, miracle therapeutic or the vaccine are the only thing that we`ll be able to say, OK, we`re back to normal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: OK. So it turns out coronavirus spread throughout American cities undetected much, much earlier than anyone realized at the time. That`s according to a new report from The New York Times. On March 1st, five major U.S. Cities, New York, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, and Seattle had a total of 23 confirmed cases of coronavirus. But a model of infection rates by researchers at northeastern university estimates that there could have actually been 28,000 undetected infections in those cities by that time.</p><p>This visualization from The Times shows the remarkable disparity between those two sets of numbers. The model suggests that by the time New York had its first confirmed case of coronavirus, there were already 10,000 people infected. This new information as New York begins work on a plan for widespread testing and contact tracing.</p><p>Joining us now, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Governor, we meet on a day of some pretty momentous political headlines and pretty momentous science headlines. I want to start with the science. You shared some information in your briefing today about antibodies. Is that encouraging? And can you take us through how many New Yorkers, based on this early study, may have already been exposed to COVID?</p><p>CUOMO: Yeah. No, it was surprising. We had about -- we did a 3,000-person survey, which is fairly extensive all throughout the state. Statewide, it was about 14 percent of the people had the antibodies, which means 14 percent of the people had the virus. That`s about 2.7 million people in our state. New York City was close to 20 percent.</p><p>WALLACE: Wow.</p><p>CUOMO: Which was surprising. Yeah. So the good news is these are people who have the antibodies. They can then donate blood for the convalescent plasma, which is probably one of the best therapeutic that show promise.</p><p>The other good news is, you know, we talk about the death rate. We have about 15,000 people who have died in New York. That`s hospitalizations and nursing homes. That doesn`t count the at-home deaths which we still have to calculate. But it`s 15,000 on a much larger denominator. So the death rate is like 0.5. The normal flu is like 0.1 to 0.3. So it gives a perspective on the death rate if you`re looking for a silver lining.</p><p>WALLACE: I think we`re all looking for silver linings, and I think it makes clear how much of the science is unfolding as we navigate the crisis. Another piece of reporting on that front is The New York Times report that suggests that there were as many as 10,000 infections in New York at the beginning of March. What do you make of some of the news reporting and some of the studies that show that it was here much earlier than we thought?</p><p>CUOMO: Well, look, it`s an eye-opener. I think it`s important because we have to do a retrospective on this because I`m afraid it`s not only in the past. It`s going to be in the future. They`ve been talking about a possibility of a global pandemic for many, many years, but it never really happened. And until it happens, it doesn`t really get people`s attention, and it`s not actualized. But now, look, we`re learning. When they say that China has a virus last November, last December, then I think the flares have to go up at that point because if China has a virus, that virus is going to get on a plane. It`s going to go to Europe.</p><p>WALLACE: Right.</p><p>CUOMO: It`s going to get on another plane. It`s going to come to New York. It`s going to come to California. So they`re now saying that the virus was here in February, maybe January. So all these actions we`re taking in March, the horse is out of the barn.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, and your message this week, we talked as you were leaving a meeting with President Trump -- was testing, testing, testing. At this point, how does that fit into your strategy moving forward or any attempt to open up the state? It seems to me like it`s a snapshot. It`s a moment in time. But without it, it`s hard to understand how you even draw up plans for doing anything close to normal.</p><p>CUOMO: Yeah. Nicolle, it`s snapshot, but then it`s snapshot, snapshot, snapshot, right? And you put those snapshots together, and you have a motion picture. Reopening, reopening. All right. The only guideposts you have on reopening are the virus infection, which you can only find from testing.</p><p>WALLACE: Right.</p><p>CUOMO: The calibration is always going to be we want to reopen as fast as possible, yes. But we want to make sure we don`t increase the virus spread. The only way you can find that out and calibrate it and gauge it is if you are testing. So you take a snapshot. We took a snapshot today. OK, it was 20 percent. It was 14 percent statewide. Now let`s see how that progresses, how that changes. If people show the same discipline, you start to reopen. You have a little more activity. The weather is getting warm. Watch the gauge. Watch the meter.</p><p>WALLACE: Yeah.</p><p>CUOMO: And the meter is the virus inspection that you see from the testing.</p><p>WALLACE: You went to see the President to ask for some sort of a partnership. Can you talk about what you got and if there`s been any follow-up since you were at the White House this week?</p><p>CUOMO: Yeah. There`s been a lot of back-and-forth on testing. Everybody says we have to test, right? It`s now been left up to the states, and there was a back-and-forth. Do the states test? Does the federal government test? The federal government stands up at the briefings, and they talk about what they`re doing on testing, but then there`s a disconnect because some people say it should be left to the states.</p><p>So I just wanted to iron it out so to speak. This is a new frontier, this whole testing. Between the states and the federal government, who does what? Who does what? I have the private labs in my state. I have about 300 commercial labs. I can regulate them. I can administer the testing planning, the tracing operation, which is also extensive. But the manufacturers of the lab equipment can`t get the supplies, so they can`t provide it to my commercial labs. That supply chain for the national manufacturers that should be the responsibility of the federal government. Let them figure out how to deal with China or South Korea.</p><p>WALLACE: Did they commit to doing that?</p><p>CUOMO: Yes, yes, and that was the division of responsibility. So the feds will take that piece. I will take the front-end piece. The states will be responsible for the testing. They will be responsible for the supply chain to the national manufacturers so my labs get the test kits and the reagents, and we agreed to a very aggressive plan of doubling the number of tests we`re now taking from 20,000 to 40,000 tests, which are the maximum capacity for my commercial labs.</p><p>WALLACE: Mitch McConnell today basically left it to the states to also pay for themselves and if they can`t, to file for bankruptcy. You had some strong words for him. Do you care to elaborate?</p><p>CUOMO: Look, this is just one of the dumb ideas of all time, and pardon my bluntness. But I don`t know what else you say about it. First, everyone said, the House passed a bill, did not have funding for state and local governments in it. Everybody said don`t worry, don`t worry, don`t worry. We`ll do it in the next bill.</p><p>As soon as the Senate passes it, Mitch McConnell comes out and he says he`s not interested in it. The states should declare bankruptcy, right? They want to get the economy running. Do you really want to have states across this nation declaring bankruptcy? You want to see that stock market go through the cellar? Let a state or a couple of states declare bankruptcy. You want to see the economy in this nation suffer in a way that it won`t come back for years? Let states declare bankruptcy. I mean from an economic point of view, it was bizarre. And then to say that reimbursing states for coronavirus costs is a bailout of the blue states, these are states that lost thousands of people. It`s not red or blue. Is there ever a moment in this country, in Washington, when these guys are going to stop playing politics? Even with people dying from the coronavirus, he`s going to say, well, they died in blue states, so they`re Democrats.</p><p>WALLACE: Yeah.</p><p>CUOMO: I mean they`re Americans who died. Just at one point this corrosive partisanship has to stop. And if it doesn`t stop when it comes to coronavirus, it will never stop.</p><p>WALLACE: I want to ask you about the personal toll this is taking on you. I worked for George W. Bush on 9/11, and there was nothing that moved him more than the courage and the sacrifice and the service of the first responders, especially folks who were working down at ground zero for months and years. And I wonder if there`s a parallel there, what this has been like for you to be in contact with the hospitals in crisis. One was described as apocalyptic as it neared the peak. To be advocating on behalf of health care workers who have been called everything from hoarders to liars by the folks down in Washington. And just the toll, I mean the toll on our state. I live in New York City, on my city. How has that affected you?</p><p>CUOMO: You know, I`m not even sure I`ve figured that out, Nicolle. I can tell you this. When the pressure is on, not just in this situation, as a society, as a collective, but you really see what people are made of when the pressure is on, right? You see the good, the bad, and the ugly. You see some people who you thought were better just crumble. And then you see people who you didn`t expect anything from who actually rise to the occasion. I think you`re seeing both extremes here. You see people who really got scared and ran away, and then you have people who have shown such courage and resilience. These nurses, these doctors who are in these emergency rooms, I don`t know how they did it day after day after day. I ordered hospitals to increase capacity by 50 percent. So every hospital was at 150 percent. The emergency rooms were packed. People were petrified. They didn`t know what this was, coronavirus, right? It reminded me of the early days of HIV. Nobody knew what it was. Nobody wanted to go near it. But these people got up every day. The outpouring from across the nation reminded me of 9/11.</p><p>You know, after 9/11, you had people from across the country just show up in New York.</p><p>WALLACE: Yeah.</p><p>CUOMO: Just to help. I can`t tell you how many beautiful letters I`ve gotten, how many phone calls, how many gifts, how many cards that just break your heart, the beauty of the American people. So you have both, right? You have the worst, and you have the best, and you get the strength from the best to keep going. And they give you the courage and the inspiration to deal with the worst. But it is a -- look, it`s been every day for about two months, right? And the human toll, the death toll, you know, we went through 9/11, as you mentioned. 2,700 people died. We`re at 15,000 deaths now. So living with that every day takes a tremendous, tremendous toll.</p><p>WALLACE: Governor Cuomo, thank you for joining us. Thank you for spending some time with us tonight. We`re grateful for your time.</p><p>CUOMO: Thank you.</p><p>WALLACE: Brian, I thought it was so striking when he said you see the worst and you see the best.</p><p>WALLACE: What if I had told you on 9/12 something would come along in a generation and kill more people in New York? It is unbelievable. The virus doesn`t discriminate. The virus doesn`t pick the politicians that it`s going to call upon in this death and absence to be leaders, but here`s a guy who has emerged, three-term Governor of New York, the second Governor Cuomo of New York.</p><p>Coming up, Richard Engel reports on the countries that are managing at least thus far to start to tame this coronavirus.</p><p>WALLACE: And two doctors will tell us if we can do it here. Don`t go away. We`ll be right back.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Welcome back. And as countries around the world struggle to control the spread of this coronavirus, researchers are rushing to develop a successful vaccine as we`ve been discussing. But as much our country remains under these stay-at-home orders, other countries have managed to control the virus enough to start to re-emerge. One thing they all seem to have in common is extensive testing. Our Chief Foreign Correspondent Richard Engel has that story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RICHARD ENGEL, NBC NEWS CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Scientists have warned time and time again that this coronavirus hollowing out world capitals can`t be defeated without a vaccine. But several nations have proven it can be tamed.</p><p>Germany is already opening again, but it only came after months of countermeasures. Germany, with a large population, a quarter of the U.S., found a three-part formula to choke off the virus, and it`s not very complicated. Honesty, testing, and isolating the sick. While President Trump downplayed the virus as just a nasty cold in the early weeks.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It`s a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for.</p><p>ENGEL: Chancellor Angela Merkel took the exact opposite approach, leveling with Germans in March that 70 percent of them could become infected. Germany began testing extensively. By now it`s tested twice as many people per capita as the United States. And that wasn`t rocket science either. The tests aren`t complicated to make, and they`ve been available internationally for a while. In early March, I visited a lab in Germany, a company called Qiagen was making testing machines.</p><p>ENGEL (on camera): This will tell you if they have the coronavirus, if they don`t have the coronavirus, and what they probably do have, what they really have?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it will tell you that in just one hour.</p><p>ENGEL (voice-over): There were hundreds of these testing machines already in the United States at the time, but they didn`t get approval from the FDA to turn them on until nearly a month after my visit.</p><p>Germany didn`t lose that critical time, and now Germany is delivering care directly to people who need it so they can stay isolated. It`s a program called the corona taxi, but really it`s just old-fashioned house calls. And it`s not Germany. South Korea and the United States had their first confirmed COVID cases on the same day in January. Yet by March 8th, South Korea had done 700 times more tests per capita than the United States, which only recently caught up. And South Korea has been doing aggressive contact tracing using mobile phones and making the data available so people know where the hot spots are.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right now across the street, there would be a store that the patient had visited on April 4th.</p><p>ENGEL: The United States these days reports tens of thousands of new virus cases a day. South Korea today reported eight. Dr. Irwin Redlener is the Director of Columbia University`s Center of Disaster Preparedness and an NBC Analyst.</p><p>(On camera) When you look at how the United States has rallied in times of national crisis, during World War II when all the factories were converted into making war machines, what happened this time? We seem to have been unable to rise to this challenge on a government level.</p><p>DR. IRWIN REDLENER, DIRECTOR OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY`S CENTER OF DISASTER PREPAREDNESS: Yeah. Well, without being too political about this, what happened was Donald Trump. We had a President come into office that made a habit of misrepresenting facts and reality. So what the public got and what governors and mayors got was a very disorganized series of untruths, misstatements, and so on that created a tremendous amount of confusion.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ENGEL: There isn`t a secret plan for taming COVID-19. It`s obvious, be honest, test, isolate the sick and vulnerable, and do it without vacillating or theater. Some countries have done it. The U.S. has not. Brian, Nicolle.</p><p>WALLACE: It`s an unbelievably simple and painful truth to talk about it, we`re joined now by Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, infectious diseases physician and Medical Director for the Special Pathogens Unit at Boston Medical Center. And Dr. Vin Gupta, Pulmonologist and Global Health Policy Expert. Dr. Gupta, I`ll start with you. Can we catch up? I mean, is it too late for us to do what South Korea and Germany have done?</p><p>DR. VIN GUPTA, MSNBC MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely, Nicolle, we can absolutely catch up. But I think, you know, here`s the thing about something that Mr. Engel didn`t manage, which Italy, which Wuhan, which other countries, South Korea, implemented successfully in parallel with testing. That was strict social distancing measures. There was none of this patchwork approach in Georgia, tattoo parlors are going to open up, and in New York and Washington State, we`re going to be really regimented. There was none of that.</p><p>And so let`s be honest here. We need that approach, that policy consistent across all 50 states with scaling in home testing. So you talked about the drive-through they were doing in South Korea, the van that was doing these swab-and-sends. We need more of that. We need more saliva testing at home, more send-in swabs of nasal tests at home. We need to make it easier because we have bottlenecks that currently exist. But we also need social distancing. We need it now.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Dr. Bhadelia, when we are able to rely on doctors and nurses and put a case in your hands and ask you to change with circumstances the medical industry in our country has proven remarkably able to turn on a dime. When it`s become known that patients sometimes do better on their stomachs, when it`s become known that young adults are having a problem with stroke. Medicine`s moving in that direction to try to address both of those, but I guess you can only do so much and you depend on the data coming in.</p><p>DR. NAHID BHADELIA, MSNBC MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: We do. You know, I think underlying all of this response is a strong network of physicians, of scientists that are actually in real time communicating with each other about these phenomenon. So we need the official structure, the research infrastructure that allows us to share this data. But it`s not just the scientists and the doctors taking care of the patients. Hospitals are sharing their experiences about how to decontaminate respirators to use them again.</p><p>There`s only so much of a limit we can reach to. But just circling back to the testing point, there was data yesterday that said the earliest deaths in the United States were actually two cases in California a whole two weeks before the one in Washington State that was noticed. That means this disease was here since January in multiple cases as was mentioned in the northeastern modeling study. If that`s the case, we were missing the forest from the trees. We were still testing people with just travel history to China. So part of this is the testing is important for the individual, but moving forward, if we don`t have an idea of how big the problem is, where the clusters are, where the hot spots are, how are we going to have any kind of strategy to control anything once society opens?</p><p>WALLACE: Dr. Bhadelia, if I could follow up, to your point, The New York Times also reporting tonight that there were 10,000 cases in New York and 23,000 cases in five of the largest cities by March 1st, which is much earlier than the whole country was shut down and practicing social distancing. I wonder what moving forward we do to sort of address those blind spots of the past. What have we learned from the things that we missed in February and March?</p><p>BHADELIA: I think that one of the major things of course is that there are little details. You know, you just can`t say testing kits are available. There are little details along the entire pathway that make it impossible for us to get a picture of where the disease is, right? To do a test, you need a health care worker with personal protective equipment, with a swab, with the viral media that keeps the virus on the swab alive, all the way to everything that`s needed in the laboratory.</p><p>There are so many pinch points, all of which as Governor Cuomo said are actually applicable to national supply chains that haven`t been answered. But beyond that, we need a strategy for how we will efficiently test people, not just immediately everybody who needs it, but over time, over time as we continue to loosen criteria, going back to the same population and retesting them. What`s the strategy? And a huge part of this is going to be identifying hot spots. There were studies this week that showed that huge percentage of patients in homeless shelters from multiple cities have high rates of this infection without realizing that they have it. Those are exactly the hot spots we`re looking for, and that kind of surveillance over time is going to be necessary.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Dr. Gupta, it seems like I ask you at least once a week the following question, which I`ve found to be true thus far. Is your ability to get a test still largely dependent on your zip code, where you live and where you are on the social scale in terms of income?</p><p>GUPTA: Yes. And, you know, I mean one thing to note is a lot of people are consuming telemedicine, telehealth. The ecosystem of primary health care is changing to be more connected. But here`s the thing. To actually get to a physician or to a provider to potentially see if you need a test, you need a smartphone. You can`t just have a phone conversation for that interaction to be reimbursed. And so it`s not going to be provided. So these racial disparities we talk about, we could have an easy fix. Let`s get rid of the smartphone requirement, the audio/visual component. Let`s allow people to just chat on the phone, see if they meet certain criteria to get a test, or let`s scale up home testing. They`re doing it here in Seattle. Let`s do it for the country.</p><p>WALLACE: Dr. Gupta, you mentioned disparity. There`s also a real racial disparity in terms of who is paying some of the highest cost in terms of loss of life in cities like Chicago, Mayor Lightfoot said she was shocked when the first round of data came through. And I think of as, oh, 70 percent of the people who died in Chicago are African Americans and they represent a much smaller percentage than 70 percent in the city of Chicago. What`s being done on the science and medicine side to serve the communities hardest hit?</p><p>DR. VIN GUPTA, GLOBAL HEALTH POLICY EXPERT: Well, Nicolle, I mean, I think on the science side, we are trying to understand, are there other drivers other than what we know is already common, that across the socioeconomic spectrum, there are inequalities. And health care access, and you tend to have more -- you see more pre-existing lung disease, heart disease amongst those that don`t have access to care.</p><p>So is it as simple as that, which is a complicated socioeconomic social problem we`ve been wrestling with for a long time? Are there genetic drivers? We`re trying to figure that piece out. So there are some unknowns there, but there`s clearly health equity, health access issues that are driving poor outcomes in certain segments of society.</p><p>BRIAN WILLIAMS, MSNBC HOST: Just in the last break, I read a tweet that I sent to a physician friend of mine in the Twin Cities. It reads, telemedicine is now just medicine. It is very true. It still involves human doctors and two of the best have been our guests here in this segment tonight, Dr. Nahid Bhadelia and Dr. Vin Gupta. Our thanks as we always, thank you for coming on and finding time to take our questions.</p><p>Coming up for us, more of Savannah`s interview with Bill Gates. How he rates our federal government`s response to the pandemic and why the U.S. should continue to support the World Health Organization. And we`ll hear his response to becoming a right-wing target of conspiracy theories.</p><p>WILLIAMS: We are back into the final part of what was a fascinating conversation, Savannah Guthrie asks Bill Gates here about the decision to withhold funding from the World Health Organization and the many good ideas he says might come out of what we`re living through.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GUTHRIE: I know that you do your best to stay out of politics, and I`ll try to respect that. But I do wonder how you assess the response of our government in general, what grade you give. What is your view of how the federal government, how the states have responded to this crisis and where they could do better?</p><p>GATES: Well, you would have expected the U.S. not to have such widespread disease. The CDC is the best in the world. We`ll have plenty of time to go back and look at, you know, what happened before the disease hit that we haven`t rehearsed. You know, that retrospective work, you know, this is not the time for it. Now, it`s to get these drug trials going, you know, studying which opening up policies work well, get the contact tracing going. You know, it`s a tough situation but, you know, this is where we find ourselves and, you know, we`ve got to end it as quickly as possible.</p><p>GUTHRIE: The president has said that he`s going to put funding for the World Health Organization on hold. Your wife, Melinda Gates, also your partner in this work, has said that that was a mistake. What effect do you think that will have right now, pulling that funding in the midst of a pandemic, and what`s your view of that?</p><p>GATES: Well, I`m hopeful that the U.S. that historically is by far the biggest supporter of WHO. And, you know, reducing childhood deaths. You know, the U.S. was a leader in smallpox eradication. I`m hopeful that we won`t cut that money off. In fact, you know, WHO needs more resources during this time to step up to their role of international coordination.</p><p>And so, you know, although, you know, no one gets a perfect score in this thing, WHO is very, very important, and I hope the review will say, look, WHO, we`re with you. You know, when it`s over, we`ll look at how you can do even better. But the world needs to help here, and usually U.S. leadership helps the world deal with crises. The world wants the U.S. to play that role in terms of research and funding and collaboration.</p><p>GUTHRIE: Unfortunately, we do live in a time where disinformation abounds, and sometimes bad facts go viral. And you, yourself, have been a victim of that recently in the darkest corners of the internet. Some have even suggested that you were behind the pandemic. We don`t need to dignify those conspiracy theories, but I just wonder what you think about that and what your reaction is to that.</p><p>GATES: Well, you know, at one level, it`s serious. At one level, it`s, you know, so bizarre it`s hard to believe. You know, our foundation works on vaccines that have saved lives, millions and millions of lives. And that idea that we should have health equity globally, we should use the latest science, you know, we stand for that and, you know, we ought to be willing to withstand some criticism if it`s based on facts.</p><p>GUTHRIE: Let`s talk about the world going forward. I`ve given a lot of thought to this, and I`m sure you have too, about what`s changed, and possibly what`s changed forever. It`s an economic question. It`s a health question. It`s a philosophical question. Dr. Fauci said the other day, I think he was half joking, that maybe handshaking is a thing of the past now or should be. Have you thought about what`s changed forever?</p><p>GATES: I do think some of the digital approaches that were catching on anyway have been accelerated. You know, even I`m surprised that doing these meetings digitally for a lot of things works pretty well. You know, so business travel may get reduced even in normal times. You know, the idea that we really need experts in government, and they need to think through these scenarios to protect us, including, you know, for any future pandemic. I think that`ll be so clear to people that this time we will prepare for the next pandemic.</p><p>You know, beyond that, you know, everybody hopes that the cause they believed in before this happened somehow it fits in. So, you know, I think the speculation is great. I think it will be a lot of change. I hope it`s more about the world working together to solve big, big problems.</p><p>GUTHRIE: Yes, you`ve likened this fight against the coronavirus to a world war except for this time we`re all on the same side. We`re all fighting the same thing, this virus. How hopeful are you about ingenuity? You know, we saw innovation after World War II, incredible leaps in technology. Is this that kind of opportunity as well?</p><p>GATES: Well, I definitely think in terms of some of the health approaches, you know, making vaccines cheap and quickly, coming up with new classes of drugs that can address these things, the speed with which diagnostics can get out and, you know, sharing what you`re seeing through symptoms on the cellphone internet basis. There`s going to be some amazing innovation, and that will make us less vulnerable.</p><p>GUTHRIE: Well, that`s a hopeful note to end on, but I also have to ask you, you`re home as well. I know you`re working on behalf of the Gates Foundation, so your self-isolation is not equal to ours. I guess you`re not watching \"Tiger King\" on Netflix or eating too much. But, what are you doing with the extra time you may find yourself with these days?</p><p>GATES: Well, my daughter did get me to watch \"Tiger King\", you know, at night, a little distraction is allowed even though it`s a busy time. You know, thank goodness the internet both brings us information and brings us entertainment and lets us do these meetings online. You know, online schooling, some place is good, not good. But, you know, we`re, you know, crammed into less space, but there`s some virtues to that in terms of, you know, being together as we deal with something that is, you know, shocking and completely unexpected.</p><p>GUTHRIE: Bill Gates, thank you so much for your time. We really appreciate it.</p><p>GATES: Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Nicolle, think of it. At a time when income inequality has been right there, a front-burner issue in our country, and we`re watching the effects of it as so many people get crushed.</p><p>We have featured tonight in a two-hour special two billionaires. What do they have in common? They made their money in tech. They are giving the money they made in their adult business lives away, and they are heavily involved in this fight. We have also learned that when this is over, what we`re going to have in common is a used face mask and we all will have seen \"Tiger King\".</p><p>WALLACE: I had nightmares about the snakes in the mailbox after one episode. But I have to say those two that we featured are doing a lot. They`re going to have to do more. I mean, this is going to be a brutal, brutal, brutal economic -- period of economic despair, to be blunt, for --</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh yes.</p><p>WALLACE: -- people all over the world, not just in this country. And so I applaud their efforts. Everyone, everyone, we -- it is going to be a brutal reality. The things that we have to do to protect our communities and protect our loved ones are going to have really, really devastating economic impacts. They`re going to lead to economic insecurity, and we have to address that with the same sort of fervor, the same sort of moonshot marshal plan that we address the pandemic. And I`m sure that we`ll rise or I hope that we`ll rise to that occasion as well.</p><p>Still ahead for us, experts agree that until there`s a vaccine, testing, testing, testing, testing is our very best way to get a handle on the pandemic. Is the U.S. doing as much testing as it needs to, and do states have the materials and the capability to administer those tests? NBC`s Stephanie Gosk will join us with the breakdown. And NBC technology correspondent Jacob Ward will join us on the Google-Apple partnership hoping to mobilize your mobile phone to stop the spread of the virus. We`ll be right back.</p><p>WILLIAMS: As we`ve established, as you`re hearing day and night, across the country, there`s this urgent need for testing and contact tracing on a massive scale. And so our reporting team has the latest on the race to contain this virus.</p><p>NBC News technology correspondent Jacob Ward reports that contact tracing apps could soon help track the spread of this in this country. But first, NBC News correspondent Stephanie Gosk has our report on testing and the road to reopening.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEPHANIE GOSK, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The battle in the fight against COVID boils down to one thing, testing.</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, (D) NEW YORK: No one ever imagined this testing system was going to become hyper relevant to survival.</p><p>GOSK: A new study in Los Angeles indicates the number of people that have or had COVID-19 may be up to 55 times higher than previously known. Public health experts say it is not something states can handle alone.</p><p>DR. DAN HANFLING, CO-CHAIR, NATIONAL ACADEMY OF MEDICINE, MEDICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS: To ask the states to go about finding their own solutions is a recipe for disaster.</p><p>GOSK: Dr. Dan Hanfling has worked on national preparedness planning programs for presidents Obama and Trump. He says the Trump administration`s guidelines don`t go far enough.</p><p>HANFLING: It misses the mark widely because we don`t have the means for either testing or contact tracing. Both critically important if we are to understand prevalence of disease. It`s a fantasy to think that we`re going to be able to reopen safely in the absence of those capabilities.</p><p>GOSK: Right now, a million people are being tested a week, a number experts say needs to triple. Vice Admiral Raquel Bono oversees Washington State`s response to COVID-19. She says state labs could be processing more than twice the number of tests but lack critical supplies.</p><p>RET. VICE ADMIRAL RAQUEL BONO, DIRECTOR, WASHINGTON STATE COVID-19 HEALTH SYSTEM RESPONSE MANAGEMENT: It`s swabs and transport medium as well as reagent. The person who is using the swab and taking the sample also has to be in PPE.</p><p>GOSK: And each state is competing for these supplies.</p><p>BONO: We`re all pitted against each other trying to get the supplies that we know we need.</p><p>GOSK: Another obstacle, test accuracy, health officials tell NBC News they`re seeing inaccurate diagnostic and antibody tests, showing false positives or false negatives.</p><p>BONO: It is less accurate than we had hoped, and so there was a whole lot of false positives. It points out to the importance of being able to accurately and rigorously develop these tests so that we don`t inadvertently put people at harm.</p><p>GOSK: Without testing on a massive scale, we lack a clear picture of when stay-at-home orders can be lifted. But a recent report by 48 economists and social scientists suggests it can be done quickly. Dr. Danielle Allen of Harvard University is the lead author.</p><p>DANIELLE ALLEN, HARVARD UNIVESITY PROFESSOR: The best approach for economic recovery is one where we get to open and stay open. The way you open and stay open is by having the capacity to control the disease.</p><p>GOSK: Controlling the disease, she says, will require 5 million tests a day in order to start lifting restrictions in June, ramping up to 20 million tests a day by August.</p><p>But the key to getting there is national coordination. She suggests the federal government create a pandemic testing board to supervise testing, contact tracing, and supply chain issues.</p><p>How important is that centralized effort to having success in testing?</p><p>ALLEN: You really do need that centralized coordination in order to move things faster than the market itself could achieve.</p><p>GOSK: The argument among those who want to open up quickly is that we are going to have such dramatic economic costs in this country that it is -- the pain is not going to be worth it.</p><p>ALLEN: The argument we make with them is that the path we`re proposing gives you a stronger recovery.</p><p>GOSK: That plan estimates national testing, tracing and isolation would cost $15 billion a month compared to the cost of stay-at-home orders, $350 billion a month. And if no action is taken and restrictions lifted, there would be a sharp increase in deaths costing $15 to $20 trillion. The researchers say economic growth and testing go hand in hand.</p><p>ALLEN: This is a moment for (INAUDIBLE) America to show up. We can do this. Again, no law of physics has to be broken. It is purely a question of organizing ourselves to deliver on the capacity that we already have.</p><p>GOSK: Stephanie Gosk, NBC News.</p><p>JACOB WARD, NBC NEWS TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): I`m Jake Ward in San Francisco. If we`re going to reopen America, experts say we need a way to keep track of who is infected, who is not and where their paths have crossed. But we don`t have enough investigators to follow each other around. A human researcher can track down the past contacts of maybe two people a day. But for the first time, we`re talking about contact tracing hundreds of thousands of people.</p><p>DR. ART REINGOLD, EPIDEMIOLOGIST, UC BERKELEY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: Contact tracing is more than just were you in touch with Mr. Jones? Were you in 10 feet of proximity of Mrs. Smith? Technology could help with the process in a number of ways.</p><p>WARD: Scale is where technology can really help. Nearly all of the phones here in the United States run either Google or Apple operating systems. That`s why a Google-Apple contact tracing app due out in May is such a big deal. You want to know if you`ve been exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID? Maybe those phones can tell you.</p><p>(on camera): Let`s say I go running in my neighborhood and I pass a couple of people pretty closely. Well, their phone and my phone would be registered together as part of a contact history, and then if any of them were to test positive for COVID-19, well, I might be notified that I should probably be quarantined for two weeks.</p><p>(voice-over): The companies say you can choose whether to opt in. It`ll use Bluetooth to detect other phones rather than the GPS data that countries like China have been using. And your information won`t leave your phone unless you agree to share it. Oxford University researchers say 56 percent of the population has to use such an app for it to be effective.</p><p>The idea is that it`s all up to you. You decide if you want to report your test results. And if you were near someone who tested positive, the app will only offer advice on what to do. But health data is extremely personal data, and even if it`s kept secure, let`s imagine a world where a single notification from your phone changes your life.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To what extent are there follow-on limitations to my liberty or to my economic prosperity that comes from being tagged in this way?</p><p>WARD: The huge reach of these companies makes them the fastest way to monitor the nation. The question is, are we prepared for a world in which a computer program tells you whether you should stay home from work for the public good? Jake Ward, NBC News, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIAMS: So, Nicolle, the smart reporting also knows to leave us with a little hope, and these are hopeful nuggets amid a death toll you and I have just watched grow staggeringly high.</p><p>WALLACE: Yes, and it`s the theme we keep coming back to, American ingenuity, everyone doing their part. I think that, you know, when you watch that reporting about technology, there`s just a piece of me that worries that so many people will be distrustful because of the battering that our institutions have taken over the last decade of sort of American public life. So hope springs eternal. I guess we all order things on Amazon, or most of us do.</p><p>So there`s that.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes.</p><p>WALLACE: There`s still more to come though from us when our MSNBC special report \"Testing and the Road to Reopening\" continues. Don`t go anywhere.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. NAJY MASRI, LSU DIRECTOR, HOSPITALIST SERVICES, OCHSNER MEDICAL CENTER: We need more testing. We need expedited testing. We need to identify all of those individuals out there who are infected so we can get them to quarantine and self-isolate. And we need validation on that testing. We need to be able to trust a negative so that if we tell someone that they have a negative COVID test, we are comfortable that they are not infectious, that it`s a true negative and they can return to society and whatever the new normal is going to be.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Dr. Najy Masri in a city I love, New Orleans, Louisiana, pleading for validated tests. They passed a sad rubicund there today. The Governor John Bel Edwards announced that more people in his state have now died of coronavirus than died in Hurricane Katrina. Governor Edwards also said he hopes to start phase one of reopening Louisiana early on in the state of May. Nicolle?</p><p>WALLACE: It`s one thing that every single person in this country seems to agree on that more and better tests, more readily available tests, more user-friendly tests would help this country, would go a long way. The truth is right now as we sit here, Brian, we have a president who thinks the testing is just great, that it`s perfect.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, that`s a problem. I -- it all goes back to Crimson Tide for me. Even though Denzel was -- Gene Hackman was mean to Denzel, but that`s a subject for another time. Gene Hackman as captain of the submarine decided to hold a missile drill during a kitchen fire. He said that`s the best time to hold a missile drill. We`re having a kitchen fire that could consume the house. I worry about the missile drill. I worry, God forbid, about anything worse, and we have to all hope that the election is secured coming up in November.</p><p>For us, for now, these are all topics for another time. That`s going to do it for our two hours coverage.</p><p>WALLACE: Thanks for joining us tonight. \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" starts right now.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

It has proved substantially off-limits for much of the global medtech industry, and has rarely been in the early launch strategies of global companies. China's government wants that to change, as evidenced in the latest Five-Year Plan and the recent Healthy China 2030 report.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The changes that are underway are part of the new climate for business overseen by Chinese president Xi Jinping, who is trying to attract more foreign innovative companies. They include necessary structural changes and initiatives like special trade zones intended to increase China's appeal as a destination market. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But it wouldn't be China without some form of controls in place, Chinese-only standards and national UDI systems, etc. But these controls are decreasing incrementally, according to Nick Beckett, the co-head of life sciences and healthcare at international law firm CMS. Beckett, also head of Asia-Pacific IP at CMS, spends much of his time in Beijing and greater China. </p><p>With greater demand for the type of products and services routinely available in the Europe and North America, China has reached a health-care watershed, Beckett said.</p><p>Chinese Medtechs Under-Represented in Global Top Rankings </p><p>Four Chinese companies feature in Medtech Insight's Top 100 medical device companies by dollar-ranked revenues for 2018: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/200800304\">Lepu Medical Technology (Beijing) Co.

But demand in China is growing for the technologies that western patients already have access to. Changing attitudes about the value of healthcare will help transform China's health-care industry and market in the decade ahead. Mindful of the need for quality healthcare for the vast local population, top decision-makers, from Jinping down, are overseeing an ongoing process of support and investment in the sector.</p><p>The overall framework is set out in the 13th Five-Year Plan for economic and social development of the People's Republic of China 2016-2020, listing China's strategic intentions and major objectives, tasks, and measures for economic and social development. By the end of the plan, for a national population anticipated to reach 1.42 billion in 2020, the major goals are: doubling China's GDP and per capita personal income from 2010 levels; moving industrial production towards the medium-high end; and visibly supporting and fostering innovation-driven developments, business start-ups and internationally-competitive enterprises.</p><p>In a section dedicated to promoting a healthy China, the Plan promises deepened reform of the health-care system, an emphasis on prevention, and strategies to control of chronic diseases\u00a0 \u0336\u00a0 cardiovascular, neurological and vascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, respiratory disease and mental illness. It speaks of a tiered medical diagnosis and treatment system and promised to improve the capacity of general practitioners, with the number of active physicians targeted to reach 2.5 per 1,000 people. </p><p>A Role For Market Mechanisms And Reform In Key Areas </p><p>Enlarging the scale of the national health industry and perfecting the health-care services systems are two of the five specific goals of Healthy China 2030: A Vision for Health Care, released in October 2016 by Jinping as a blueprint for the changes China should make in the coming decade. With innovation at its center, it advocates a role for market mechanisms. In 29 chapters, it recommends 13 indicators and four core principles for how China must reform key public health services, food and drug safety systems and the Chinese medical industry.</p><p>The ground is increasingly fertile and the population is ready for the health-care reforms and delivery improvements of the kinds detailed in these two reports, according to Beckett. Speaking to Medtech Insight, he observed that, in healthcare, China is indeed at a turning point. The markets may have heard that before, but he expects real change to come.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>One reason for increasing optimism that China is more ready now to turn the corner is that the youth of the country, more connected through social media, international travel and foreign education and experiences, have a greater awareness than their parents' and grandparents' generations of what goes on beyond China. Other parts of the world have access to innovative devices and drugs and China's millennials are now demanding them too. Overseas companies are monitoring this, factoring in the impact it will have. Beckett observed that these companies will need to be more patient- and consumer-focused and ready to bring their new or yet-to-be-developed technologies into China to provide information and support local patients.</p><p>This comes at the same time that artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and the advantages offered by big data - a major focus in the Five-Year Plan 2016 - 2020 \u00a0\u0336\u00a0 are being brought to bear. AI is seen as a transformational step, and the next few years will be fascinating in terms of who will drive developments in the digital health-care ecosystem. China is a global leader in AI, alongside the UK and US. Its homegrown major tech groups, Tencent and Alibaba, especially, continue to make huge strides in digital health-care delivery. In some ways, the traditional big pharma companies, especially, appear to be unprepared for this change despite\u00a0the accelerated pace of developments over the past four to five years.</p><p>The uptake of AI in China is one of the focus areas of a CMS \"legal perspectives\" document titled \"AI in Life Sciences,\" which quotes a government prediction of the value of the Chinese AI industry in 2025: RMB400bn (according to the national \"Plan for the Development of a New Generation of AI\"). The puzzle is that pharma, and to an extent medtech too, while talking up the prospects of AI are still grappling with the hows and whys in terms of monetizing it and bringing it into business models. They still more often talk about specific bolt-ons only, but by contrast, China's Tencent, for one, is not waiting around (see below).</p><p>Awareness of Healthcare On The Up</p><p>The sense that China is ready to open for health-care entrants is boosted by the knowledge that, while the population has traditionally had a low fundamental awareness of health, a new awareness of that very fact means that remedial action is unavoidable. The millennial generation's attitudes will be a contributory factor to the speed of change ahead. </p><p>Historically, as a very poor country, China has lacked a health-care infrastructure. With no or low primary-care availability and no local general-practitioner interface, patients have been forced to into usually crowded hospitals to seek an appointment. With no yardstick for their ailments, patients have been prone to overreact to very simple issues, and so there remain big challenges around educational issues, and about patients being able to seek appropriate health-care attention for perhaps minor health issues. Here is an area where awareness, from an albeit low base, is set to rise markedly. </p><p>Coupled with that, China's new vision of itself as a \"strong and growing country\" in turn fosters notions that it should rightfully have good healthcare. That is still not the case in the large rural areas, but there, too, a better basic understanding of health is developing. The advent of technology, including personal health-care information apps that give basic information about conditions, are facilitating and driving that change.</p><p>In view of this, medtech companies should be providing support to those patients who are more receptive to it and maybe even more demanding of it. This will lead to demands for better basic health-care provision. Healthy China 2030 and its recommendations are central tenets of the administration, which now finds it must provide in the large rural communities the standard of health care enjoyed by the slightly more affluent people in Shanghai or Beijing. \"The government had to up its game in terms of quality of health-care services, and tied to the opening up of the market to private investment, it's apparent that it is all coming together,\" said Beckett.</p><p>'One China'</p><p>China's policies are built around a \"one country\" approach for health care, and good provision across the provinces and into the remote rural zones. Remote monitoring technology, such as telecare/telemedicine systems, is seen as increasingly critical in rural China. Allowing private investment is one of the strategies to develop health-care provision in China's the second- and third- tier cities.</p><p>The Five-Year Plan underlines the \"one country, two systems,\" approaches for Hong Kong and Macao. Hong Kong's current protests against its government over China's drive for more influence there are being watched closely for potential effects on business. China also seeks to build cross-Straits cooperation with Taiwan, under the One China approach. </p><p>Private healthcare, although still very small-scale, has been making inroads in China in the past three to five years, manifested in the establishment of specialist clinics for respiratory disease, for example. \"The groundwork has been done to allow greater investment now in both private and public private hospitals,\" said Beckett, adding however, that while China can \"move at the speed of light\" for building projects, etc, in policy, law and regulation it sometimes moves much more slowly. </p><p>Pilot Zones</p><p>Using pilot zones is a common approach of the Chinese authorities. A prime example in summer 2019 was the way it tested the new marketing authorization holder (MAH) tool for medtech. The MAH is a very significant concept that until recently did not exist in China. Medtech product license owners were typically the manufacturers. Only they could own the market authorization and they could only transfer it to another manufacturer. </p><p>With so much economic activity tied to manufacturing capability, this led to difficulties. The MAH system, first used in three zones and then in a further 21 this year, makes transferring market authorization much easier and will lead to contracts being set up in manufacturing development. Contract research organizations and contract sales organizations are expected to flourish in what will become a wider outsourcing environment. </p><p>But such processes often take several years, as the Chinese need to be totally comfortable before rolling out a scheme nationwide. </p><p>The medtech MAH rule is also seen as a boost for local innovation. \"It will be a move from basic and mid-level devices, to higher-end and probably higher-price devices, and thereby will help Chinese commercial operators be better able to compete globally,\" said Beckett. </p><p>Jinping's \"One belt one road\" (OBOR) trade outreach project focuses on improving connectivity and cooperation across Asia, Africa and Europe. Though not primarily a tool for medtech projects, if China were to develop large medtech champions, they too could use the OBOR to develop trading routes and find trading partners, eventually helping their global health-care trading plans.</p><p>Slow China   </p><p>Critics would argue that \"eventually\" has too often been a signature word for Chinese policy initiatives. The long-awaited amendment to the PRC Drug Administration Law was due to come into effect on 1 December 2019. It is a second major systematic and structural amendment to China's drug-administration framework since the implementation of the last significant amendment in 2001. But the amendment has been in the works since 2015. </p><p>The catalyst was the China's State Council's issuance in October 2017 of the Opinions on Deepening Regulatory Reforms to Encourage Drug and Medical Device Innovation. This proposed fundamental changes to regulatory systems, including the simplification of clinical trials, implementing the Drug Marketing Administration Holder system, establishing a patent-linkage regime and perfecting the drug-registration process. The marketing administration system for medtech is slowly and carefully coming into place now.</p><p>\"Politically, China tries to do things in such a way to get everyone on side; not to do anything suddenly,\" Beckett observed. A frustration is that several of China's regulatory authorities are often involved in looking at the same issues at the same time. For example, three were studying China's anti-trust and competition law. This overlap can slow down the passage of regulatory instruments. </p><p>In the medtech domain, the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), the Chinese agency for regulating drugs and medical devices, has been mulling the dropping of the country of origin (COO) certification requirement for \"priority\" devices that qualify for its \"green channel,\" a fast-track innovation approval pathway. But nervousness about making big decisions among individual regulatory executives has led to a situation where no decision has yet been taken. Regulatory officers would rather not make a decision than make a wrong decision. In terms of the COO, the nervousness is at individual level, not at a state level. \"Looking at it through the lens of the Chinese state, it's clear China is not in a hurry, I feel,\" said Beckett. </p><p>Green Channel For Medtech Is Still Underused </p><p>NMPA's green channel has not so far been called into action as much as had been anticipated. It was set up in 2014, but five years on, this route to fast-track certain devices remains underused by manufacturers. The consensus is that the initiative has value, however. And on the regulators' side, it is a sign of preparedness to expedite the right products, Beckett noted. </p><p>From a western company's perspective, as an initiative, it ties in with foreign clinical trials exemptions, quicker regulatory reviews, and products getting to market much faster, and indeed, coming to market first, he explained.</p><p>IP More Protected And Courts More Active </p><p>The regulations and infrastructure being put in place now in China are more internationally aligned, and are more acceptable to companies in the west, which are no longer worried quite so much about each and every step they take. In the area of intellectual property, China has formalized dialogs with judges in the US, UK and Japan, which is making China more internationally accepted. \"The lens is slowly changing, and we may soon have data exclusivity and a patent linkage system. We already have patent recognition and special courts protecting companies' rights,\" said Beckett. </p><p>The standards are changing and the infrastructure is being put in place that allows investors in China to have more confidence. From China's perspective, there is a drive to elevate domestic life-sciences companies to \"national champion level,\" so that they can eventually compete globally. Although there is a long way to go in the life sciences and health-care spaces, where there are ongoing learning requirements and need for talent and know how. This makes China receptive to foreign investment and assistance in ways which other industries\u00a0- for example, telecoms\u00a0- simply do not need.</p><p>The recent development in the Drug Administration Law (see above) also answers in some ways the need in China to align more with international standards. The authorities are looking at bringing in a pharmacovigilance standard, and are changing the emphasis from pre-approval to post-approval. The pre-approval stage in pharma is much faster now, enabling companies to bring products to market more swiftly, but at the same time, with increasing liabilities on them. China is on the same basic path in devices, making strides in exemptions from local clinical trials. \"It all fits,\" said Beckett.</p><p>Cleary, China is more prepared to use a mix of international and Chinese standards in its regulatory infrastructure. It is developing its own unique device identification system for medical devices, but using ISO-based, China-specific standards, GB, the code for national standards issued by the Standards Administration, and YY, the code for medical devices, issued by the NMPA. The medtech industry follows both sets of standards, says Chao Xu, co-founder of Chinese consultancy J-Medtec, in Berlin.</p><p>Imitation Helps Achieve Greater Goals</p><p>\"China is not afraid to copy - historically seen as a high form of flattery in China,\" said Beckett. Its law, for example, is very heavily based on European law, and the patent linkage system is partially derived from the US system.</p><p>The same principle applies in the case of WeChat, the multi-purpose messaging, social media and mobile payment app, owned by Tencent Holdings. Tencent specializes in internet-related services and products, has become bigger than the concept it imitated, Facebook, and is increasingly important in digital healthcare. It was the first Chinese firm to have a market valuation of over $500bn. Of the three big tech players in China, including Alibaba and Baidu, Tencent is the fastest growing in healthcare.</p><p>Tencent Trusted Doctor now claims to connect 440,000 certified doctors with more than 10 million patients online. It collaborates with Germany's <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/198601187\">Merck KGaA</url>, and it also operates WeDoctor, a web- appointments, education, diagnosis, and consultation tool. Alibaba is developing services to support China's primary care system through online doctor consultations.</p><p>Primary Care Issue To Be Solved</p><p>Such tools are gaining a lot of ground in the relative absence of primary care in China, where there are some very early-stage plans to install primary care services in hospitals and a push to establish smaller clinics that integrate technology. </p><p>At the same time, China sees the need to increase the standing and social status of general practitioners, who believe they are perceived as inferior to specialists. A 2017 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28664588\">survey</url> by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and others revealed that Chinese physicians bear heavy physical, mental and financial stress. Low confidence, trust and respect for them from wider Chineses society are their other complaints. Soberingly, over 70% would not encourage their children to follow their career path.\u00a0</p><p>Talent Being Brought In</p><p>China is encouraging foreign talent into the country, including in Nanjing, the heart of the Chinese pharma industry, to leverage the knowledge to innovate and help advance the local industry. Nanjing University is a leading university in the pharmaceutical field in China. The country is welcoming innovative products in the life sciences domain, but the government plans to retain the firm hand of control over any decisions. </p><p>Another tool for developing healthcare and local health-care business are the special zones, such as free trade zones and a medical tourist pilot zone. For example, Hainan province could take advantage of its location in the South China Sea to maximize the huge trading potential with Vietnam, the Philippines and Thailand, among others. </p><p>Action Vs Corruption</p><p>Jinping has led a big push to rid the country of corruption at all levels over the past five or six years. The historical problem with corruption partly lies in the multiple layers of distributors and the power of money. After the Chinese government fined <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/198601356\">GlaxoSmithKline PLC</url>\u00a0for $436m for illegal kickbacks in 2014, companies have redoubled their compliance and auditing activities, set up proper local training, and reviewed their procedures. </p><p>But the involvement of third parties in sales and marketing still presents challenges, as it means manufacturers losing sight of what happens and possibly losing control. The government has tightened up this whole area by reducing distributor numbers, slimming down brands, introducing invoice controls and generally tidying up the system. \"[Corruption] was built in, and changing it has been a big challenge, but Xi Jinping has taken strong action and it's now a lot better than it was,\" said Beckett.</p><p>The tariff issues between the US and China have done nothing to help China's global trade ambitions, but the effects are being seen in the US too, where providers are having to consider finding alternative sources for Chinese imported devices. VC funding has been impacted recently by the US trade tensions after a big VC funding uptake in 2018.</p><p>Strategic Signposts Point To More Healthcare</p><p>The Five-Year Plan and Healthy China 2030 initiative are strategic signposts for massive change, and a strong indication of where China is focusing. </p><p>They acknowledge that Chinese role model names in medtech and pharma are not there as yet, and at present, aspiring innovators in China are looking at companies like <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/198600174\">Johnson &amp; Johnson</url>\u00a0as models to emulate. </p><p>They underline the critical nature of partnerships to success in China. And they encourage \u00a0companies to \"be the first in China,\" under the package of measures being developed for the health-care products industries. China has not yet featured in the launch strategies of global companies at an early stage: it used to be at the very end of such plans. Now, it's getting to a point where companies might consider to launch in China first. \"But it's very early days there, and that notion needs more time,\" said Beckett. </p><p>Locally, investment is being improved, as seen, for example, in the new health-care incubator fund in Shenzen, in the Greater Bay Area. It is a government-funded initiative, and does not yet involve huge figures, but it is an attempt to encourage start-ups from all over the world to come to China. </p><p>Conservative China Is Serious About Health-care Improvement </p><p>Conservative China's plans make it one to watch in health care in the next five years. Its plans, central government-led, are seen as critical for China, targeting an area of great need, and providing opportunities for western and Chinese companies alike. The market is there, the infrastructure is being put in place, and there is a move towards a more consumer-led, innovative economy. China plays the long game, but it seems that western minds can probably have growing confidence - and less nervousness - regarding future medtech and pharma business with China. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>By <url normalizedValue=\"mailto:ashley.yeo@informa.com\">Ashley Yeo</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDINS-MT126028</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDINS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSH-WS01-F0JS-Y52V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436901</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3750\"/><timeReceived>4:26 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Informa All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Medtech Insight</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"48260\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 19, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000C9XA</classCode><className>LEPU MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY (BEIJING) CO LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC0009DNU</classCode><className>GEOPHARMA INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC000A7YY</classCode><className>JIANGSU YUYUE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT &amp;

Digital technologies will expedite the process. Yet critics claim health care is too slow to transform. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2020 will be the year when the industry shake-out from the EU Medical Device Regulation will become fully visible; until now, it has been mainly silence and speculation. The MDR has united medtech executives on one thing: it must not slow down access to innovation for patients. But is it a failure in waiting? \u00a0\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Innovation will remain the spine of the industry, but disruptive forces are telling manufacturers the old business model won't suffice. Tomorrow's medtech champions will target wellness, consumers, disease management, diagnostics, data management, the remote patient, chronic disease management and genomics, as well as clinical research. Is a major shake-out coming?                                                                                                       </p><p>\"Digital is no longer a vertical, it cuts across all sectors. It is a horizontal.\" Andy Fish, AdvaMed's chief strategy officer, was telling the press in late fall 2019 that medtech companies will come to incorporate digital as a means to an end, not as an end in itself. \"Digital is now the coin of the realm,\" he said, explaining the rationale behind the US industry association's decision to invest time and resources in a new Center For Digital Heath. (<url normalizedValue=\"http://medtech.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//MT125785//\">\"Reimbursement A Top Goal For New Digital Health Lobbying Center\" \"Medtech Insight\"</url>)</p><p>It is further recognition of the health-care value of digital, now and in the future, and another step on the road to the integration of modern methods of care delivery. It is also a reflection of the transition in health-care industries from supply push to demand pull. </p><p>Innovation spawns early adopters, but they are not the real market for medtech companies of any size. Delegates were reminded of this essential truth at the French annual medtech start-ups meeting, in spring 2019 (see below). In such a fast-moving climate, there can be a tendency to overplay the early prospects of a technology - digital or \"traditional.\" Later in a technology' lifecycle, the continual, incremental and less-visible changes that make a real difference tend to be underplayed.</p><p>This also applies to value-based health care (VBHC), where much is happening even if progress is not as fast as expected, according to Eric Th\u00e9paut, president for Europe, Middle East and Asia, at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/198601188\">Boston Scientific Corp.</url> (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://medtech.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//IV124306//\">\"MedTech Forum 2019 The Future Is Here But Industry Still Needs A LongTerm Vision\" \"In Vivo\"</url>) VBHC, he said, \"is a long-term initiative where a step-by-step approach is needed.\" It is a delivery concept that one day will become mainstream, similar to how once disruptive medical tools and technques, nanotechnology, molecular diagnostics, point-of-care testing and telehealth for instance, are now factored in as part of the medtech routine.</p><p> Elsewhere in medtech, other routines are changing fast: 2020 will see the biggest change to EU medtech regulation since the 1993 Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC), when the EU Council's Medical Device Regulation (MDR, 2017/745) comes fully into force. That is the promise. But as the clock ticks down to implementation day on 26 May, the magnitude of the task has been causing more and more jitters. Many stakeholders want the EU to acknowledge that, while the MDR is generally welcomed, it is coming too soon. It's certainly the right thing to do, but it is arriving too fast, so it is actually the wrong thing to do, to paraphrase <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/199500181\">ResMed Inc.</url>\u00a0CEO Mick Farrell, during MedTech Europe's MedTech Forum panel discussion in Paris in May 2019.

There were seven under the MDR, and two under the IVDR for in vitro diagnostics, as of 8 November 2019. Under the previous EU directives, there were 58 such organizations. This prospective shortage of resources makes the new regulation work against high-quality patient care, the very thing the MDR promises to strengthen. (<url normalizedValue=\"http://medtech.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//MT125918//\">\"BSIs Gary Slack Explains Why MDR TakeUp Is So Slow\" \"Medtech Insight\"</url>)                               </p><p>Signs of a more flexible approach from the European Commission appeared in October 2019, when talk emerged of some Class I products additionally being able to use the MDR's four-year grace period, remaining under MDD oversight until 2024. There was also a proposal for a two-year delay to 2022 in Eudamed. These moves open the door to possibly further concessions from the commission in 2020, which would suit most of industry very well. Brexit - effectively voted through by the 12 December UK general election\u00a0 \u0336 \u00a0throws a spanner in the works, and may yet be the catalyst that allows a more concerted rethink on MDR timetables without the commission changing its sacrosanct policy line on implementation.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>Favorable Demographic Trends Are There To Be Exploited   </p><p>On a broad scale, the outlook for medtech business is good, with global healthcare expected to benefit from continued favorable demographic trends. The world's population is anticipated to grow by more than a billion by 2030. The number of people over the age of 60 is forecast to rise by 500 million, to 1.4 billion, with the prevalence of cancer, cardiovascular diseases and other long-term conditions rising in tandem. Medtech is a safe if maybe unexciting investment, with average market growth in the mid- to high single digits expected to be perpetuated in the near term. \u00a0 </p><p>Average health-care spending is expected to increase annually by 4% to 5%. Next year, around half (some $4trn) of all health-care spending will be targeted at cancer, and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, according to Deloitte's Global Healthcare Sector Outlook.</p><p>This is good news for medtechs companies, but there is a complication: innovation is changing. Big-scale innovations in the traditional device areas are becoming fewer. An increasing amount of innovation is coming from digital iterations and advances. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/198600101\">Abbott Laboratories Inc.</url>'s recent Merlin 10.0 app for the CardioMEMS HF sensor system is designed to keep heart failure patients out of hospital and allows physicians to communicate directly with them is just one example of where large companies are able to broaden their offerings with digital enhancements. (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://medtech.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//MT125753//\">\"Abbott Launches New App To Keep Heart Failure Patients Out Of The Hospital\" \"Medtech Insight\"</url>) </p><p>The US FDA is fully behind mobile apps, aware of their potential to help individuals manage their own health and wellness and gain access to useful information when and where they need it. The US, arguably the most fertile and receptive market for medtech innovation, is once again leading the way in a new cornerstone of the industry, just as it did in fall 2013, when it broke the turf on implementing unique device identification (UDI). </p><p>It seems mobile apps are being adopted almost as quickly as they are developed: in 2017 alone, 325,000 health care apps were available on smartphones, according to FDA-reported industry estimates. The agency posted an updated Policy for Device Software Functions and Mobile Medical Applications Guidance (\"MMA guidance\") in fall 2019.(<url normalizedValue=\"http://medtech.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//MT125679//\">\"Industry Optimistic About Second CDS Draft Guidance FDA Releases More Final Software Guidances\" \"Medtech Insight\"</url>)</p><p>Into The Data-Driven Era Of The 2020s </p><p>Apps are where the medtech and digital confluence is at its most obvious. Digital is prompting a rethink among those medtechs who are reviewing whether they should be targeting consumers and wellness, or patients and sickness. The simplistic view is that there is a clear marketing advantage, at least, in seeking\u00a0 consumer/wellness branding, accoring to ZS principal Brian Chapman. (<url normalizedValue=\"http://medtech.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//IV124303//\">\"MedTech Forum 2019 Consumers And Wellness Or Patients And Health Care\" \"In Vivo\"</url>) But as a rule, medtech has yet to view patient-consumers as its real customer; its efforts are still focused largely on provider systems.\u00a0 </p><p>Nevertheless, medtech is \"truly beginning to acquire the tools and capabilities that will allow it to enter a data-driven, personalized new era,\" according to Kevin Lobo, chairman and CEO of <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/198600402\">Stryker Corp.</url>, and the current AdvaMed chairman. EY's latest annual Pulse of the Industry report (2019) quotes Lobo as saying that data-driven medical devices will be at the forefront of health care's transformation. Digital and AI are currently the standout features in an industry that in his view has seen \"generally conservative activity\" in the past year.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/198601188\">Boston Scientific Corp.</url>'s Th\u00e9paut agrees, and says there is no changing course now. \"Digitization is going to completely transform health care, albeit later than has happened in the consumer world,\" he said, alluding to the type of criticism often directed at health care. But there are clear reasons for this to be so. \"We are focusing on patients in a highly-regulated industry, and health care will always be unique.\" Commoditizing it would not be good for the ecosystem or the patient; however, it will evolve significantly, he believes.</p><p>Patients were arguably already \"at the center,\" but now they are going to be even more so, with device-derived information more fluid and available faster. At present, the European industry remains focused on products and therapeutic value, but what is required, in Th\u00e9paut's view, is a very open dialog with patients. US FDA guidance seems to acknowledge this shift (see below). Indeed, at the 2019 MedTech Forum, it was sobering to find both that the medtech industry was unable to pin down all the benefits that digital could bring; and that it was open about that. </p><p> \"Blurring Everything\"</p><p>While the medtech industry is still \u00a0at the digital learning stage, initiatives like AdvaMed's rebooted Center For Digital Heath will fill in many of the knowledge gaps. The CDH will look at adoption, regulation and reimbursement of digital tools across the industry. The big medtech names and certain software manufacturers are already members. How its agenda shifts will be likely be significant in telling us how health care will be delivered in the 2020s, and by whom.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>The British In Vitro Diagnostic Association (BIVDA) is going along the same path. BIVDA chairman Darren Stenlake of (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/198600763\">Sysmex Corp.</url>) told an association meeting in early October that \"digital is blurring everything,\" and highlighted the UK industry's plans to focus a new working group on IT infrastructures, cybersecurity and malware.</p><p>Unmatched Appetite For Innovation</p><p>But it will not be to the total detriment of traditional medical technologies. Indeed, innovation levels are currently at seldom-reached heights, to judge from activity at the US FDA, which broke its new novel medical devices approvals record in 2018 with at 100 new device approvals. (<url normalizedValue=\"http://medtech.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//MT124486//\">\"2018 US Device Approvals The Year Of De Novos And Digital Health\" \"Medtech Insight\"</url>)\u00a0 Nevertheless,\u00a0 as an investment proposition, medtech is currently perceived as less favorable than biopharma, and the intense competition within the sector means a clear run on innovation does not last for very long. But the appetite for and pace of innovation in medtech cannot be matched. </p><p>The consensus is that massive opportunities are available in medtech, as seen in <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/198600101\">Abbott Laboratories Inc.</url>'s significant breakthrough with MitraClip.

It does not attract greater direct reimbursement, but it helps reduce in hospital stay length, and thus generates a secondary reimbursement effect. It's another example of the value-based, holistic care approach that will be the strapline fopr increasing numbers of medtech innovators in the coming decade.\u00a0 </p><p>M&amp;A Environment Changes To Affect Start-ups?</p><p>A cautious mood has settled in regarding M&amp;A targets, especially given the strong valuations at present. In our annual table of major M&amp;A, the list of purely medtech-focused $1bn+ acquisitions is relatievly short (see below). It is a cautious environment at present that will extend into 2020.</p><p>The MDR will also have a telling effect on those who succeed in the EU markets, who will be acquired and when, and which companies will decide to bite the bullet and cut programs and products. Another pressure on companies is that thay are increasingly expected to gain reimbursement before they can make an exit. And all this against an environment of overall industry financing levels declining for the second consecutive year in 2018, claims EY. However, venture capital continues to flow into medtech.</p><p>A good indication of where there are new seams to be exploited is provided by Cleveland Clinic Innovations in its Top 10 Medical Innovations, the annual showcase from the US hospital group that was voted US News &amp; World Report's \"2019-20 Best Hospital.\" Cleveland Clinic Innovations predicted in fall 2019 that the following technologies, procedures and trends would be gain ground in 2020:</p><p>                                           Minimally-invasive mitral valve surgery (see above). This will further expand in the US, to individuals with secondary or functional MR, despite optimal medical therapy. The mitral valve is defective in around one in 10 individuals over the age of 75, causing regurgitation, so this is an important new treatment option.</p><p>Closed-loop spinal cord stimulation. Chronic pain is a reason for prescription of opioid medication, but spinal cord stimulation also provides electrical stimulus to the spinal cord. Closed-loop stimulation allows for better communication between the device and the spinal cord, and can reduce unsatisfactory outcomes due to subtherapeutic or overstimulation events. </p><p>Biologics in orthopedic repair.

Genomics company       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/201600030\">Grail Inc.</url> secured a total of $1.6bn, disease diagnosis company       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/200900318\">23andMe Inc.</url>, $795m, and health-care services delivery company Babylon Health, $635m. The big rounds went to companies innovating across health insurance\u00a0 \u0336 \u00a0Clover Health raising $500m (series E), and genomics company Ginkgo BioWorks, $290m (series E), for instance.</p><p>Notable in this list of 150 was how many Chinese firms occupy top rankings. The world's second-largest economy is investing significantly in health care, now a national priority as the population ages and demands better care. The Chinese health-care market is growing at a 17% compound annual growth rate, according to the World Health Organization.</p><p>The report showed that China's tech giant Tencent was a top three investor in digital health start-ups (based on the number of portfolio companies), alongside Google and Microsoft - these three representing over 70% of digital health deals made by the key big tech companies. Google is the undisputed leader in digital health investment, says CB Insights, mainly in genomics, clinical research, and insurance and benefits. Its subsidiaries and investment vehicles include Alphabet, Google Ventures, CapitalG, Gradient Ventures, Verily Life Sciences, and incubators such as Google Launchpad Accelerator. Intel, Samsung, Alibaba, Amazon, and Comcast have likewise almost all reached household-name status in digital healthcare. In November 2019, Google said it was acquiring FitBit for $2.1bn, boosting its presence in the wearable technology market. (<url normalizedValue=\"http://medtech.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//MT125855//\">\"Google Buys Fitbit In 21Bn Deal Rivaling Apple\" \"Medtech Insight\"</url>) </p><p>These groups' top targets are not medtech per se, but the provision of a wider wellness offering that encompasses data management, diagnostics, remote patient monitoring, drug delivery, telemedicine and chronic disease management, as well as genomics and the other leading targets listed by Google. The clinician expertise still resides among medtechs large and small, which the big techs do not have ready access to - and maybe do not want. But there is no hiding from the fact that these developments show how the health-care delivery model is undergoing huge change. </p><p>Real World Evidence And Massive Potential Of AI</p><p>AI and machine learning are increasingly being used in the development of therapy solutions, therapy delivery and provision of data for assisting biopharma clinical trials. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/200700461\">Ixico Ltd.</url>, for instance, is working on neuroimaging methods that provide more accurate and richer brain structural and functional information. The 60-person company can also capture, analyze and measure digital biomarker data supplied by wearable biosensors or mobile devices. These are for parameters such as sleep, activity and heart rate. The aim is to deliver patient-centric, clinically-meaningful and objective data from patient subjects. </p><p>Better-targeted success has been an aim in neurological disease clinical trials for some time. There are still no effective therapies available to slow the progression of Alzheimer's, and a growing realization that new ideas are needed. Cognetivity, another small company, is developing a sensitive visual categorization platform in conjunction with advanced AI algorithms to cluster test performance in terms of accuracy, speed and image properties. It wants its technology to be seen as a blood pressure test-equivalent for dementia patients for use up to 20 years before symptoms appear.</p><p>Genomics' Rising Role In Healthcare Management</p><p>The awakening of minds to the potential of genomics is arguably the biggest single positive development that will guarantee the success of targeted therapy in the decade ahead. Genomics is one of three new industries (alongside digital and diagnostics) that the UK Life Sciences Industrial Strategy (LSIS), and NHS England's second \"sector deal\" aim to establish in the coming years. (<url normalizedValue=\"http://medtech.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//MT125253//\">\"UK Plugs Into Golden Period For Medtech Innovation\" \"Medtech Insight\"</url>)</p><p>The LSIS was authored by John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University, who is a champion of genomics and of the power it brings to identify at-risk individuals with greater precision.

Conditions such as cancer, stroke, heart disease and diabetes can be treated or prevented through early and regular use of diagnostics. But despite widespread recognition of their value, diagnostic services have suffered from chronic under-investment within health-care systems, and slow or even non-availability of in vitro diagnostic tests in mainstream medicine. </p><p>The message of\u00a0 \"the earlier and the more targeted, the better\" has become better understood with the success of AI and machine learning, and the power of big data. Diagnostics' true value is thus becoming more visible, and the importance of early diagnosis is being elevated in initiatives like the NHS Long Term Plan. The LTP states that by 2021, pathology networks will deliver quicker test turnaround times and improved access to more complex tests at less overall cost. </p><p>In vitro diagnostics are the biggest subsegment of world medtech market of $426bn in 2018, accounting for\u00a0almost $55.4bn, driven by testing for cancer, diabetes, HIV and other sexually-transmitted dieseases, and malaria, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/infographics/medical-devices-market-100085\">Fortune Business Insights</url>.\u00a0 By 2021, the overall in vitro diagnotics market will have risen to $70bn, according to a 2019 global industry outlook       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.iqvia.com/-/media/iqvia/pdfs/library/white-papers/global-outlook-on-the-in-vitro-diagnostics-industry.pdf?_=1573127928197\">white paper</url> from IQVIA Medtech. </p><p>The MDR And Brexit</p><p>The end of 2019 proved busy for EU regulators, having agreed to another delay to the UK's Brexit to 31 January 2020 (which will be enacted by that date in the wake of the UK general election -\u00a0see above), and still having to face the EU Medical Device Regulation's (MDR) ambitious timetable. But in a welcome show of flexibility, as reported, the EU delayed Eudamed by two years until 2022, for products of all risk classes, and mooted a corrigendum on Class I up-classified devices in early 2020 - allowing certain class I devices to qualify for the four-year MDD extension that the higher risk classes enjoy.</p><p>What happens in 2020 is in the gift of the European Commission. The general view is that the EU is prone to pushing things to the last moment, so it is likely that more of the three-year MDR transition until 26 May 2020 will be eroded before any more contingencies are offered. But with the timing too tight, the consequence could be a raft of products needed by patients coming off the EU market on 26 May. </p><p> The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) no longer has a voice at EU level; the Brexit vote has meant the UK has not been attending EU meetings or been included on early EU planning. One school of thinking sees that as regrettable, given that the MDR is the biggest hurdle and biggest change for the EU medtech industry since the early 1990s, when the first European Economic Community directives began to emerge. The negatives that the MDR has attracted have so far overshadowed its good elements, notably unique device identification and Eudamed, among other benefits.</p><p>Ed Rozynski, senior international advisor at the US Medical Device Manufacturers Association (MDMA), says that the MDR is a front-and-center issue for the MDMA's member companies in the US. He fears that companies and/or products might disappear, and that it could impact the availability of products at health-care providers. \"We want it to be seen as a public health bottleneck, not just a regulatory bottleneck,\" he said. US trade officials have suggested that the US could help build notified body capacity. A trigger for EU intervention could be supply chain shortages at hospitals, which would quickly lead to a political solution. Rozynski believes that, in the end, the regulations won't change until the deadline is reached, or very soon before.</p><p>And on Brexit, which has been the No. 1 concern of new MHRA director of devices Graeme Tunbridge, making predictions has so far proved pointless. The fears of industry persist, and industry associations are very busy, but Brexit's effects on business and regulation remain an ongoing uncertainty. Rozynski speculated in late October that a post-Brexit trade agreement with the US could be made within three or four months and could \"build bridges between two like-minded regulatory authorities.\" </p><p>US Tax And China Bumps In The Road</p><p>With 2019 elapsing quickly, the US 2.3% excise tax is still an ongoing issue for the US MDMA and wider US industry. It wants it removed permanently. It is more likely that temporary fixes will still be the reality. The US industry should know the fate of the tax by by mid-January 2020, which is when the first of the fortnightly tax demands would start to be made. The tax was suspended between 2016 and 2019. The MDMA is not alone in working on a solution for industry; AdvaMed wrote to US President Donald Trump in mid-October soliciting his support for a permanent repeal of the medical device tax.</p><p>The China-US trade tariffs dispute has made it harder for US buyers to secure Chinese-made devices. No end to the stand-off is in sight. The US might investigate alternative sources from low-cost sources, such as Mexico, Costa Rica and South-East Asia.\u00a0 </p><p>Big M&amp;A Deals In Medtech In 2019   </p><p>M&amp;A spending increased in the 12 months to June 2019, reports EY, but the uplift came from a larger number of smaller deals.

There are six eternal factors that medtechs must address to ensure continuity of business and sales growth: </p><p>                                                                                         Demographics. Medtechs must find the opportunities that arise on the back of the growing, aging global population, given that demand for cost-efficient health-care solutions will continue to intensify; </p><p>                                              Emerging countries. These represent new market opportunities, but securing a balanced portfolio geographically is something even industry leader Medtronic has not mastered fully. As global affluence grows in tandem with awareness of the benefits of healthcare, greater opportunities for medtechs to invest in private and public health-care systems will appear;</p><p>                                              Long-term conditions. These continue to rise in importance as a function of demographic change and lifestyle-related issues; </p><p>                                              Health-care providers. These are transforming and consolidating, and at the same time are introducing new remuneration models for health-care services, with valued-based health-care concepts becoming slowly but surely more central. Digitization and artificial intelligence are likely to be key enablers for health-care providers; </p><p>                                              Readiness and the ability to take new the opportunities that are emerging. The range spans robotics; M&amp;A opportunities; big data approaches to research and commercialization opportunities offered by digital, AI, and machine learning; the tighter regulatory climate in many parts of the world, from the EU, to Asean countries to the EAEU bloc; the ever-present threat of public scrutiny; the fact that prevention and early diagnosis are receiving more than mere lip service now; targeted therapy; the move towards home-based care and away from the inpatient setting; and the change in attitudes to business in general that will be ushered in by the millennial generation as they begin to occupy senior medtech management posts; and above all\u00a0 </p><p>                                              Overall patient experience. As Eric Th\u00e9paut said at the MTF 2019 (above), this must continue to be enhanced to provide better outcomes accompanied by an overall reduction in the cost of care.

I`m Katy Tur, again, in for Nicolle Wallace. \"MTP DAILY\" starts right now with Chuck Todd.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hi, Chuck. Hello.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHUCK TODD, MSNBC HOST: Katy Tur.</p><p>TUR: Charles.</p><p>TODD: How are you? I see -- look, that`s what Pete does to me. By the way, next time, if Pete Williams ever does a Katharine on you, just call him Lewis.</p><p>TUR: You know, I had someone online yesterday say, I was surprised to find out that Katharine was your full name. And I said, really?</p><p>TODD: Well --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD: Yes. Is it that hard to figure out?</p><p>TUR: Well, apparently.</p><p>TODD: It`s like, oh, you`re a Charles? Yes, most Chucks are.</p><p>TUR: Yes.</p><p>TODD: Yes.</p><p>TUR: Katy, Katharine. What are you going to do?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD: All right. Thank you, Katy.</p><p>TUR: You bet.</p><p>TODD: If it`s Thursday, it`s the eye of the tweetstorm.</p><p>Good evening. I`m Chuck Todd here in Washington and welcome to MTP DAILY. If it`s Thursday, the President is making assertions that, to some, come across as paranoid, conspiratorial, full of projection, and at times, a bit Orwellian.</p><p>And if that isn`t concerning enough, we`re learning that some of the most important people whose jobs are to act as a guardrail against the President`s behavior or instincts are leaving, giving up, rationalizing it, or simply being ousted.</p><p>Folks, that is a recipe for bad things getting worse. So let`s dive in. The President today all but said reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. He suggested, without evidence, because there is none, that part of the tape of him on camera in that interview with my colleague, Lester Holt, was fudged, as he puts it.</p><p>OK. Not true. You might remember that was the interview where the President said, yes, he fired James Comey in part because of the Russia investigation. That was just one baseless allegation in a series of baseless allegations about the press, books, tapes, journalistic sources, and news executives that he claims are all conspiring against him.</p><p>The President, also, went after a top Justice Department official by claiming that this official was involved in some kind of Russian collusion and should be fired because of it.</p><p>The President suggested that he ousted his White House Counsel, Don McGahn, just 24 hours after saying McGahn was leaving on his own accord.</p><p>Folks, McGahn was a key check on some of the President`s impulsiveness. McGahn also testified to Bob Mueller extensively about his boss`s impulses, which reportedly included at least two attempts to fire Mueller.</p><p>So yesterday, we learned that McGahn is leaving. Today, we learned that the White House ethics lawyer is out effective tomorrow. And it looks as if the Attorney General is likely going to be ousted after the midterms according to several top Senate Republicans.</p><p>And amid it all, we`re hearing some Senate Republicans either shrug their shoulders or tell themselves that Hillary Clinton would be more corrupt or that the President is just too inept to commit a crime like conspiring with Russia.</p><p>Let`s bring in tonight`s panel. Sahil Kapur is a national political reporter with Bloomberg News. And they had a big interview with the President a few minutes ago, so we get some scoop there.</p><p>Daniella Gibbs Leger, a senior vice president for the Center for American Progress.</p><p>And Brad Todd is a Republican strategist and ad maker. I haven`t seen you in a while. Welcome back.</p><p>BRAD TODD, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Thanks a lot.</p><p>TODD: All right, Sahil, the President -- let`s get to the quick news here -- making quick headlines. I guess the biggest one is Jeff Sessions` job is safe for 60 days.</p><p>SAHIL KAPUR, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, BLOOMBERG NEWS: That`s correct, at least 60 days. The President would not comment when my colleagues asked him what would happen to the Attorney General after that, but there`s widespread speculation, given the President`s very public attacks on his A.G., that his job may not last beyond that.</p><p>Now, Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, said earlier this week he has total confidence in Jeff Sessions and he should stay exactly where he is. That is a signal that McConnell doesn`t want anything to mess with the Kavanaugh hearings.</p><p>And the second things is, who do you put in his place if you get rid of Jeff Sessions? It`s a 50 to 49 Senate right now. Some of those Republicans are not going to be comfortable supporting another A.G. unless they promise to protect the Russia investigation and the Mueller probe, which is precisely why it seems the President wants Sessions gone. So it`s hard to know, you know, what the end game is here.</p><p>TODD: Let me underscore this midterm issue, though, Daniella and Brad, because I think the voters are going to have a say as to the future of Jeff Sessions. Meaning this, my theory is if somehow Democrats win the Senate, that actually might change Republicans` calculations in the Senate. If somehow they won the Senate.</p><p>Brad, is that a fair -- that, all of a sudden, you`d have a different set of -- because, right now, you have a bunch of Republican senators that are going, look, he`s popular with the base.</p><p>B. TODD: Well, it wasn`t widely noted last fall when Charles Grassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, sent out a tweet that that said I have no time to schedule any Attorney General confirmation hearings this year.</p><p>Some people may have noted that, last week, he said that now he does have some time. And he changed --</p><p>TODD: Yes. And he`s got a separate beef.</p><p>B. TODD: He does.</p><p>TODD: He does have a separate beef with the --</p><p>B. TODD: He does. But you can`t have a new Attorney General until you have hearings to confirm a new Attorney General, and you can`t do it on the floor until you have a majority leader willing to schedule a vote on the floor.</p><p>So even if the did want to fire Jeff Sessions, he`s going to be replaced with Rod Rosenstein. And so the -- and until the Senate Republicans decide that they think it`s time.</p><p>TODD: So is that -- that`s why it feels as if, at the end of the day, Mitch McConnell is a calculator. And I mean that as a compliment. He reads the tea leaves. And it`s about being in power. And if he`s not in power, he wants to figure out why he was not in power.</p><p>DANIELLA GIBBS LEGER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND STRATEGY, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS: Yes.</p><p>TODD: And he would probably only have one person to blame if he`s not Senate majority leader this election year.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: Yes, I think that`s right. You know, look, Donald Trump hasn`t listened to Mitch McConnell in the past either because I`m pretty sure Mitch McConnell did not want him to nominate Brett Kavanaugh for a host of reasons. So I don`t know how that`s going to play into his calculus.</p><p>I think, you know, we`ve already said what comes after Jeff Sessions. Donald Trump is not somebody who strikes me as someone who thinks down the line, so he very much just deals with impulses. And his impulse is at I want to get rid of this person who should never have recused himself from the Russian investigation in the first place.</p><p>So, you know, he is putting Republicans in a really tight bind. And you`re right, I think the voters are going to really speak very loudly -- I think you hear it happening already in these primary elections -- that they don`t like what`s happening.</p><p>TODD: But I guess I`d flipped it this way. If Republicans hold the Senate, even if they lose 50 House seats, Brad, which -- that calculus is not out of the question, right? Republicans could gain a seat, and Democrats could win 50 House seats. And you can --</p><p>B. TODD: Probably win three or four.</p><p>TODD: Yes, right, they may.</p><p>KAPUR: Yes, they may.</p><p>B. TODD: Yes.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: Right.</p><p>TODD: If Trump has the cocoon of protection of a Republican Senate, right, that`s -- nothing in the House sort of changes his calculus.</p><p>B. TODD: Well, in a polarized country, control of the Senate is really important because it`s how you see the government.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>B. TODD: You confirm judges. You confirm cabinet secretaries. It`s how you can -- are able to control the personnel in your own government, so the control of the Senate is a big deal.</p><p>And I think that getting a larger amount of control of the Senate is going to become a bigger and bigger priority of Republicans as we get closer to the election, and they see a lot more challengers who have shots. It gives you a little blanket, too, for 2020.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: Yes. I mean, I think that`s really important. But if the Democrats take back the House, there`s actually going to be oversight happening on this President.</p><p>TODD: No doubt.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: There are actually going to be hearings, and they`re going to have subpoena power and all of this. So I don`t -- you know, I think, yes, having the Senate will still be a check or a blanket for the President, but if Democrats win back the House, he is going to have to -- like, there is going to be reckoning that`s going to happen.</p><p>KAPUR: The Senate is --</p><p>B. TODD: Every receipt for every holiday in every vendor they will take, at least.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD: There you go. That`s right.</p><p>KAPUR: The Senate is enormously consequential because of the issue of appointments. Everyone who President wants to appoint to a cabinet position or, you know, a federal position that is confirmable by the Senate would have to go through Chuck Schumer`s desk if the Democrats win two seats in November.</p><p>Now, judges, probably the most significant, most successful project of the Trump presidency. He got a 60th judge this week. He`s got 33 on the district courts, 26 on the appellate courts, one Supreme Court justice already. He`s got more eight more district judges coming next week, and a Supreme Court judge in the pipeline.</p><p>Imagine the difference if it`s Chuck Schumer rather than Mitch McConnell looking at these personal appointees. It would be a massive complexion change.</p><p>TODD: Daniella, this has a side note.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: Yes.</p><p>TODD: Your party didn`t have a project, actually, that cares about the judiciary the way the conservative movement does. Are you starting to regret that?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD: My gosh.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: Probably yes. I think --</p><p>TODD: I mean, they had sort of a very organized effort.</p><p>KAPUR: Yes.</p><p>TODD: I mean, it`s been something.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: I mean, if I was in charge --</p><p>TODD: Yes.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: -- if I had all the moneys, yes, I would -- this should be --</p><p>TODD: But this has never been a liberal priority, has it?</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: And, you know, it`s something I`ve been talking about with my colleagues a lot. You know, at the Center for American Progress, we actually do have a project called \"Why Courts Matter,\" so we understand the importance of the judiciary.</p><p>I don`t understand why it isn`t something that gets Democrats and progressives out like it does on the right. And money is a part of it. You guys put millions and millions of dollars into these fights, and our side just doesn`t do that.</p><p>KAPUR: Progressives were furious this week, by the way, when Senate Democrats agreed to fast-track votes on seven of Trump`s judges.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: Yes.</p><p>KAPUR: Seven all within about an hour, so seven of them confirmed. That`s a huge deal.</p><p>TODD: I saw.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: Yes.</p><p>TODD: By the way, what does Chuck Schumer do? Yes, go ahead.</p><p>B. TODD: And in the year 2030, there will be virtually no one in the current Senate still there, Donald Trump probably will be dead, and Neil Gorsuch will still be on the Supreme Court.</p><p>KAPUR: Long after President --</p><p>TODD: Right, Neil Gorsuch.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: But all these --</p><p>TODD: How many of these judges?</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: Yes, all 60 of them.</p><p>TODD: Yes.</p><p>KAPUR: Long after Trump`s presidency fades into history, they`ll be making --</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: It`s so consequential.</p><p>B. TODD: Yes.</p><p>KAPUR: They`ll be becoming decisions. Almost all of them, I should add, are in their 40s and 50s.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: Yes.</p><p>KAPUR: Most of them have been vetted by the Federalist Society. These are very conservative people who will be making decisions for a long time.</p><p>TODD: I need to -- we have a whole bunch of other mini news items that the President made in this Bloomberg interview, so let me just resuscitate some of them.</p><p>He says an E.U. proposal to animate auto tariffs, not good enough.</p><p>He says getting Canada into the new NAFTA -- I guess he doesn`t want to call it NAFTA, he calls it into -- the trade deal. It`ll be by Friday or within a period of time but it will come. It does feel as if the Canadians are circling that.</p><p>He says he does not regret appointing Jerome Powell as Fed Chair, even though he`s been upset about the interest rate decisions.</p><p>And he says he is thinking of linking capital gains taxes to inflation, which would be a massive tax cut for a lot of people. Would it not, Brad? Like that`s something --</p><p>B. TODD: God created Republicans to cut taxes.</p><p>TODD: So that`s what --</p><p>KAPUR: By themselves or without --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KAPUR: -- without congressional approval, though?</p><p>TODD: So none of those headlines are -- let me -- real quick, though, on getting a new NAFTA. He`s had a horrendous summer. There`s not a lot of good headlines, child separation -- you start going down with July. You know, Scott Pruitt happened in July. I was, like, for many people, that was last month.</p><p>But getting a new trade deal, getting a new NAFTA. That`s not a -- you know, it looks a lot like old NAFTA.</p><p>KAPUR: Right.</p><p>TODD: But at least he`s going to say, I did it.</p><p>KAPUR: He`s very eager for a victory on NAFTA. He doesn`t have much on the deliverable end on the issue of trade other than tariffs that have hurt -- you know, or that are making a number of members of his own party nervous, that are hurting Republican Senate candidates in places like Tennessee and Missouri. And, I think, North Dakota as well.</p><p>So I think he wants a victory. He at least wants to rename NAFTA --</p><p>B. TODD: Yes, yes.</p><p>KAPUR: -- and get the P.R. value of saying, I put my stamp on it. Beyond that, we don`t know what the details are going to be. There are some negotiations still happening with the Mexicans.</p><p>TODD: Sure.</p><p>KAPUR: The Canadians seem to be moving forward on this. But we -- there`s more questions than answers right now.</p><p>TODD: There`s no doubt the Canadians don`t want -- like, you could --</p><p>B. TODD: To be left out.</p><p>TODD: Yes.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: They don`t want --</p><p>TODD: Well, and the same time, they`d love to stand up to him but they can`t afford it.</p><p>B. TODD: I don`t --</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: Right.</p><p>B. TODD: I don`t want to -- I think we should understand how important the trade deal renegotiations are to the new coalition that, I think, has been forming not just because of President Trump, but he`s a product of that reformation.</p><p>You know, I`m from a town in east Tennessee that had two hosiery mills and a paper mill and a steel mill as a kid. They`re all gone.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>B. TODD: And for a lot of people there, they would tell you that trade deals that we had in the past two decades were part of that equation. And the last two presidents didn`t do anything to change the course of where we were headed on trade.</p><p>And so I think for a lot of people that`s been in the middle of the country and even blue-collar cities on the east coast will tell you this is a pretty big deal.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: I know. The proof is going to be in the pudding, right? It`s all about the details. So he has maybe a minor P.R. win right now, but we`ll see what happens. And if this trade deal really is something that benefits the American worker, or like the tax deal, is it going to benefit the wealthiest?</p><p>And I`m sorry, after North Korea, I, you know, really don`t believe the hype when it comes out of this White House and its people.</p><p>TODD: All right, let me bring up one other political thing that the President did today. He sort of bragged about the fact that he`s not going to give a pay raise to federal workers. Politically, Brad, I get that not a single -- the base said, great, yes, screw the government.</p><p>B. TODD: I think he`s writing off Virginia.</p><p>TODD: Yes. Well, but this --</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: Not just Virginia, you know.</p><p>TODD: Yes, not just Virginia. I mean, it is sort of you have -- we don`t have it in the budget, he said. You could do the $1.6 trillion tax cut and you can`t do this? Again, how good of politics is it to bash government?</p><p>B. TODD: This was --</p><p>TODD: I mean, I hate to be this cynical.</p><p>B. TODD: Well, first of --</p><p>TODD: Is this a cynical decision --</p><p>B. TODD: First off, the Congress will decide it, not him, in the end. And I think that the public doesn`t trust government right now, either party. There are plenty of people in the Republican coalition who trust Donald Trump more than they trust Republicans in Congress.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>B. TODD: And this is an example of him being a disrupter and trying to say that he -- whether he actually does it or not, he is proving --</p><p>TODD: Do you think that is another one of those things, don`t believe it?</p><p>B. TODD: He is proving he is willing to say things people won`t say and that he`s not taking cues from other people in Washington.</p><p>TODD: He doesn`t necessarily do what he says on that one.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: Right.</p><p>KAPUR: And how does this affect someone like Barbara Comstock who`s running for Congress in a tough re-election in D.C.?</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: Exactly.</p><p>TODD: I think he just --</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: Right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD: Actually, he did better --</p><p>B. TODD: -- Virginia in 2020.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: I mean, her opponent already put out --</p><p>B. TODD: That tells me Virginia in 2020 for his own race is what I`m sure he`s thinking about rather than that.</p><p>TODD: Well, there -- I think he realizes Virginia -- it may be a swing state again, not in the Trump era. I think that`s fair to say.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: Right. I mean, Barbara Comstock`s opponent already put out a press release about it. And it`s not just Virginia. There are lots of states where there are lots of civilian employees that are going to be really hurt by this.</p><p>KAPUR: Yes, this is a matter of priorities. I mean, the President decided that he -- that the United States didn`t have the money and could borrow the money for a big increase in military spending and did have, you know, funds in the Treasury to offer tax breaks. But on this one, he --</p><p>TODD: Let`s be crass.</p><p>B. TODD: He called an increase on the military --</p><p>TODD: Let`s be crass, let`s be crass. There is not a single vote that he would get if he somehow said, I`m giving a raise to all federal government workers.</p><p>B. TODD: Not a single vote he would gain.</p><p>TODD: Yes.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: Right.</p><p>B. TODD: But the military vote does help him.</p><p>TODD: Well, and that`s --</p><p>B. TODD: Because a part of the federal workforce that identifies with Republicans is military.</p><p>TODD: Right. Which is why the rest of the federal workforce is probably getting a raise because they`ll not separate the two, is my guess, which is probably right. Congress won`t distinguish.</p><p>KAPUR: And it`s about priorities. The money is there, clearly. He just wants to spend it on certain things and not other things.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: Exactly.</p><p>TODD: All right, guys. We`ll take a break here. You guys get to stick around.</p><p>Up ahead, inside President Trump`s war on Google.</p><p>Plus, a new outage -- outrage at the border. Why are more and more Hispanic American citizens being denied their passports?</p><p>TODD: Welcome back. Another entry in a long pattern for President Trump. When his opponents attacked him in 2016, he gave them labels. So he labeled them Lying Ted, Crooked Hillary. When the news media publishes stories he doesn`t like, he cries fake news, enemy of the people.</p><p>And now, this week, the President has decided to go after Google for, in his words, suppressing conservative voices in its search results.</p><p>The President tweeted, quote, Google search results for Trump news shows only the viewing/reporting of fake news media. In other words, they have it rigged for me and others so that almost all bad -- stories and news is bad. They are controlling what we can and cannot see. This is a very serious situation. Will be addressed.</p><p>The President also tweeted a video in which he accused the search engine of highlighting President Obama`s state of the union addresses but not his own.</p><p>Google responded by saying, wrong, that they did, in fact, highlight President Trump`s state of the union address this year. Not so last year for a very good reason. The speech President Trump gave to Congress in 2017 was not a state of the union address.</p><p>None of them are when you give them in the first year in office.</p><p>Joining me now is Kara Swisher. She is the executive editor of the technology news Web site, Recode.</p><p>Kara, nice to see you.</p><p>KARA SWISHER, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, RECODE: How are you doing, Chuck?</p><p>TODD: All right. Let`s start with the President`s accusation.</p><p>SWISHER: Yes.</p><p>TODD: And then I want to go to something that I think he is touching on that actually is relevant to this conversation.</p><p>SWISHER: OK. Yes.</p><p>TODD: So, obviously, he`s going after Google. And it`s all part -- this is -- you know, Steve Bannon ranted about this a long time ago, big tech.</p><p>SWISHER: Yes, and he did also last week.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>SWISHER: He did a bunch last week and he`s done it to Amazon -- Amazon, \"Washington Post.\"</p><p>TODD: That`s right. He is --</p><p>SWISHER: Yes.</p><p>TODD: Part of it is maybe he doesn`t understand the tech world.</p><p>SWISHER: No.</p><p>TODD: I think that`s a big part of it, but the other part of it just feels ironic. It`s like, is he saying that you guys must stink because I was able to manipulate your system and look what I did? I mean, I don`t mean to be that cynical.</p><p>SWISHER: Yes, yes.</p><p>TODD: But is there any basis to his attack?</p><p>SWISHER: No, none whatsoever. And I`m not one to defend the tech industry, you know that. I`m sort of -- I`m very particular about certain things they`ve done, and I`m very interested in these hearings next week where a lot of the leaders are going to come with some of the problems they had with Cambridge Analytica and things like that.</p><p>But, in this case, he`s completely wrong. He doesn`t know what he`s talking about.</p><p>TODD: I want to go to that state of the union attack because this is the problem that`s happening on social media. The irony is -- and it`s basically Twitter has allowed this to happen, whether they like it or not.</p><p>SWISHER: Yes.</p><p>TODD: Their platform has been used for this, which is -- and it`s been regularly done. Matt Gaetz is a congressman that has done this. Kevin McCarthy is a congressman that has done this. Where they retweet stuff that they say, this is how they`re biased against conservatives but it turned out to be fake accusations. Like, the fake accusations about state of the union, all these false accusations.</p><p>SWISHER: Yes, but it`s beyond --</p><p>TODD: But it gets, like, 32,000 retweets.</p><p>SWISHER: Of course.</p><p>TODD: Or 50,000 likes. So people still believe it.</p><p>SWISHER: Well, you know, I wrote a column in \"The New York Times\" saying this is codswallop. But I just was -- I try to find a word that you could look up on Google very easily.</p><p>But the fact of the matter is, conservative voices are very loud on social media. So are liberal voices, so are crazy voices, so are comedians, and so is everyone. And this particular group of people has actually been advantaged by it because they were largely left out of the mainstream media until Fox News came along.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>SWISHER: Now, they have all these platforms to discuss things on. And there`s been this sort of online rage-fest among them that they are not heard. And the line I used is, the people that talk loudest about not being heard never shut up. And I think we can all agree that Donald Trump uses Twitter quite a bit.</p><p>TODD: One of the mistakes we in the mainstream media made during -- when these false accusations against us being biased for 40 years happen is we started believing, well, maybe we are biased and we got to -- oh, wait, we can`t look biased. So then we created a lot of false equivalency issues, OK.</p><p>SWISHER: Yes.</p><p>TODD: It looks to me like Silicon Valley is about to fall into that trap. How do they not fall into that trap?</p><p>SWISHER: By ignoring it completely. Look at what Jeff Bezos is doing every time he comes after him. He just doesn`t say a word. I think Google has to just say this is not true and move along and stuff like that.</p><p>And, obviously, there, again, are issues that all these companies should face, you know, of things they have done but not this one.</p><p>TODD: All right. But I want to get into an issue that I actually thought Steve Bannon addressed very -- you know, in a -- he ranted at the end, but he, actually, I thought, touched on something that I`ve gotten into, which is, who`s going to regulate the algorithms?</p><p>SWISHER: Right.</p><p>TODD: At the end of the day, they`re not wrong that, these algorithms, none of us know what they have.</p><p>SWISHER: Right.</p><p>TODD: They have all of our information. Steve Bannon made a recommendation that I didn`t think was a bad one, which was should our info at least be in a public trust of some sort that they can access all the time?</p><p>And we get that, but -- I buy what he`s talking about there. At some point, we have to figure out how to regulate the algorithms so, at least, we know if they`re being abused.</p><p>SWISHER: Well, no, I know. That`s the problem, is you can`t do that. That`s such -- then make Google an entity of the government?</p><p>TODD: No, you wouldn`t make it an entity of the government.</p><p>SWISHER: It`s called Russia.</p><p>TODD: No, no, no. But it`s --</p><p>SWISHER: It`s called the Russian government.</p><p>TODD: Well, then how do we regulate an algorithm?</p><p>SWISHER: We don`t. We don`t.</p><p>TODD: Why?</p><p>SWISHER: Because they`re big companies, and they are -- they`re the ones in charge, just the way CBS used to be in charge of the airwaves.</p><p>TODD: OK. But if Google writes an algorithm that somehow directs -- all right, let me do a better one. Let`s say one of the --</p><p>SWISHER: Facebook or any --</p><p>TODD: No, monster.com, like an employment site. And their algorithm seems to always leave out people of color as your job applicants.</p><p>SWISHER: Right, that`s a different issue.</p><p>TODD: But that`s my point. How do you --</p><p>SWISHER: Yes.</p><p>TODD: You know, they could say, oh, we just wrote an algorithm, we didn`t know it was going to do that.</p><p>SWISHER: Right. Well, I think the problem is who is making these things. That`s one of the big issues being discussed with Silicon Valley, like A.I. You know, there`s an -- you know, the old expression, crap in, crap out.</p><p>And so, you know, if certain people are the only ones designing that, what happens? But that`s in the Internet. The Internet has largely been designed by the small group of people. That still doesn`t mean you should have a government entity regulating any of that sort of thing.</p><p>TODD: All right, but let me go to a consumer thing, OK?</p><p>SWISHER: OK.</p><p>TODD: So I want to know that I am getting -- I am being treated as a consumer equally in the state of Texas as I am in the state of North Dakota.</p><p>SWISHER: Yes.</p><p>TODD: And if an Amazon algorithm decides, boy, in Texas, you have more money. You can afford to pay this because I know this by where you live and all this stuff than the north. Boy, I`m getting -- that`s not fair as a consumer.</p><p>SWISHER: That`s called marketing and retail for the past hundred years, so I don`t know that can --</p><p>TODD: No. Well, I`m wondering -- I get it.</p><p>SWISHER: Yes.</p><p>TODD: But on the other hand, if there -- if it`s unfair practices, how is it that we`re going to --</p><p>SWISHER: Is it?</p><p>TODD: Well, why shouldn`t it?</p><p>SWISHER: Why shouldn`t it be? Well, here`s the thing, privacy issues, yes. I think there`s probably going to be a privacy bill, especially if the Democrats come into power. I`m absolutely certain there will be some sort of -- there`s been one in California that`s been somewhat controversial, but there will be a national privacy bill at some point given all these issues we`re having.</p><p>TODD: Is it going to look like Europe?</p><p>SWISHER: I don`t know. Probably not. I don`t think U.S. regulators have ever been as strong as the ones in Europe. But, again, there`s international issues too because the Europeans are doing something different, the Chinese will do something different. Everyone around the world in a global society will do something different.</p><p>TODD: What`s next week going to look like for Twitter and Facebook?</p><p>SWISHER: Ah, I don`t know. It depends who shows up. I mean, if we get Jack Dorsey and Sheryl Sandberg -- now, there`s been calls to bring in Larry Page who was one of the founders of Google. It probably will be Sundar Pichai.</p><p>I think they`re going to quiz them. I hope they don`t quiz them on all these whether conservatives can speak up or whether anybody can speak out. They should talk about issues of the meddling in the elections. They should talk about privacy. They should talk about how did this -- how did their platforms get hijacked by the Russian government.</p><p>These are critical issues, not whether Donald Trump is loud enough on the Internet, which I think he is. I feel he has plenty of voice.</p><p>TODD: I was just going to say the Internet has been good to Donald Trump.</p><p>SWISHER: That`s what I said, they -- Donald Trump should send tech a gold embossed thank you note for the things that it has done, giving him tools and all kinds of ways to get in office.</p><p>TODD: Right. So I guess, does the industry --</p><p>SWISHER: You want me to say you want to regulate --</p><p>TODD: No, no, no, no. But does the industry -- is it ready to come and say, hey, look, we know we`ve gotten this big and we need help figuring X out?</p><p>SWISHER: Right.</p><p>TODD: Are they ready to at least do that with the government?</p><p>SWISHER: I think they have to engage more with the government. But as you saw from the Zuckerberg hearings, the politicians really are almost clueless about technology.</p><p>TODD: It`s embarrassing.</p><p>SWISHER: And it was embarrassing. And everyone used to say, oh, Mark did really well. I say, well, it`s a very really low bar. So, no, he didn`t, but they did badly.</p><p>TODD: I would love Mr. Zuckerberg to come here.</p><p>SWISHER: Well, I will ask him.</p><p>TODD: And I would -- no, they haven`t. Like, none of them will stay, though.</p><p>SWISHER: None of them will?</p><p>TODD: Yes, I would love to be quizzed by some of those members of Congress, too.</p><p>SWISHER: Yes, yes. I would like members of Congress who actually know something about technology to do the quizzing, but that`s, you know.</p><p>TODD: I think it`s time to let them staffers do the quizzing and all.</p><p>SWISHER: Yes.</p><p>TODD: Do you expect any sort of -- I think Donald Trump, Jr. said, oh, we`re going to have a conservative alternative. Is that plausible out there and realistic?</p><p>SWISHER: Sure, go ahead. They can do it. It`s the big wide Internet.</p><p>TODD: Right, but is there anybody out there that actually could do it?</p><p>SWISHER: You know, there were rumors of Peter Thiel and Steve Bannon getting together. I keep hearing them getting together and creating their own. I`m sure there will be a digital element to it if they do it. There`s all kinds of rumors around that.</p><p>Obviously, Fox News has digital elements. Are you kidding? There are so many conservative publications on the Internet now, Breitbart, all the others. They`ve had -- the Internet has been very, very good to them.</p><p>TODD: Yes.</p><p>SWISHER: So I don`t know if they should complain quite so much.</p><p>TODD: I think their biggest complaint is called capitalism.</p><p>SWISHER: Yes.</p><p>TODD: Kara Swisher, thanks for coming on.</p><p>SWISHER: Thank you.</p><p>TODD: Much appreciated. Up ahead, the uproar over a new crackdown on Hispanic Americans that are American citizens. They`re being denied passports or having their passports taken away.</p><p>But, first, it`s the emotional tribute to Senator John McCain. Some 3,500 people gathered in a Phoenix church to honor McCain`s life of service.</p><p>Twenty-four sitting U.S. senators attended that service. So did four former senators, including former Vice President Joe Biden who remembered Senator McCain as a leader who always put country before party.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: John was a hero. His character, courage, honor, integrity. But I think the thing that`s understated the most is his optimism. That`s what made John special. It made John a giant among all of us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: Welcome back. Tonight I`m obsessed with President Trump`s morning tweetstorm. More unusual than normal, even for him. Those tweets were a plague of defensive outbursts, baseless assertions and outright falsehoods, the kind of statements that have fact checkers working overtime or simply throwing up their hands.</p><p>But it got us wondering, what if in some Seinfeld-like Bizarro universe, President Trump tweeted the exact opposite of what he tweeted this morning? What would that look like? Hmm, would it be more believable if President Trump had tweeted something like this? When Lester Holt accurately played my tape on Russia, I was hurt badly.</p><p>Or how about this? Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner had everything to do with the pushing out of Don McGahn. The news media has it right. Has it so right. Or how about this one? The legitimate Russia investigation had everything to do with respect to my decision on Don McGahn.</p><p>And then another one on Don McGahn. I`m very excited about the person who will be taking the place of Don McGahn as White House counsel. I never liked Don, and he was responsible for me not firing Bob Mueller or Jeff Sessions. And finally, I just cannot state strongly enough how totally dishonest I am. Truth doesn`t matter to me. I only have my hatred and agenda.</p><p>As Jerry Seinfeld and George Costanza, if every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right. Right?</p><p>TODD: Welcome back. The Trump administration`s crackdown along the Mexican border isn`t just limited to people trying to come here illegally. Now a growing number of Hispanic-Americans are being denied passports because the government is questioning their citizenship.</p><p>The Washington Post reports that the Trump administration is accusing hundreds and possibly thousands of people of using fraudulent birth certificates since they were babies. The government alleges that some midwives and physicians along the border gave U.S. birth certificates to people who were actually born in Mexico decades ago.</p><p>In a statement to The Washington Post, the State Department said it \"has not changed policy or practice regarding the adjudication of passport applications and the U.S.-Mexico border region happens to be an area of the country where there has been a significant incidence of citizenship fraud.\"</p><p>It`s true that this happened under George W. Bush and the Obama administrations too, but that mostly ended after a government settlement in 2009. This news as taking away people`s citizenship is on the rise under President Trump.</p><p>And to try to understand this piece and this issue a little better, I`m joined now by NBC News national security and justice reporter Julia Ainsley and Attorney Jaime Diaz who represents some of the U.S. citizens who have been either denied passports or had them taken away. Welcome to both of you.</p><p>Julia, let me start with you. When did this begin? How pervasive do we think it is? And is this connected to the sort of prediction, if you will, that this was the next thing Stephen Miller, who`s sort of the chief advisor on all immigration issues in the West Wing, this is the next step he wanted to take?</p><p>JULIA AINSLEY, NATIONAL SECURITY AND JUSTICE REPORTER, NBC NEWS: Chuck, context here is critical. You`re exactly right. We know that Stephen Miller -- the next step he wants to do is go after legal immigration.</p><p>What we`re seeing here is part of this new fraud crackdown from DHS and throughout the Trump administration like the State Department. They`re trying to go after people who maybe lied on their applications and became citizens or became permanent residents and got green cards who shouldn`t have.</p><p>So they want to go back and re-adjudicate and take that away. But of course what happens and what The Washington Post laid out in this story is a lot of people who were rightfully in the United States end up getting their rights taken away too.</p><p>And as they found under the Obama administration, it`s very difficult to decide which ones of those birth certificates signed by those midwives in the `90s were legitimate and which ones weren`t. And so they really just decided it was a fruitless cause and that they should just allow them -- take them as legitimate.</p><p>But this is part of a broader crackdown. And from people I`ve spoken to who represent a lot of immigrants who are trying to move up the ladder, get passports, get citizenships, get green cards, they say before you take that next step, you need to go through your record and make sure everything is crystal clear or it could just not even be worth it.</p><p>It`s too much of a risk because of the scrutiny they`re doing going back and looking at everything and every application you`ve put in earlier, even if they were legitimate, Chuck.</p><p>TODD: All right. Let me go to Jaime Diaz. Jaime, I wanted Julia to begin there to help me continue to sort of lay out the context of all of this. Now walk me through what you`re dealing with. How many clients do you have that have been impacted?</p><p>How many of them are natural born citizens versus those who went through the green card process and became naturalized citizens here, born here versus naturalized, all of those things. I`m curious. What kind of folks are being targeted here?</p><p>JAIME DIAZ, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY: Here we`re talking only about people that were born in the United States.</p><p>TODD: OK. How many clients do you have on this front?</p><p>DIAZ: I have represented over 500 people. I presently have probably 30 people that are in lawsuits in federal court. I have represented over 100 of them in lawsuits in federal court where they have been taken away their documents. They have been put in rooms to admit that they were not born in the United States.</p><p>Their mothers have been asked to come to the consulate to admit that they were not born there and the documents were taken. What we see now is that they are detaining them. When they come back -- without allowing them to come back and keep them in Mexico.</p><p>There are many clients of mine that I have that were born in the United States, that the government has stopped them and have kept them in Mexico. And the crackdown is starting to be very hard. They are doing it every day. I see someone in my office.</p><p>I practice in Brownsville, Texas which is at the border with Mexico. People that were born by midwives down there, there is a lot of them, but I can tell you something, that most of them were born in the United States.</p><p>We even have a soldier that was born with a midwife and he applied to become a soldier. They took him in. He applied for a passport and they say, show that you`re a United States citizen. This is ridiculous.</p><p>TODD: Well, there was one example in The Washington Post, Mr. Diaz, and I`m just curious if you had to deal with something like this where it was a former soldier and he only wanted to give his first name because he was afraid he`d be targeted.</p><p>He said that the State Department told him that they weren`t convinced he was a U.S. citizen, that they needed a bunch of the following documents. Either his mother`s -- evidence of his mother`s prenatal care, his baptismal certificate, maybe rental agreements when he was a baby.</p><p>This is a grown man. I`m sorry, I don`t think my mother has the power bill from when I was born in 1972. Is this the burden of proof that`s being put on your clients?</p><p>DIAZ: Yes. That is what`s going on. They are asking for things that no one has. No one in the whole United States has prenatal record from her mother. A person that is 40 years old, there`s no way they have them. So they`re asking for things that they know they don`t have. People get frustrated.</p><p>But if you live on the border, there is a need for you to cross to the other side. You have family, you have things to do on the other side. And when they`re coming back, that`s when they`re detaining them. They`re making them sign documents so that they can get away from it.</p><p>What has happened is outrageous. An opportunity like this to tell the American people what is going on is incredible. We`re not talking about people that are naturalized, we are talking about people that were born in the United States. They just happen to have a Hispanic last name and they were born with midwives, but that`s still Americans.</p><p>TODD: Mr. Diaz, did you have any client who didn`t have a Hispanic last name who had their passport taken away?</p><p>DIAZ: Not that I can remember right now on the top of my head. Most of them have been taken away, no. I have people that I represented that are having difficulty getting a passport because they were born in Southern Texas with a midwife. But someone that has a passport taken away or revoked when they were coming back or through a letter in the mail, no, I have never had it.</p><p>TODD: So it does feel as if it is Hispanic surnames that get targeted here. Julia, walk me through the due process in this. What are the court procedures here? You`re accused of this, you`re trying to fight back. Where does it go in the system?</p><p>AINSLEY: It`s really hard to fight back, Chuck. I mean, you would have to get a lawyer. I know a lot of people who stay outside of places where immigrants are trying to appeal and they know that they will eventually come across the street and find lawyers because it`s nearly impossible to navigate this system on your own.</p><p>As Jaime just pointed out, they`re asking for these documents a lot of people don`t have. And as an American citizen, yes, you have the right to have citizenship, but that passport, the documents that you have to have a passport, it`s not a right to have a passport if you don`t have the documents to back it up.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>AINSLEY: And when they`re raising this bar, there actually very few routes to go. The way this was handled in the past, Chuck, was through a class action settlement and that`s frequently the way we see immigrants or even U.S.-born immigrants, the children of immigrants seek their rights, that they`re able to go through the ACLU. They have to come in a class action suit with lots of people and then they are able to get justice.</p><p>That`s what happened in 2009 when the ACLU said, look, you can`t tell which one of these midwife birth certificates are illegitimate and which ones aren`t, and we think that it`s a very small amount of children that were actually born in Mexico. And so, therefore, you can`t discriminate based on them having this one type of birth certificate. So the answer is it is really hard to get justice without a class action lawsuit in this case.</p><p>TODD: Mr. Diaz, is there anything in the -- why is the burden of proof not on the government to prove you`re not a U.S. citizen?</p><p>DIAZ: The burden (INAUDIBLE) evidence and this is a civil case. The government does not have any way to prove that you are -- to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you fraudulently obtained that document. First of all, these are documents that were registered when you were a baby. And the only way to prove it is if you knew that that document was fraudulent when you grew up.</p><p>So, you know, what they do is they try to take you away from going to court. That`s why they detain you at ports of entry and they keep you and say stay in Mexico. How do you come back if you will stay in Mexico and you were thrown into --</p><p>TODD: You`re not a Mexican citizen. You`re not a Mexican citizen. What are you going to do?</p><p>DIAZ: It is really -- the stories -- unfortunately I don`t have the time to tell you all the stories that I have seen of people. But I can tell you one thing. We have won all those cases. What is sad is after you win all those cases, you would think the government would say, you know, I have to change. No, they go harder. Eventually there will be no attorney that will represent these people, but I`m here to represent them.</p><p>TODD: Let me ask you this. Is there -- how many of your clients that you felt like they were detained longer than they should be thrown in jail and what were they thrown in jail for if they were?</p><p>DIAZ: They were thrown to jail -- they get thrown immigration detention centers. I had a guy that was detained for three days at a detention center --</p><p>TODD: American citizen? An American citizen?</p><p>DIAZ: An American citizen. Yes, sir.</p><p>TODD: Detained -- put into a detention center and just because, what, he didn`t have a passport or they didn`t believe his passport?</p><p>DIAZ: No, he had a passport. They just said, we have a note that we need to revoke your passport so they put him in a room. The agent asked him, do you want me to treat you like a Mexican or as a U.S. citizen? What I would have told him, treat him like a human being, give him his rights. He has a right to hear whatever evidence you think you have. But the way they`re treating people is not right.</p><p>TODD: All right. Julia Ainsley, Jaime Diaz, I`ve got to leave it there. I thank you both for sharing your expertise and your experiences there, thank you.</p><p>Up ahead, the empire state strikes back. We`ll show you some of last night`s New York gubernatorial debate between Andrew Cuomo and Cynthia Nixon. Let`s just say a little feisty.</p><p>TODD: Welcome back. In tonight`s \"Meet the Midterms,\" the feuding factions of the Democratic Party literally on full display.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D), NEW YORK: The subway system is owned by New York City.</p><p>CYNTHIA NIXON, DEMOCRATIC GUBERNATORIAL NOMINEE: The MTA has been controlled by the state since 1965.</p><p>CUOMO: Excuse me, can you stop interrupting? Can you stop interrupting?</p><p>NIXON: Can you stop lying?</p><p>NIXON: Yeah, as soon as you do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: I guess they call that a cell phone. That was New York Governor Andrew Cuomo seeking his third term and challenger Cynthia Nixon, an actress and self-described Democratic socialist going out last night in their one and only debate before New York`s primary September 13th. That handshake at the end may have been the most civil moment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NIXON: I`m not an Albany insider, like Governor Cuomo, but I think that experience doesn`t mean that much if you`re not actually good at governing.</p><p>CUOMO: My opponent lives in the world of fiction, I live in the world of fact.</p><p>NIXON: We already have a corrupt corporate Republican in the White House. We don`t need a corrupt corporate Democrat in Albany as his main opposition.</p><p>CUOMO: She released five years of corporate taxes, dumped them in three hours on a Friday with no notice. Only Donald Trump has done less transparency on his taxes than my opponent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: Nixon is still a long shot to win the nomination. She trailed Cuomo by 31 points in a Siena College poll from last month.</p><p>But let`s see, in a year in which Democrats tapped underdog Andrew Gillum, who wasn`t polling very high in many polls to run for governor in Florida and in a year in which Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who Nixon endorsed won over Congressman Joe Crowley in the Bronx there, are you really going to discount her chances? More \"MTP Daily\" after the break.</p><p>TODD: Time now for \"The Lid.\" The panel is back: Sahil, Daniella, and Brad. All right, the president, we got more from your Bloomberg interview. You`re just dribbling it out. You know, we in the -- we just put it all out there. But anyway, you dribbled it out. We got a little bit which is, here`s what he said about the Mueller probe. We will put it up on the screen here.</p><p>I view it as an illegal investigation because great scholars -- that`s his quote -- have said that there never should have been a special counsel. This is an answer when asked if he would comply with the subpoena for Mueller, he said I`ll see what happens there.</p><p>He talks about Mueller being an illegal probe all the time. Let me ask this, Brad. Do any of the supporters wonder why he just doesn`t end it? He has the power. He is the president.</p><p>BRAD TODD, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST AND FOUNDING PARTNER OF ONMESSAGE INC.: I don`t think many of the supporters think very much about the Mueller probe. I think the president thinks about it a lot more than his supporters do.</p><p>C.TOOD: I think the president thinks about it more than anybody around this table sometimes.</p><p>B.TODD: I think the president`s voters are -- we`ll wait until the Mueller probe is over with and we`ll see what he has and we`ll evaluate it. I don`t think it`s something that they`re obsessed about. Washington is obsessed about it. They lead (ph) the paper everyday.</p><p>C.TODD: Sure.</p><p>B.TODD: It doesn`t lead the paper in Kenosho (ph).</p><p>C.TODD: No, that I buy. He has the power to end these things if he really wanted to. He obviously knows it would be a problem.</p><p>SAHIL KAPUR, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, BLOOMBERG NEWS: It`s not the prevailing view of members of his own party in Congress, that it`s an illegal investigation. The Senate majority leader and the speaker of the House say they support the investigation. That is not only legal but it is proper that it should come to an end.</p><p>So I think this is the president feeling like there is a lot happening around him. The walls may be closing in on him. I think he is lashing out. He may be binging cable news, according to some people around him that I spoke to.</p><p>DANIELLA GIBBS LEGER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, COMMUNICATIONS AND STRATEGY AT AMERICAN PROGRESS: Yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>C. TODD: He needed something to do. I think they`re glad they scheduled this rally this afternoon.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: Yeah, very well timed.</p><p>B.TODD: The special counsel has a responsibility too. He presumably supports the idea that special counsel should exist and he has to know when he`s gone past the time limit of when he has credibility.</p><p>C.TODD: What time limit are we at? This is not even at the halfway point.</p><p>B.TODD: He`s had more than a year.</p><p>C.TODD: Not even a halfway point.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: So what? You just arbitrarily stop because --</p><p>B.TODD: He has to decide when the public thinks he`s gone too far on time and show his cards.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: He has to go until the investigation is over. If he keeps uncovering more crimes --</p><p>B. TODD: All appointments are political, though, you have a certain amount of political rope. He has to judge where the American public is and whether it`s willing to let him go on.</p><p>C. TODD: Here is what I`ve learned about Bob Mueller. Not a single person that has known him been with him, worked with him, would say if he didn`t have any -- he would have ended this investigation if there is no collusion, that he already would have ended it.</p><p>B. TODD: We can`t tell that though until he tells us something.</p><p>C.TODD: That`s true. Right, we are just left here in what is the last chapter --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KAPUR: This is not the issue that resonates in most of the country. I do think public opinion is calcified on this issue for now. New developments in this case are not necessarily going to move the needle unless they directly relate to the president. I don`t know that the fall of people around him is going to affect the midterm elections. But this is baked in. It`s one of the reasons that the president --</p><p>D.TODD: But here is the question --</p><p>KAPUR: -- not like it doesn`t affect him at all.</p><p>B.TODD: We`re at Labor Day. And I think if Mueller comes back with anything between Labor Day and the election, half the country is going to reject it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>C.TODD: I think he knows, more than anything, he keeps quiet between Labor Day and election day, don`t you think?</p><p>B.TODD: Then he`s going to be pushing up against two years before you know it. I mean, it`s too long.</p><p>C.TODD: No, no, no --</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: That`s why I feel like --</p><p>C. TODD: This is a trap that Giuliani is trying to set, I think, PR-wise, which is you`re taking forever. Wait, why are you speaking during the election --</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: Exactly. That`s why I feel like maybe January 2019 is going to be the time when Mueller announces everything. Because it`s enough time before the 2020 election, but you wait until after this election so you don`t have people saying --</p><p>C. TODD: I`m not missing work tomorrow. I wouldn`t miss work tomorrow.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: That`s right.</p><p>C. TODD: Tomorrow is the last business day of the pre-Labor Day to election day window, Sahil.</p><p>KAPUR: And this is where there`s so much at stake in the 2018 elections because whoever controls the House is going to decide what the fate -- what comes of this report that Mueller files.</p><p>Now, to the issue of subpoenas and, you know, potentially what the White House would do if he`s forced to -- or if he`s subpoenaed, they will very likely challenge this in court and the president probably won`t end up speaking executive privilege.</p><p>The White House can find a way around this, I think, to make sure that they don`t face any court conviction because it`s not -- I`m sorry, indictment because it`s not happened to a sitting president so far. Congress is going to decide.</p><p>C. TODD: Not to be totally cliche, 5:00 tomorrow is a big deadline, isn`t it?</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: Yeah.</p><p>C. TODD: Unofficially for a lot of people. I mean, we assume Mueller wouldn`t do it until -- tomorrow at 5:00 p.m. is the last possible time.</p><p>B.TODD: Chuck, every Friday night is entertaining in this presidency.</p><p>C.TODD: Let`s try putting on a Sunday show.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>C. TODD: We don`t find it entertaining, we find it mind boggling.</p><p>B.TODD: You always wanted things to get a little more exciting. You wanted a little more of a president who is unscripted.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER: It would be perfect, the Friday before Labor Day to have like this big thing.</p><p>C.TODD: Today we had an arrest of somebody who threatened The Boston Globe using \"you`re the enemy of the people.\" Sahil, you`re the other working journalist here. The U.S. attorney went after and arrested this person. This person, \"you`re the enemy of the people, and we`re going to kill every\" -- whatever the caller said to Globe.</p><p>You know, there`s always this decision, do we alert authorities or not? At this point the guy called so many times and, you know, maybe holding somebody criminally responsible does sort of make people responsible for their rhetoric.</p><p>KAPUR: Yeah. There were 14 phone calls here of this man using all kinds of nasty language that I can`t repeat here. Yes, he used the phrase \"the enemy of the people,\" where have we heard that before.</p><p>I want to be very clear, the president is not condoning violence against anybody, but it`s not difficult to see how someone can listen to that, see that rhetoric and want to do something crazy if they are not mentally stable.</p><p>C. TODD: This has always been our point. We know the president is not -- he needs to actually say that he doesn`t mean it. All right. Sahil, Daniella, Brad, thank you all. We`ll be right back.</p><p>TODD: That`s all we have for tonight. We`ll be back tomorrow with more \"MTP Daily.\" Remember, 5:00 p.m. tomorrow is a big deadline, perhaps in the Mueller probe. \"The Beat\" starts right now. Ayman Mohyeldin is in for Ari. Ayman, good evening, sir.</p><p>AYMAN MOHYELDIN, JOURNALIST, MSNBC: Good evening, Chuck.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

I'm Katy Tur, again, in for Nicolle  Wallace.  \"MTP DAILY\" starts right now with Chuck Todd.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hi, Chuck.  Hello.    </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHUCK TODD, MSNBC HOST:  Katy Tur.</p><p>TUR:  Charles.  </p><p>TODD:  How are you?  I see -- look, that's what Pete does to me.

Thank you, Katy.  </p><p>TUR:  You bet.  </p><p>TODD:  If it's Thursday, it's the eye of the tweetstorm.  </p><p>Good evening.  I'm Chuck Todd here in Washington and welcome to MTP DAILY.   If it's Thursday, the President is making assertions that, to some, come  across as paranoid, conspiratorial, full of projection, and at times, a bit  Orwellian.  </p><p>And if that isn't concerning enough, we're learning that some of the most  important people whose jobs are to act as a guardrail against the  President's behavior or instincts are leaving, giving up, rationalizing it,  or simply being ousted.  </p><p>Folks, that is a recipe for bad things getting worse.  So let's dive in.   The President today all but said reject the evidence of your eyes and ears.   He suggested, without evidence, because there is none, that part of the  tape of him on camera in that interview with my colleague, Lester Holt, was  fudged, as he puts it.  </p><p>OK.  Not true.  You might remember that was the interview where the  President said, yes, he fired James Comey in part because of the Russia  investigation.  That was just one baseless allegation in a series of  baseless allegations about the press, books, tapes, journalistic sources,  and news executives that he claims are all conspiring against him.  </p><p>The President, also, went after a top Justice Department official by  claiming that this official was involved in some kind of Russian collusion  and should be fired because of it.  </p><p>The President suggested that he ousted his White House Counsel, Don McGahn,  just 24 hours after saying McGahn was leaving on his own accord.  </p><p>Folks, McGahn was a key check on some of the President's impulsiveness.   McGahn also testified to Bob Mueller extensively about his boss's impulses,  which reportedly included at least two attempts to fire Mueller.  </p><p>So yesterday, we learned that McGahn is leaving.  Today, we learned that  the White House ethics lawyer is out effective tomorrow.  And it looks as  if the Attorney General is likely going to be ousted after the midterms  according to several top Senate Republicans.  </p><p>And amid it all, we're hearing some Senate Republicans either shrug their  shoulders or tell themselves that Hillary Clinton would be more corrupt or  that the President is just too inept to commit a crime like conspiring with  Russia.  </p><p>Let's bring in tonight's panel.  Sahil Kapur is a national political  reporter with Bloomberg News.  And they had a big interview with the  President a few minutes ago, so we get some scoop there.  </p><p>Daniella Gibbs Leger, a senior vice president for the Center for American  Progress.  </p><p>And Brad Todd is a Republican strategist and ad maker.  I haven't seen you  in a while.  Welcome back.  </p><p>BRAD TODD, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Thanks a lot.  </p><p>TODD:  All right, Sahil, the President -- let's get to the quick news here  -- making quick headlines.  I guess the biggest one is Jeff Sessions' job  is safe for 60 days.  </p><p>SAHIL KAPUR, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, BLOOMBERG NEWS:  That's correct,  at least 60 days.  The President would not comment when my colleagues asked  him what would happen to the Attorney General after that, but there's  widespread speculation, given the President's very public attacks on his  A.G., that his job may not last beyond that.  </p><p>Now, Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, said earlier this week  he has total confidence in Jeff Sessions and he should stay exactly where  he is.  That is a signal that McConnell doesn't want anything to mess with  the Kavanaugh hearings.  </p><p>And the second things is, who do you put in his place if you get rid of  Jeff Sessions?  It's a 50 to 49 Senate right now.  Some of those  Republicans are not going to be comfortable supporting another A.G. unless  they promise to protect the Russia investigation and the Mueller probe,  which is precisely why it seems the President wants Sessions gone.  So it's  hard to know, you know, what the end game is here.  </p><p>TODD:  Let me underscore this midterm issue, though, Daniella and Brad,  because I think the voters are going to have a say as to the future of Jeff  Sessions.  Meaning this, my theory is if somehow Democrats win the Senate,  that actually might change Republicans' calculations in the Senate.  If  somehow they won the Senate.  </p><p>Brad, is that a fair -- that, all of a sudden, you'd have a different set  of -- because, right now, you have a bunch of Republican senators that are  going, look, he's popular with the base.  </p><p>B. TODD:  Well, it wasn't widely noted last fall when Charles Grassley,  chairman of the Judiciary Committee, sent out a tweet that that said I have  no time to schedule any Attorney General confirmation hearings this year.  </p><p>Some people may have noted that, last week, he said that now he does have  some time.  And he changed --</p><p>TODD:  Yes.  And he's got a separate beef.   </p><p>B. TODD:  He does.  </p><p>TODD:  He does have a separate beef with the -- </p><p>B. TODD:  He does.  But you can't have a new Attorney General until you  have hearings to confirm a new Attorney General, and you can't do it on the  floor until you have a majority leader willing to schedule a vote on the  floor.  </p><p>So even if the did want to fire Jeff Sessions, he's going to be replaced  with Rod Rosenstein.  And so the -- and until the Senate Republicans decide  that they think it's time.  </p><p>TODD:  So is that -- that's why it feels as if, at the end of the day,  Mitch McConnell is a calculator.  And I mean that as a compliment.  He  reads the tea leaves.  And it's about being in power.  And if he's not in  power, he wants to figure out why he was not in power.  </p><p>DANIELLA GIBBS LEGER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND  STRATEGY, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  And he would probably only have one person to blame if he's not  Senate majority leader this election year.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Yes, I think that's right.  You know, look, Donald Trump  hasn't listened to Mitch McConnell in the past either because I'm pretty  sure Mitch McConnell did not want him to nominate Brett Kavanaugh for a  host of reasons.  So I don't know how that's going to play into his  calculus.  </p><p>I think, you know, we've already said what comes after Jeff Sessions.   Donald Trump is not somebody who strikes me as someone who thinks down the  line, so he very much just deals with impulses.  And his impulse is at I  want to get rid of this person who should never have recused himself from  the Russian investigation in the first place.  </p><p>So, you know, he is putting Republicans in a really tight bind.  And you're  right, I think the voters are going to really speak very loudly -- I think  you hear it happening already in these primary elections -- that they don't  like what's happening.  </p><p>TODD:  But I guess I'd flipped it this way.  If Republicans hold the  Senate, even if they lose 50 House seats, Brad, which -- that calculus is  not out of the question, right?  Republicans could gain a seat, and  Democrats could win 50 House seats.  And you can --</p><p>B. TODD:  Probably win three or four.  </p><p>TODD:  Yes, right, they may.  </p><p>KAPUR:  Yes, they may.  </p><p>B. TODD:  Yes.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Right.  </p><p>TODD:  If Trump has the cocoon of protection of a Republican Senate, right,  that's -- nothing in the House sort of changes his calculus.  </p><p>B. TODD:  Well, in a polarized country, control of the Senate is really  important because it's how you see the government.  </p><p>TODD:  Right.  </p><p>B. TODD:  You confirm judges.  You confirm cabinet secretaries.  It's how  you can -- are able to control the personnel in your own government, so the  control of the Senate is a big deal.  </p><p>And I think that getting a larger amount of control of the Senate is going  to become a bigger and bigger priority of Republicans as we get closer to  the election, and they see a lot more challengers who have shots.  It gives  you a little blanket, too, for 2020.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Yes.  I mean, I think that's really important.  But if the  Democrats take back the House, there's actually going to be oversight  happening on this President.  </p><p>TODD:  No doubt.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  There are actually going to be hearings, and they're going to  have subpoena power and all of this.  So I don't -- you know, I think, yes,  having the Senate will still be a check or a blanket for the President, but  if Democrats win back the House, he is going to have to -- like, there is  going to be reckoning that's going to happen.  </p><p>KAPUR:  The Senate is --</p><p>B. TODD:  Every receipt for every holiday in every vendor they will take,  at least.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD:  There you go.  That's right.  </p><p>KAPUR:  The Senate is enormously consequential because of the issue of  appointments.  Everyone who President wants to appoint to a cabinet  position or, you know, a federal position that is confirmable by the Senate  would have to go through Chuck Schumer's desk if the Democrats win two  seats in November.  </p><p>Now, judges, probably the most significant, most successful project of the  Trump presidency.  He got a 60th judge this week.  He's got 33 on the  district courts, 26 on the appellate courts, one Supreme Court justice  already.  He's got more eight more district judges coming next week, and a  Supreme Court judge in the pipeline.  </p><p>Imagine the difference if it's Chuck Schumer rather than Mitch McConnell  looking at these personal appointees.  It would be a massive complexion  change.  </p><p>TODD:  Daniella, this has a side note.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  Your party didn't have a project, actually, that cares about the  judiciary the way the conservative movement does.  Are you starting to  regret that?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD:  My gosh.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Probably yes.  I think --</p><p>TODD:  I mean, they had sort of a very organized effort.  </p><p>KAPUR:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  I mean, it's been something.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  I mean, if I was in charge --</p><p>TODD:  Yes.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  -- if I had all the moneys, yes, I would -- this should be --</p><p>TODD:  But this has never been a liberal priority, has it?  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  And, you know, it's something I've been talking about with my  colleagues a lot.  You know, at the Center for American Progress, we  actually do have a project called \"Why Courts Matter,\" so we understand the  importance of the judiciary.  </p><p>I don't understand why it isn't something that gets Democrats and  progressives out like it does on the right.  And money is a part of it.   You guys put millions and millions of dollars into these fights, and our  side just doesn't do that.  </p><p>KAPUR:  Progressives were furious this week, by the way, when Senate  Democrats agreed to fast-track votes on seven of Trump's judges.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Yes.  </p><p>KAPUR:  Seven all within about an hour, so seven of them confirmed.  That's  a huge deal.  </p><p>TODD:  I saw.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  By the way, what does Chuck Schumer do?  Yes, go ahead.  </p><p>B. TODD:  And in the year 2030, there will be virtually no one in the  current Senate still there, Donald Trump probably will be dead, and Neil  Gorsuch will still be on the Supreme Court.  </p><p>KAPUR:  Long after President --</p><p>TODD:  Right, Neil Gorsuch.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  But all these --</p><p>TODD:  How many of these judges?  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Yes, all 60 of them.  </p><p>TODD:  Yes.  </p><p>KAPUR:  Long after Trump's presidency fades into history, they'll be making  --</p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  It's so consequential.  </p><p>B. TODD:  Yes.  </p><p>KAPUR:  They'll be becoming decisions.  Almost all of them, I should add,  are in their 40s and 50s.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Yes.  </p><p>KAPUR:  Most of them have been vetted by the Federalist Society.  These are  very conservative people who will be making decisions for a long time.  </p><p>TODD:  I need to -- we have a whole bunch of other mini news items that the  President made in this Bloomberg interview, so let me just resuscitate some  of them.  </p><p>He says an E.U. proposal to animate auto tariffs, not good enough.  </p><p>He says getting Canada into the new NAFTA -- I guess he doesn't want to  call it NAFTA, he calls it into -- the trade deal.  It'll be by Friday or  within a period of time but it will come.  It does feel as if the Canadians  are circling that.  </p><p>He says he does not regret appointing Jerome Powell as Fed Chair, even  though he's been upset about the interest rate decisions.  </p><p>And he says he is thinking of linking capital gains taxes to inflation,  which would be a massive tax cut for a lot of people.  Would it not, Brad?   Like that's something --</p><p>B. TODD:  God created Republicans to cut taxes.  </p><p>TODD:  So that's what --</p><p>KAPUR:  By themselves or without --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KAPUR:  -- without congressional approval, though?  </p><p>TODD:  So none of those headlines are -- let me -- real quick, though, on  getting a new NAFTA.  He's had a horrendous summer.  There's not a lot of  good headlines, child separation -- you start going down with July.  You  know, Scott Pruitt happened in July.  I was, like, for many people, that  was last month.  </p><p>But getting a new trade deal, getting a new NAFTA.  That's not a -- you  know, it looks a lot like old NAFTA.  </p><p>KAPUR:  Right.  </p><p>TODD:  But at least he's going to say, I did it.  </p><p>KAPUR:  He's very eager for a victory on NAFTA.  He doesn't have much on  the deliverable end on the issue of trade other than tariffs that have hurt  -- you know, or that are making a number of members of his own party  nervous, that are hurting Republican Senate candidates in places like  Tennessee and Missouri.  And, I think, North Dakota as well.  </p><p>So I think he wants a victory.  He at least wants to rename NAFTA --</p><p>B. TODD:  Yes, yes.  </p><p>KAPUR:  -- and get the P.R. value of saying, I put my stamp on it.  Beyond  that, we don't know what the details are going to be.  There are some  negotiations still happening with the Mexicans.  </p><p>TODD:  Sure.  </p><p>KAPUR:  The Canadians seem to be moving forward on this.  But we -- there's  more questions than answers right now.  </p><p>TODD:  There's no doubt the Canadians don't want -- like, you could --</p><p>B. TODD:  To be left out.  </p><p>TODD:  Yes.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  They don't want --</p><p>TODD:  Well, and the same time, they'd love to stand up to him but they  can't afford it.  </p><p>B. TODD:  I don't --</p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Right.  </p><p>B. TODD:  I don't want to -- I think we should understand how important the  trade deal renegotiations are to the new coalition that, I think, has been  forming not just because of President Trump, but he's a product of that  reformation.  </p><p>You know, I'm from a town in east Tennessee that had two hosiery mills and  a paper mill and a steel mill as a kid.  They're all gone.  </p><p>TODD:  Right.  </p><p>B. TODD:  And for a lot of people there, they would tell you that trade  deals that we had in the past two decades were part of that equation.  And  the last two presidents didn't do anything to change the course of where we  were headed on trade.  </p><p>And so I think for a lot of people that's been in the middle of the country  and even blue-collar cities on the east coast will tell you this is a  pretty big deal.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  I know.  The proof is going to be in the pudding, right?   It's all about the details.  So he has maybe a minor P.R. win right now,  but we'll see what happens.  And if this trade deal really is something  that benefits the American worker, or like the tax deal, is it going to  benefit the wealthiest?  </p><p>And I'm sorry, after North Korea, I, you know, really don't believe the  hype when it comes out of this White House and its people.  </p><p>TODD:  All right, let me bring up one other political thing that the  President did today.  He sort of bragged about the fact that he's not going  to give a pay raise to federal workers.  Politically, Brad, I get that not  a single -- the base said, great, yes, screw the government.  </p><p>B. TODD:  I think he's writing off Virginia.  </p><p>TODD:  Yes.  Well, but this --</p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Not just Virginia, you know.  </p><p>TODD:  Yes, not just Virginia.  I mean, it is sort of you have -- we don't  have it in the budget, he said.  You could do the $1.6 trillion tax cut and  you can't do this?  Again, how good of politics is it to bash government?  </p><p>B. TODD:  This was --</p><p>TODD:  I mean, I hate to be this cynical.  </p><p>B. TODD:  Well, first of --</p><p>TODD:  Is this a cynical decision -- </p><p>B. TODD:  First off, the Congress will decide it, not him, in the end.  And  I think that the public doesn't trust government right now, either party.   There are plenty of people in the Republican coalition who trust Donald  Trump more than they trust Republicans in Congress.  </p><p>TODD:  Right.  </p><p>B. TODD:  And this is an example of him being a disrupter and trying to say  that he -- whether he actually does it or not, he is proving -- </p><p>TODD:  Do you think that is another one of those things, don't believe it?  </p><p>B. TODD:  He is proving he is willing to say things people won't say and  that he's not taking cues from other people in Washington.  </p><p>TODD:  He doesn't necessarily do what he says on that one.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Right.  </p><p>KAPUR:  And how does this affect someone like Barbara Comstock who's  running for Congress in a tough re-election in D.C.?  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Exactly.  </p><p>TODD:  I think he just --</p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Right.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TODD:  Actually, he did better --</p><p>B. TODD:  -- Virginia in 2020.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  I mean, her opponent already put out -- </p><p>B. TODD:  That tells me Virginia in 2020 for his own race is what I'm sure  he's thinking about rather than that.  </p><p>TODD:  Well, there -- I think he realizes Virginia -- it may be a swing  state again, not in the Trump era.  I think that's fair to say.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Right.  I mean, Barbara Comstock's opponent already put out a  press release about it.  And it's not just Virginia.  There are lots of  states where there are lots of civilian employees that are going to be  really hurt by this.  </p><p>KAPUR:  Yes, this is a matter of priorities.  I mean, the President decided  that he -- that the United States didn't have the money and could borrow  the money for a big increase in military spending and did have, you know,  funds in the Treasury to offer tax breaks.  But on this one, he --</p><p>TODD:  Let's be crass.  </p><p>B. TODD:  He called an increase on the military --</p><p>TODD:  Let's be crass, let's be crass.  There is not a single vote that he  would get if he somehow said, I'm giving a raise to all federal government  workers.  </p><p>B. TODD:  Not a single vote he would gain. </p><p>TODD:  Yes.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Right.  </p><p>B. TODD:  But the military vote does help him.  </p><p>TODD:  Well, and that's --</p><p>B. TODD:  Because a part of the federal workforce that identifies with  Republicans is military.  </p><p>TODD:  Right.  Which is why the rest of the federal workforce is probably  getting a raise because they'll not separate the two, is my guess, which is  probably right.  Congress won't distinguish.   </p><p>KAPUR:  And it's about priorities.  The money is there, clearly.  He just  wants to spend it on certain things and not other things.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Exactly.  </p><p>TODD:  All right, guys.  We'll take a break here.  You guys get to stick  around. </p><p>Up ahead, inside President Trump's war on Google.  </p><p>Plus, a new outage -- outrage at the border.  Why are more and more  Hispanic American citizens being denied their passports?  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Welcome back.  Another entry in a long pattern for President Trump.   When his opponents attacked him in 2016, he gave them labels.  So he  labeled them Lying Ted, Crooked Hillary.  When the news media publishes  stories he doesn't like, he cries fake news, enemy of the people.  </p><p>And now, this week, the President has decided to go after Google for, in  his words, suppressing conservative voices in its search results.  </p><p>The President tweeted, quote, Google search results for Trump news shows  only the viewing/reporting of fake news media.  In other words, they have  it rigged for me and others so that almost all bad -- stories and news is  bad.  They are controlling what we can and cannot see.  This is a very  serious situation.  Will be addressed.  </p><p>The President also tweeted a video in which he accused the search engine of  highlighting President Obama's state of the union addresses but not his  own.  </p><p>Google responded by saying, wrong, that they did, in fact, highlight  President Trump's state of the union address this year.  Not so last year  for a very good reason.  The speech President Trump gave to Congress in  2017 was not a state of the union address.  </p><p>None of them are when you give them in the first year in office.  </p><p>Joining me now is Kara Swisher.  She is the executive editor of the  technology news Web site, Recode.  </p><p>Kara, nice to see you.  </p><p>KARA SWISHER, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, RECODE:  How are you doing, Chuck?  </p><p>TODD:  All right.  Let's start with the President's accusation.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  And then I want to go to something that I think he is touching on  that actually is relevant to this conversation.  </p><p>SWISHER:  OK.  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  So, obviously, he's going after Google.  And it's all part -- this  is -- you know, Steve Bannon ranted about this a long time ago, big tech.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Yes, and he did also last week.  </p><p>TODD:  Right.  </p><p>SWISHER:  He did a bunch last week and he's done it to Amazon -- Amazon,  \"Washington Post.\"  </p><p>TODD:  That's right.  He is --</p><p>SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  Part of it is maybe he doesn't understand the tech world.  </p><p>SWISHER:  No.  </p><p>TODD:  I think that's a big part of it, but the other part of it just feels  ironic.  It's like, is he saying that you guys must stink because I was  able to manipulate your system and look what I did?  I mean, I don't mean  to be that cynical.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Yes, yes.  </p><p>TODD:  But is there any basis to his attack?  </p><p>SWISHER:  No, none whatsoever.  And I'm not one to defend the tech  industry, you know that.  I'm sort of -- I'm very particular about certain  things they've done, and I'm very interested in these hearings next week  where a lot of the leaders are going to come with some of the problems they  had with Cambridge Analytica and things like that.  </p><p>But, in this case, he's completely wrong.  He doesn't know what he's  talking about.  </p><p>TODD:  I want to go to that state of the union attack because this is the  problem that's happening on social media.  The irony is -- and it's  basically Twitter has allowed this to happen, whether they like it or not.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  Their platform has been used for this, which is -- and it's been  regularly done.  Matt Gaetz is a congressman that has done this.  Kevin  McCarthy is a congressman that has done this.  Where they retweet stuff  that they say, this is how they're biased against conservatives but it  turned out to be fake accusations.  Like, the fake accusations about state  of the union, all these false accusations.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Yes, but it's beyond --</p><p>TODD:  But it gets, like, 32,000 retweets.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Of course.  </p><p>TODD:  Or 50,000 likes.  So people still believe it.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Well, you know, I wrote a column in \"The New York Times\" saying  this is codswallop.  But I just was -- I try to find a word that you could  look up on Google very easily.  </p><p>But the fact of the matter is, conservative voices are very loud on social  media.  So are liberal voices, so are crazy voices, so are comedians, and  so is everyone.  And this particular group of people has actually been  advantaged by it because they were largely left out of the mainstream media  until Fox News came along.  </p><p>TODD:  Right.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Now, they have all these platforms to discuss things on.  And  there's been this sort of online rage-fest among them that they are not  heard.  And the line I used is, the people that talk loudest about not  being heard never shut up.  And I think we can all agree that Donald Trump  uses Twitter quite a bit.  </p><p>TODD:  One of the mistakes we in the mainstream media made during -- when  these false accusations against us being biased for 40 years happen is we  started believing, well, maybe we are biased and we got to -- oh, wait, we  can't look biased.  So then we created a lot of false equivalency issues,  OK.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  It looks to me like Silicon Valley is about to fall into that trap.   How do they not fall into that trap?  </p><p>SWISHER:  By ignoring it completely.  Look at what Jeff Bezos is doing  every time he comes after him.  He just doesn't say a word.  I think Google  has to just say this is not true and move along and stuff like that.  </p><p>And, obviously, there, again, are issues that all these companies should  face, you know, of things they have done but not this one.  </p><p>TODD:  All right.  But I want to get into an issue that I actually thought  Steve Bannon addressed very -- you know, in a -- he ranted at the end, but  he, actually, I thought, touched on something that I've gotten into, which  is, who's going to regulate the algorithms?  </p><p>SWISHER:  Right.  </p><p>TODD:  At the end of the day, they're not wrong that, these algorithms,  none of us know what they have.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Right.  </p><p>TODD:  They have all of our information.  Steve Bannon made a  recommendation that I didn't think was a bad one, which was should our info  at least be in a public trust of some sort that they can access all the  time?  </p><p>And we get that, but -- I buy what he's talking about there.  At some  point, we have to figure out how to regulate the algorithms so, at least,  we know if they're being abused.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Well, no, I know.  That's the problem, is you can't do that.   That's such -- then make Google an entity of the government?  </p><p>TODD:  No, you wouldn't make it an entity of the government.  </p><p>SWISHER:  It's called Russia.  </p><p>TODD:  No, no, no.  But it's --</p><p>SWISHER:  It's called the Russian government.  </p><p>TODD:  Well, then how do we regulate an algorithm?  </p><p>SWISHER:  We don't.  We don't.  </p><p>TODD:  Why?  </p><p>SWISHER:  Because they're big companies, and they are -- they're the ones  in charge, just the way CBS used to be in charge of the airwaves.  </p><p>TODD:  OK.  But if Google writes an algorithm that somehow directs -- all  right, let me do a better one.  Let's say one of the -- </p><p>SWISHER:  Facebook or any --</p><p>TODD:  No, monster.com, like an employment site.  And their algorithm seems  to always leave out people of color as your job applicants.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Right, that's a different issue.  </p><p>TODD:  But that's my point.  How do you --</p><p>SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  You know, they could say, oh, we just wrote an algorithm, we didn't  know it was going to do that.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Right.  Well, I think the problem is who is making these things.   That's one of the big issues being discussed with Silicon Valley, like A.I.   You know, there's an -- you know, the old expression, crap in, crap out.  </p><p>And so, you know, if certain people are the only ones designing that, what  happens?  But that's in the Internet.  The Internet has largely been  designed by the small group of people.  That still doesn't mean you should  have a government entity regulating any of that sort of thing.  </p><p>TODD:  All right, but let me go to a consumer thing, OK?  </p><p>SWISHER:  OK.  </p><p>TODD:  So I want to know that I am getting -- I am being treated as a  consumer equally in the state of Texas as I am in the state of North  Dakota.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  And if an Amazon algorithm decides, boy, in Texas, you have more  money.  You can afford to pay this because I know this by where you live  and all this stuff than the north.  Boy, I'm getting -- that's not fair as  a consumer.  </p><p>SWISHER:  That's called marketing and retail for the past hundred years, so  I don't know that can --</p><p>TODD:  No.  Well, I'm wondering -- I get it.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  But on the other hand, if there -- if it's unfair practices, how is  it that we're going to --</p><p>SWISHER:  Is it?  </p><p>TODD:  Well, why shouldn't it?  </p><p>SWISHER:  Why shouldn't it be?  Well, here's the thing, privacy issues,  yes.  I think there's probably going to be a privacy bill, especially if  the Democrats come into power.  I'm absolutely certain there will be some  sort of -- there's been one in California that's been somewhat  controversial, but there will be a national privacy bill at some point  given all these issues we're having.  </p><p>TODD:  Is it going to look like Europe?  </p><p>SWISHER:  I don't know.  Probably not.  I don't think U.S. regulators have  ever been as strong as the ones in Europe.  But, again, there's  international issues too because the Europeans are doing something  different, the Chinese will do something different.  Everyone around the  world in a global society will do something different.  </p><p>TODD:  What's next week going to look like for Twitter and Facebook?  </p><p>SWISHER:  Ah, I don't know.  It depends who shows up.  I mean, if we get  Jack Dorsey and Sheryl Sandberg -- now, there's been calls to bring in  Larry Page who was one of the founders of Google.  It probably will be  Sundar Pichai.  </p><p>I think they're going to quiz them.  I hope they don't quiz them on all  these whether conservatives can speak up or whether anybody can speak out.   They should talk about issues of the meddling in the elections.  They  should talk about privacy.  They should talk about how did this -- how did  their platforms get hijacked by the Russian government.  </p><p>These are critical issues, not whether Donald Trump is loud enough on the  Internet, which I think he is.  I feel he has plenty of voice.  </p><p>TODD:  I was just going to say the Internet has been good to Donald Trump.  </p><p>SWISHER:  That's what I said, they -- Donald Trump should send tech a gold  embossed thank you note for the things that it has done, giving him tools  and all kinds of ways to get in office.  </p><p>TODD:  Right.  So I guess, does the industry --</p><p>SWISHER:  You want me to say you want to regulate -- </p><p>TODD:  No, no, no, no.  But does the industry -- is it ready to come and  say, hey, look, we know we've gotten this big and we need help figuring X  out?  </p><p>SWISHER:  Right.  </p><p>TODD:  Are they ready to at least do that with the government?  </p><p>SWISHER:  I think they have to engage more with the government.  But as you  saw from the Zuckerberg hearings, the politicians really are almost  clueless about technology.  </p><p>TODD:  It's embarrassing.  </p><p>SWISHER:  And it was embarrassing.  And everyone used to say, oh, Mark did  really well.  I say, well, it's a very really low bar.  So, no, he didn't,  but they did badly.</p><p>TODD:  I would love Mr. Zuckerberg to come here.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Well, I will ask him.  </p><p>TODD:  And I would -- no, they haven't.  Like, none of them will stay,  though.  </p><p>SWISHER:  None of them will?  </p><p>TODD:  Yes, I would love to be quizzed by some of those members of  Congress, too.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Yes, yes.  I would like members of Congress who actually know  something about technology to do the quizzing, but that's, you know.  </p><p>TODD:  I think it's time to let them staffers do the quizzing and all.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  Do you expect any sort of -- I think Donald Trump, Jr. said, oh,  we're going to have a conservative alternative.  Is that plausible out  there and realistic?  </p><p>SWISHER:  Sure, go ahead.  They can do it.  It's the big wide Internet.  </p><p>TODD:  Right, but is there anybody out there that actually could do it?  </p><p>SWISHER:  You know, there were rumors of Peter Thiel and Steve Bannon  getting together.  I keep hearing them getting together and creating their  own.  I'm sure there will be a digital element to it if they do it.   There's all kinds of rumors around that.  </p><p>Obviously, Fox News has digital elements.  Are you kidding?  There are so  many conservative publications on the Internet now, Breitbart, all the  others.  They've had -- the Internet has been very, very good to them.  </p><p>TODD:  Yes.  </p><p>SWISHER:  So I don't know if they should complain quite so much.  </p><p>TODD:  I think their biggest complaint is called capitalism.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  Kara Swisher, thanks for coming on.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Thank you.  </p><p>TODD:  Much appreciated.  Up ahead, the uproar over a new crackdown on  Hispanic Americans that are American citizens.  They're being denied  passports or having their passports taken away.  </p><p>But, first, it's the emotional tribute to Senator John McCain.  Some 3,500  people gathered in a Phoenix church to honor McCain's life of service.  </p><p>Twenty-four sitting U.S. senators attended that service.  So did four  former senators, including former Vice President Joe Biden who remembered  Senator McCain as a leader who always put country before party.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  John was a hero.   His character, courage, honor, integrity.  But I think the thing that's  understated the most is his optimism.  That's what made John special.  It  made John a giant among all of us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Welcome back. Tonight I'm obsessed with President Trump's morning  tweetstorm. More unusual than normal, even for him. Those tweets were a  plague of defensive outbursts, baseless assertions and outright falsehoods,  the kind of statements that have fact checkers working overtime or simply  throwing up their hands.</p><p>But it got us wondering, what if in some Seinfeld-like Bizarro universe,  President Trump tweeted the exact opposite of what he tweeted this morning?  What would that look like? Hmm, would it be more believable if President  Trump had tweeted something like this? When Lester Holt accurately played  my tape on Russia, I was hurt badly.</p><p>Or how about this? Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner had everything to do with  the pushing out of Don McGahn. The news media has it right. Has it so  right. Or how about this one? The legitimate Russia investigation had  everything to do with respect to my decision on Don McGahn.</p><p>And then another one on Don McGahn. I'm very excited about the person who  will be taking the place of Don McGahn as White House counsel. I never  liked Don, and he was responsible for me not firing Bob Mueller or Jeff  Sessions. And finally, I just cannot state strongly enough how totally  dishonest I am. Truth doesn't matter to me. I only have my hatred and  agenda.</p><p>As Jerry Seinfeld and George Costanza, if every instinct you have is wrong,  then the opposite would have to be right. Right?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Welcome back. The Trump administration's crackdown along the Mexican  border isn't just limited to people trying to come here illegally. Now a  growing number of Hispanic-Americans are being denied passports because the  government is questioning their citizenship.</p><p>The Washington Post reports that the Trump administration is accusing  hundreds and possibly thousands of people of using fraudulent birth  certificates since they were babies. The government alleges that some  midwives and physicians along the border gave U.S. birth certificates to  people who were actually born in Mexico decades ago.</p><p>In a statement to The Washington Post, the State Department said it \"has  not changed policy or practice regarding the adjudication of passport  applications and the U.S.-Mexico border region happens to be an area of the  country where there has been a significant incidence of citizenship fraud.\"</p><p>It's true that this happened under George W. Bush and the Obama  administrations too, but that mostly ended after a government settlement in  2009. This news as taking away people's citizenship is on the rise under  President Trump.</p><p>And to try to understand this piece and this issue a little better, I'm  joined now by NBC News national security and justice reporter Julia Ainsley  and Attorney Jaime Diaz who represents some of the U.S. citizens who have  been either denied passports or had them taken away. Welcome to both of  you.</p><p>Julia, let me start with you. When did this begin? How pervasive do we  think it is? And is this connected to the sort of prediction, if you will,  that this was the next thing Stephen Miller, who's sort of the chief  advisor on all immigration issues in the West Wing, this is the next step  he wanted to take?</p><p>JULIA AINSLEY, NATIONAL SECURITY AND JUSTICE REPORTER, NBC NEWS:  Chuck,  context here is critical. You're exactly right. We know that Stephen Miller  -- the next step he wants to do is go after legal immigration.</p><p>What we're seeing here is part of this new fraud crackdown from DHS and  throughout the Trump administration like the State Department. They're  trying to go after people who maybe lied on their applications and became  citizens or became permanent residents and got green cards who shouldn't  have.</p><p>So they want to go back and re-adjudicate and take that away. But of course  what happens and what The Washington Post laid out in this story is a lot  of people who were rightfully in the United States end up getting their  rights taken away too.</p><p>And as they found under the Obama administration, it's very difficult to  decide which ones of those birth certificates signed by those midwives in  the '90s were legitimate and which ones weren't. And so they really just  decided it was a fruitless cause and that they should just allow them --  take them as legitimate.</p><p>But this is part of a broader crackdown. And from people I've spoken to who  represent a lot of immigrants who are trying to move up the ladder, get  passports, get citizenships, get green cards, they say before you take that  next step, you need to go through your record and make sure everything is  crystal clear or it could just not even be worth it.</p><p>It's too much of a risk because of the scrutiny they're doing going back  and looking at everything and every application you've put in earlier, even  if they were legitimate, Chuck.</p><p>TODD:  All right. Let me go to Jaime Diaz. Jaime, I wanted Julia to begin  there to help me continue to sort of lay out the context of all of this.  Now walk me through what you're dealing with. How many clients do you have  that have been impacted?</p><p>How many of them are natural born citizens versus those who went through  the green card process and became naturalized citizens here, born here  versus naturalized, all of those things. I'm curious. What kind of folks  are being targeted here? </p><p>JAIME DIAZ, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY:  Here we're talking only about people  that were born in the United States.</p><p>TODD:  OK. How many clients do you have on this front?</p><p>DIAZ:  I have represented over 500 people. I presently have probably 30  people that are in lawsuits in federal court. I have represented over 100  of them in lawsuits in federal court where they have been taken away their  documents. They have been put in rooms to admit that they were not born in  the United States.</p><p>Their mothers have been asked to come to the consulate to admit that they  were not born there and the documents were taken. What we see now is that  they are detaining them. When they come back -- without allowing them to  come back and keep them in Mexico.</p><p>There are many clients of mine that I have that were born in the United  States, that the government has stopped them and have kept them in Mexico.  And the crackdown is starting to be very hard. They are doing it every day. I see someone in my office.</p><p>I practice in Brownsville, Texas which is at the border with Mexico. People  that were born by midwives down there, there is a lot of them, but I can  tell you something, that most of them were born in the United States.</p><p>We even have a soldier that was born with a midwife and he applied to  become a soldier. They took him in. He applied for a passport and they say,  show that you're a United States citizen. This is ridiculous.</p><p>TODD:  Well, there was one example in The Washington Post, Mr. Diaz, and  I'm just curious if you had to deal with something like this where it was a  former soldier and he only wanted to give his first name because he was  afraid he'd be targeted.</p><p>He said that the State Department told him that they weren't convinced he  was a U.S. citizen, that they needed a bunch of the following documents.  Either his mother's -- evidence of his mother's prenatal care, his  baptismal certificate, maybe rental agreements when he was a baby.</p><p>This is a grown man. I'm sorry, I don't think my mother has the power bill  from when I was born in 1972. Is this the burden of proof that's being put  on your clients?</p><p>DIAZ:  Yes. That is what's going on. They are asking for things that no one  has. No one in the whole United States has prenatal record from her mother.  A person that is 40 years old, there's no way they have them. So they're  asking for things that they know they don't have. People get frustrated.</p><p>But if you live on the border, there is a need for you to cross to the  other side. You have family, you have things to do on the other side. And  when they're coming back, that's when they're detaining them. They're  making them sign documents so that they can get away from it.</p><p>What has happened is outrageous. An opportunity like this to tell the  American people what is going on is incredible. We're not talking about  people that are naturalized, we are talking about people that were born in  the United States. They just happen to have a Hispanic last name and they  were born with midwives, but that's still Americans.</p><p>TODD:  Mr. Diaz, did you have any client who didn't have a Hispanic last  name who had their passport taken away?</p><p>DIAZ:  Not that I can remember right now on the top of my head. Most of  them have been taken away, no. I have people that I represented that are  having difficulty getting a passport because they were born in Southern  Texas with a midwife. But someone that has a passport taken away or revoked  when they were coming back or through a letter in the mail, no, I have  never had it.</p><p>TODD:  So it does feel as if it is Hispanic surnames that get targeted  here. Julia, walk me through the due process in this. What are the court  procedures here? You're accused of this, you're trying to fight back. Where  does it go in the system?</p><p>AINSLEY:  It's really hard to fight back, Chuck. I mean, you would have to  get a lawyer. I know a lot of people who stay outside of places where  immigrants are trying to appeal and they know that they will eventually  come across the street and find lawyers because it's nearly impossible to  navigate this system on your own.</p><p>As Jaime just pointed out, they're asking for these documents a lot of  people don't have. And as an American citizen, yes, you have the right to  have citizenship, but that passport, the documents that you have to have a  passport, it's not a right to have a passport if you don't have the  documents to back it up.</p><p>TODD:  Right.</p><p>AINSLEY:  And when they're raising this bar, there actually very few routes  to go. The way this was handled in the past, Chuck, was through a class  action settlement and that's frequently the way we see immigrants or even  U.S.-born immigrants, the children of immigrants seek their rights, that  they're able to go through the ACLU. They have to come in a class action  suit with lots of people and then they are able to get justice.</p><p>That's what happened in 2009 when the ACLU said, look, you can't tell which  one of these midwife birth certificates are illegitimate and which ones  aren't, and we think that it's a very small amount of children that were  actually born in Mexico. And so, therefore, you can't discriminate based on  them having this one type of birth certificate. So the answer is it is  really hard to get justice without a class action lawsuit in this case.</p><p>TODD:  Mr. Diaz, is there anything in the -- why is the burden of proof not  on the government to prove you're not a U.S. citizen?</p><p>DIAZ:  The burden (INAUDIBLE) evidence and this is a civil case. The  government does not have any way to prove that you are -- to prove beyond a  reasonable doubt that you fraudulently obtained that document. First of  all, these are documents that were registered when you were a baby. And the  only way to prove it is if you knew that that document was fraudulent when  you grew up.</p><p>So, you know, what they do is they try to take you away from going to  court. That's why they detain you at ports of entry and they keep you and  say stay in Mexico. How do you come back if you will stay in Mexico and you  were thrown into --</p><p>TODD:  You're not a Mexican citizen. You're not a Mexican citizen. What are  you going to do? </p><p>DIAZ:  It is really -- the stories -- unfortunately I don't have the time  to tell you all the stories that I have seen of people. But I can tell you  one thing. We have won all those cases. What is sad is after you win all  those cases, you would think the government would say, you know, I have to  change. No, they go harder. Eventually there will be no attorney that will  represent these people, but I'm here to represent them.</p><p>TODD:  Let me ask you this. Is there -- how many of your clients that you felt like they were detained longer than they should be thrown in  jail and what were they thrown in jail for if they were? </p><p>DIAZ:  They were thrown to jail -- they get thrown immigration detention  centers. I had a guy that was detained for three days at a detention center  --</p><p>TODD:  American citizen? An American citizen?</p><p>DIAZ:  An American citizen. Yes, sir.</p><p>TODD:  Detained -- put into a detention center and just because, what, he  didn't have a passport or they didn't believe his passport?</p><p>DIAZ:  No, he had a passport. They just said, we have a note that we need  to revoke your passport so they put him in a room. The agent asked him, do  you want me to treat you like a Mexican or as a U.S. citizen? What I would  have told him, treat him like a human being, give him his rights. He has a  right to hear whatever evidence you think you have. But the way they're  treating people is not right.</p><p>TODD:  All right. Julia Ainsley, Jaime Diaz, I've got to leave it there. I  thank you both for sharing your expertise and your experiences there, thank  you.</p><p>Up ahead, the empire state strikes back. We'll show you some of last  night's New York gubernatorial debate between Andrew Cuomo and Cynthia  Nixon. Let's just say a little feisty.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Welcome back. In tonight's \"Meet the Midterms,\" the feuding factions  of the Democratic Party literally on full display.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D), NEW YORK:  The subway system is owned by New York  City.</p><p>CYNTHIA NIXON, DEMOCRATIC GUBERNATORIAL NOMINEE: The MTA has been  controlled by the state since 1965.</p><p>CUOMO:  Excuse me, can you stop interrupting? Can you stop interrupting?</p><p>NIXON:  Can you stop lying?</p><p>NIXON:  Yeah, as soon as you do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD:  I guess they call that a cell phone. That was New York Governor  Andrew Cuomo seeking his third term and challenger Cynthia Nixon, an  actress and self-described Democratic socialist going out last night in  their one and only debate before New York's primary September 13th. That  handshake at the end may have been the most civil moment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NIXON:  I'm not an Albany insider, like Governor Cuomo, but I think that  experience doesn't mean that much if you're not actually good at governing.</p><p>CUOMO:  My opponent lives in the world of fiction, I live in the world of  fact.</p><p>NIXON:  We already have a corrupt corporate Republican in the White House.  We don't need a corrupt corporate Democrat in Albany as his main  opposition.</p><p>CUOMO:  She released five years of corporate taxes, dumped them in three  hours on a Friday with no notice. Only Donald Trump has done less  transparency on his taxes than my opponent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD:  Nixon is still a long shot to win the nomination. She trailed Cuomo  by 31 points in a Siena College poll from last month.</p><p>But let's see, in a year in which Democrats tapped underdog Andrew Gillum,  who wasn't polling very high in many polls to run for governor in Florida  and in a year in which Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who Nixon endorsed won over  Congressman Joe Crowley in the Bronx there, are you really going to  discount her chances? More \"MTP Daily\" after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Time now for \"The Lid.\" The panel is back: Sahil, Daniella, and  Brad. All right, the president, we got more from your Bloomberg interview.  You're just dribbling it out. You know, we in the -- we just put it all out  there. But anyway, you dribbled it out. We got a little bit which is,  here's what he said about the Mueller probe. We will put it up on the  screen here.</p><p>I view it as an illegal investigation because great scholars -- that's his  quote -- have said that there never should have been a special counsel.  This is an answer when asked if he would comply with the subpoena for  Mueller, he said I'll see what happens there.</p><p>He talks about Mueller being an illegal probe all the time. Let me ask  this, Brad. Do any of the supporters wonder why he just doesn't end it? He  has the power. He is the president.</p><p>BRAD TODD, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST AND FOUNDING PARTNER OF ONMESSAGE INC.:  I  don't think many of the supporters think very much about the Mueller probe.  I think the president thinks about it a lot more than his supporters do.</p><p>C.TOOD:  I think the president thinks about it more than anybody around  this table sometimes.</p><p>B.TODD:  I think the president's voters are -- we'll wait until the Mueller  probe is over with and we'll see what he has and we'll evaluate it. I don't  think it's something that they're obsessed about. Washington is obsessed  about it. They lead (ph) the paper everyday.</p><p>C.TODD:  Sure.</p><p>B.TODD:  It doesn't lead the paper in Kenosho (ph).</p><p>C.TODD:  No, that I buy. He has the power to end these things if he really  wanted to. He obviously knows it would be a problem.</p><p>SAHIL KAPUR, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, BLOOMBERG NEWS:  It's not the  prevailing view of members of his own party in Congress, that it's an  illegal investigation. The Senate majority leader and the speaker of the  House say they support the investigation. That is not only legal but it is  proper that it should come to an end.</p><p>So I think this is the president feeling like there is a lot happening  around him. The walls may be closing in on him. I think he is lashing out.  He may be binging cable news, according to some people around him that I  spoke to.</p><p>DANIELLA GIBBS LEGER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, COMMUNICATIONS AND STRATEGY AT  AMERICAN PROGRESS:  Yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>C. TODD:  He needed something to do. I think they're glad they scheduled  this rally this afternoon.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Yeah, very well timed.</p><p>B.TODD:  The special counsel has a responsibility too. He presumably  supports the idea that special counsel should exist and he has to know when  he's gone past the time limit of when he has credibility.</p><p>C.TODD:  What time limit are we at? This is not even at the halfway point.</p><p>B.TODD:  He's had more than a year.</p><p>C.TODD:  Not even a halfway point.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  So what? You just arbitrarily stop because --</p><p>B.TODD:  He has to decide when the public thinks he's gone too far on time  and show his cards.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  He has to go until the investigation is over. If he keeps  uncovering more crimes --</p><p>B. TODD:  All appointments are political, though, you have a certain amount  of political rope. He has to judge where the American public is and whether  it's willing to let him go on.</p><p>C. TODD:  Here is what I've learned about Bob Mueller. Not a single person  that has known him been with him, worked with him, would say if he didn't  have any -- he would have ended this investigation if there is no  collusion, that he already would have ended it.</p><p>B. TODD:  We can't tell that though until he tells us something. </p><p>C.TODD:  That's true. Right, we are just left here in what is the last  chapter --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KAPUR:  This is not the issue that resonates in most of the country. I do  think public opinion is calcified on this issue for now. New developments  in this case are not necessarily going to move the needle unless they  directly relate to the president. I don't know that the fall of people  around him is going to affect the midterm elections. But this is baked in.  It's one of the reasons that the president --</p><p>D.TODD:  But here is the question --</p><p>KAPUR:  -- not like it doesn't affect him at all.</p><p>B.TODD:  We're at Labor Day. And I think if Mueller comes back with  anything between Labor Day and the election, half the country is going to  reject it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>C.TODD:  I think he knows, more than anything, he keeps quiet between Labor  Day and election day, don't you think?</p><p>B.TODD:  Then he's going to be pushing up against two years before you know  it. I mean, it's too long.</p><p>C.TODD:  No, no, no --</p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  That's why I feel like --</p><p>C. TODD:  This is a trap that Giuliani is trying to set, I think, PR-wise,  which is you're taking forever. Wait, why are you speaking during the  election --</p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Exactly. That's why I feel like maybe January 2019 is going  to be the time when Mueller announces everything. Because it's enough time  before the 2020 election, but you wait until after this election so you  don't have people saying -- </p><p>C. TODD:  I'm not missing work tomorrow. I wouldn't miss work tomorrow.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  That's right.</p><p>C. TODD:  Tomorrow is the last business day of the pre-Labor Day to  election day window, Sahil.</p><p>KAPUR:  And this is where there's so much at stake in the 2018 elections  because whoever controls the House is going to decide what the fate -- what  comes of this report that Mueller files.</p><p>Now, to the issue of subpoenas and, you know, potentially what the White  House would do if he's forced to -- or if he's subpoenaed, they will very  likely challenge this in court and the president probably won't end up  speaking executive privilege.</p><p>The White House can find a way around this, I think, to make sure that they  don't face any court conviction because it's not -- I'm sorry, indictment  because it's not happened to a sitting president so far. Congress is going  to decide.</p><p>C. TODD:  Not to be totally cliche, 5:00 tomorrow is a big deadline, isn't  it?</p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Yeah.</p><p>C. TODD:  Unofficially for a lot of people. I mean, we assume Mueller  wouldn't do it until -- tomorrow at 5:00 p.m. is the last possible time.</p><p>B.TODD:  Chuck, every Friday night is entertaining in this presidency.</p><p>C.TODD:  Let's try putting on a Sunday show.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>C. TODD:  We don't find it entertaining, we find it mind boggling.</p><p>B.TODD:  You always wanted things to get a little more exciting. You wanted  a little more of a president who is unscripted.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  It would be perfect, the Friday before Labor Day to have like  this big thing.</p><p>C.TODD:  Today we had an arrest of somebody who threatened The Boston Globe  using \"you're the enemy of the people.\" Sahil, you're the other working  journalist here. The U.S. attorney went after and arrested this person.  This person, \"you're the enemy of the people, and we're going to kill  every\" -- whatever the caller said to Globe.</p><p>You know, there's always this decision, do we alert authorities or not? At  this point the guy called so many times and, you know, maybe holding  somebody criminally responsible does sort of make people responsible for  their rhetoric.</p><p>KAPUR:  Yeah. There were 14 phone calls here of this man using all kinds of  nasty language that I can't repeat here. Yes, he used the phrase \"the enemy  of the people,\" where have we heard that before.</p><p>I want to be very clear, the president is not condoning violence against  anybody, but it's not difficult to see how someone can listen to that, see  that rhetoric and want to do something crazy if they are not mentally  stable. </p><p>C. TODD:  This has always been our point. We know the president is not --  he needs to actually say that he doesn't mean it. All right. Sahil,  Daniella, Brad, thank you all. We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  That's all we have for tonight. We'll be back tomorrow with more  \"MTP Daily.\" Remember, 5:00 p.m. tomorrow is a big deadline, perhaps in the  Mueller probe. \"The Beat\" starts right now. Ayman Mohyeldin is in for Ari.

It has been a memorable one.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> That will do it for this hour.  I'm Katy Tur, again, in for Nicolle  Wallace.  \"MTP DAILY\" starts right now with Chuck Todd.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Hi, Chuck.  Hello.    </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> CHUCK TODD, MSNBC HOST:  Katy Tur.</p><p> TUR:  Charles.  </p><p> TODD:  How are you?  I see -- look, that's what Pete does to me.  By the  way, next time, if Pete Williams ever does a Katharine on you, just call  him Lewis.  </p><p> TUR:  You know, I had someone online yesterday say, I was surprised to find  out that Katharine was your full name.  And I said, really?  </p><p> TODD:  Well --</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> TODD:  Yes.  Is it that hard to figure out?  </p><p> TUR:  Well, apparently.  </p><p> TODD:  It's like, oh, you're a Charles?  Yes, most Chucks are.  </p><p> TUR:  Yes.  </p><p> TODD:  Yes.  </p><p> TUR:  Katy, Katharine.  What are you going to do?  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> TODD:  All right.  Thank you, Katy.  </p><p> TUR:  You bet.  </p><p> TODD:  If it's Thursday, it's the eye of the tweetstorm.  </p><p> Good evening.  I'm Chuck Todd here in Washington and welcome to MTP DAILY.   If it's Thursday, the President is making assertions that, to some, come  across as paranoid, conspiratorial, full of projection, and at times, a bit  Orwellian.  </p><p> And if that isn't concerning enough, we're learning that some of the most  important people whose jobs are to act as a guardrail against the  President's behavior or instincts are leaving, giving up, rationalizing it,  or simply being ousted.  </p><p> Folks, that is a recipe for bad things getting worse.  So let's dive in.   The President today all but said reject the evidence of your eyes and ears.   He suggested, without evidence, because there is none, that part of the  tape of him on camera in that interview with my colleague, Lester Holt, was  fudged, as he puts it.  </p><p> OK.  Not true.  You might remember that was the interview where the  President said, yes, he fired James Comey in part because of the Russia  investigation.  That was just one baseless allegation in a series of  baseless allegations about the press, books, tapes, journalistic sources,  and news executives that he claims are all conspiring against him.  </p><p> The President, also, went after a top Justice Department official by  claiming that this official was involved in some kind of Russian collusion  and should be fired because of it.  </p><p> The President suggested that he ousted his White House Counsel, Don McGahn,  just 24 hours after saying McGahn was leaving on his own accord.  </p><p> Folks, McGahn was a key check on some of the President's impulsiveness.   McGahn also testified to Bob Mueller extensively about his boss's impulses,  which reportedly included at least two attempts to fire Mueller.  </p><p> So yesterday, we learned that McGahn is leaving.  Today, we learned that  the White House ethics lawyer is out effective tomorrow.  And it looks as  if the Attorney General is likely going to be ousted after the midterms  according to several top Senate Republicans.  </p><p> And amid it all, we're hearing some Senate Republicans either shrug their  shoulders or tell themselves that Hillary Clinton would be more corrupt or  that the President is just too inept to commit a crime like conspiring with  Russia.  </p><p> Let's bring in tonight's panel.  Sahil Kapur is a national political  reporter with Bloomberg News.  And they had a big interview with the  President a few minutes ago, so we get some scoop there.  </p><p> Daniella Gibbs Leger, a senior vice president for the Center for American  Progress.  </p><p> And Brad Todd is a Republican strategist and ad maker.  I haven't seen you  in a while.  Welcome back.  </p><p> BRAD TODD, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Thanks a lot.  </p><p> TODD:  All right, Sahil, the President -- let's get to the quick news here  -- making quick headlines.  I guess the biggest one is Jeff Sessions' job  is safe for 60 days.  </p><p> SAHIL KAPUR, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, BLOOMBERG NEWS:  That's correct,  at least 60 days.  The President would not comment when my colleagues asked  him what would happen to the Attorney General after that, but there's  widespread speculation, given the President's very public attacks on his  A.G., that his job may not last beyond that.  </p><p> Now, Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, said earlier this week  he has total confidence in Jeff Sessions and he should stay exactly where  he is.  That is a signal that McConnell doesn't want anything to mess with  the Kavanaugh hearings.  </p><p> And the second things is, who do you put in his place if you get rid of  Jeff Sessions?  It's a 50 to 49 Senate right now.  Some of those  Republicans are not going to be comfortable supporting another A.G. unless  they promise to protect the Russia investigation and the Mueller probe,  which is precisely why it seems the President wants Sessions gone.  So it's  hard to know, you know, what the end game is here.  </p><p> TODD:  Let me underscore this midterm issue, though, Daniella and Brad,  because I think the voters are going to have a say as to the future of Jeff  Sessions.  Meaning this, my theory is if somehow Democrats win the Senate,  that actually might change Republicans' calculations in the Senate.  If  somehow they won the Senate.  </p><p> Brad, is that a fair -- that, all of a sudden, you'd have a different set  of -- because, right now, you have a bunch of Republican senators that are  going, look, he's popular with the base.  </p><p> B. TODD:  Well, it wasn't widely noted last fall when Charles Grassley,  chairman of the Judiciary Committee, sent out a tweet that that said I have  no time to schedule any Attorney General confirmation hearings this year.  </p><p> Some people may have noted that, last week, he said that now he does have  some time.  And he changed --</p><p> TODD:  Yes.  And he's got a separate beef.   </p><p> B. TODD:  He does.  </p><p> TODD:  He does have a separate beef with the -- </p><p> B. TODD:  He does.  But you can't have a new Attorney General until you  have hearings to confirm a new Attorney General, and you can't do it on the  floor until you have a majority leader willing to schedule a vote on the  floor.  </p><p> So even if the did want to fire Jeff Sessions, he's going to be replaced  with Rod Rosenstein.  And so the -- and until the Senate Republicans decide  that they think it's time.  </p><p> TODD:  So is that -- that's why it feels as if, at the end of the day,  Mitch McConnell is a calculator.  And I mean that as a compliment.  He  reads the tea leaves.  And it's about being in power.  And if he's not in  power, he wants to figure out why he was not in power.  </p><p> DANIELLA GIBBS LEGER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND  STRATEGY, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS:  Yes.  </p><p> TODD:  And he would probably only have one person to blame if he's not  Senate majority leader this election year.  </p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  Yes, I think that's right.  You know, look, Donald Trump  hasn't listened to Mitch McConnell in the past either because I'm pretty  sure Mitch McConnell did not want him to nominate Brett Kavanaugh for a  host of reasons.  So I don't know how that's going to play into his  calculus.  </p><p> I think, you know, we've already said what comes after Jeff Sessions.   Donald Trump is not somebody who strikes me as someone who thinks down the  line, so he very much just deals with impulses.  And his impulse is at I  want to get rid of this person who should never have recused himself from  the Russian investigation in the first place.  </p><p> So, you know, he is putting Republicans in a really tight bind.  And you're  right, I think the voters are going to really speak very loudly -- I think  you hear it happening already in these primary elections -- that they don't  like what's happening.  </p><p> TODD:  But I guess I'd flipped it this way.  If Republicans hold the  Senate, even if they lose 50 House seats, Brad, which -- that calculus is  not out of the question, right?  Republicans could gain a seat, and  Democrats could win 50 House seats.  And you can --</p><p> B. TODD:  Probably win three or four.  </p><p> TODD:  Yes, right, they may.  </p><p> KAPUR:  Yes, they may.  </p><p> B. TODD:  Yes.  </p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  Right.  </p><p> TODD:  If Trump has the cocoon of protection of a Republican Senate, right,  that's -- nothing in the House sort of changes his calculus.  </p><p> B. TODD:  Well, in a polarized country, control of the Senate is really  important because it's how you see the government.  </p><p> TODD:  Right.  </p><p> B. TODD:  You confirm judges.  You confirm cabinet secretaries.  It's how  you can -- are able to control the personnel in your own government, so the  control of the Senate is a big deal.  </p><p> And I think that getting a larger amount of control of the Senate is going  to become a bigger and bigger priority of Republicans as we get closer to  the election, and they see a lot more challengers who have shots.  It gives  you a little blanket, too, for 2020.  </p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  Yes.  I mean, I think that's really important.  But if the  Democrats take back the House, there's actually going to be oversight  happening on this President.  </p><p> TODD:  No doubt.  </p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  There are actually going to be hearings, and they're going to  have subpoena power and all of this.  So I don't -- you know, I think, yes,  having the Senate will still be a check or a blanket for the President, but  if Democrats win back the House, he is going to have to -- like, there is  going to be reckoning that's going to happen.  </p><p> KAPUR:  The Senate is --</p><p> B. TODD:  Every receipt for every holiday in every vendor they will take,  at least.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> TODD:  There you go.  That's right.  </p><p> KAPUR:  The Senate is enormously consequential because of the issue of  appointments.  Everyone who President wants to appoint to a cabinet  position or, you know, a federal position that is confirmable by the Senate  would have to go through Chuck Schumer's desk if the Democrats win two  seats in November.  </p><p> Now, judges, probably the most significant, most successful project of the  Trump presidency.  He got a 60th judge this week.  He's got 33 on the  district courts, 26 on the appellate courts, one Supreme Court justice  already.  He's got more eight more district judges coming next week, and a  Supreme Court judge in the pipeline.  </p><p> Imagine the difference if it's Chuck Schumer rather than Mitch McConnell  looking at these personal appointees.  It would be a massive complexion  change.  </p><p> TODD:  Daniella, this has a side note.  </p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  Yes.  </p><p> TODD:  Your party didn't have a project, actually, that cares about the  judiciary the way the conservative movement does.  Are you starting to  regret that?  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> TODD:  My gosh.  </p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  Probably yes.  I think --</p><p> TODD:  I mean, they had sort of a very organized effort.  </p><p> KAPUR:  Yes.  </p><p> TODD:  I mean, it's been something.  </p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  I mean, if I was in charge --</p><p> TODD:  Yes.  </p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  -- if I had all the moneys, yes, I would -- this should be --</p><p> TODD:  But this has never been a liberal priority, has it?  </p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  And, you know, it's something I've been talking about with my  colleagues a lot.  You know, at the Center for American Progress, we  actually do have a project called \"Why Courts Matter,\" so we understand the  importance of the judiciary.  </p><p> I don't understand why it isn't something that gets Democrats and  progressives out like it does on the right.  And money is a part of it.   You guys put millions and millions of dollars into these fights, and our  side just doesn't do that.  </p><p> KAPUR:  Progressives were furious this week, by the way, when Senate  Democrats agreed to fast-track votes on seven of Trump's judges.  </p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  Yes.  </p><p> KAPUR:  Seven all within about an hour, so seven of them confirmed.  That's  a huge deal.  </p><p> TODD:  I saw.  </p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  Yes.  </p><p> TODD:  By the way, what does Chuck Schumer do?  Yes, go ahead.  </p><p> B. TODD:  And in the year 2030, there will be virtually no one in the  current Senate still there, Donald Trump probably will be dead, and Neil  Gorsuch will still be on the Supreme Court.  </p><p> KAPUR:  Long after President --</p><p> TODD:  Right, Neil Gorsuch.  </p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  But all these --</p><p> TODD:  How many of these judges?  </p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  Yes, all 60 of them.  </p><p> TODD:  Yes.  </p><p> KAPUR:  Long after Trump's presidency fades into history, they'll be making  --</p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  It's so consequential.  </p><p> B. TODD:  Yes.  </p><p> KAPUR:  They'll be becoming decisions.  Almost all of them, I should add,  are in their 40s and 50s.  </p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  Yes.  </p><p> KAPUR:  Most of them have been vetted by the Federalist Society.  These are  very conservative people who will be making decisions for a long time.  </p><p> TODD:  I need to -- we have a whole bunch of other mini news items that the  President made in this Bloomberg interview, so let me just resuscitate some  of them.  </p><p> He says an E.U. proposal to animate auto tariffs, not good enough.  </p><p> He says getting Canada into the new NAFTA -- I guess he doesn't want to  call it NAFTA, he calls it into -- the trade deal.  It'll be by Friday or  within a period of time but it will come.  It does feel as if the Canadians  are circling that.  </p><p> He says he does not regret appointing Jerome Powell as Fed Chair, even  though he's been upset about the interest rate decisions.  </p><p> And he says he is thinking of linking capital gains taxes to inflation,  which would be a massive tax cut for a lot of people.  Would it not, Brad?   Like that's something --</p><p> B. TODD:  God created Republicans to cut taxes.  </p><p> TODD:  So that's what --</p><p> KAPUR:  By themselves or without --</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> KAPUR:  -- without congressional approval, though?  </p><p> TODD:  So none of those headlines are -- let me -- real quick, though, on  getting a new NAFTA.  He's had a horrendous summer.  There's not a lot of  good headlines, child separation -- you start going down with July.  You  know, Scott Pruitt happened in July.  I was, like, for many people, that  was last month.  </p><p> But getting a new trade deal, getting a new NAFTA.  That's not a -- you  know, it looks a lot like old NAFTA.  </p><p> KAPUR:  Right.  </p><p> TODD:  But at least he's going to say, I did it.  </p><p> KAPUR:  He's very eager for a victory on NAFTA.  He doesn't have much on  the deliverable end on the issue of trade other than tariffs that have hurt  -- you know, or that are making a number of members of his own party  nervous, that are hurting Republican Senate candidates in places like  Tennessee and Missouri.  And, I think, North Dakota as well.  </p><p> So I think he wants a victory.  He at least wants to rename NAFTA --</p><p> B. TODD:  Yes, yes.  </p><p> KAPUR:  -- and get the P.R. value of saying, I put my stamp on it.  Beyond  that, we don't know what the details are going to be.  There are some  negotiations still happening with the Mexicans.  </p><p> TODD:  Sure.  </p><p> KAPUR:  The Canadians seem to be moving forward on this.  But we -- there's  more questions than answers right now.  </p><p> TODD:  There's no doubt the Canadians don't want -- like, you could --</p><p> B. TODD:  To be left out.  </p><p> TODD:  Yes.  </p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  They don't want --</p><p> TODD:  Well, and the same time, they'd love to stand up to him but they  can't afford it.  </p><p> B. TODD:  I don't --</p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  Right.  </p><p> B. TODD:  I don't want to -- I think we should understand how important the  trade deal renegotiations are to the new coalition that, I think, has been  forming not just because of President Trump, but he's a product of that  reformation.  </p><p> You know, I'm from a town in east Tennessee that had two hosiery mills and  a paper mill and a steel mill as a kid.  They're all gone.  </p><p> TODD:  Right.  </p><p> B. TODD:  And for a lot of people there, they would tell you that trade  deals that we had in the past two decades were part of that equation.  And  the last two presidents didn't do anything to change the course of where we  were headed on trade.  </p><p> And so I think for a lot of people that's been in the middle of the country  and even blue-collar cities on the east coast will tell you this is a  pretty big deal.  </p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  I know.  The proof is going to be in the pudding, right?   It's all about the details.  So he has maybe a minor P.R. win right now,  but we'll see what happens.  And if this trade deal really is something  that benefits the American worker, or like the tax deal, is it going to  benefit the wealthiest?  </p><p> And I'm sorry, after North Korea, I, you know, really don't believe the  hype when it comes out of this White House and its people.  </p><p> TODD:  All right, let me bring up one other political thing that the  President did today.  He sort of bragged about the fact that he's not going  to give a pay raise to federal workers.  Politically, Brad, I get that not  a single -- the base said, great, yes, screw the government.  </p><p> B. TODD:  I think he's writing off Virginia.  </p><p> TODD:  Yes.  Well, but this --</p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  Not just Virginia, you know.  </p><p> TODD:  Yes, not just Virginia.  I mean, it is sort of you have -- we don't  have it in the budget, he said.  You could do the $1.6 trillion tax cut and  you can't do this?  Again, how good of politics is it to bash government?  </p><p> B. TODD:  This was --</p><p> TODD:  I mean, I hate to be this cynical.  </p><p> B. TODD:  Well, first of --</p><p> TODD:  Is this a cynical decision -- </p><p> B. TODD:  First off, the Congress will decide it, not him, in the end.  And  I think that the public doesn't trust government right now, either party.   There are plenty of people in the Republican coalition who trust Donald  Trump more than they trust Republicans in Congress.  </p><p> TODD:  Right.  </p><p> B. TODD:  And this is an example of him being a disrupter and trying to say  that he -- whether he actually does it or not, he is proving -- </p><p> TODD:  Do you think that is another one of those things, don't believe it?  </p><p> B. TODD:  He is proving he is willing to say things people won't say and  that he's not taking cues from other people in Washington.  </p><p> TODD:  He doesn't necessarily do what he says on that one.  </p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  Right.  </p><p> KAPUR:  And how does this affect someone like Barbara Comstock who's  running for Congress in a tough re-election in D.C.?  </p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  Exactly.  </p><p> TODD:  I think he just --</p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  Right.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> TODD:  Actually, he did better --</p><p> B. TODD:  -- Virginia in 2020.  </p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  I mean, her opponent already put out -- </p><p> B. TODD:  That tells me Virginia in 2020 for his own race is what I'm sure  he's thinking about rather than that.  </p><p> TODD:  Well, there -- I think he realizes Virginia -- it may be a swing  state again, not in the Trump era.  I think that's fair to say.  </p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  Right.  I mean, Barbara Comstock's opponent already put out a  press release about it.  And it's not just Virginia.  There are lots of  states where there are lots of civilian employees that are going to be  really hurt by this.  </p><p> KAPUR:  Yes, this is a matter of priorities.  I mean, the President decided  that he -- that the United States didn't have the money and could borrow  the money for a big increase in military spending and did have, you know,  funds in the Treasury to offer tax breaks.  But on this one, he --</p><p> TODD:  Let's be crass.  </p><p> B. TODD:  He called an increase on the military --</p><p> TODD:  Let's be crass, let's be crass.  There is not a single vote that he  would get if he somehow said, I'm giving a raise to all federal government  workers.  </p><p> B. TODD:  Not a single vote he would gain. </p><p> TODD:  Yes.  </p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  Right.  </p><p> B. TODD:  But the military vote does help him.  </p><p> TODD:  Well, and that's --</p><p> B. TODD:  Because a part of the federal workforce that identifies with  Republicans is military.  </p><p> TODD:  Right.  Which is why the rest of the federal workforce is probably  getting a raise because they'll not separate the two, is my guess, which is  probably right.  Congress won't distinguish.   </p><p> KAPUR:  And it's about priorities.  The money is there, clearly.  He just  wants to spend it on certain things and not other things.  </p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  Exactly.  </p><p> TODD:  All right, guys.  We'll take a break here.  You guys get to stick  around. </p><p> Up ahead, inside President Trump's war on Google.  </p><p> Plus, a new outage -- outrage at the border.  Why are more and more  Hispanic American citizens being denied their passports?  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> TODD:  Welcome back.  Another entry in a long pattern for President Trump.   When his opponents attacked him in 2016, he gave them labels.  So he  labeled them Lying Ted, Crooked Hillary.  When the news media publishes  stories he doesn't like, he cries fake news, enemy of the people.  </p><p> And now, this week, the President has decided to go after Google for, in  his words, suppressing conservative voices in its search results.  </p><p> The President tweeted, quote, Google search results for Trump news shows  only the viewing/reporting of fake news media.  In other words, they have  it rigged for me and others so that almost all bad -- stories and news is  bad.  They are controlling what we can and cannot see.  This is a very  serious situation.  Will be addressed.  </p><p> The President also tweeted a video in which he accused the search engine of  highlighting President Obama's state of the union addresses but not his  own.  </p><p>Google responded by saying, wrong, that they did, in fact, highlight  President Trump's state of the union address this year.  Not so last year  for a very good reason.  The speech President Trump gave to Congress in  2017 was not a state of the union address.  </p><p> None of them are when you give them in the first year in office.  </p><p> Joining me now is Kara Swisher.  She is the executive editor of the  technology news Web site, Recode.  </p><p> Kara, nice to see you.  </p><p> KARA SWISHER, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, RECODE:  How are you doing, Chuck?  </p><p> TODD:  All right.  Let's start with the President's accusation.  </p><p> SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p> TODD:  And then I want to go to something that I think he is touching on  that actually is relevant to this conversation.  </p><p> SWISHER:  OK.  Yes.  </p><p> TODD:  So, obviously, he's going after Google.  And it's all part -- this  is -- you know, Steve Bannon ranted about this a long time ago, big tech.  </p><p> SWISHER:  Yes, and he did also last week.  </p><p> TODD:  Right.  </p><p> SWISHER:  He did a bunch last week and he's done it to Amazon -- Amazon,  \"Washington Post.\"  </p><p> TODD:  That's right.  He is --</p><p> SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p> TODD:  Part of it is maybe he doesn't understand the tech world.  </p><p> SWISHER:  No.  </p><p> TODD:  I think that's a big part of it, but the other part of it just feels  ironic.  It's like, is he saying that you guys must stink because I was  able to manipulate your system and look what I did?  I mean, I don't mean  to be that cynical.  </p><p> SWISHER:  Yes, yes.  </p><p> TODD:  But is there any basis to his attack?  </p><p> SWISHER:  No, none whatsoever.  And I'm not one to defend the tech  industry, you know that.  I'm sort of -- I'm very particular about certain  things they've done, and I'm very interested in these hearings next week  where a lot of the leaders are going to come with some of the problems they  had with Cambridge Analytica and things like that.  </p><p> But, in this case, he's completely wrong.  He doesn't know what he's  talking about.  </p><p> TODD:  I want to go to that state of the union attack because this is the  problem that's happening on social media.  The irony is -- and it's  basically Twitter has allowed this to happen, whether they like it or not.  </p><p> SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p> TODD:  Their platform has been used for this, which is -- and it's been  regularly done.  Matt Gaetz is a congressman that has done this.  Kevin  McCarthy is a congressman that has done this.  Where they retweet stuff  that they say, this is how they're biased against conservatives but it  turned out to be fake accusations.  Like, the fake accusations about state  of the union, all these false accusations.  </p><p> SWISHER:  Yes, but it's beyond --</p><p> TODD:  But it gets, like, 32,000 retweets.  </p><p> SWISHER:  Of course.  </p><p> TODD:  Or 50,000 likes.  So people still believe it.  </p><p> SWISHER:  Well, you know, I wrote a column in \"The New York Times\" saying  this is codswallop.  But I just was -- I try to find a word that you could  look up on Google very easily.  </p><p> But the fact of the matter is, conservative voices are very loud on social  media.  So are liberal voices, so are crazy voices, so are comedians, and  so is everyone.  And this particular group of people has actually been  advantaged by it because they were largely left out of the mainstream media  until Fox News came along.  </p><p> TODD:  Right.  </p><p> SWISHER:  Now, they have all these platforms to discuss things on.  And  there's been this sort of online rage-fest among them that they are not  heard.  And the line I used is, the people that talk loudest about not  being heard never shut up.  And I think we can all agree that Donald Trump  uses Twitter quite a bit.  </p><p> TODD:  One of the mistakes we in the mainstream media made during -- when  these false accusations against us being biased for 40 years happen is we  started believing, well, maybe we are biased and we got to -- oh, wait, we  can't look biased.  So then we created a lot of false equivalency issues,  OK.  </p><p> SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p> TODD:  It looks to me like Silicon Valley is about to fall into that trap.   How do they not fall into that trap?  </p><p> SWISHER:  By ignoring it completely.  Look at what Jeff Bezos is doing  every time he comes after him.  He just doesn't say a word.  I think Google  has to just say this is not true and move along and stuff like that.  </p><p> And, obviously, there, again, are issues that all these companies should  face, you know, of things they have done but not this one.  </p><p> TODD:  All right.  But I want to get into an issue that I actually thought  Steve Bannon addressed very -- you know, in a -- he ranted at the end, but  he, actually, I thought, touched on something that I've gotten into, which  is, who's going to regulate the algorithms?  </p><p> SWISHER:  Right.  </p><p> TODD:  At the end of the day, they're not wrong that, these algorithms,  none of us know what they have.  </p><p> SWISHER:  Right.  </p><p> TODD:  They have all of our information.  Steve Bannon made a  recommendation that I didn't think was a bad one, which was should our info  at least be in a public trust of some sort that they can access all the  time?  </p><p> And we get that, but -- I buy what he's talking about there.  At some  point, we have to figure out how to regulate the algorithms so, at least,  we know if they're being abused.  </p><p> SWISHER:  Well, no, I know.  That's the problem, is you can't do that.   That's such -- then make Google an entity of the government?  </p><p> TODD:  No, you wouldn't make it an entity of the government.  </p><p> SWISHER:  It's called Russia.  </p><p> TODD:  No, no, no.  But it's --</p><p> SWISHER:  It's called the Russian government.  </p><p> TODD:  Well, then how do we regulate an algorithm?  </p><p> SWISHER:  We don't.  We don't.  </p><p> TODD:  Why?  </p><p> SWISHER:  Because they're big companies, and they are -- they're the ones  in charge, just the way CBS used to be in charge of the airwaves.  </p><p> TODD:  OK.  But if Google writes an algorithm that somehow directs -- all  right, let me do a better one.  Let's say one of the -- </p><p> SWISHER:  Facebook or any --</p><p> TODD:  No, monster.com, like an employment site.  And their algorithm seems  to always leave out people of color as your job applicants.  </p><p> SWISHER:  Right, that's a different issue.  </p><p> TODD:  But that's my point.  How do you --</p><p> SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p> TODD:  You know, they could say, oh, we just wrote an algorithm, we didn't  know it was going to do that.  </p><p> SWISHER:  Right.  Well, I think the problem is who is making these things.   That's one of the big issues being discussed with Silicon Valley, like A.I.   You know, there's an -- you know, the old expression, crap in, crap out.  </p><p> And so, you know, if certain people are the only ones designing that, what  happens?  But that's in the Internet.  The Internet has largely been  designed by the small group of people.  That still doesn't mean you should  have a government entity regulating any of that sort of thing.  </p><p> TODD:  All right, but let me go to a consumer thing, OK?  </p><p> SWISHER:  OK.  </p><p> TODD:  So I want to know that I am getting -- I am being treated as a  consumer equally in the state of Texas as I am in the state of North  Dakota.  </p><p> SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p> TODD:  And if an Amazon algorithm decides, boy, in Texas, you have more  money.  You can afford to pay this because I know this by where you live  and all this stuff than the north.  Boy, I'm getting -- that's not fair as  a consumer.  </p><p> SWISHER:  That's called marketing and retail for the past hundred years, so  I don't know that can --</p><p> TODD:  No.  Well, I'm wondering -- I get it.  </p><p> SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p> TODD:  But on the other hand, if there -- if it's unfair practices, how is  it that we're going to --</p><p> SWISHER:  Is it?  </p><p> TODD:  Well, why shouldn't it?  </p><p> SWISHER:  Why shouldn't it be?  Well, here's the thing, privacy issues,  yes.  I think there's probably going to be a privacy bill, especially if  the Democrats come into power.  I'm absolutely certain there will be some  sort of -- there's been one in California that's been somewhat  controversial, but there will be a national privacy bill at some point  given all these issues we're having.  </p><p> TODD:  Is it going to look like Europe?  </p><p> SWISHER:  I don't know.  Probably not.  I don't think U.S. regulators have  ever been as strong as the ones in Europe.  But, again, there's  international issues too because the Europeans are doing something  different, the Chinese will do something different.  Everyone around the  world in a global society will do something different.  </p><p> TODD:  What's next week going to look like for Twitter and Facebook?  </p><p> SWISHER:  Ah, I don't know.  It depends who shows up.  I mean, if we get  Jack Dorsey and Sheryl Sandberg -- now, there's been calls to bring in  Larry Page who was one of the founders of Google.  It probably will be  Sundar Pichai.  </p><p> I think they're going to quiz them.  I hope they don't quiz them on all  these whether conservatives can speak up or whether anybody can speak out.   They should talk about issues of the meddling in the elections.  They  should talk about privacy.  They should talk about how did this -- how did  their platforms get hijacked by the Russian government.  </p><p> These are critical issues, not whether Donald Trump is loud enough on the  Internet, which I think he is.  I feel he has plenty of voice.  </p><p> TODD:  I was just going to say the Internet has been good to Donald Trump.  </p><p> SWISHER:  That's what I said, they -- Donald Trump should send tech a gold  embossed thank you note for the things that it has done, giving him tools  and all kinds of ways to get in office.  </p><p> TODD:  Right.  So I guess, does the industry --</p><p> SWISHER:  You want me to say you want to regulate -- </p><p> TODD:  No, no, no, no.  But does the industry -- is it ready to come and  say, hey, look, we know we've gotten this big and we need help figuring X  out?  </p><p> SWISHER:  Right.  </p><p> TODD:  Are they ready to at least do that with the government?  </p><p> SWISHER:  I think they have to engage more with the government.  But as you  saw from the Zuckerberg hearings, the politicians really are almost  clueless about technology.  </p><p> TODD:  It's embarrassing.  </p><p> SWISHER:  And it was embarrassing.  And everyone used to say, oh, Mark did  really well.  I say, well, it's a very really low bar.  So, no, he didn't,  but they did badly.</p><p> TODD:  I would love Mr. Zuckerberg to come here.  </p><p> SWISHER:  Well, I will ask him.  </p><p> TODD:  And I would -- no, they haven't.  Like, none of them will stay,  though.  </p><p> SWISHER:  None of them will?  </p><p> TODD:  Yes, I would love to be quizzed by some of those members of  Congress, too.  </p><p> SWISHER:  Yes, yes.  I would like members of Congress who actually know  something about technology to do the quizzing, but that's, you know.  </p><p> TODD:  I think it's time to let them staffers do the quizzing and all.  </p><p> SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p> TODD:  Do you expect any sort of -- I think Donald Trump, Jr. said, oh,  we're going to have a conservative alternative.  Is that plausible out  there and realistic?  </p><p> SWISHER:  Sure, go ahead.  They can do it.  It's the big wide Internet.  </p><p> TODD:  Right, but is there anybody out there that actually could do it?  </p><p> SWISHER:  You know, there were rumors of Peter Thiel and Steve Bannon  getting together.  I keep hearing them getting together and creating their  own.  I'm sure there will be a digital element to it if they do it.   There's all kinds of rumors around that.  </p><p> Obviously, Fox News has digital elements.  Are you kidding?  There are so  many conservative publications on the Internet now, Breitbart, all the  others.  They've had -- the Internet has been very, very good to them.  </p><p> TODD:  Yes.  </p><p> SWISHER:  So I don't know if they should complain quite so much.  </p><p> TODD:  I think their biggest complaint is called capitalism.  </p><p> SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p> TODD:  Kara Swisher, thanks for coming on.  </p><p> SWISHER:  Thank you.  </p><p> TODD:  Much appreciated.  Up ahead, the uproar over a new crackdown on  Hispanic Americans that are American citizens.  They're being denied  passports or having their passports taken away.  </p><p> But, first, it's the emotional tribute to Senator John McCain.  Some 3,500  people gathered in a Phoenix church to honor McCain's life of service.  </p><p> Twenty-four sitting U.S. senators attended that service.  So did four  former senators, including former Vice President Joe Biden who remembered  Senator McCain as a leader who always put country before party.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  John was a hero.   His character, courage, honor, integrity.  But I think the thing that's  understated the most is his optimism.  That's what made John special.  It  made John a giant among all of us.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> TODD:  Welcome back. Tonight I'm obsessed with President Trump's morning  tweetstorm. More unusual than normal, even for him. Those tweets were a  plague of defensive outbursts, baseless assertions and outright falsehoods,  the kind of statements that have fact checkers working overtime or simply  throwing up their hands.</p><p> But it got us wondering, what if in some Seinfeld-like Bizarro universe,  President Trump tweeted the exact opposite of what he tweeted this morning?  What would that look like? Hmm, would it be more believable if President  Trump had tweeted something like this? When Lester Holt accurately played  my tape on Russia, I was hurt badly.</p><p> Or how about this? Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner had everything to do with  the pushing out of Don McGahn. The news media has it right. Has it so  right. Or how about this one? The legitimate Russia investigation had  everything to do with respect to my decision on Don McGahn.</p><p> And then another one on Don McGahn. I'm very excited about the person who  will be taking the place of Don McGahn as White House counsel. I never  liked Don, and he was responsible for me not firing Bob Mueller or Jeff  Sessions. And finally, I just cannot state strongly enough how totally  dishonest I am. Truth doesn't matter to me. I only have my hatred and  agenda.</p><p> As Jerry Seinfeld and George Costanza, if every instinct you have is wrong,  then the opposite would have to be right. Right?</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> TODD:  Welcome back. The Trump administration's crackdown along the Mexican  border isn't just limited to people trying to come here illegally. Now a  growing number of Hispanic-Americans are being denied passports because the  government is questioning their citizenship.</p><p> The Washington Post reports that the Trump administration is accusing  hundreds and possibly thousands of people of using fraudulent birth  certificates since they were babies. The government alleges that some  midwives and physicians along the border gave U.S. birth certificates to  people who were actually born in Mexico decades ago.</p><p> In a statement to The Washington Post, the State Department said it \"has  not changed policy or practice regarding the adjudication of passport  applications and the U.S.-Mexico border region happens to be an area of the  country where there has been a significant incidence of citizenship fraud.\"</p><p> It's true that this happened under George W. Bush and the Obama  administrations too, but that mostly ended after a government settlement in  2009. This news as taking away people's citizenship is on the rise under  President Trump.</p><p> And to try to understand this piece and this issue a little better, I'm  joined now by NBC News national security and justice reporter Julia Ainsley  and Attorney Jaime Diaz who represents some of the U.S. citizens who have  been either denied passports or had them taken away. Welcome to both of  you.</p><p> Julia, let me start with you. When did this begin? How pervasive do we  think it is? And is this connected to the sort of prediction, if you will,  that this was the next thing Stephen Miller, who's sort of the chief  advisor on all immigration issues in the West Wing, this is the next step  he wanted to take?</p><p> JULIA AINSLEY, NATIONAL SECURITY AND JUSTICE REPORTER, NBC NEWS:  Chuck,  context here is critical. You're exactly right. We know that Stephen Miller  -- the next step he wants to do is go after legal immigration.</p><p> What we're seeing here is part of this new fraud crackdown from DHS and  throughout the Trump administration like the State Department. They're  trying to go after people who maybe lied on their applications and became  citizens or became permanent residents and got green cards who shouldn't  have.</p><p> So they want to go back and re-adjudicate and take that away. But of course  what happens and what The Washington Post laid out in this story is a lot  of people who were rightfully in the United States end up getting their  rights taken away too.</p><p> And as they found under the Obama administration, it's very difficult to  decide which ones of those birth certificates signed by those midwives in  the '90s were legitimate and which ones weren't. And so they really just  decided it was a fruitless cause and that they should just allow them --  take them as legitimate.</p><p> But this is part of a broader crackdown. And from people I've spoken to who  represent a lot of immigrants who are trying to move up the ladder, get  passports, get citizenships, get green cards, they say before you take that  next step, you need to go through your record and make sure everything is  crystal clear or it could just not even be worth it.</p><p> It's too much of a risk because of the scrutiny they're doing going back  and looking at everything and every application you've put in earlier, even  if they were legitimate, Chuck.</p><p> TODD:  All right. Let me go to Jaime Diaz. Jaime, I wanted Julia to begin  there to help me continue to sort of lay out the context of all of this.  Now walk me through what you're dealing with. How many clients do you have  that have been impacted?</p><p> How many of them are natural born citizens versus those who went through  the green card process and became naturalized citizens here, born here  versus naturalized, all of those things. I'm curious. What kind of folks  are being targeted here? </p><p>JAIME DIAZ, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY:  Here we're talking only about people  that were born in the United States.</p><p> TODD:  OK. How many clients do you have on this front?</p><p>DIAZ:  I have represented over 500 people. I presently have probably 30  people that are in lawsuits in federal court. I have represented over 100  of them in lawsuits in federal court where they have been taken away their  documents. They have been put in rooms to admit that they were not born in  the United States.</p><p> Their mothers have been asked to come to the consulate to admit that they  were not born there and the documents were taken. What we see now is that  they are detaining them. When they come back -- without allowing them to  come back and keep them in Mexico.</p><p> There are many clients of mine that I have that were born in the United  States, that the government has stopped them and have kept them in Mexico.  And the crackdown is starting to be very hard. They are doing it every day. I see someone in my office.</p><p> I practice in Brownsville, Texas which is at the border with Mexico. People  that were born by midwives down there, there is a lot of them, but I can  tell you something, that most of them were born in the United States.</p><p> We even have a soldier that was born with a midwife and he applied to  become a soldier. They took him in. He applied for a passport and they say,  show that you're a United States citizen. This is ridiculous.</p><p> TODD:  Well, there was one example in The Washington Post, Mr. Diaz, and  I'm just curious if you had to deal with something like this where it was a  former soldier and he only wanted to give his first name because he was  afraid he'd be targeted.</p><p> He said that the State Department told him that they weren't convinced he  was a U.S. citizen, that they needed a bunch of the following documents.  Either his mother's -- evidence of his mother's prenatal care, his  baptismal certificate, maybe rental agreements when he was a baby.</p><p> This is a grown man. I'm sorry, I don't think my mother has the power bill  from when I was born in 1972. Is this the burden of proof that's being put  on your clients?</p><p>DIAZ:  Yes. That is what's going on. They are asking for things that no one  has. No one in the whole United States has prenatal record from her mother.  A person that is 40 years old, there's no way they have them. So they're  asking for things that they know they don't have. People get frustrated.</p><p> But if you live on the border, there is a need for you to cross to the  other side. You have family, you have things to do on the other side. And  when they're coming back, that's when they're detaining them. They're  making them sign documents so that they can get away from it.</p><p> What has happened is outrageous. An opportunity like this to tell the  American people what is going on is incredible. We're not talking about  people that are naturalized, we are talking about people that were born in  the United States. They just happen to have a Hispanic last name and they  were born with midwives, but that's still Americans.</p><p> TODD:  Mr. Diaz, did you have any client who didn't have a Hispanic last  name who had their passport taken away?</p><p>DIAZ:  Not that I can remember right now on the top of my head. Most of  them have been taken away, no. I have people that I represented that are  having difficulty getting a passport because they were born in Southern  Texas with a midwife. But someone that has a passport taken away or revoked  when they were coming back or through a letter in the mail, no, I have  never had it.</p><p> TODD:  So it does feel as if it is Hispanic surnames that get targeted  here. Julia, walk me through the due process in this. What are the court  procedures here? You're accused of this, you're trying to fight back. Where  does it go in the system?</p><p> AINSLEY:  It's really hard to fight back, Chuck. I mean, you would have to  get a lawyer. I know a lot of people who stay outside of places where  immigrants are trying to appeal and they know that they will eventually  come across the street and find lawyers because it's nearly impossible to  navigate this system on your own.</p><p> As Jaime just pointed out, they're asking for these documents a lot of  people don't have. And as an American citizen, yes, you have the right to  have citizenship, but that passport, the documents that you have to have a  passport, it's not a right to have a passport if you don't have the  documents to back it up.</p><p> TODD:  Right.</p><p> AINSLEY:  And when they're raising this bar, there actually very few routes  to go. The way this was handled in the past, Chuck, was through a class  action settlement and that's frequently the way we see immigrants or even  U.S.-born immigrants, the children of immigrants seek their rights, that  they're able to go through the ACLU. They have to come in a class action  suit with lots of people and then they are able to get justice.</p><p> That's what happened in 2009 when the ACLU said, look, you can't tell which  one of these midwife birth certificates are illegitimate and which ones  aren't, and we think that it's a very small amount of children that were  actually born in Mexico. And so, therefore, you can't discriminate based on  them having this one type of birth certificate. So the answer is it is  really hard to get justice without a class action lawsuit in this case.</p><p> TODD:  Mr. Diaz, is there anything in the -- why is the burden of proof not  on the government to prove you're not a U.S. citizen?</p><p>DIAZ:  The burden (INAUDIBLE) evidence and this is a civil case. The  government does not have any way to prove that you are -- to prove beyond a  reasonable doubt that you fraudulently obtained that document. First of  all, these are documents that were registered when you were a baby. And the  only way to prove it is if you knew that that document was fraudulent when  you grew up.</p><p> So, you know, what they do is they try to take you away from going to  court. That's why they detain you at ports of entry and they keep you and  say stay in Mexico. How do you come back if you will stay in Mexico and you  were thrown into --</p><p> TODD:  You're not a Mexican citizen. You're not a Mexican citizen. What are  you going to do? </p><p> DIAZ:  It is really -- the stories -- unfortunately I don't have the time  to tell you all the stories that I have seen of people. But I can tell you  one thing. We have won all those cases. What is sad is after you win all  those cases, you would think the government would say, you know, I have to  change. No, they go harder. Eventually there will be no attorney that will  represent these people, but I'm here to represent them.</p><p> TODD:  Let me ask you this. Is there -- how many of your clients that you felt like they were detained longer than they should be thrown in  jail and what were they thrown in jail for if they were? </p><p> DIAZ:  They were thrown to jail -- they get thrown immigration detention  centers. I had a guy that was detained for three days at a detention center  --</p><p> TODD:  American citizen? An American citizen?</p><p> DIAZ:  An American citizen. Yes, sir.</p><p> TODD:  Detained -- put into a detention center and just because, what, he  didn't have a passport or they didn't believe his passport?</p><p> DIAZ:  No, he had a passport. They just said, we have a note that we need  to revoke your passport so they put him in a room. The agent asked him, do  you want me to treat you like a Mexican or as a U.S. citizen? What I would  have told him, treat him like a human being, give him his rights. He has a  right to hear whatever evidence you think you have. But the way they're  treating people is not right.</p><p> TODD:  All right. Julia Ainsley, Jaime Diaz, I've got to leave it there. I  thank you both for sharing your expertise and your experiences there, thank  you.</p><p> Up ahead, the empire state strikes back. We'll show you some of last  night's New York gubernatorial debate between Andrew Cuomo and Cynthia  Nixon. Let's just say a little feisty.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> TODD:  Welcome back. In tonight's \"Meet the Midterms,\" the feuding factions  of the Democratic Party literally on full display.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D), NEW YORK:  The subway system is owned by New York  City.</p><p> CYNTHIA NIXON, DEMOCRATIC GUBERNATORIAL NOMINEE: The MTA has been  controlled by the state since 1965.</p><p> CUOMO:  Excuse me, can you stop interrupting? Can you stop interrupting?</p><p> NIXON:  Can you stop lying?</p><p> NIXON:  Yeah, as soon as you do.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TODD:  I guess they call that a cell phone. That was New York Governor  Andrew Cuomo seeking his third term and challenger Cynthia Nixon, an  actress and self-described Democratic socialist going out last night in  their one and only debate before New York's primary September 13th. That  handshake at the end may have been the most civil moment.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> NIXON:  I'm not an Albany insider, like Governor Cuomo, but I think that  experience doesn't mean that much if you're not actually good at governing.</p><p> CUOMO:  My opponent lives in the world of fiction, I live in the world of  fact.</p><p> NIXON:  We already have a corrupt corporate Republican in the White House.  We don't need a corrupt corporate Democrat in Albany as his main  opposition.</p><p> CUOMO:  She released five years of corporate taxes, dumped them in three  hours on a Friday with no notice. Only Donald Trump has done less  transparency on his taxes than my opponent.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TODD:  Nixon is still a long shot to win the nomination. She trailed Cuomo  by 31 points in a Siena College poll from last month.</p><p> But let's see, in a year in which Democrats tapped underdog Andrew Gillum,  who wasn't polling very high in many polls to run for governor in Florida  and in a year in which Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who Nixon endorsed won over  Congressman Joe Crowley in the Bronx there, are you really going to  discount her chances? More \"MTP Daily\" after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> TODD:  Time now for \"The Lid.\" The panel is back: Sahil, Daniella, and  Brad. All right, the president, we got more from your Bloomberg interview.  You're just dribbling it out. You know, we in the -- we just put it all out  there. But anyway, you dribbled it out. We got a little bit which is,  here's what he said about the Mueller probe. We will put it up on the  screen here.</p><p> I view it as an illegal investigation because great scholars -- that's his  quote -- have said that there never should have been a special counsel.  This is an answer when asked if he would comply with the subpoena for  Mueller, he said I'll see what happens there.</p><p> He talks about Mueller being an illegal probe all the time. Let me ask  this, Brad. Do any of the supporters wonder why he just doesn't end it? He  has the power. He is the president.</p><p> BRAD TODD, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST AND FOUNDING PARTNER OF ONMESSAGE INC.:  I  don't think many of the supporters think very much about the Mueller probe.  I think the president thinks about it a lot more than his supporters do.</p><p> C.TOOD:  I think the president thinks about it more than anybody around  this table sometimes.</p><p> B.TODD:  I think the president's voters are -- we'll wait until the Mueller  probe is over with and we'll see what he has and we'll evaluate it. I don't  think it's something that they're obsessed about. Washington is obsessed  about it. They lead (ph) the paper everyday.</p><p> C.TODD:  Sure.</p><p> B.TODD:  It doesn't lead the paper in Kenosho (ph).</p><p> C.TODD:  No, that I buy. He has the power to end these things if he really  wanted to. He obviously knows it would be a problem.</p><p> SAHIL KAPUR, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, BLOOMBERG NEWS:  It's not the  prevailing view of members of his own party in Congress, that it's an  illegal investigation. The Senate majority leader and the speaker of the  House say they support the investigation. That is not only legal but it is  proper that it should come to an end.</p><p> So I think this is the president feeling like there is a lot happening  around him. The walls may be closing in on him. I think he is lashing out.  He may be binging cable news, according to some people around him that I  spoke to.</p><p> DANIELLA GIBBS LEGER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, COMMUNICATIONS AND STRATEGY AT  AMERICAN PROGRESS:  Yes.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> C. TODD:  He needed something to do. I think they're glad they scheduled  this rally this afternoon.</p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  Yeah, very well timed.</p><p> B.TODD:  The special counsel has a responsibility too. He presumably  supports the idea that special counsel should exist and he has to know when  he's gone past the time limit of when he has credibility.</p><p> C.TODD:  What time limit are we at? This is not even at the halfway point.</p><p> B.TODD:  He's had more than a year.</p><p> C.TODD:  Not even a halfway point.</p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  So what? You just arbitrarily stop because --</p><p> B.TODD:  He has to decide when the public thinks he's gone too far on time  and show his cards.</p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  He has to go until the investigation is over. If he keeps  uncovering more crimes --</p><p> B. TODD:  All appointments are political, though, you have a certain amount  of political rope. He has to judge where the American public is and whether  it's willing to let him go on.</p><p> C. TODD:  Here is what I've learned about Bob Mueller. Not a single person  that has known him been with him, worked with him, would say if he didn't  have any -- he would have ended this investigation if there is no  collusion, that he already would have ended it.</p><p> B. TODD:  We can't tell that though until he tells us something. </p><p> C.TODD:  That's true. Right, we are just left here in what is the last  chapter --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KAPUR:  This is not the issue that resonates in most of the country. I do  think public opinion is calcified on this issue for now. New developments  in this case are not necessarily going to move the needle unless they  directly relate to the president. I don't know that the fall of people  around him is going to affect the midterm elections. But this is baked in.  It's one of the reasons that the president --</p><p> D.TODD:  But here is the question --</p><p> KAPUR:  -- not like it doesn't affect him at all.</p><p> B.TODD:  We're at Labor Day. And I think if Mueller comes back with  anything between Labor Day and the election, half the country is going to  reject it.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> C.TODD:  I think he knows, more than anything, he keeps quiet between Labor  Day and election day, don't you think?</p><p> B.TODD:  Then he's going to be pushing up against two years before you know  it. I mean, it's too long.</p><p> C.TODD:  No, no, no --</p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  That's why I feel like --</p><p> C. TODD:  This is a trap that Giuliani is trying to set, I think, PR-wise,  which is you're taking forever. Wait, why are you speaking during the  election --</p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  Exactly. That's why I feel like maybe January 2019 is going  to be the time when Mueller announces everything. Because it's enough time  before the 2020 election, but you wait until after this election so you  don't have people saying -- </p><p> C. TODD:  I'm not missing work tomorrow. I wouldn't miss work tomorrow.</p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  That's right.</p><p> C. TODD:  Tomorrow is the last business day of the pre-Labor Day to  election day window, Sahil.</p><p> KAPUR:  And this is where there's so much at stake in the 2018 elections  because whoever controls the House is going to decide what the fate -- what  comes of this report that Mueller files.</p><p> Now, to the issue of subpoenas and, you know, potentially what the White  House would do if he's forced to -- or if he's subpoenaed, they will very  likely challenge this in court and the president probably won't end up  speaking executive privilege.</p><p> The White House can find a way around this, I think, to make sure that they  don't face any court conviction because it's not -- I'm sorry, indictment  because it's not happened to a sitting president so far. Congress is going  to decide.</p><p> C. TODD:  Not to be totally cliche, 5:00 tomorrow is a big deadline, isn't  it?</p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  Yeah.</p><p> C. TODD:  Unofficially for a lot of people. I mean, we assume Mueller  wouldn't do it until -- tomorrow at 5:00 p.m. is the last possible time.</p><p> B.TODD:  Chuck, every Friday night is entertaining in this presidency.</p><p> C.TODD:  Let's try putting on a Sunday show.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> C. TODD:  We don't find it entertaining, we find it mind boggling.</p><p> B.TODD:  You always wanted things to get a little more exciting. You wanted  a little more of a president who is unscripted.</p><p> GIBBS LEGER:  It would be perfect, the Friday before Labor Day to have like  this big thing.</p><p> C.TODD:  Today we had an arrest of somebody who threatened The Boston Globe  using \"you're the enemy of the people.\" Sahil, you're the other working  journalist here. The U.S. attorney went after and arrested this person.  This person, \"you're the enemy of the people, and we're going to kill  every\" -- whatever the caller said to Globe.</p><p> You know, there's always this decision, do we alert authorities or not? At  this point the guy called so many times and, you know, maybe holding  somebody criminally responsible does sort of make people responsible for  their rhetoric.</p><p> KAPUR:  Yeah. There were 14 phone calls here of this man using all kinds of  nasty language that I can't repeat here. Yes, he used the phrase \"the enemy  of the people,\" where have we heard that before.</p><p> I want to be very clear, the president is not condoning violence against  anybody, but it's not difficult to see how someone can listen to that, see  that rhetoric and want to do something crazy if they are not mentally  stable. </p><p> C. TODD:  This has always been our point. We know the president is not --  he needs to actually say that he doesn't mean it. All right. Sahil,  Daniella, Brad, thank you all. We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> TODD:  That's all we have for tonight. We'll be back tomorrow with more  \"MTP Daily.\" Remember, 5:00 p.m. tomorrow is a big deadline, perhaps in the  Mueller probe. \"The Beat\" starts right now. Ayman Mohyeldin is in for Ari.  Ayman, good evening, sir.</p><p> AYMAN MOHYELDIN, JOURNALIST, MSNBC:  Good evening, Chuck. </p><p> THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY  BE UPDATED.

Hello.    </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHUCK TODD, MSNBC HOST:  Katy Tur.</p><p>TUR:  Charles.  </p><p>TODD:  How are you?  I see -- look, that's what Pete does to me.  By the  way, next time, if Pete Williams ever does a Katharine on you, just call  him Lewis.  </p><p>TUR:  You know, I had someone online yesterday say, I was surprised to find  out that Katharine was your full name.  And I said, really?  </p><p>TODD:  Well --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD:  Yes.  Is it that hard to figure out?  </p><p>TUR:  Well, apparently.  </p><p>TODD:  It's like, oh, you're a Charles?  Yes, most Chucks are.  </p><p>TUR:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  Yes.  </p><p>TUR:  Katy, Katharine.  What are you going to do?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD:  All right.  Thank you, Katy.  </p><p>TUR:  You bet.  </p><p>TODD:  If it's Thursday, it's the eye of the tweetstorm.  </p><p>Good evening.  I'm Chuck Todd here in Washington and welcome to MTP DAILY.   If it's Thursday, the President is making assertions that, to some, come  across as paranoid, conspiratorial, full of projection, and at times, a bit  Orwellian.  </p><p>And if that isn't concerning enough, we're learning that some of the most  important people whose jobs are to act as a guardrail against the  President's behavior or instincts are leaving, giving up, rationalizing it,  or simply being ousted.  </p><p>Folks, that is a recipe for bad things getting worse.  So let's dive in.   The President today all but said reject the evidence of your eyes and ears.   He suggested, without evidence, because there is none, that part of the  tape of him on camera in that interview with my colleague, Lester Holt, was  fudged, as he puts it.  </p><p>OK.  Not true.  You might remember that was the interview where the  President said, yes, he fired James Comey in part because of the Russia  investigation.  That was just one baseless allegation in a series of  baseless allegations about the press, books, tapes, journalistic sources,  and news executives that he claims are all conspiring against him.  </p><p>The President, also, went after a top Justice Department official by  claiming that this official was involved in some kind of Russian collusion  and should be fired because of it.  </p><p>The President suggested that he ousted his White House Counsel, Don McGahn,  just 24 hours after saying McGahn was leaving on his own accord.  </p><p>Folks, McGahn was a key check on some of the President's impulsiveness.   McGahn also testified to Bob Mueller extensively about his boss's impulses,  which reportedly included at least two attempts to fire Mueller.  </p><p>So yesterday, we learned that McGahn is leaving.  Today, we learned that  the White House ethics lawyer is out effective tomorrow.  And it looks as  if the Attorney General is likely going to be ousted after the midterms  according to several top Senate Republicans.  </p><p>And amid it all, we're hearing some Senate Republicans either shrug their  shoulders or tell themselves that Hillary Clinton would be more corrupt or  that the President is just too inept to commit a crime like conspiring with  Russia.  </p><p>Let's bring in tonight's panel.  Sahil Kapur is a national political  reporter with Bloomberg News.  And they had a big interview with the  President a few minutes ago, so we get some scoop there.  </p><p>Daniella Gibbs Leger, a senior vice president for the Center for American  Progress.  </p><p>And Brad Todd is a Republican strategist and ad maker.  I haven't seen you  in a while.  Welcome back.  </p><p>BRAD TODD, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Thanks a lot.  </p><p>TODD:  All right, Sahil, the President -- let's get to the quick news here  -- making quick headlines.  I guess the biggest one is Jeff Sessions' job  is safe for 60 days.  </p><p>SAHIL KAPUR, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, BLOOMBERG NEWS:  That's correct,  at least 60 days.  The President would not comment when my colleagues asked  him what would happen to the Attorney General after that, but there's  widespread speculation, given the President's very public attacks on his  A.G., that his job may not last beyond that.  </p><p>Now, Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, said earlier this week  he has total confidence in Jeff Sessions and he should stay exactly where  he is.  That is a signal that McConnell doesn't want anything to mess with  the Kavanaugh hearings.  </p><p>And the second things is, who do you put in his place if you get rid of  Jeff Sessions?  It's a 50 to 49 Senate right now.  Some of those  Republicans are not going to be comfortable supporting another A.G. unless  they promise to protect the Russia investigation and the Mueller probe,  which is precisely why it seems the President wants Sessions gone.  So it's  hard to know, you know, what the end game is here.  </p><p>TODD:  Let me underscore this midterm issue, though, Daniella and Brad,  because I think the voters are going to have a say as to the future of Jeff  Sessions.  Meaning this, my theory is if somehow Democrats win the Senate,  that actually might change Republicans' calculations in the Senate.  If  somehow they won the Senate.  </p><p>Brad, is that a fair -- that, all of a sudden, you'd have a different set  of -- because, right now, you have a bunch of Republican senators that are  going, look, he's popular with the base.  </p><p>B. TODD:  Well, it wasn't widely noted last fall when Charles Grassley,  chairman of the Judiciary Committee, sent out a tweet that that said I have  no time to schedule any Attorney General confirmation hearings this year.  </p><p>Some people may have noted that, last week, he said that now he does have  some time.  And he changed --</p><p>TODD:  Yes.  And he's got a separate beef.   </p><p>B. TODD:  He does.  </p><p>TODD:  He does have a separate beef with the -- </p><p>B. TODD:  He does.  But you can't have a new Attorney General until you  have hearings to confirm a new Attorney General, and you can't do it on the  floor until you have a majority leader willing to schedule a vote on the  floor.  </p><p>So even if the did want to fire Jeff Sessions, he's going to be replaced  with Rod Rosenstein.  And so the -- and until the Senate Republicans decide  that they think it's time.  </p><p>TODD:  So is that -- that's why it feels as if, at the end of the day,  Mitch McConnell is a calculator.  And I mean that as a compliment.  He  reads the tea leaves.  And it's about being in power.  And if he's not in  power, he wants to figure out why he was not in power.  </p><p>DANIELLA GIBBS LEGER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND  STRATEGY, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  And he would probably only have one person to blame if he's not  Senate majority leader this election year.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Yes, I think that's right.  You know, look, Donald Trump  hasn't listened to Mitch McConnell in the past either because I'm pretty  sure Mitch McConnell did not want him to nominate Brett Kavanaugh for a  host of reasons.  So I don't know how that's going to play into his  calculus.  </p><p>I think, you know, we've already said what comes after Jeff Sessions.   Donald Trump is not somebody who strikes me as someone who thinks down the  line, so he very much just deals with impulses.  And his impulse is at I  want to get rid of this person who should never have recused himself from  the Russian investigation in the first place.  </p><p>So, you know, he is putting Republicans in a really tight bind.  And you're  right, I think the voters are going to really speak very loudly -- I think  you hear it happening already in these primary elections -- that they don't  like what's happening.  </p><p>TODD:  But I guess I'd flipped it this way.  If Republicans hold the  Senate, even if they lose 50 House seats, Brad, which -- that calculus is  not out of the question, right?  Republicans could gain a seat, and  Democrats could win 50 House seats.  And you can --</p><p>B. TODD:  Probably win three or four.  </p><p>TODD:  Yes, right, they may.  </p><p>KAPUR:  Yes, they may.  </p><p>B. TODD:  Yes.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Right.  </p><p>TODD:  If Trump has the cocoon of protection of a Republican Senate, right,  that's -- nothing in the House sort of changes his calculus.  </p><p>B. TODD:  Well, in a polarized country, control of the Senate is really  important because it's how you see the government.  </p><p>TODD:  Right.  </p><p>B. TODD:  You confirm judges.  You confirm cabinet secretaries.  It's how  you can -- are able to control the personnel in your own government, so the  control of the Senate is a big deal.  </p><p>And I think that getting a larger amount of control of the Senate is going  to become a bigger and bigger priority of Republicans as we get closer to  the election, and they see a lot more challengers who have shots.  It gives  you a little blanket, too, for 2020.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Yes.  I mean, I think that's really important.  But if the  Democrats take back the House, there's actually going to be oversight  happening on this President.  </p><p>TODD:  No doubt.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  There are actually going to be hearings, and they're going to  have subpoena power and all of this.  So I don't -- you know, I think, yes,  having the Senate will still be a check or a blanket for the President, but  if Democrats win back the House, he is going to have to -- like, there is  going to be reckoning that's going to happen.  </p><p>KAPUR:  The Senate is --</p><p>B. TODD:  Every receipt for every holiday in every vendor they will take,  at least.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD:  There you go.  That's right.  </p><p>KAPUR:  The Senate is enormously consequential because of the issue of  appointments.  Everyone who President wants to appoint to a cabinet  position or, you know, a federal position that is confirmable by the Senate  would have to go through Chuck Schumer's desk if the Democrats win two  seats in November.  </p><p>Now, judges, probably the most significant, most successful project of the  Trump presidency.  He got a 60th judge this week.  He's got 33 on the  district courts, 26 on the appellate courts, one Supreme Court justice  already.  He's got more eight more district judges coming next week, and a  Supreme Court judge in the pipeline.  </p><p>Imagine the difference if it's Chuck Schumer rather than Mitch McConnell  looking at these personal appointees.  It would be a massive complexion  change.  </p><p>TODD:  Daniella, this has a side note.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  Your party didn't have a project, actually, that cares about the  judiciary the way the conservative movement does.  Are you starting to  regret that?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD:  My gosh.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Probably yes.  I think --</p><p>TODD:  I mean, they had sort of a very organized effort.  </p><p>KAPUR:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  I mean, it's been something.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  I mean, if I was in charge --</p><p>TODD:  Yes.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  -- if I had all the moneys, yes, I would -- this should be --</p><p>TODD:  But this has never been a liberal priority, has it?  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  And, you know, it's something I've been talking about with my  colleagues a lot.  You know, at the Center for American Progress, we  actually do have a project called \"Why Courts Matter,\" so we understand the  importance of the judiciary.  </p><p>I don't understand why it isn't something that gets Democrats and  progressives out like it does on the right.  And money is a part of it.   You guys put millions and millions of dollars into these fights, and our  side just doesn't do that.  </p><p>KAPUR:  Progressives were furious this week, by the way, when Senate  Democrats agreed to fast-track votes on seven of Trump's judges.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Yes.  </p><p>KAPUR:  Seven all within about an hour, so seven of them confirmed.  That's  a huge deal.  </p><p>TODD:  I saw.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  By the way, what does Chuck Schumer do?  Yes, go ahead.  </p><p>B. TODD:  And in the year 2030, there will be virtually no one in the  current Senate still there, Donald Trump probably will be dead, and Neil  Gorsuch will still be on the Supreme Court.  </p><p>KAPUR:  Long after President --</p><p>TODD:  Right, Neil Gorsuch.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  But all these --</p><p>TODD:  How many of these judges?  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Yes, all 60 of them.  </p><p>TODD:  Yes.  </p><p>KAPUR:  Long after Trump's presidency fades into history, they'll be making  --</p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  It's so consequential.  </p><p>B. TODD:  Yes.  </p><p>KAPUR:  They'll be becoming decisions.  Almost all of them, I should add,  are in their 40s and 50s.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Yes.  </p><p>KAPUR:  Most of them have been vetted by the Federalist Society.  These are  very conservative people who will be making decisions for a long time.  </p><p>TODD:  I need to -- we have a whole bunch of other mini news items that the  President made in this Bloomberg interview, so let me just resuscitate some  of them.  </p><p>He says an E.U. proposal to animate auto tariffs, not good enough.  </p><p>He says getting Canada into the new NAFTA -- I guess he doesn't want to  call it NAFTA, he calls it into -- the trade deal.  It'll be by Friday or  within a period of time but it will come.  It does feel as if the Canadians  are circling that.  </p><p>He says he does not regret appointing Jerome Powell as Fed Chair, even  though he's been upset about the interest rate decisions.  </p><p>And he says he is thinking of linking capital gains taxes to inflation,  which would be a massive tax cut for a lot of people.  Would it not, Brad?   Like that's something --</p><p>B. TODD:  God created Republicans to cut taxes.  </p><p>TODD:  So that's what --</p><p>KAPUR:  By themselves or without --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KAPUR:  -- without congressional approval, though?  </p><p>TODD:  So none of those headlines are -- let me -- real quick, though, on  getting a new NAFTA.  He's had a horrendous summer.  There's not a lot of  good headlines, child separation -- you start going down with July.  You  know, Scott Pruitt happened in July.  I was, like, for many people, that  was last month.  </p><p>But getting a new trade deal, getting a new NAFTA.  That's not a -- you  know, it looks a lot like old NAFTA.  </p><p>KAPUR:  Right.  </p><p>TODD:  But at least he's going to say, I did it.  </p><p>KAPUR:  He's very eager for a victory on NAFTA.  He doesn't have much on  the deliverable end on the issue of trade other than tariffs that have hurt  -- you know, or that are making a number of members of his own party  nervous, that are hurting Republican Senate candidates in places like  Tennessee and Missouri.  And, I think, North Dakota as well.  </p><p>So I think he wants a victory.  He at least wants to rename NAFTA --</p><p>B. TODD:  Yes, yes.  </p><p>KAPUR:  -- and get the P.R. value of saying, I put my stamp on it.  Beyond  that, we don't know what the details are going to be.  There are some  negotiations still happening with the Mexicans.  </p><p>TODD:  Sure.  </p><p>KAPUR:  The Canadians seem to be moving forward on this.  But we -- there's  more questions than answers right now.  </p><p>TODD:  There's no doubt the Canadians don't want -- like, you could --</p><p>B. TODD:  To be left out.  </p><p>TODD:  Yes.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  They don't want --</p><p>TODD:  Well, and the same time, they'd love to stand up to him but they  can't afford it.  </p><p>B. TODD:  I don't --</p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Right.  </p><p>B. TODD:  I don't want to -- I think we should understand how important the  trade deal renegotiations are to the new coalition that, I think, has been  forming not just because of President Trump, but he's a product of that  reformation.  </p><p>You know, I'm from a town in east Tennessee that had two hosiery mills and  a paper mill and a steel mill as a kid.  They're all gone.  </p><p>TODD:  Right.  </p><p>B. TODD:  And for a lot of people there, they would tell you that trade  deals that we had in the past two decades were part of that equation.  And  the last two presidents didn't do anything to change the course of where we  were headed on trade.  </p><p>And so I think for a lot of people that's been in the middle of the country  and even blue-collar cities on the east coast will tell you this is a  pretty big deal.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  I know.  The proof is going to be in the pudding, right?   It's all about the details.  So he has maybe a minor P.R. win right now,  but we'll see what happens.  And if this trade deal really is something  that benefits the American worker, or like the tax deal, is it going to  benefit the wealthiest?  </p><p>And I'm sorry, after North Korea, I, you know, really don't believe the  hype when it comes out of this White House and its people.  </p><p>TODD:  All right, let me bring up one other political thing that the  President did today.  He sort of bragged about the fact that he's not going  to give a pay raise to federal workers.  Politically, Brad, I get that not  a single -- the base said, great, yes, screw the government.  </p><p>B. TODD:  I think he's writing off Virginia.  </p><p>TODD:  Yes.  Well, but this --</p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Not just Virginia, you know.  </p><p>TODD:  Yes, not just Virginia.  I mean, it is sort of you have -- we don't  have it in the budget, he said.  You could do the $1.6 trillion tax cut and  you can't do this?  Again, how good of politics is it to bash government?  </p><p>B. TODD:  This was --</p><p>TODD:  I mean, I hate to be this cynical.  </p><p>B. TODD:  Well, first of --</p><p>TODD:  Is this a cynical decision -- </p><p>B. TODD:  First off, the Congress will decide it, not him, in the end.  And  I think that the public doesn't trust government right now, either party.   There are plenty of people in the Republican coalition who trust Donald  Trump more than they trust Republicans in Congress.  </p><p>TODD:  Right.  </p><p>B. TODD:  And this is an example of him being a disrupter and trying to say  that he -- whether he actually does it or not, he is proving -- </p><p>TODD:  Do you think that is another one of those things, don't believe it?  </p><p>B. TODD:  He is proving he is willing to say things people won't say and  that he's not taking cues from other people in Washington.  </p><p>TODD:  He doesn't necessarily do what he says on that one.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Right.  </p><p>KAPUR:  And how does this affect someone like Barbara Comstock who's  running for Congress in a tough re-election in D.C.?  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Exactly.  </p><p>TODD:  I think he just --</p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Right.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TODD:  Actually, he did better --</p><p>B. TODD:  -- Virginia in 2020.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  I mean, her opponent already put out -- </p><p>B. TODD:  That tells me Virginia in 2020 for his own race is what I'm sure  he's thinking about rather than that.  </p><p>TODD:  Well, there -- I think he realizes Virginia -- it may be a swing  state again, not in the Trump era.  I think that's fair to say.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Right.  I mean, Barbara Comstock's opponent already put out a  press release about it.  And it's not just Virginia.  There are lots of  states where there are lots of civilian employees that are going to be  really hurt by this.  </p><p>KAPUR:  Yes, this is a matter of priorities.  I mean, the President decided  that he -- that the United States didn't have the money and could borrow  the money for a big increase in military spending and did have, you know,  funds in the Treasury to offer tax breaks.  But on this one, he --</p><p>TODD:  Let's be crass.  </p><p>B. TODD:  He called an increase on the military --</p><p>TODD:  Let's be crass, let's be crass.  There is not a single vote that he  would get if he somehow said, I'm giving a raise to all federal government  workers.  </p><p>B. TODD:  Not a single vote he would gain. </p><p>TODD:  Yes.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Right.  </p><p>B. TODD:  But the military vote does help him.  </p><p>TODD:  Well, and that's --</p><p>B. TODD:  Because a part of the federal workforce that identifies with  Republicans is military.  </p><p>TODD:  Right.  Which is why the rest of the federal workforce is probably  getting a raise because they'll not separate the two, is my guess, which is  probably right.  Congress won't distinguish.   </p><p>KAPUR:  And it's about priorities.  The money is there, clearly.  He just  wants to spend it on certain things and not other things.  </p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Exactly.  </p><p>TODD:  All right, guys.  We'll take a break here.  You guys get to stick  around. </p><p>Up ahead, inside President Trump's war on Google.  </p><p>Plus, a new outage -- outrage at the border.  Why are more and more  Hispanic American citizens being denied their passports?  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Welcome back.  Another entry in a long pattern for President Trump.   When his opponents attacked him in 2016, he gave them labels.  So he  labeled them Lying Ted, Crooked Hillary.  When the news media publishes  stories he doesn't like, he cries fake news, enemy of the people.  </p><p>And now, this week, the President has decided to go after Google for, in  his words, suppressing conservative voices in its search results.  </p><p>The President tweeted, quote, Google search results for Trump news shows  only the viewing/reporting of fake news media.  In other words, they have  it rigged for me and others so that almost all bad -- stories and news is  bad.  They are controlling what we can and cannot see.  This is a very  serious situation.  Will be addressed.  </p><p>The President also tweeted a video in which he accused the search engine of  highlighting President Obama's state of the union addresses but not his  own.  </p><p>Google responded by saying, wrong, that they did, in fact, highlight  President Trump's state of the union address this year.  Not so last year  for a very good reason.  The speech President Trump gave to Congress in  2017 was not a state of the union address.  </p><p>None of them are when you give them in the first year in office.  </p><p>Joining me now is Kara Swisher.  She is the executive editor of the  technology news Web site, Recode.  </p><p>Kara, nice to see you.  </p><p>KARA SWISHER, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, RECODE:  How are you doing, Chuck?  </p><p>TODD:  All right.  Let's start with the President's accusation.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  And then I want to go to something that I think he is touching on  that actually is relevant to this conversation.  </p><p>SWISHER:  OK.  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  So, obviously, he's going after Google.  And it's all part -- this  is -- you know, Steve Bannon ranted about this a long time ago, big tech.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Yes, and he did also last week.  </p><p>TODD:  Right.  </p><p>SWISHER:  He did a bunch last week and he's done it to Amazon -- Amazon,  \"Washington Post.\"  </p><p>TODD:  That's right.  He is --</p><p>SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  Part of it is maybe he doesn't understand the tech world.  </p><p>SWISHER:  No.  </p><p>TODD:  I think that's a big part of it, but the other part of it just feels  ironic.  It's like, is he saying that you guys must stink because I was  able to manipulate your system and look what I did?  I mean, I don't mean  to be that cynical.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Yes, yes.  </p><p>TODD:  But is there any basis to his attack?  </p><p>SWISHER:  No, none whatsoever.  And I'm not one to defend the tech  industry, you know that.  I'm sort of -- I'm very particular about certain  things they've done, and I'm very interested in these hearings next week  where a lot of the leaders are going to come with some of the problems they  had with Cambridge Analytica and things like that.  </p><p>But, in this case, he's completely wrong.  He doesn't know what he's  talking about.  </p><p>TODD:  I want to go to that state of the union attack because this is the  problem that's happening on social media.  The irony is -- and it's  basically Twitter has allowed this to happen, whether they like it or not.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  Their platform has been used for this, which is -- and it's been  regularly done.  Matt Gaetz is a congressman that has done this.  Kevin  McCarthy is a congressman that has done this.  Where they retweet stuff  that they say, this is how they're biased against conservatives but it  turned out to be fake accusations.  Like, the fake accusations about state  of the union, all these false accusations.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Yes, but it's beyond --</p><p>TODD:  But it gets, like, 32,000 retweets.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Of course.  </p><p>TODD:  Or 50,000 likes.  So people still believe it.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Well, you know, I wrote a column in \"The New York Times\" saying  this is codswallop.  But I just was -- I try to find a word that you could  look up on Google very easily.  </p><p>But the fact of the matter is, conservative voices are very loud on social  media.  So are liberal voices, so are crazy voices, so are comedians, and  so is everyone.  And this particular group of people has actually been  advantaged by it because they were largely left out of the mainstream media  until Fox News came along.  </p><p>TODD:  Right.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Now, they have all these platforms to discuss things on.  And  there's been this sort of online rage-fest among them that they are not  heard.  And the line I used is, the people that talk loudest about not  being heard never shut up.  And I think we can all agree that Donald Trump  uses Twitter quite a bit.  </p><p>TODD:  One of the mistakes we in the mainstream media made during -- when  these false accusations against us being biased for 40 years happen is we  started believing, well, maybe we are biased and we got to -- oh, wait, we  can't look biased.  So then we created a lot of false equivalency issues,  OK.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  It looks to me like Silicon Valley is about to fall into that trap.   How do they not fall into that trap?  </p><p>SWISHER:  By ignoring it completely.  Look at what Jeff Bezos is doing  every time he comes after him.  He just doesn't say a word.  I think Google  has to just say this is not true and move along and stuff like that.  </p><p>And, obviously, there, again, are issues that all these companies should  face, you know, of things they have done but not this one.  </p><p>TODD:  All right.  But I want to get into an issue that I actually thought  Steve Bannon addressed very -- you know, in a -- he ranted at the end, but  he, actually, I thought, touched on something that I've gotten into, which  is, who's going to regulate the algorithms?  </p><p>SWISHER:  Right.  </p><p>TODD:  At the end of the day, they're not wrong that, these algorithms,  none of us know what they have.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Right.  </p><p>TODD:  They have all of our information.  Steve Bannon made a  recommendation that I didn't think was a bad one, which was should our info  at least be in a public trust of some sort that they can access all the  time?  </p><p>And we get that, but -- I buy what he's talking about there.  At some  point, we have to figure out how to regulate the algorithms so, at least,  we know if they're being abused.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Well, no, I know.  That's the problem, is you can't do that.   That's such -- then make Google an entity of the government?  </p><p>TODD:  No, you wouldn't make it an entity of the government.  </p><p>SWISHER:  It's called Russia.  </p><p>TODD:  No, no, no.  But it's --</p><p>SWISHER:  It's called the Russian government.  </p><p>TODD:  Well, then how do we regulate an algorithm?  </p><p>SWISHER:  We don't.  We don't.  </p><p>TODD:  Why?  </p><p>SWISHER:  Because they're big companies, and they are -- they're the ones  in charge, just the way CBS used to be in charge of the airwaves.  </p><p>TODD:  OK.  But if Google writes an algorithm that somehow directs -- all  right, let me do a better one.  Let's say one of the -- </p><p>SWISHER:  Facebook or any --</p><p>TODD:  No, monster.com, like an employment site.  And their algorithm seems  to always leave out people of color as your job applicants.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Right, that's a different issue.  </p><p>TODD:  But that's my point.  How do you --</p><p>SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  You know, they could say, oh, we just wrote an algorithm, we didn't  know it was going to do that.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Right.  Well, I think the problem is who is making these things.   That's one of the big issues being discussed with Silicon Valley, like A.I.   You know, there's an -- you know, the old expression, crap in, crap out.  </p><p>And so, you know, if certain people are the only ones designing that, what  happens?  But that's in the Internet.  The Internet has largely been  designed by the small group of people.  That still doesn't mean you should  have a government entity regulating any of that sort of thing.  </p><p>TODD:  All right, but let me go to a consumer thing, OK?  </p><p>SWISHER:  OK.  </p><p>TODD:  So I want to know that I am getting -- I am being treated as a  consumer equally in the state of Texas as I am in the state of North  Dakota.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  And if an Amazon algorithm decides, boy, in Texas, you have more  money.  You can afford to pay this because I know this by where you live  and all this stuff than the north.  Boy, I'm getting -- that's not fair as  a consumer.  </p><p>SWISHER:  That's called marketing and retail for the past hundred years, so  I don't know that can --</p><p>TODD:  No.  Well, I'm wondering -- I get it.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  But on the other hand, if there -- if it's unfair practices, how is  it that we're going to --</p><p>SWISHER:  Is it?  </p><p>TODD:  Well, why shouldn't it?  </p><p>SWISHER:  Why shouldn't it be?  Well, here's the thing, privacy issues,  yes.  I think there's probably going to be a privacy bill, especially if  the Democrats come into power.  I'm absolutely certain there will be some  sort of -- there's been one in California that's been somewhat  controversial, but there will be a national privacy bill at some point  given all these issues we're having.  </p><p>TODD:  Is it going to look like Europe?  </p><p>SWISHER:  I don't know.  Probably not.  I don't think U.S. regulators have  ever been as strong as the ones in Europe.  But, again, there's  international issues too because the Europeans are doing something  different, the Chinese will do something different.  Everyone around the  world in a global society will do something different.  </p><p>TODD:  What's next week going to look like for Twitter and Facebook?  </p><p>SWISHER:  Ah, I don't know.  It depends who shows up.  I mean, if we get  Jack Dorsey and Sheryl Sandberg -- now, there's been calls to bring in  Larry Page who was one of the founders of Google.  It probably will be  Sundar Pichai.  </p><p>I think they're going to quiz them.  I hope they don't quiz them on all  these whether conservatives can speak up or whether anybody can speak out.   They should talk about issues of the meddling in the elections.  They  should talk about privacy.  They should talk about how did this -- how did  their platforms get hijacked by the Russian government.  </p><p>These are critical issues, not whether Donald Trump is loud enough on the  Internet, which I think he is.  I feel he has plenty of voice.  </p><p>TODD:  I was just going to say the Internet has been good to Donald Trump.  </p><p>SWISHER:  That's what I said, they -- Donald Trump should send tech a gold  embossed thank you note for the things that it has done, giving him tools  and all kinds of ways to get in office.  </p><p>TODD:  Right.  So I guess, does the industry --</p><p>SWISHER:  You want me to say you want to regulate -- </p><p>TODD:  No, no, no, no.  But does the industry -- is it ready to come and  say, hey, look, we know we've gotten this big and we need help figuring X  out?  </p><p>SWISHER:  Right.  </p><p>TODD:  Are they ready to at least do that with the government?  </p><p>SWISHER:  I think they have to engage more with the government.  But as you  saw from the Zuckerberg hearings, the politicians really are almost  clueless about technology.  </p><p>TODD:  It's embarrassing.  </p><p>SWISHER:  And it was embarrassing.  And everyone used to say, oh, Mark did  really well.  I say, well, it's a very really low bar.  So, no, he didn't,  but they did badly.</p><p>TODD:  I would love Mr. Zuckerberg to come here.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Well, I will ask him.  </p><p>TODD:  And I would -- no, they haven't.  Like, none of them will stay,  though.  </p><p>SWISHER:  None of them will?  </p><p>TODD:  Yes, I would love to be quizzed by some of those members of  Congress, too.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Yes, yes.  I would like members of Congress who actually know  something about technology to do the quizzing, but that's, you know.  </p><p>TODD:  I think it's time to let them staffers do the quizzing and all.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  Do you expect any sort of -- I think Donald Trump, Jr. said, oh,  we're going to have a conservative alternative.  Is that plausible out  there and realistic?  </p><p>SWISHER:  Sure, go ahead.  They can do it.  It's the big wide Internet.  </p><p>TODD:  Right, but is there anybody out there that actually could do it?  </p><p>SWISHER:  You know, there were rumors of Peter Thiel and Steve Bannon  getting together.  I keep hearing them getting together and creating their  own.  I'm sure there will be a digital element to it if they do it.   There's all kinds of rumors around that.  </p><p>Obviously, Fox News has digital elements.  Are you kidding?  There are so  many conservative publications on the Internet now, Breitbart, all the  others.  They've had -- the Internet has been very, very good to them.  </p><p>TODD:  Yes.  </p><p>SWISHER:  So I don't know if they should complain quite so much.  </p><p>TODD:  I think their biggest complaint is called capitalism.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Yes.  </p><p>TODD:  Kara Swisher, thanks for coming on.  </p><p>SWISHER:  Thank you.  </p><p>TODD:  Much appreciated.  Up ahead, the uproar over a new crackdown on  Hispanic Americans that are American citizens.  They're being denied  passports or having their passports taken away.  </p><p>But, first, it's the emotional tribute to Senator John McCain.  Some 3,500  people gathered in a Phoenix church to honor McCain's life of service.  </p><p>Twenty-four sitting U.S. senators attended that service.  So did four  former senators, including former Vice President Joe Biden who remembered  Senator McCain as a leader who always put country before party.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  John was a hero.   His character, courage, honor, integrity.  But I think the thing that's  understated the most is his optimism.  That's what made John special.  It  made John a giant among all of us.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Welcome back. Tonight I'm obsessed with President Trump's morning  tweetstorm. More unusual than normal, even for him. Those tweets were a  plague of defensive outbursts, baseless assertions and outright falsehoods,  the kind of statements that have fact checkers working overtime or simply  throwing up their hands.</p><p>But it got us wondering, what if in some Seinfeld-like Bizarro universe,  President Trump tweeted the exact opposite of what he tweeted this morning?  What would that look like? Hmm, would it be more believable if President  Trump had tweeted something like this? When Lester Holt accurately played  my tape on Russia, I was hurt badly.</p><p>Or how about this? Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner had everything to do with  the pushing out of Don McGahn. The news media has it right. Has it so  right. Or how about this one? The legitimate Russia investigation had  everything to do with respect to my decision on Don McGahn.</p><p>And then another one on Don McGahn. I'm very excited about the person who  will be taking the place of Don McGahn as White House counsel. I never  liked Don, and he was responsible for me not firing Bob Mueller or Jeff  Sessions. And finally, I just cannot state strongly enough how totally  dishonest I am. Truth doesn't matter to me. I only have my hatred and  agenda.</p><p>As Jerry Seinfeld and George Costanza, if every instinct you have is wrong,  then the opposite would have to be right. Right?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Welcome back. The Trump administration's crackdown along the Mexican  border isn't just limited to people trying to come here illegally. Now a  growing number of Hispanic-Americans are being denied passports because the  government is questioning their citizenship.</p><p>The Washington Post reports that the Trump administration is accusing  hundreds and possibly thousands of people of using fraudulent birth  certificates since they were babies. The government alleges that some  midwives and physicians along the border gave U.S. birth certificates to  people who were actually born in Mexico decades ago.</p><p>In a statement to The Washington Post, the State Department said it \"has  not changed policy or practice regarding the adjudication of passport  applications and the U.S.-Mexico border region happens to be an area of the  country where there has been a significant incidence of citizenship fraud.\"</p><p>It's true that this happened under George W. Bush and the Obama  administrations too, but that mostly ended after a government settlement in  2009. This news as taking away people's citizenship is on the rise under  President Trump.</p><p>And to try to understand this piece and this issue a little better, I'm  joined now by NBC News national security and justice reporter Julia Ainsley  and Attorney Jaime Diaz who represents some of the U.S. citizens who have  been either denied passports or had them taken away. Welcome to both of  you.</p><p>Julia, let me start with you. When did this begin? How pervasive do we  think it is? And is this connected to the sort of prediction, if you will,  that this was the next thing Stephen Miller, who's sort of the chief  advisor on all immigration issues in the West Wing, this is the next step  he wanted to take?</p><p>JULIA AINSLEY, NATIONAL SECURITY AND JUSTICE REPORTER, NBC NEWS:  Chuck,  context here is critical. You're exactly right. We know that Stephen Miller  -- the next step he wants to do is go after legal immigration.</p><p>What we're seeing here is part of this new fraud crackdown from DHS and  throughout the Trump administration like the State Department. They're  trying to go after people who maybe lied on their applications and became  citizens or became permanent residents and got green cards who shouldn't  have.</p><p>So they want to go back and re-adjudicate and take that away. But of course  what happens and what The Washington Post laid out in this story is a lot  of people who were rightfully in the United States end up getting their  rights taken away too.</p><p>And as they found under the Obama administration, it's very difficult to  decide which ones of those birth certificates signed by those midwives in  the '90s were legitimate and which ones weren't. And so they really just  decided it was a fruitless cause and that they should just allow them --  take them as legitimate.</p><p>But this is part of a broader crackdown. And from people I've spoken to who  represent a lot of immigrants who are trying to move up the ladder, get  passports, get citizenships, get green cards, they say before you take that  next step, you need to go through your record and make sure everything is  crystal clear or it could just not even be worth it.</p><p>It's too much of a risk because of the scrutiny they're doing going back  and looking at everything and every application you've put in earlier, even  if they were legitimate, Chuck.</p><p>TODD:  All right. Let me go to Jaime Diaz. Jaime, I wanted Julia to begin  there to help me continue to sort of lay out the context of all of this.  Now walk me through what you're dealing with. How many clients do you have  that have been impacted?</p><p>How many of them are natural born citizens versus those who went through  the green card process and became naturalized citizens here, born here  versus naturalized, all of those things. I'm curious. What kind of folks  are being targeted here? </p><p>JAIME DIAZ, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY:  Here we're talking only about people  that were born in the United States.</p><p>TODD:  OK. How many clients do you have on this front?</p><p>DIAZ:  I have represented over 500 people. I presently have probably 30  people that are in lawsuits in federal court. I have represented over 100  of them in lawsuits in federal court where they have been taken away their  documents. They have been put in rooms to admit that they were not born in  the United States.</p><p>Their mothers have been asked to come to the consulate to admit that they  were not born there and the documents were taken. What we see now is that  they are detaining them. When they come back -- without allowing them to  come back and keep them in Mexico.</p><p>There are many clients of mine that I have that were born in the United  States, that the government has stopped them and have kept them in Mexico.  And the crackdown is starting to be very hard. They are doing it every day. I see someone in my office.</p><p>I practice in Brownsville, Texas which is at the border with Mexico. People  that were born by midwives down there, there is a lot of them, but I can  tell you something, that most of them were born in the United States.</p><p>We even have a soldier that was born with a midwife and he applied to  become a soldier. They took him in. He applied for a passport and they say,  show that you're a United States citizen. This is ridiculous.</p><p>TODD:  Well, there was one example in The Washington Post, Mr. Diaz, and  I'm just curious if you had to deal with something like this where it was a  former soldier and he only wanted to give his first name because he was  afraid he'd be targeted.</p><p>He said that the State Department told him that they weren't convinced he  was a U.S. citizen, that they needed a bunch of the following documents.  Either his mother's -- evidence of his mother's prenatal care, his  baptismal certificate, maybe rental agreements when he was a baby.</p><p>This is a grown man. I'm sorry, I don't think my mother has the power bill  from when I was born in 1972. Is this the burden of proof that's being put  on your clients?</p><p>DIAZ:  Yes. That is what's going on. They are asking for things that no one  has. No one in the whole United States has prenatal record from her mother.  A person that is 40 years old, there's no way they have them. So they're  asking for things that they know they don't have. People get frustrated.</p><p>But if you live on the border, there is a need for you to cross to the  other side. You have family, you have things to do on the other side. And  when they're coming back, that's when they're detaining them. They're  making them sign documents so that they can get away from it.</p><p>What has happened is outrageous. An opportunity like this to tell the  American people what is going on is incredible. We're not talking about  people that are naturalized, we are talking about people that were born in  the United States. They just happen to have a Hispanic last name and they  were born with midwives, but that's still Americans.</p><p>TODD:  Mr. Diaz, did you have any client who didn't have a Hispanic last  name who had their passport taken away?</p><p>DIAZ:  Not that I can remember right now on the top of my head. Most of  them have been taken away, no. I have people that I represented that are  having difficulty getting a passport because they were born in Southern  Texas with a midwife. But someone that has a passport taken away or revoked  when they were coming back or through a letter in the mail, no, I have  never had it.</p><p>TODD:  So it does feel as if it is Hispanic surnames that get targeted  here. Julia, walk me through the due process in this. What are the court  procedures here? You're accused of this, you're trying to fight back. Where  does it go in the system?</p><p>AINSLEY:  It's really hard to fight back, Chuck. I mean, you would have to  get a lawyer. I know a lot of people who stay outside of places where  immigrants are trying to appeal and they know that they will eventually  come across the street and find lawyers because it's nearly impossible to  navigate this system on your own.</p><p>As Jaime just pointed out, they're asking for these documents a lot of  people don't have. And as an American citizen, yes, you have the right to  have citizenship, but that passport, the documents that you have to have a  passport, it's not a right to have a passport if you don't have the  documents to back it up.</p><p>TODD:  Right.</p><p>AINSLEY:  And when they're raising this bar, there actually very few routes  to go. The way this was handled in the past, Chuck, was through a class  action settlement and that's frequently the way we see immigrants or even  U.S.-born immigrants, the children of immigrants seek their rights, that  they're able to go through the ACLU. They have to come in a class action  suit with lots of people and then they are able to get justice.</p><p>That's what happened in 2009 when the ACLU said, look, you can't tell which  one of these midwife birth certificates are illegitimate and which ones  aren't, and we think that it's a very small amount of children that were  actually born in Mexico. And so, therefore, you can't discriminate based on  them having this one type of birth certificate. So the answer is it is  really hard to get justice without a class action lawsuit in this case.</p><p>TODD:  Mr. Diaz, is there anything in the -- why is the burden of proof not  on the government to prove you're not a U.S. citizen?</p><p>DIAZ:  The burden (INAUDIBLE) evidence and this is a civil case. The  government does not have any way to prove that you are -- to prove beyond a  reasonable doubt that you fraudulently obtained that document. First of  all, these are documents that were registered when you were a baby. And the  only way to prove it is if you knew that that document was fraudulent when  you grew up.</p><p>So, you know, what they do is they try to take you away from going to  court. That's why they detain you at ports of entry and they keep you and  say stay in Mexico. How do you come back if you will stay in Mexico and you  were thrown into --</p><p>TODD:  You're not a Mexican citizen. You're not a Mexican citizen. What are  you going to do? </p><p>DIAZ:  It is really -- the stories -- unfortunately I don't have the time  to tell you all the stories that I have seen of people. But I can tell you  one thing. We have won all those cases. What is sad is after you win all  those cases, you would think the government would say, you know, I have to  change. No, they go harder. Eventually there will be no attorney that will  represent these people, but I'm here to represent them.</p><p>TODD:  Let me ask you this. Is there -- how many of your clients that you felt like they were detained longer than they should be thrown in  jail and what were they thrown in jail for if they were? </p><p>DIAZ:  They were thrown to jail -- they get thrown immigration detention  centers. I had a guy that was detained for three days at a detention center  --</p><p>TODD:  American citizen? An American citizen?</p><p>DIAZ:  An American citizen. Yes, sir.</p><p>TODD:  Detained -- put into a detention center and just because, what, he  didn't have a passport or they didn't believe his passport?</p><p>DIAZ:  No, he had a passport. They just said, we have a note that we need  to revoke your passport so they put him in a room. The agent asked him, do  you want me to treat you like a Mexican or as a U.S. citizen? What I would  have told him, treat him like a human being, give him his rights. He has a  right to hear whatever evidence you think you have. But the way they're  treating people is not right.</p><p>TODD:  All right. Julia Ainsley, Jaime Diaz, I've got to leave it there. I  thank you both for sharing your expertise and your experiences there, thank  you.</p><p>Up ahead, the empire state strikes back. We'll show you some of last  night's New York gubernatorial debate between Andrew Cuomo and Cynthia  Nixon. Let's just say a little feisty.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Welcome back. In tonight's \"Meet the Midterms,\" the feuding factions  of the Democratic Party literally on full display.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D), NEW YORK:  The subway system is owned by New York  City.</p><p>CYNTHIA NIXON, DEMOCRATIC GUBERNATORIAL NOMINEE: The MTA has been  controlled by the state since 1965.</p><p>CUOMO:  Excuse me, can you stop interrupting? Can you stop interrupting?</p><p>NIXON:  Can you stop lying?</p><p>NIXON:  Yeah, as soon as you do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD:  I guess they call that a cell phone. That was New York Governor  Andrew Cuomo seeking his third term and challenger Cynthia Nixon, an  actress and self-described Democratic socialist going out last night in  their one and only debate before New York's primary September 13th. That  handshake at the end may have been the most civil moment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NIXON:  I'm not an Albany insider, like Governor Cuomo, but I think that  experience doesn't mean that much if you're not actually good at governing.</p><p>CUOMO:  My opponent lives in the world of fiction, I live in the world of  fact.</p><p>NIXON:  We already have a corrupt corporate Republican in the White House.  We don't need a corrupt corporate Democrat in Albany as his main  opposition.</p><p>CUOMO:  She released five years of corporate taxes, dumped them in three  hours on a Friday with no notice. Only Donald Trump has done less  transparency on his taxes than my opponent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD:  Nixon is still a long shot to win the nomination. She trailed Cuomo  by 31 points in a Siena College poll from last month.</p><p>But let's see, in a year in which Democrats tapped underdog Andrew Gillum,  who wasn't polling very high in many polls to run for governor in Florida  and in a year in which Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who Nixon endorsed won over  Congressman Joe Crowley in the Bronx there, are you really going to  discount her chances? More \"MTP Daily\" after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Time now for \"The Lid.\" The panel is back: Sahil, Daniella, and  Brad. All right, the president, we got more from your Bloomberg interview.  You're just dribbling it out. You know, we in the -- we just put it all out  there. But anyway, you dribbled it out. We got a little bit which is,  here's what he said about the Mueller probe. We will put it up on the  screen here.</p><p>I view it as an illegal investigation because great scholars -- that's his  quote -- have said that there never should have been a special counsel.  This is an answer when asked if he would comply with the subpoena for  Mueller, he said I'll see what happens there.</p><p>He talks about Mueller being an illegal probe all the time. Let me ask  this, Brad. Do any of the supporters wonder why he just doesn't end it? He  has the power. He is the president.</p><p>BRAD TODD, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST AND FOUNDING PARTNER OF ONMESSAGE INC.:  I  don't think many of the supporters think very much about the Mueller probe.  I think the president thinks about it a lot more than his supporters do.</p><p>C.TOOD:  I think the president thinks about it more than anybody around  this table sometimes.</p><p>B.TODD:  I think the president's voters are -- we'll wait until the Mueller  probe is over with and we'll see what he has and we'll evaluate it. I don't  think it's something that they're obsessed about. Washington is obsessed  about it. They lead (ph) the paper everyday.</p><p>C.TODD:  Sure.</p><p>B.TODD:  It doesn't lead the paper in Kenosho (ph).</p><p>C.TODD:  No, that I buy. He has the power to end these things if he really  wanted to. He obviously knows it would be a problem.</p><p>SAHIL KAPUR, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, BLOOMBERG NEWS:  It's not the  prevailing view of members of his own party in Congress, that it's an  illegal investigation. The Senate majority leader and the speaker of the  House say they support the investigation. That is not only legal but it is  proper that it should come to an end.</p><p>So I think this is the president feeling like there is a lot happening  around him. The walls may be closing in on him. I think he is lashing out.  He may be binging cable news, according to some people around him that I  spoke to.</p><p>DANIELLA GIBBS LEGER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, COMMUNICATIONS AND STRATEGY AT  AMERICAN PROGRESS:  Yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>C. TODD:  He needed something to do. I think they're glad they scheduled  this rally this afternoon.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Yeah, very well timed.</p><p>B.TODD:  The special counsel has a responsibility too. He presumably  supports the idea that special counsel should exist and he has to know when  he's gone past the time limit of when he has credibility.</p><p>C.TODD:  What time limit are we at? This is not even at the halfway point.</p><p>B.TODD:  He's had more than a year.</p><p>C.TODD:  Not even a halfway point.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  So what? You just arbitrarily stop because --</p><p>B.TODD:  He has to decide when the public thinks he's gone too far on time  and show his cards.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  He has to go until the investigation is over. If he keeps  uncovering more crimes --</p><p>B. TODD:  All appointments are political, though, you have a certain amount  of political rope. He has to judge where the American public is and whether  it's willing to let him go on.</p><p>C. TODD:  Here is what I've learned about Bob Mueller. Not a single person  that has known him been with him, worked with him, would say if he didn't  have any -- he would have ended this investigation if there is no  collusion, that he already would have ended it.</p><p>B. TODD:  We can't tell that though until he tells us something. </p><p>C.TODD:  That's true. Right, we are just left here in what is the last  chapter --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KAPUR:  This is not the issue that resonates in most of the country. I do  think public opinion is calcified on this issue for now. New developments  in this case are not necessarily going to move the needle unless they  directly relate to the president. I don't know that the fall of people  around him is going to affect the midterm elections. But this is baked in.  It's one of the reasons that the president --</p><p>D.TODD:  But here is the question --</p><p>KAPUR:  -- not like it doesn't affect him at all.</p><p>B.TODD:  We're at Labor Day. And I think if Mueller comes back with  anything between Labor Day and the election, half the country is going to  reject it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>C.TODD:  I think he knows, more than anything, he keeps quiet between Labor  Day and election day, don't you think?</p><p>B.TODD:  Then he's going to be pushing up against two years before you know  it. I mean, it's too long.</p><p>C.TODD:  No, no, no --</p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  That's why I feel like --</p><p>C. TODD:  This is a trap that Giuliani is trying to set, I think, PR-wise,  which is you're taking forever. Wait, why are you speaking during the  election --</p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Exactly. That's why I feel like maybe January 2019 is going  to be the time when Mueller announces everything. Because it's enough time  before the 2020 election, but you wait until after this election so you  don't have people saying -- </p><p>C. TODD:  I'm not missing work tomorrow. I wouldn't miss work tomorrow.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  That's right.</p><p>C. TODD:  Tomorrow is the last business day of the pre-Labor Day to  election day window, Sahil.</p><p>KAPUR:  And this is where there's so much at stake in the 2018 elections  because whoever controls the House is going to decide what the fate -- what  comes of this report that Mueller files.</p><p>Now, to the issue of subpoenas and, you know, potentially what the White  House would do if he's forced to -- or if he's subpoenaed, they will very  likely challenge this in court and the president probably won't end up  speaking executive privilege.</p><p>The White House can find a way around this, I think, to make sure that they  don't face any court conviction because it's not -- I'm sorry, indictment  because it's not happened to a sitting president so far. Congress is going  to decide.</p><p>C. TODD:  Not to be totally cliche, 5:00 tomorrow is a big deadline, isn't  it?</p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  Yeah.</p><p>C. TODD:  Unofficially for a lot of people. I mean, we assume Mueller  wouldn't do it until -- tomorrow at 5:00 p.m. is the last possible time.</p><p>B.TODD:  Chuck, every Friday night is entertaining in this presidency.</p><p>C.TODD:  Let's try putting on a Sunday show.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>C. TODD:  We don't find it entertaining, we find it mind boggling.</p><p>B.TODD:  You always wanted things to get a little more exciting. You wanted  a little more of a president who is unscripted.</p><p>GIBBS LEGER:  It would be perfect, the Friday before Labor Day to have like  this big thing.</p><p>C.TODD:  Today we had an arrest of somebody who threatened The Boston Globe  using \"you're the enemy of the people.\" Sahil, you're the other working  journalist here. The U.S. attorney went after and arrested this person.  This person, \"you're the enemy of the people, and we're going to kill  every\" -- whatever the caller said to Globe.</p><p>You know, there's always this decision, do we alert authorities or not? At  this point the guy called so many times and, you know, maybe holding  somebody criminally responsible does sort of make people responsible for  their rhetoric.</p><p>KAPUR:  Yeah. There were 14 phone calls here of this man using all kinds of  nasty language that I can't repeat here. Yes, he used the phrase \"the enemy  of the people,\" where have we heard that before.</p><p>I want to be very clear, the president is not condoning violence against  anybody, but it's not difficult to see how someone can listen to that, see  that rhetoric and want to do something crazy if they are not mentally  stable. </p><p>C. TODD:  This has always been our point. We know the president is not --  he needs to actually say that he doesn't mean it. All right. Sahil,  Daniella, Brad, thank you all. We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  That's all we have for tonight. We'll be back tomorrow with more  \"MTP Daily.\" Remember, 5:00 p.m. tomorrow is a big deadline, perhaps in the  Mueller probe. \"The Beat\" starts right now. Ayman Mohyeldin is in for Ari.  Ayman, good evening, sir.</p><p>AYMAN MOHYELDIN, JOURNALIST, MSNBC:  Good evening, Chuck. </p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY  BE UPDATED.

I`m Sheinelle Jones. \"DEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE WITH NICOLLE WALLACE\" will be back next week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MTP DAILY starts now with Katy Tur in for Chuck today. Hi, Katy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KATY TUR, MSNBC HOST: Hi there, Sheinelle. And if it`s Thursday, who gets caught red-handed in 2018 and who gets caught \"Russian\" to judgment?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening, I`m Katy Tur in New York, in for Chuck Todd. Welcome to MTP DAILY.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Heading into next year, can you think of two bigger political questions than these -- what will the Russia probe find in 2018 and how much are voters going to care?</p><p>Well, one way to begin answering those questions is to look at what the Russia probe found in 2017 and how much voters cared in 2017.</p><p>Let`s start with the biggest bombshells. We learned that the Trump campaign was penetrated by Russian interests, whether it was Trump Junior or <person><nameText>Jeff Sessions </nameText></person>or Carter Page or others. And looking back on it, the campaign also seemed willing to accept Russia`s help.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, JR., </nameText></person>SON OF PRESIDENT <person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: For me, this was opposition research. They had something, you know, maybe concrete evidence to all the stories I`d been hearing about, but they were probably under- reported for, you know, years, not just during the campaign, so I think I wanted to hear it out.</p><p>That was, you know, wanting to hear the information. I mean, that`s what we do in business. If there`s information out there, you want it, and then you make what you do with it.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Politics is not the nicest business in the world, but it`s very standard where they have information and you take the information.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TUR: But if there was seemingly nothing to hide, why did the President`s national security adviser and one of the campaign`s national security advisers both plead guilty to lying to federal investigators about their contacts with Russia?</p><p>Both have flipped which means they`re cooperating with Mueller`s investigation.</p><p>On top of it, the Trump campaign`s chairman and his top deputy were indicted for money laundering and conspiracy involving their work for a pro-Russian government. Charges they deny.</p><p>And though the President denies he interfered in the FBI`s investigation, he did admit that the, quote, made up story, he calls the, quote, Russia thing was one of the reasons he fired FBI Director Comey.</p><p>Guy, some look at all these bombshells, and they see a five-alarm fire. Others see a five-alarm nothing burger. But what do voters see? It`s hard to tell.</p><p>As enormous as the story was in 2017, you`d be hard-pressed to find any campaign ads about it. There were even some Democrats urging their party not to talk about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. TIM RYAN (D), OHIO: People back in Ohio aren`t really talking that much about Russia, about Putin, about Michael Flynn. They`re trying to figure out how they`re going to make the mortgage payment, how they`re going to pay for their kids to go to college, what their energy bill looks like.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TUR: But there`s no question that the constant flood of Russia headlines is one important factor when it comes to the anti-Trump wave building right now. It`s not just the most important factor. Not yet. Which brings us to 2018.</p><p>As both parties gear up for a reckoning on this story one way or the other, the President and his allies are attacking the credibility of anyone they see as a threat, whether it`s discrediting Mueller as a partisan running a hoax or dismissing Flynn as a liar.</p><p>They want the FBI`s investigation investigated. The President says the agency is in tatters. And top House Republicans want to end their Russia probe and open up new investigations into deals when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, but Democrats want more witnesses to testify and even re-testify.</p><p>And, guys, the reality for Democrats is that they are being driven by a base that overwhelmingly wants to impeach the President. Begin impeachment proceedings at the very least. So where does the Russia story go now from both a political standpoint and a criminal one?</p><p>Let`s start with Joyce Vance who was a former U.S. attorney with 25 years of experience as a federal prosecutor.</p><p>Joyce, thank you so much for joining us. What do you think -- where do you think the Mueller investigation is going right now? What`s the next shoe to drop?</p><p>JOYCE VANCE, FORMER UNITED STATES ATTORNEY FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA: So I think for folk whose haven`t worked in the Justice Department, the investigation looks slow from the outside, and there are reasons for that. That`s because a criminal investigation proceeds slowly and by the rules.</p><p>Mueller will have a team of FBI investigators. We know that he has some investigators from the Internal Revenue Service. It`s likely that there are folks from other agencies as well as some friends like accountants. And they`ve really spent most of 2017 very quietly putting together the paper trail -- banking records, phone records, e-mails -- and meticulously combing through those.</p><p>And the reason that they`re so meticulous is because prosecutors don`t target individuals. So this isn`t a situation where Mueller is talking with his team in the morning, saying, let`s look at Jared Kushner today.</p><p>Instead, what they`re doing is they`re investigating activity, whether that`s communication between the campaign and Russia during the election or potential activity that looks like it may be Russia recruiting United States persons as agents, and they`ll investigate that situation. And then they`ll make a determination of whether anything that was criminal happened. And only then can they make a decision about whether to proceed with an indictment.</p><p>It`s a lot of sausage making that, from the outside, looks slow. On the inside, it`s painstaking and often very tedious at this stage of the case.</p><p>TUR: They`re going where the investigation leads. We also have two new clues about where they could be going soon. And there are two reports -- one from Yahoo! yesterday -- saying that Robert Mueller is looking into the RNC`s digital operation, trying to figure out why certain areas were targeted and whether they align with the areas that could have been targeted by Russian misinformation or bots.</p><p>There`s also a \"Washington Post\" report out that says Trump`s legal team is preparing to attack Michael Flynn`s credibility, to paint him as a liar.</p><p>VANCE: Two really interesting stories. I think the first piece, the communications piece, was very predictable. The core behind this entire investigation is whether Russia tried to influence a United States election. And it`s important to determine: was that only Russian actors, or were there other folks, potentially folks in the United States and even on the campaign staff, who were involved?</p><p>It`s critical that Mueller make that assessment because there are stat sheets, there are laws on the books, that make it illegal for a foreign country to donate either activity or something of value in connection with the campaign.</p><p>You know, interesting question, would Mueller indict only Russian personnel if it was strictly a Russian operation?</p><p>But what happened online makes it look like the Russians were getting some level of insight about where, geographically, to engage, what populations were vulnerable to the messages and the misinformation they wanted to put out on Facebook and other platforms. So expect Mueller to fully investigate who else was involved in that and determine whether there was any criminal activity.</p><p>TUR: Is Mueller going to -- or going to interview the President?</p><p>VANCE: I think it`s unlikely that this investigation concludes without that happening. Ken Starr`s investigation into President Clinton went on for about 1,490 days and concluded with an interview of the President. It`d be very difficult to finalize this one without interviewing someone who`s either a key witness or potentially a subject or target.</p><p>TUR: When you look at those people that are in the White House right now, and you wonder who potentially has the most exposure. And then you look at Paul Manafort, you look Rick Gates, and what they pleaded to with -- or what they`re facing against Robert Mueller, the not being completely forthcoming on their various federal forms about foreign government interactions.</p><p>When you think about that, is Jared Kushner potentially a person who could face the most problems, who could have the most legal exposure?</p><p>VANCE: So Mueller`s team has made it very clear with they`re indictments that they take lying to the FBI, concealing the truth from investigators, very seriously.</p><p>Anyone who`s in the line of fire either because they made false statements to investigators or because they made misstatements on forms or because they lied or concealed the truth in other forms, those are probably the group of people who are most at risk in the next wave of this investigation. And certainly, Jared Kushner has that bull`s eye on his back.</p><p>TUR: He`s had to resubmit his form a number of times now.</p><p>Joyce Vance, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>Joining me now on our panel is Princeton University professor and MSNBC contributor Eddie Glaude, Republican strategist Susan Del Percio, and political reporter Gabe Debendetti (ph) -- Debenedetti. I got it the second time.</p><p>GABRIEL DEBENEDETTI, POLITICAL REPORTER, POLITICO: Second time.</p><p>TUR: I`m going to get it. So let`s -- in looking at whether or not Mueller could be eyeing the President, I am curious. How in the world is he going to react if he has to be interviewed by the Special Counsel?</p><p>DEBENEDETTI: Not well. Next question?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TUR: The short answer is not well because, of course, we know how he feels about the Special Counsel and he feels about this whole investigation. Of course, he does have a team of legal professionals around him who are going to try and tread extremely carefully with this question.</p><p>So it depends on when we think this is going to happen if it does happen. Whether it`s going to happen in the next few weeks, they`ll try to just blow past it. But if there`s a big build-up to this as we get closer to the midterms, as things get more and more complicated, you know, people around the President are going to be counseling him to tread extremely carefully.</p><p>TUR: How does he react if Jared Kushner gets indicted or looks to be getting indicted?</p><p>SUSAN DEL PERCIO, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Very badly. He`s not going to be responsive to this. One of the things, just to follow up on what was just said, is the timing of this will be very interesting because we`re going into the midterm elections.</p><p>Mueller has either has to have this wrapped up by the summer or plans on going dormant during the campaign time because this could be very influential during the 2018 elections if all of a sudden President Trump or Kushner or someone was brought in for an interview in, say, September or October.</p><p>So I think the timing will be very important on how that plays out.</p><p>TUR: Can an investigation go dormant just because of an election?</p><p>DEL PERCIO: Well, when I say dormant, meaning he won`t make indictments or do big interviews or do anything. Let`s not forget what happened in 2016 with Comey when he was going out there, making news during the election cycle. The FBI, traditionally, has always been very careful about making a certain amount of news in the news cycle.</p><p>So when I say the investigation goes dormant, I`m not suggesting it says -- it`s not ongoing. I`m suggesting they don`t do anything like make big indictments, do big interviews during September and October, which has always been their practice prior to 2016.</p><p>TUR: It would be interesting, though, if it`s an indictment that could be in the national interest, how you --</p><p>DEL PERCIO: You could do -- if you know it`s that -- you`re that close, you can do it in --</p><p>EDDIE GLAUDE, JR., PROFESSOR OF RELIGION AND AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY: August.</p><p>DEL PERCIO: Yes, July or August, or you can wait until November `18.</p><p>TUR: So the other piece of this is whether or not Donald Trump`s team does try to distance itself from Michael Flynn, which would be interesting, considering all of the things that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has said about Flynn and all of the ways he`s been complimentary to him.</p><p>Just take a look. We have a mash-up of all the times Trump has praised his former national security adviser.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Michael Flynn -- General Flynn is a wonderful man. I think he`s been treated very, very unfairly by the media.</p><p>I think it`s very, very unfair, what`s happened to General Flynn, the way he was treated and the documents and papers that were illegally -- I stress that -- illegally leaked.</p><p>I do feel badly for him. He served the country. He was a general.</p><p>This man has served for many years. He`s a general. He`s a, in my opinion, a very good person.</p><p>Well, I feel badly for General Flynn. I feel very badly. He`s led a very strong life.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TUR: This is after he fired him for lying to the Vice President. He`s been complimentary towards him or not negative, at least, towards him, even after it was revealed that he lied to the FBI and that he was working with Special Counsel Mueller. That is until it looks like, potentially, right now, when the Mueller -- when the legal team could be turning against him.</p><p>How is the legal team going to find credibility when the President, the person in charge, has been saying wonderful things about this man and saying he has been treated unfairly by the press?</p><p>GLAUDE, JR.: I`m not sure. Dowd just came out recently saying that this was just simply a bogus story. It was fake, --</p><p>TUR: Fake news, yes.</p><p>GLAUDE, JR: -- fake news. But this is standard practice on the part of defense attorneys, to say that if a person is being charged for lying, then how can we trust their word? In relation to --</p><p>TUR: Yes.</p><p>GLAUDE, JR.: -- or in regards to the person who is under investigation. So I think the interesting thing here is this: folks are scared. And it`s clear folks are scared because the Mueller investigation is -- they are on to something. And whether they call it a nothing burger or whether they call it fake news or whatever, we know they`re on to something. And the question is: when will it come to light?</p><p>It seems to me, very clearly, that the question of collusion, the question of obstruction, and all the collateral effects that follow from the investigation of these two things, the collateral effects involved, financing involve lying. It implicates these folks. And they`re not behaving like people who are innocent. They`re just simply not behaving like people --</p><p>DEL PERCIO: Well, and it kindly lends to that they`re on to something. They have something. They have four indictments --</p><p>GLAUDE, JR.: Right.</p><p>DEL PERCIO: -- and two guilty pleas.</p><p>GLAUDE, JR.: Right, right.</p><p>DEL PERCIO: A guilty plea from the former national security adviser. That in itself is really telling itself.</p><p>GLAUDE, JR.: And let`s not forget. The last news cycle, we were actually thinking about -- a few news cycles ago, we were actually thinking about the timeline of when President Trump found out that Flynn was lying.</p><p>DEL PERCIO: That`s right.</p><p>TUR: Let`s switch for a second because I want to know: do voters care about this? Because if you look at polls, it doesn`t seem like voters have this at the top of their priority list.</p><p>The most significant event to you personally in 2017, according to an NBC poll on Russia, go all the way down the list. Russia investigation, seven percent. That`s not the top of the list. Are voters going to vote on this issue in to 2018?</p><p>DEBENEDETTI: Certainly, some will, and probably those people that are either big supporters of the President or enormous detractors of the President.</p><p>But if things stay as they currently are and we don`t get more information and there isn`t more movement on this investigation as we get closer to the midterms, probably not that many of these voters will vote on that. But that`s not going to be that much of an issue because very few candidates are actually going to be campaigning on this because they specifically know about it.</p><p>Now, in Democratic primaries, there might be some people saying we have to impeach the President immediately, and Republicans may be campaigning, saying, these Democrats want to impeach the President immediately. But when you look at what candidates are actually talking on the campaign trail, very few of them are talking about this though.</p><p>TUR: Very few people are bringing up Russia. If you look at what happened in Alabama, it was about Roy Moore. If you look at what happened in Virginia, it was about the statues -- the Civil War statues. If you look at Georgia, it was about where Ossoff lived. It was about anti-Trump to a degree, but it wasn`t about this Russia investigation.</p><p>DEL PERCIO: And that poll also talks about health care, I mean, as being a top priority. There`s a lot of things. I don`t think it turns into an election issue unless there is more there to show the public why it matters.</p><p>GLAUDE, JR.: But it all depends, I think --</p><p>DEL PERCIO: I mean --</p><p>GLAUDE, JR.: Sorry to cut you off.</p><p>DEL PERCIO: Go ahead.</p><p>GLAUDE, JR.: It all depends on how we understand the way in which the word \"Trump\" parses out. Right? Trump is a shorthand for a range --</p><p>TUR: But are you going to see an ad that says <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>colluded with Russia? The Russia investigation is under federal investigation.</p><p>DEL PERCIO: Yes.</p><p>TUR: That sort of ad that you might see?</p><p>DEL PERCIO: I think you`re going to see <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>supported a child -- accused child molester, who`ve said, you know, to -- the point to Charlottesville, I don`t think that this is something that necessarily is the worst thing, which has --</p><p>TUR: Which is always --</p><p>DEL PERCIO: -- worked for him (ph).</p><p>TUR: But which is fascinating. This is not -- this isn`t the worst that this President --</p><p>DEL PERCIO: Which is interesting (ph).</p><p>TUR: -- who`s under federal investigation for potentially colluding with or coordinating with a foreign government to interfere in our elections, is not the biggest thing.</p><p>GLAUDE, JR.: Right.</p><p>TUR: It`s fascinating. Guys, stick with us, Eddie, Susan, and Gabe.</p><p>Ahead, Roy Moore`s last stand. Speaking of Roy Moore. Alabama says, officially, the Senate candidate lost to Doug Jones fair and square, but is it really over?</p><p>TUR: Welcome back. It`s official. Democrat Doug Jones is the winner of the Alabama special senate race. Alabama`s Secretary of State John Merrill certified the results from this month`s special election this afternoon, but Jones` opponent, Roy Moore, is still not yet ready to throw in the towel.</p><p>Today`s certification comes despite a last-minute protest from Moore. Late yesterday, Moore filed a lawsuit alleging that voter fraud led to his defeat, setting some rumors that have already been debunked by state authorities.</p><p>The motion was denied by a judge this afternoon, but Moore`s campaign is not backing down. They put out a statement after the certification today that says, in part, election fraud experts across the country have agreed that this was a fraudulent election.</p><p>A source within the Moore campaign tells NBC News that the candidate is still not conceding but that Moore has not determined whether to further contest the results. Nevertheless, Jones is expected to be sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence next week.</p><p>More MTP DAILY right after this.</p><p>TUR: Welcome back. 2017 is coming to a close and what a year it was. Let`s go back to our panel -- Eddie Glaude, Susan Del Percio, Gabe Debenedetti.</p><p>Guys, top landmark moments of 2017. We asked you to give your thoughts. You answered.</p><p>Eddie, Charlottesville and the #MeToo Movement?</p><p>GLAUDE, JR.: Yes. I mean, it is a sign of the culture wars, right? That we`re in another iteration of the culture wars and that this idea that this country is run and possessed by the property of old White men is dying. Although it`s dying a very violent and intense death.</p><p>TUR: How does it resonate, though, in 2018?</p><p>GLAUDE, JR.: Well, it`s going to -- it`s already --</p><p>TUR: What is that going to look like, though?</p><p>GLAUDE, JR.: It`s already resonating in the political process, right? So we saw it in Virginia. We`re seeing it in Alabama, right? We`re going to see it in Mississippi.</p><p>We`re going to grassroots organizers all across the country who are mobilizing. It`s going to be Black voters, Brown voters, it`s going to be women. Of course, there are Black and Brown women.</p><p>They`re going to be mobilized. They`re actually excited about, in some ways, putting forward a vision of the country that challenges this idea that the country belongs to old heterosexual White men.</p><p>TUR: Do you think it`s going to be the end of Nancy Pelosi, Susan?</p><p>DEL PERCIO: I do in that when they start looking at that $17 million of settlements from -- for the previous 12 years, she was either Speaker or Minority Leader during them. So she oversaw that. The deadline comes right at --</p><p>TUR: What about Paul Ryan?</p><p>DEL PERCIO: He was only in power for a year, so he wasn`t Speaker then so he wasn`t overseeing it.</p><p>TUR: What about Mitch McConnell?</p><p>DEL PERCIO: This is the congressional fund. I am -- and I think on the Senate front, they`ve only found -- I don`t think it`s a substantial amount of money that they`ve seen. There has been things come to light.</p><p>But Nancy Pelosi is going to have to explain -- after she fouled up her interview on Conyers, she`s going to have to explain how she oversaw that many cases. And I think we`re going to see a lot more, not just from that $17 million but also when people start reviewing campaign accounts of members of the Congress.</p><p>TUR: And does <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>pay a penalty from the #MeToo Movement politically?</p><p>DEBENEDETTI: Of course. This is something that he has been dealing with since day one, of course.</p><p>Now that the #MeToo Movement is something that people are talking about more openly, it`s something that even some Democrat opponents of his on Capitol Hill are talking about. You have people who might want to run for President out there saying <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>should resign because of the accusations against him.</p><p>TUR: And his accusers are not going away.</p><p>DEBENEDETTI: Absolutely not.</p><p>TUR: That suit is still pending.</p><p>DEL PERCIO: And if -- to add to Eddie`s point, not only that, when you look at Donald Trump`s poll numbers, they`re horrible. He gets better marks when they look at him on issues like the economy, so it is clear that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is pulling down the party, not necessarily the way he`s handling his policy.</p><p>TUR: And he endorsed Roy Moore, and you -- there was a report that Ronna Romney McDaniel, the head of the RNC, was worried that that endorsement is just going to --</p><p>DEL PERCIO: She was right.</p><p>TUR: -- kill him with women. We`ll see, though.</p><p>Susan, yours was firing James Comey and the appointment of a Special Counsel.</p><p>DEL PERCIO: Yes, I --</p><p>TUR: In 2018, are we still going to be talking about Comey?</p><p>DEL PERCIO: Oh, well --</p><p>TUR: Oh, yes?</p><p>DEL PERCIO: -- we`re going to be talking about Comey and Mueller and --</p><p>TUR: Yes, yes.</p><p>DEL PERCIO: -- that`s not going away anytime soon. And it was just -- it`s not just that it happened, which is so significant.</p><p>It`s also because the amount of time the President has used -- has consumed tweeting about it, the way it`s led to him going after the DOJ, going after law enforcement, going after a pillar of our society and trying to take it down because he doesn`t like an investigation that may hurt him.</p><p>This is a -- you know, that takedown is not about -- he needs to put country first on this one, which I know he won`t do, but --</p><p>TUR: He`s undercutting the Justice Department --</p><p>DEL PERCIO: Tremendously.</p><p>TUR: -- undercutting the FBI. He was trying to undercut the electoral process in 2016. He is still trying to do it to a degree with this Election Voter Fraud Commission that`s out there.</p><p>And now, we`re seeing Roy Moore, who we just mentioned a moment ago, trying to use this idea of voter fraud as a reason why he should not concede and why he has standing to get back on the ballot or some sort of recount. Who knows?</p><p>I mean, what does that mean, though, for us going forward? Are we going to see candidates just refuse to lose and to claim voter fraud?</p><p>DEBENEDETTI: Sure. I mean, when we talk about the Trump presidency, we talk about the undercutting of norms so often that it almost doesn`t mean anything anymore. But this is really an important one, the question of accepting the legitimacy of our elections.</p><p>DEL PERCIO: Yes.</p><p>DEBENEDETTI: There was a lot of concern, you`ll remember, in late 2016 that had <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>lost --</p><p>DEL PERCIO: That`s true.</p><p>DEBENEDETTI: -- that he would not have accepted the result of the election.</p><p>TUR: Right.</p><p>DEBENEDETTI: And he wouldn`t say that he was going to.</p><p>TUR: Yes.</p><p>DEBENEDETTI: It does not seem that Roy Moore`s challenge upon challenge upon challenge is going to get anywhere. It looks like Doug Jones is going to be a senator next weekend, and we`ll move on from that. But there`s clearly a precedent --</p><p>DEL PERCIO: But there`s precedent, yes.</p><p>DEBENEDETTI: Absolutely.</p><p>DEL PERCIO: And we still know the Russians interfered with our elections, and we haven`t done anything to really stop them in 2018. So that`s also another big thing.</p><p>GLAUDE, JR.: And the irony is that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is still here, despite all --</p><p>TUR: That`s right.</p><p>GLAUDE, JR.: Despite all of what we`ve just said.</p><p>TUR: Travel ban was yours, Gabe.</p><p>DEBENEDETTI: Yes. I think the travel ban is extremely important here because not only did it happen on, essentially, day one of the presidency, but there were enormous protests immediately. And it showed both sides the political power here and the -- it raised the stakes for the coming year and the years to come.</p><p>TUR: And it also set the stage for <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>being a divisive president, not being a unifying president. Not starting with infrastructure, which he could have got Democrats onboard with. Starting with something that was going to alienate a large chunk of the population, and us from the rest of the world.</p><p>DEBENEDETTI: And that`s the important point here. Obviously, there`s an enormous issue here domestically with this travel ban and the legal fights that have continued to keep going and will continue to keep going, but it also sends an enormous message to the rest of the world, on day one of the Trump presidency, that this was going to be a dramatic break from the Obama White House and from all previous administrations.</p><p>And it really sent a huge message to the world that, listen, you`re going to have to pay attention to <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>because what you`re about to see for the next year, for the next four years, maybe for the next eight years, is like nothing you`ve ever seen before.</p><p>DEL PERCIO: That`s a really great point that you brought up that I hadn`t thought about. When you think of it, that the first time we saw such strong voter protest besides after the inauguration, which goes to your point about energizing and having voter turnout.</p><p>That really -- I mean, no one expected to see people turning up at airports and changing it. So I applaud you for bringing that up because I hadn`t thought -- I hadn`t remembered that with all the craziness.</p><p>TUR: Protests like we haven`t seen in this country and --</p><p>DEL PERCIO: I mean, it was over --</p><p>GLAUDE, JR.: Since the mid-20th century.</p><p>DEL PERCIO: Yes.</p><p>TUR: Yes.</p><p>GLAUDE, JR.: And I think the travel ban is also -- should also be understood as part of the culture war underneath it.</p><p>DEBENEDETTI: Absolutely.</p><p>TUR: Yes.</p><p>DEL PERCIO: Yes.</p><p>GLAUDE, JR.: It`s all of these deep anxieties about --</p><p>TUR: The other.</p><p>GLAUDE, JR.: -- demographic shifts in the country.</p><p>TUR: The other.</p><p>GLAUDE, JR.: Exactly.</p><p>TUR: The people that don`t look like us.</p><p>GLAUDE, JR.: Exactly.</p><p>TUR: Absolutely. Eddie Glaude, Susan Del Percio, Gabe Debenedetti -- I`m getting it now.</p><p>DEBENEDETTI: You got it.</p><p>TUR: Just rolling off the tongue. Coming up, Capitol Hill versus Silicon Valley. The massive impact Facebook, Twitter, and Google had in 2017, and how they could shape the political landscape next year.</p><p>KATY TUR, CORRESPONDENT, NBC NEWS: Ahead, how social media could change the way we look at politics in 2018. Plus, a look back on the political icons we lost over the past year. But first, Josh Lipton is here with the \"CNBC Market Wrap.\" Hi, Josh.</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT, CNBC: Thanks, Katy. Bank stocks help Wall Street close higher. All three major indexes are set for monthly gains. Dow notched its 71st record close for the year adding 63 points. S&amp;P gained five points. The Nasdaq closed 11 points higher.</p><p>Financial stocks gave Wall Street a boost. JP Morgan Chase rose 0.5 percent and oil prices dipped but stayed close to the psychologically key $60 level, a 2-1/2-year high which it touched earlier this week.</p><p>That`s it from CNBC, first in business worldwide.</p><p>TUR: Welcome back. Members of President Trump`s inner circle weren`t the only ones facing tough questions this year about Russian meddling in the 2016 election. As the investigations heated up, so does scrutiny of the major social media and tech companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google.</p><p>Early this year, Facebook`s CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg rejected the idea that the social network had been manipulated by Russia to alter the outcome of the election. By the end of the year, Facebook acknowledged Russian bots published fake news stories and pages that were seen by millions.</p><p>Twitter and Google both acknowledged they were infiltrated by Russian bank accounts too. On Twitter, more than 30,000 of those accounts were seen hundreds of millions of times.</p><p>Joining me now is California Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna. He represents parts of Silicon Valley. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us. We appreciate your time. I want to talk a little bit about tech and Silicon Valley and the changing way that Americans and lawmakers are perceiving tech. There seems to be a bipartisan frustration with tech.</p><p>Democrats not trusting it now because of their involvement with the 2016 election or their infiltration during the 2016 election. Then other Republicans see it as just out of touch with America, this liberal part of the country. And then liberal op-ed pages interestingly are using words like, evil and not your friend, when it comes to big tech.</p><p>So as the person who represents a good portion of Silicon Valley, what is your response to those sorts of criticisms?</p><p><person><nameText>REP. RO KHANNA </nameText></person>(D), CALIFORNIA: Well, I think we have to some some nuance. First, these companies are still widely admired. I think Apple and Google have over 80 percent approval ratings and I`m reminded that in Congress, we got an 11 percent approval rating.</p><p>That said, look, they have to do better. There were mistakes that were made. They didn`t do enough to have third party verification. If someone goes on to your show and if I make a claim, it will be verified on social media. There were no mechanisms to verify it. And they didn`t do enough in disclosing where some of these ads were coming from.</p><p>So I do think the social media companies, tech companies, need to be more transparent, need to acknowledge that mistakes were made. But overall, I remain a technology optimist, and I think most Americans remain optimistic about technology.</p><p>TUR: Are you confident the tech companies are taking the steps they need in order to secure their databases, secure their platforms in time for 2018?</p><p>KHANNA: I think they have started. I think it would be wrong to say that they have solved the problem. These are very difficult problems. Even if they hire thousands of more people to do reviews, there`s going to be a need for better machine learning, better artificial intelligence to be able to review the millions of possible people who use social media, and that`s a conversation we need to have.</p><p>I also think and I suggested this before. They need to hire a lot of journalists and people from journalism schools to say, what are the social media standards? How can we make sure something doesn`t happen like what happened in the Roy Moore case, where a woman went on Twitter or a person and said that The Washington Post paid her.</p><p>It turned out to be wrong but that story was tweeted and re-tweeted and could have influenced people`s voting decision. They need to find a way to make sure that that is removed from those platforms.</p><p>TUR: Tech companies and leaders of tech companies, Mark Zuckerberg in particular, have changed their stories a number of times since the election. Initially, Zuckerberg was laughing it off, saying in now way it could have interfered in the election or had any sort of influence.</p><p>That story obviously changed quite a bit. And given that we`re running up to 2018, 2020 is on the horizon as well, and there`s still should be a lot more done by tech companies. Do you think there`s time -- it`s time for more scrutiny potentially oversight or regulation on the part of Congress on to tech?</p><p>KHANNA: I do, but I don`t think it is one of grandstanding of just asking a question to make it on to the evening news. I think it has to be collaboration, and these tech companies have to realize.</p><p>They claim that they helped to bring on the Arab spring and they claim that people like Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders benefited from social media and there`s no question that they did, but they can`t say that they are changing the world with social media and then not acknowledge the negative impacts.</p><p>The fact that they amplify those platforms hate speech. The fact that they have led to false propaganda on those platforms. And I think what would be great is if we tone down the rhetoric, if tech leaders on their part were more transparent to come to the media, answer the tough questions, be open and honest that it`s a new technology that has mistakes.</p><p>And politicians should really learn the technology and try to be collaborative on how to solve the problems. That may involve more regulation, but it also just involves a conversation about what type of technology is needed to solve some of these problems.</p><p>TUR: Isn`t it going to be difficult, though, for Congress to figure out a way to regulate or even to work with companies on this? Do many folks in Congress understand how these platforms work? Do many members of Congress know how to code?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KHANNA: Well, I think that Congress could learn a little bit more. They should come out to the Valley and learn what is possible. I mean, for example, some people called for net neutrality for tech companies, not just for internet service providers.</p><p>What does that mean? Does that mean that Amazon should be required to sell every product in the world, or that every website should have an alternative perspective? So I do think there has to be more knowledge about the conversation.</p><p>And there has to be one other central point, which is when I go to places like Ohio, Youngstown which Tim Ryan represents, or Paintsville, Kentucky which Hal Rogers, a Republican represents, he calls Paintsville \"Silicon Holler\" and people there, they are hungry for technology to come to their communities, to have new tech jobs.</p><p>And Silicon Valley has a responsibility to make sure that some of these jobs are placed in other parts of the country. And I think Congress has a responsibility to understand the benefits of technology as well and how to take advantage of that.</p><p>TUR: Remember, democratic voters are for the beginning of impeachment proceedings against President Trump, 2018 is a big election and there`s a lot of talk about whether or not Democrats should run on impeachment. What do you think?</p><p>KHANNA: I think that would be a mistake. And here is what I say to my colleagues, Democrats, who want to push for impeachment. I say imagine if there was a Republican who said, I don`t care what Bob Mueller finds. I don`t care if the president was bribed. I`m never going to vote for impeachment.</p><p>We find that totally unreasonable. We would say, what about the evidence? Well, how can we say, we`re for impeachment before we even know the Mueller investigation or the outcome? We should wait to see what the evidence is, or we`re being equally biased.</p><p>And I also think that the Democrats, we`ve got to learn the lesson, one of the lessons of this last election. People were upset at all of us in positions of responsibility. They felt their lives weren`t being taken into consideration, that a lot of the job creation, the wealth creation was on the coast.</p><p>And we`ve got to figure out how do we connect, how do we assure people who are left behind that we have a vision for them. Everyone is capable of having an opinion about <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>There`s nothing I can say today that`s probably going to change someone`s mind about <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>But I do think what I can say and what Democrats can say may give them more confidence that we actually have a plan to solve their problems, and my belief is that should be the focus.</p><p>TUR: Congressman Ro Khanna, good to see you. Thanks so much for coming.</p><p>KHANNA: Thanks, Katy, for having me on.</p><p>TUR: Happy new year. Ahead, remembering the lives we lost, an unforgettable year for politics.</p><p>TUR: Welcome back. As we look ahead to the new year, we also want to take a moment to look back at some of the people in politics, the media, and culture who we lost in 2017.</p><p>(START VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINKKI, FORMER DIPLOMAT AND POLITICAL SCIENTIST: We no longer live in an age in which peace and war can sharpen to differentiate it.</p><p>JOHN ANDERSON, FORMER UNITED STATES CONGRESSMAN: There is a third way, and I represent that third approach for the American voter.</p><p>ROGER AILES, FORMER TELEVISION PRODUCER: The American people didn`t want to be told what to think about the information they were receiving.

It was something to behold.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TUR: Welcome back. It`s time for \"The Lid.\" The panel is here. Eddie Glaude, Susan Del Percio, Gabe Debenedetti. Let`s start with the stories that did not get enough attention in 2017. We`ve been hyper-focused on <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>Eddie, what do you think didn`t rise to the surface the way it should have?</p><p>EDDIE GLAUDE, PROFESSOR, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY: I want to lift up the name of Casey Marquez and Francisco Fernandez, two high school students at Aztec High School who were shot and killed in a mass shooting. We didn`t talk enough about what happened in New Mexico at that high school.</p><p>And it`s at a time time when we needed to have a discussion about gun control, a time that we needed to have a discussion about mass shooting. The data that you put up earlier about what was on voters` mind, right? Here we have these babies in a high school. They were killed.</p><p>And then this extraordinarily heroic substitute teacher who had the presence of mind to put a sofa in front of the door. And so (INAUDIBLE) burst through door and only could shoot randomly. We had no discussion about it. Why? Because we were paying attention to the P.T. Barnum of American politics, <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>TUR: Even the mass shootings that did get a lot of focus, Las Vegas and the one down in Texas, they were here and then they were gone in a second. And we kept hearing from lawmakers about how now is not the time to talk about gun control and talk about guns.</p><p>Chuck had, you know, his take on that that went viral, as it should have. When is the time to talk about it if it is not right after it happened? Are we ever really going to talk seriously about gun control?</p><p>SUSAN DEL PERCIO, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: The only gun legislation that went through was reciprocity to go state lines with concealed weapons. I mean, not one thing was done after all of that.</p><p>GLAUDE: Couldn`t even get the bump.</p><p>DEL PERCIO: Exactly.</p><p>GABRIEL DEBENEDETTI, POLITICAL REPORTER, POLITICO: To your point, I don`t know what has to happen in this country for people to talk about this in a serious way.</p><p>TUR: I don`t know. We had 22 kindergartners killed a few years ago and that wasn`t enough.</p><p>DEBENEDETTI: But we keep breaking the record for the biggest mass shooting in American history over and over and over. And it`s not just, but it happens so frequently at this point that we become totally numb to it.</p><p>TUR: So is that the way to cover it or to not cover it, because we`ve decided as a country that it is not important to us? We are not going to change things? We are not going to change our legislation because we`re not doing that?</p><p>Is it a story that`s worthy of the coverage any longer? Is that a discussion that needs to be add? If we`re going to accept it as a society, which we clearly are, because nothing is changing, do you cover it that way?</p><p>DEBENEDETTI: We should not accept that we`re accepting it as a society to begin with. I can think of few things more newsworthy than the murder of innocent Americans, but we should have --</p><p>TUR: More disgusting than the murder of innocent Americans.</p><p>DEBENEDETTI: Of course.</p><p>DEL PERCIO: Until the voters start holding their elected officials accountable on it, then it`s really not -- we can cover it as we should cover it, but it won`t change until --</p><p>TUR: Until the voters who are single issue voters for gun control. Single issue voters for changing the gun laws and doing something about them rather than the voters who are single issue voters for not touching gun --</p><p>DEL PERCIO: And also because some of big gun safety lobbyists, if you will, they`re not focusing on moderate Republicans. They`re actually not going after the districts where you can make a difference. They`re more or less building up their support where they have it. They need to learn how to communicate with voters in a different way.</p><p>They need to reach out across the party line, not just keep going back to the traditional base of support and say and hold accountable and spend tens of millions of dollars that people do on political campaigns and doing super PACs for or against a county on this issue against a particular member of the House or Senate.</p><p>TUR: Gabe, yours was cities pushing back on the Paris climate accord. We only have a little bit of time.</p><p>DEBENEDETTI: My point is simply that for all the attention that was paid to the president to setting to pull out of this accord, you have cities, states, corporations essentially standing up and saying, you may not want to abide by these regulations, Mr. President, but we`re going to.</p><p>So that`s an enormous step that has been taken by a number of local governments and corporations all over the country and it is something that people need to be paying closer attention to.</p><p>TUR: Susan, the appointment of federal judges.</p><p>DEL PERCIO: Appointment of federal judges. Neil Gorsuch was huge to Supreme Court but more importantly 12 federal appointed judges, most with life-time appointments totally changing the face of our judiciary for decades to come, not just the term of one president, but decades. Talk about a deep state. That may be it.</p><p>TUR: Stories that did not get covered in 2017, but stories, I think, that will still be relevant and might get another, unfortunately, if we`re talking about guns, another round in 2018 and the years to come, sadly for us. Guys, thank you so much and happy new year.</p><p>DEBENEDETTI: Happy new year.</p><p>DEL PERCIO: Happy new year.</p><p>GLAUDE: I want to say quickly, I wish Erica Garner, she is on her death bed. I just wish her well. She is the daughter of Eric Garner who was killed in New York.</p><p>TUR: Eddie, thank you very much. Susan, thank you as well. Gabe, thank you.</p><p>DEBENEDETTI: Thank you.</p><p>TUR: Coming up, ahead, lights, camera, distraction.</p><p>TUR: In case you missed it, you never know what you will see on live TV. Maybe something extinct.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hey, we`re really confused about this. Is this kind of confusion far for the course any time you make big changes to the tax law like this?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TUR: No, not our chief White House correspondent Hallie Jackson. She`s not extinct. But this was her this morning in the foreground, at least. In the background, your run-of-the-mill marauding band of dinosaurs. Clearly up to no good. Good news though, they kept their distance chewing the scenery, but nothing else. Hallie handled the distraction like a pro, tweeting, at least it wasn`t gators.</p><p>Now, as a rule, we don`t encourage cameos in our live shots from any species, but every so often you have to give it up for creativity. So I say this to our prehistoric (INAUDIBLE), give yourselves a round of applause with your tiny little hands.</p><p>That`s all for tonight.

If it`s Friday, the frontrunner speaks.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>TODD: Good evening. I`m Chuck Todd here in Washington. Welcome to MEET THE PRESS DAILY. As always, we have a big one for you tonight, especially for a Friday night. You are looking at live pictures of the president at the border where he is about to tour a section of renovated wall. We are going to get to his border visit and his latest threats in just a moment. You won`t believe just how many threats he has made just about the border, frankly just in the last few months.</p><p>We`ll begin tonight with the Democratic frontrunner, Joe Biden, speaking to reporters at length for the first time this calendar year. Boy, he had a lot to say about everything from those allegations of inappropriate physical contact to his view of the Democratic Party, Donald Trump, and a lot more.</p><p>Biden`s actual speech to the electrical workers union and his back and forth with reporters was in some ways his first campaign event, because he has made it clear, he is running. There is no thinking about it anymore. We also saw Biden`s biggest challenge on full display, how he addresses concern that he`s out of touch with this Democratic Party.</p><p>On that front, Biden was defiant. He took a clear shot at the progressive wing of the party. He seemed to put folks like AOC on notice. He joked twice about the allegations facing him. He responded to President Trump`s taunts. Perhaps the most revealing thing we saw from Biden this afternoon was a steadfast belief that this is still the Obama-Biden Democratic Party.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The vast majority of the members of the Democratic Party are still basically liberal moderate Democrats in the traditional sense.</p><p>The definition of progressive now seems to be changing. Are you a socialist? Well, that`s a real progressive. Or you believe in, you know, whatever. The idea all of the sudden the Democratic Party woke up and, you know, everybody asked what kind of Democrat -- I`m an Obama-Biden Democrat, man. I`m proud of it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: Joining me now is Michigan Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Dingell. She says she has talked to Biden`s team regularly through this pre-campaign period, and is a long-time friend of the vice president. With me is also tonight`s panel: Geoff Bennett, he is an NBC News White House correspondent; Leigh Ann Caldwell, NBC News Capitol Hill reporter; Michael Gerson, one of the more thoughtful (ph) columnists for The Washington Post.</p><p>Congresswoman, let me start with you. You heard Joe Biden`s remarks today. I`m curious. Do you believe he is right that the Democratic Party is still the Obama-Biden Democratic Party, or is he sounding like someone who`s hoping it is still the Obama-Biden Democratic Party?</p><p>REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN: OK. I`m from the Midwest. I`m going to tell you -- I told you for three years -- three years ago now that President Trump could become president because he listened to people in the Midwest. He talked about economic issues. He talked about issues that mattered to working people.</p><p>I`m going to tell you now President Trump could win re-election if we don`t nominate the right candidate. Obama-Biden party, I think it`s a party of working men and women that want somebody to care about them that are going to talk about those issues that matter to families across this country.</p><p>TODD: It does seem as if, congresswoman, that this issue, the specific debate about the personal space issue with the vice president is more symbolic of this larger question, is he 21st century enough for this Democratic Party? How would you answer that question?</p><p>DINGELL: Well, I think he`s acknowledged that he had a problem. I don`t even call it a problem. He got in people`s space. I think any person, man or woman, needs to tell somebody when they make them feel uncomfortable.</p><p>I think the challenge right now on this particular subject is how do you address the \"Me Too\" movement and sexual harassment which is very real and lord knows I have experienced it in my career, but how do you make sure you respect people, don`t get in their space, but keep compassion?</p><p>Joe Biden`s strength is his ability to connect with people, the empathy that he has. He`s gone through a lot of difficult things in life and he connects with people.</p><p>TODD: I want to play for you -- he joked about it today and not everybody was comfortable with him joking about it. Let me play the two pieces of sound where he joked about this issue of personal space.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN: I just want you to know I had permission to hug Lonnie.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BIDEN: And you guys can sit on the edge. I don`t want you to have to stand all along but -- by the way, he gave me permission to touch him.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: Was it too soon, congresswoman?</p><p>DINGELL: You know it`s his first public event. I`m not going to judge him on it or not on it. The crowd reacted. You know, Joe Biden is Joe Biden. If he runs for president, he`s going to win because he is Joe Biden. He`s got to respect people`s space. He`s got to understand that there are some people -- and he`s acknowledged it -- that don`t like it but his strength is his empathy.</p><p>TODD: All right. I`m going to bring in the panel here a little bit. Geoff, what do you see here? How is he handling this?</p><p>GEOFF BENNETT, NBC NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Clearly his staff thought his attempts at humor today were a miscalculation because they had Joe Biden come out and speak to the press right after to do some clean-up work.</p><p>TODD: You feel as if -- we were told he wasn`t going to talk to the press.</p><p>BENNETT: Right.</p><p>TODD: So, this -- you do get the sense this was done for clean-up.</p><p>BENNETT: Absolutely. But on the other side of this, I think Democrats and not so much Democrats but progressives, liberals, have to figure out, come to grips with what is an acceptable level of their own political fragility because whoever emerges as the Democratic nominee is going to go against Donald Trump who has perfected the art of political shamelessness and who uses shamelessness in the public realm as a cudgel.</p><p>And as evidence of that, we saw him today when he was asked by reporters on the south lawn, the president was asked, was it appropriate for you to re- tweet the doctored video mocking Joe Biden? The president said people got a kick out of it. He felt justified in doing that. He`s been able to use that, we`ve seen for this last two years, to his political benefit.</p><p>TODD: Let me play a piece of that, Leigh Ann. Here it is. Number two, guys.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN: I made it clear that if I made anyone feel uncomfortable, I feel badly about that. That was never my intention, ever, ever, ever. I`m sorry I didn`t understand that. I`m not sorry for any of my intentions. I`m not sorry for anything that I have ever done. I have never been disrespectful intentionally to a man or a woman.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: Leigh Ann, I should bring up that both Lucy Flores, the original woman who came out, and -- she didn`t like the joking and she has already made it clear. Another person who came out didn`t like it either.</p><p>LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, NBC NEWS CAPITOL HILL REPORTER: Yeah. These women who have issues with this, for them, this joking was too soon. You also have to look at the audience. This was an IBEW union, probably mostly men who are in this audience, probably not the right place to make these jokes.</p><p>But also, this is also not only an issue of the \"Met Too\" movement because this is not sexual harassment or sexual assault. But this is also a generational issue. This brings into focus, is Joe Biden too old to run for president in this Democratic Party at this point?</p><p>MICHAEL GERSON, COLUMNIST, THE WASHINGTON POST: Well, I think you have to recognize that this is the flip side of his strengths --</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>GERSON: -- which is the ability to go in to a fire station, get out of the car and go to a fire station and relate to people. I think that is going to be after the Clinton nomination, the fire station test is going to have to be a test that`s applied in this circumstance.</p><p>TODD: Interesting.</p><p>GERSON: Yeah.</p><p>TODD: In that case, Joe Biden would pass the fire station test.</p><p>GERSON: Absolutely.</p><p>TODD: I want to go, congresswoman, and bring in his ideological back and forth that he had. I thought it was fascinating how he is trying to portray his ideology versus frankly what he views is what`s being called progressive. Let me play for you something. I`m curious what you think of it on the other side. Number four, guys.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN: The traditional judgments of whether or not you were a \"liberal,\" was whether or not -- what your positions on race were, on women, what your position on LGBT community, what is your position on civil liberties. I`ll stack my record on those things against anybody who`s ever run, who is running now or who will run.</p><p>I went into 65, 66, 67 races on the ground. I campaigned, I think, for virtually every one of the 41 people who won. Show me the really left, left, left wingers who beat a Republican, a Republican. So the idea of the Democratic Party sort of stood on its head. I don`t get it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: I thought he put the progressive left on notice calling them left, left, left wingers. Basically saying, hey, AOC, that`s nice that you beat a fellow Democrat. Your politics doesn`t beat Republicans.</p><p>DINGELL: You know, the issues that he mentioned in there have been important over the history of this country. We`ve got a lot of other issues, by the way. I mean, you know, I`m from Medicare for All. I don`t think anybody is going to call me left, left, left. But I`m co-chair of Medicare for All.</p><p>TODD: What does that mean, though? You want to scrap Obamacare?</p><p>DINGELL: I want universal health care. I think every American has a right to quality affordable health care.</p><p>TODD: Scrap Obamacare and do something else or use Obamacare and bill (ph) on it, because that`s a big difference between the two views on Medicare for All for what it`s worth.</p><p>DINGELL: I would like to go to universal health care and a single payer. I want to get there. The first universal health care was actually introduced in 1945. We got Medicare 20 years later. You got to have that vision. But at most, I`m going to tell you that the environment is a critical issue and how we talk about the issue.</p><p>President Obama is the one that said, you know, the highest and most stringent CAFE standard that we had in the history of this country. But at the same time, you have people that take CAFE again. It`s back. How do you make sure we are making more fuel efficient vehicles and protecting jobs? There are a lot of those issues that matter in the Midwest. And then you have real issues like pensions and issues that matter to working people. It`s complicated.</p><p>TODD: Geoff Bennett, I thought this was ironically the most important thing he said today, because this was the first time he was pretty defiant and drawing a line here, like, guys, I`m not a progressive. You`re not going to call me that. Because I view -- this is Biden -- I view progressive as some version of socialist Democrat. I`m not that.</p><p>BENNETT: Yeah. He said, I`m an Obama-Biden Democrat and I`m proud of it.</p><p>TODD: Yeah. I think we`re going to hear the words Obama-Biden --</p><p>BENNETT: Oh, sure.</p><p>TODD: -- Democrat from him --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD: -- over and over and over again. His first name may become Obama.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD: Former Vice President Obama-Biden.</p><p>BENNETT: I wouldn`t compare Donald Trump to Joe Biden in many ways. In this way, I think they are similar. The Republicans who have baked in all of their views about Donald Trump and love him come what may, there are Democrats who feel the same way about Joe Biden and the Obama-Biden halcyon years.</p><p>And so once we get past the dust-up with Joe Biden, I do think that he will -- whenever he announces will stay at the top of the pack because of those people who view him favorably and have viewed him favorably.</p><p>GERSON: It`s an important case here. You have perceived weaknesses on the other ideological side. There are two reactions. One is let`s get everything we always wanted, or let`s build a coalition that includes a different group of people.</p><p>TODD: Yeah.</p><p>GERSON: Those are different political tasks. Bill Clinton did the extension. Barack Obama, I think, extended. I don`t think you can run a presidential campaign by saying we are going to get everything we want.</p><p>TODD: Yeah.</p><p>CALDWELL: Joe Biden has run for president twice. He didn`t become the nominee twice. He`s leading the pack right now because he`s not in office. Of course there is this nostalgia. I think he has a huge challenge once he officially jumps in the race to stay there especially with so many fresh, new candidates. What might keep him at the top is the fractured --</p><p>TODD: Yeah.</p><p>CALDWELL: -- components of this.</p><p>TODD: Congresswoman, you are a historian of the Democratic Party. You`ve lived --</p><p>DINGELL: I`m not that old. I`m a little seasoned but not old.</p><p>TODD: No, you have been a witness like me. I`m not --</p><p>DINGELL: OK.</p><p>TODD: I was putting us together here.</p><p>DINGELL: OK.</p><p>TODD: In our lifetimes, OK, I`m going to give you the names of three Democrats who won the presidency and the last three who lost the presidency, and I want to ask who which one Joe Biden looks like. The last three successful presidential nominees on the Democratic side were Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. They were all outsiders. They were all the first-time candidates when they ran.</p><p>The last three nominees to lose were Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, and Al Gore. Very resume heavy. I look at this and I ask you, it`s like Joe Biden looks a lot like the ones that didn`t get there. Well, there are a lot of other candidates on this field that look a lot more like the Jimmy Carter model. What say you? What`s the better place to be?</p><p>DINGELL: First of all, it`s a lifetime between now and next year. And by the way, I don`t have a candidate. I have 20 friends running for president.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DINGELL: Let`s be real about this.</p><p>TODD: There are 22 running, so let me -- let me do the math. Which two you`re not friends with? I`m kidding. I`m kidding. Go ahead.</p><p>DINGELL: I know. But the fact of the matter is that he may benefit a little from the Trump factor which is -- we were just talking about it -- is that his base is strong. When you have that many candidates, you divide it up. The other fallacy I hear people say is he`s too old. Well, Bernie did really well in the last election. Young kids like Joe Biden, you know, a Democratic society represents all ages.</p><p>I think he`s going to appeal to the college campus. Some of the kids really like Joe Biden. Some of the kids really like Bernie Sanders. Some of the kids like Mayor Pete. Mayor Pete is doing really well right now. Is he a flash in the pan? So I think we have to get through a summer, see where people are in the fall. That`s the one thing when you are seasoned, not old, you know? It`s a lifetime in the next few months.</p><p>TODD: That`s for sure. Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, Democrat from Michigan, it is always interesting to get your point of view on this. Thanks for doing this today. Jeff, Leigh Ann, and Michael, you guys are sticking around.</p><p>Coming up, President Trump visits the border. How many threats is he making about walls, about the border, about Mexico? Oh, let us count the ways because we will, next.</p><p>TODD: Welcome back. The president just finished an event at the southern border where he showcased a border wall renovation project that was actually started on the Obama administration. His visit comes after he backed off threats to close the border which he replaced with threats to punish Mexico in other ways.</p><p>Moments ago, he seemed to put the threat about closing the border back on the table. The barrage of Mr. Trump`s various border-related threats are simply too many to count. But that didn`t stop us from trying. Oh yes, we had to do a scroll. As you can see, these are the various threats he has made.</p><p>You missed the build the wall, birth right citizenship, closing the entire border, parts of the border, habeas corpus. Don`t forget, he once appointed immigration czar in the name of Kris Kobach. Remember that one? Impose zero tolerance, withdraw from NAFTA, and levy new tariffs. Perhaps, the one that people forget, charge Mexico $100,000 per illegal immigrant, cancel all funds to sanctuary cities.</p><p>It seems the president is looking for ways to keep the story in the headlines. That is what is going on here which raises the question, is it a crisis he wants to go away, or is it a crisis he needs to stay at least politically?</p><p>Let`s bring back the panel here: Geoff Bennett, Leigh Ann Caldwell, and Michael Gerson. Michael, I want to start with you. It does feel as if whenever the president hits a political wall, so to speak, whether it`s Mueller, health care, whatever is in the moment, he gets to the political crutch of immigration because it is one thing that unites the party around him.</p><p>GERSON: Yeah. I think that`s true. But he did that in the midterms as his closing strategy. In fact, the closing strategy was to warn that the country was being invaded by a caravan of brown people that should be shot, he said.</p><p>TODD: It worked in Missouri Senate and Indiana Senate.</p><p>GERSON: Right. But it didn`t work more broadly.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>GERSON: And I think that he turns to this because it does unite his coalition to some extent and excite a portion of his coalition. But he`s going to have to get beyond those numbers in order to win in states in the Midwest and other places.</p><p>TODD: He doesn`t care about this. He`s told this all the time. You know, you ought to expand your palate here.</p><p>BENNETT: We know that he doesn`t care the party already lost dearly in the midterms. They lost 40-something seats in the House. They lost comfortably Republican districts.</p><p>TODD: Have you looked at the border states?</p><p>BENNETT: Right.</p><p>TODD: I mean he got smashed. It`s a wipe-out in New Mexico. They got a terrible night in Arizona, they held the governorship. And we all know what happened in Texas.</p><p>CALDWELL: Let`s admit that immigration was a big reason why they lost.</p><p>BENNETT: For sure. And we saw Mitch McConnell this past week even --</p><p>TODD: Claire McCaskill will tell you one of the reasons she lost was the caravan.</p><p>BENNETT: Yeah. Mitch McConnell this past week even said the president`s idea to shut down the border was a bad one. He said it would be an economic catastrophe for the country and on the border.</p><p>The problem with the kind of demagoguery the president engages in is that it doesn`t allow him to reposition, because anything less than what he`s doing now looks like he`s capitulating, so he comes up with all of these empty threats week after week, in the course of one week changing his position three times, but it`s because he started from the very beginning saying horrible things about brown people coming across the border.</p><p>TODD: Leigh Ann?</p><p>CALDWELL: The issue of immigration is doing exactly what Trump wants it to do. He`s forcing some Democrats, especially the presidential candidates, to talk about it. We have Castro who --</p><p>TODD: By the way, there is a problem on the border. Some of it, you could say he has helped create the problem, but we now have a larger asylum issue where our laws do feel out of date. But the question is who created this crisis.</p><p>CALDWELL: And there is no effort to try to solve the crisis. There are efforts to try to make it more -- to be more bombastic about it. But Castro came out with a policy this week that says, look, these people --</p><p>TODD: Julian Castro, the former San Antonio mayor, one of the candidates running for president?</p><p>CALDWELL: Yes, not the member of Congress.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>CALDWELL: He came out with a policy this week that said there was much more to the left than many other things that Democrats have been talking about regarding immigration, saying, let`s decriminalize the thing of crossing the border. And this is what Trump wants, to show that the Democratic Party is weak on immigration and wants open borders.</p><p>GERSON: I think one of the worst elements of this is that he is talking about cutting aide off to countries in the triangle.</p><p>TODD: Central American countries that Fox called Mexican countries.</p><p>GERSON: Right, exactly. The conditions in those countries are partially producing what we are seeing.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>GERSON: You can`t really confront these problems unless you confront the despair and hopelessness and illegality in these countries.</p><p>TODD: I want to remind people, Michael, you remember this, remember the Mexican peso crisis and the United States intervened. There were some -- well, one of the big reasons was help Mexico because if you didn`t, the economy would collapse and everybody would come over the border. That`s what`s happening in Central America.</p><p>GERSON: Yeah.</p><p>TODD: Does he not have any other issue he can go to anymore? Is this what it is or is this just his comfort zone?</p><p>BENNETT: Well, I mean, remember there were those two existential issues by which Republicans who even had misgivings about Donald Trump the man said they would get behind him on policy. One was immigration. The other is getting conservatives on the Supreme Court.</p><p>Well, until he could put another conservative on the Supreme Court, we keep dipping back in that well of immigration issues. His numbers of Republicans are fairly strong. It is like 89 percent approval rating among his base. Overall, it`s not moving the needle for him obviously.</p><p>CALDWELL: And trade is going to be much more difficult in the next year and a half for the president when he has no results yet on the issue and he has a bunch of Democratic people running for president who are to the left of him on trade.</p><p>TODD: What is interesting, he did have one presidential candidate on his mind today, and that was Joe Biden.</p><p>BENNETT: Yeah.</p><p>TODD: After Joe Biden gives the speech, he sent out a tweet, all those electrical workers are going to vote for me, which does tell me to go to connect or two conversations, as much hand wringing that the Democrats are having about Joe Biden, it`s so clear to me, Michael, that Donald Trump fears Joe Biden more than anybody else.</p><p>GERSON: He would much rather have that than -- much rather have a Sanders race than a Biden race.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>GERSON: I mean, clearly. I think there`s good reason that he holds these views.</p><p>TODD: Leigh Ann, you brought up who was in the room and how uncomfortable it might have been for him talking about the women, that they were the burly white guys --</p><p>CALDWELL: Yeah.</p><p>TODD: -- that the Democratic Party lost. Joe Biden says, I`m the candidate for those guys.</p><p>CALDWELL: Exactly. And the president, I think, you know, you talk to Republicans and you talk to Democrats. The talk is that the president in the White House does fear a Joe Biden candidacy the most. Obviously they know the most about Joe Biden. It`s going to be interesting to see how the other candidates do especially in the Midwest. But there`s also a lot of candidates who know that that is the critical demographic that they need and they are going to work for it.</p><p>TODD: Their path to re-election goes through the states that have a lot of people like IBEW members in it.</p><p>BENNETT: That`s right.</p><p>TODD: In Wisconsin. The way they view their calculation to 270 goes through those voters.</p><p>BENNETT: Absolutely. I have talked to people in the president`s orbit and they say the one candidate they fear is Joe Biden. Part of that is because they don`t necessarily know how to run against a Kamala Harris or even a Beto O`Rourke at this point.</p><p>TODD: I have to say that the contrast that is the hardest to figure out, like I have been trying to picture this -- Mayor Pete and Donald Trump.</p><p>BENNETT: Wow.</p><p>TODD: How about that contrast?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BENNETT: Good luck with that.</p><p>TODD: Fascinating. Panel, you guys are sticking around. Up ahead, unfriending social media. Our new poll shows most Americans think it is bad for us and it is driving us apart. Why can`t we give it up?</p><p>TODD: Welcome back. Tonight in \"2020 Vision,\" many of the Democratic presidential hopefuls made sure to make a stop this week at Reverend Al Sharpton`s National Action Network`s annual conference. It is a chance to make in-roads with the key Democratic voting block African-Americans. And for some candidates, they use it as an opportunity to address areas where they come under a bit of scrutiny.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D), VERMONT: We have a president today who is a racist, who is a sexist, who is a homophobe, who is a xenophobe.</p><p>TODD (voice-over): Bernie Sanders reinforced his campaign`s ongoing efforts to reach out to African-Americans because in 2016, he lost them by about 50 points to Hillary Clinton. Pete Buttigieg addressed recent criticism over his 2015 use of the phrase \"all lives matter\" which some say diminishes the Black Lives Matter movement.</p><p>MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG, SOUTH BEND, INDIANA: We assert what should go without saying but in these times must be said clearly and again and again that black lives matter.</p><p>TODD (voice-over): Kamala Harris, who has faced criticism over her tenure as California`s attorney general, touted her record on criminal justice.</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D), CALIFORNIA: You can look at my track record to know that`s what I would do because that`s what I did when I ran the California Department of Justice.</p><p>TODD (voice-over): And Beto O`Rourke, who has taken hits for being short on substance, was very direct when it came to supporting a bill to research reparations for the descendants of slaves.</p><p>BETO O`ROURKE, FORMER TEXAS REPRESENTATIVE: Absolutely I would sign that into law.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TODD: By the way, Bernie Sanders, John Hickenlooper, and Pete Buttigieg also agreed to sign the bill on reparations, joining Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Julian Castro, who have already said they would as well. We will be back with more MTP DAILY right after this.</p><p>TODD: Welcome back. If I were to tell you there is something out there that the majority of Americans believe is dividing our country, wasting our time and spreading lies, you probably want us to get rid of it. You probably demand the problem get fixed immediately. You might even want someone to declare a national emergency. But what if I told you that something is social media?</p><p>According to our latest NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll, 57 percent of Americans say social media is doing more to divide us than unite us. Eight- two percent say it does more to waste time than use our time well, 82 percent. And 55 percent say it does more to spread lies and falsehoods than news and information.</p><p>So are Americans ready to give up Facebook or Twitter or Instagram?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD: No. Sixty-nine percent, that`s right, nearly seven in 10 Americans say they still use social media at least once a day. They still use this toxic thing once a day. It is easy to recognize something may be bad for us. It is much harder to do something about it.</p><p>With me now is Tony Romm. He is an MSNBC contributor and a tech policy reporter for The Washington Post. He has been covering technology in tech companies for most of the past decade. Welcome.</p><p>TONY ROMM, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR, TECH POLICY REPORTER FOR THE WASHINGTON POST: Thanks for having me.</p><p>TODD: The thing that struck me the most here and as somebody who is absolutely a believer that social media has done more to destroy a lot of things that we have held near and dear to us, in our poll Americans did separate social media from technology. There`s been this perception that our anger at social media is engulfed in our anger or fear of technology. That wasn`t the case in our poll.</p><p>ROMM: Yeah, it`s much more nuanced than that. The business model suggests that Facebook and Google are much different than companies like Apple and Amazon in the ways that they make money and the kinds of products that they put out.</p><p>The numbers really track with the series of scandals that we saw over the better part of the past year. Facebook sort of leads the way in terms of generating bad headlines. We saw a number of incidents in which they misused people`s private information. A number of cases in which Facebook hasn`t really been held to account for some of those misuses here in the nation`s capital.</p><p>And so I think that`s reflected in the fact that people are very unhappy with these companies, social media companies, and what happens to their information.</p><p>TODD: We did ask some favorable ratings of the social media companies. I want to put them up. It was interesting here. It certainly was more negative for Twitter and Facebook as you`ll see here. But Google is still basically 3-1, 4-1 here. Sixty-three positive, just 13 negative. Facebook and Twitter were more sort of dead-even and polarizing.</p><p>So, as much as we don`t like social media, it`s not total anger yet. It`s like we know smoking is bad but we don`t hate Marlboro yet.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD: You know type of thing.</p><p>ROMM: Yeah. The addiction is an interesting one here because it is reflected in the fact that people --</p><p>TODD: This feels like an addiction issue.</p><p>ROMM: And some people would say there are experts out there now who are really thinking critically about the incentives that are baked into some of these platforms like Facebook that keep us coming back for more, that keep us logging on and surrendering our personal information.</p><p>TODD: That`s their business model, though.</p><p>ROMM: Yeah. These companies don`t make money unless they have some of that data.</p><p>TODD: They are trying to keep you there. So the whole goal is to keep you there. Then of course, it`s an addiction.</p><p>ROMM: At some level, they don`t have to do very much. Remember --</p><p>TODD: Digital nicotine.</p><p>ROMM: The reason that Facebook is as big as it is right now among many reasons is that all your friends are on there and so you want to be in the place where your friends are. And so that`s also why in some cases it is very hard to quit from these services, because you`re missing out on the things that your friends are saying and the things your friends are sharing.</p><p>TODD: One other thing we saw in here is that they don`t think the federal government is doing enough to have oversight over the media, 54 percent are not satisfied and 36 percent are satisfied. What was interesting is Mark Zuckerberg is suddenly down at 180. He went from not saying it is a problem to not saying they`re going to be -- you know, care about privacy and he`s on a bit of a media tour. Here he is on ABC yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: The current laws around what is political advertising don`t consider discussing issues to be political. It`s not clear to me that we want a private company to be making that kind of fundamental decision about what is political speech and how should that be regulated. That seems like something there should be a more Democratic process over.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: This frustrates me because Mark Zuckerberg is basically claiming that he does not have a responsibility that you at The Washington Post and I at MSNBC News have. It just drives me batty. We are private companies. We do face regulatory responsibility.</p><p>We do have a responsibility not to proactively, you know, for instance, if that killing video had been here, NBC would have been held accountable by the federal government. So, I feel like he continues to want to believe he doesn`t run a media company.</p><p>ROMM: Yeah. That 180 you`re talking about though is because Facebook has no choice here. We have lawmakers around the country who are talking about these things including liability and whether these companies which have long been protected from that liability are relic of the days when internet companies were much smaller than they are now should continue to have a legal shield. In fact, there will be a hearing on this in the Senate just next week.</p><p>But we even have a 2020 candidates talking about these things which we hadn`t heard before. Elizabeth Warren is out there talking about breaking up big tech companies. Amy Klobuchar is one of the bigger voices when it comes to political ads that Zuckerberg talked about in that clip. So the interest among lawmakers is certainly much more heightened than it used to be. It`s even something on the campaign trail. We didn`t see that in previous campaign cycles.</p><p>TODD: To go back to the addiction metaphor, 1964 is when the surgeon general came out and said smoking was bad for us. You can make an argument it essentially took us a generation to agree, right? It really wasn`t until the 90s that suddenly, oh, yeah, we shouldn`t have smoking sections in restaurants, smoking sections on airplanes, things like that.</p><p>This to me feels like the country now knows social media is bad but we`re addicted to it. Is it fixable or do we just kick the habit and it just takes a generation?</p><p>ROMM: We have had some of the same warnings here. We have been warned by the government about privacy and what happens when you surrender your data. We have been warned by report after report about disinformation on line and the effect that Russian agents and other digital factors have on our conversations about politics.</p><p>And now it is the question of what do we do. And there have been many efforts on Capitol Hill over the better part of the past few years that have intensified recently that just haven`t gone anywhere. We don`t have a federal overarching privacy law. We don`t have something that says that every time Facebook makes a mistake on privacy, it is going to face tough fines. And so this is the question that is being put to Congress right now. Are they willing to turn that angst into something like regulation?</p><p>TODD: Let me ask you this. What -- I`ve been surprised I haven`t heard somebody say we should have a privacy bill of rights.</p><p>ROMM: Uh-hmm.</p><p>TODD: Right? I heard some chatter. What would that look like? Is that like truth in algorithms? What does it look like that the average Joe and Jane can understand?</p><p>ROMM: Yeah. This has taken many forms over the year. President Obama back at the time was talking about a privacy bill of rights. It went nowhere. The idea was put out. He said that folks should know what`s collected about them.</p><p>TODD: I feel like the Europeans are doing more to protect your privacy and my privacy than the Americans.</p><p>ROMM: Yeah. They are the world`s privacy cops right now. They have the tough laws in the book that say you must give people choice over what happens to your data. If you don`t, we`re going to hit you with huge fines as a result of that. We have seen companies like Facebook and Google face investigations. But here, the situation is much, much different.</p><p>TODD: How much more complicated though is it by our First Amendment?</p><p>ROMM: Well, it depends what you are talking about. With privacy, it is not in a lot of cases. Giving people the ability to know what`s collected about them and say yes or no in response to that data collection isn`t something that is immediately implicated by the First Amendment.</p><p>When you talking about things like the terrible things that folks like share on social media like hate speech, racism, things of that sort, the New Zealand video that you mentioned --</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>ROMM: -- that`s where things are complicated. That is why you have seen Australia, the United Kingdom, other countries looking at content restrictions when the U.S. isn`t so much.</p><p>TODD: And obviously if they do, that might have more impact than anything we do here. Tony Romm, great conversation.</p><p>ROMM: Thank you for having me.</p><p>TODD: Nice to have you on. Much appreciate it. Up ahead, I`m obsessed with why it is the best of times and the worst of times. That`s at least according to President Trump. We`ll be right back.</p><p>TODD: Welcome back. Tonight, I`m obsessed with the president`s position on the economy. It`s the best.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The economy is roaring.</p><p>We have the strongest economy. So strong.</p><p>Stronger that it has even been before.</p><p>Strongest economy perhaps ever.</p><p>The best economy.</p><p>The great economy.</p><p>The greatest economy.</p><p>The hottest place economically anywhere in the world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: In fact, it`s so good he says we need to do something that is only necessary when the economy is bad.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Well, I personally think the Fed should drop rates. I think they really slowed us down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: I`m very confused. According to the president, lowering interest rates is good for the economy but guess who disagrees? A guy named Donald Trump. \"The Fed`s reckless policies of low interest and flooding the market with dollars need to be stopped.\"</p><p>Wait, that tweet was from 2011. So 2011 Trump and 2019 Trump are at loggerheads. Why could that be? Could it be because the Fed rate hikes so far have cost the president a lot of money? Like more than $5 million a year personally? Because he took out those business loans between 2012 and 2015, which came after he sent that tweet slamming low interest rates? You might say it`s all about changing his views to whatever benefits him best in the moment. I guess really who`s to say?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The Electoral College is genius.</p><p>I have never really been in favor of it, but now I appreciate it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: Welcome back. Time for \"The Lid.\" The panel is back: Geoff, Leigh Ann, and Michael. Geoff, I got to ask you quickly, I don`t want to get bogged down on this Fed stuff --</p><p>GEOFF BENNETT, NBC NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yeah.</p><p>TODD: But to hear the president even use the phrase quantitative easy, I`m sure Ben Bernanke was probably listening, you know, going -- what are you talking about? We are not going back to that again.</p><p>BENNETT: Yeah, my ears perked up, too.</p><p>TODD: The president is looking for a scapegoat for a softening economy that`s inevitable.</p><p>BENNETT: Right.</p><p>TODD: It seems pretty clear to me he wants to point the blame somewhere else.</p><p>BENNETT: He does. And yet, you know, as we know, he`s nominated Stephen Moore and Herman Cain to sit on the board whereas he got rid of Janet Yellen because apparently she didn`t look the part.</p><p>TODD: Yellen would have kept interest rates lower.</p><p>BENNETT: Exactly. Exactly. Explain that.</p><p>MICHAEL GERSON, COLUMNIST, THE WASHINGTON POST: To look if part of a member of the Fed, you have to be boring. These guys aren`t boring.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD: That`s the irony here. Janet Yellen would be giving him the Fed policy he wants right now.</p><p>GERSON: I think that`s right.</p><p>TODD: Leigh Ann, Herman Cain and Stephen Moore, you`re on Capitol Hill.</p><p>LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, NBC NEWS CAPITOL HILL REPORTER: Mm-hmm.</p><p>TODD: Republicans have seemed to be falling in line on some of these borderline nominees.</p><p>CALDWELL: Mm-hmm.</p><p>TODD: They complain about it. They get cranky about it. But when it gets to committee, they all seem to fall in line.</p><p>CALDWELL: Yeah.</p><p>TODD: Will that happen here?</p><p>CALDWELL: I think so.</p><p>TODD: Both of them? Or do you think one of them? Michael thinks Herman Cain is a bridge too far.</p><p>CALDWELL: Well, I think it is going to depend on what comes out about these two. I mean, we already know --</p><p>TODD: We know a lot about them. Herman Cain got driven out of a race because of sexual harassment --</p><p>CALDWELL: Yes. Sexual harassment, yes.</p><p>TODD: -- allegations.</p><p>CALDWELL: Yes, allegations. But then -- and then Stephen Moore has this debts to the IRS, $75,000, I believe. So it`s not looking good.</p><p>TODD: Mm-hmm.</p><p>CALDWELL: But I think that if they can get past this storm and there is nothing else that comes out, we already know about Herman Cain. I mean, Purdue in Georgia knows Herman Cain very well. I know he -- he comes out --</p><p>TODD: That`s Georgia. That`s kind of a home state thing.</p><p>CALDWELL: Yeah. But still, I think that is this a hill the Republicans are going to die on?</p><p>TODD: Mitt Romney seemed to mock it. He says they`ll make the rates 999. He actually joked about it.</p><p>GERSON: I think when you look at it, Republicans object. They don`t object the things like the demonization of migrants. But they do object the things like monetary policy.</p><p>BENNETT: Yeah.</p><p>GERSON: That says something. I think they will object.</p><p>BENNETT: And there have been instances when there are certain nominees where the kind of job matters. So for instance when the president nominated Ronny Jackson to be the head of V.A., there are Republicans who said, no, not the V.A. We`re not playing that game.</p><p>TODD: But Fed governors.</p><p>BENNETT: Exactly.</p><p>TODD: I talked to a former Fed chair who said one or two governors can`t really ruin policy.</p><p>BENNETT: Right.</p><p>CALDWELL: Yeah.</p><p>TODD: But four or five might over time.</p><p>CALDWELL: But Stephen Moore has been out there several weeks now and no Republican has really come out strongly against him yet. I don`t --</p><p>TODD: He`s been on both sides of every economic issue.</p><p>BENNETT: There was one Republican on the Hill who privately said when it comes to this kind of nominees you don`t want names of people you have seen on Fox News. Those aren`t the guys you want for the Fed.</p><p>TODD: I want to go to social media. Michael, I was heartened by the fact that the public has separated social media from technology, because I think there`s been this fear that we`re so angry with social media we`re afraid of technology. That`s not the case. Americans love advancement and I think correctly have realized social media is not one of the advancements.</p><p>GERSON: I think it has both isolated people in a weird way but then turned our discourse into a battleground at the same time. So yeah, I think people are suspicious of social media. They use it but they`re not sure about it.</p><p>TODD: What does that mean for the election going forward? Does that mean the public might be more suspicious of what they read on line? I mean, is this the -- look, I agree we`re not going to kick the habit today, but at least we know.</p><p>CALDWELL: Yeah, I think people don`t like social media but they are addicted to it, and I don`t think that they are not going engage in it. I think the candidates are going to use every tool they have on social media to advance their message. Look at AOC. She is a social media star and she uses that platform very effectively.</p><p>And while we might not love social media, we know that it makes us twitch sometimes and we get frustrated with it. But I don`t see anything changing in this next cycle.</p><p>BENNETT: Yeah, I think you`re right. I think we as journalists see using Twitter as a work hazard, right? I mean, how many times you follow journalists on Twitter who say, you know, today on Twitter it is a cesspool, but yet it is so enmeshed in our daily lives, certainly in our political lives, and even with all of the --</p><p>TODD: My favorite hate tweets were, you needed a poll to find out that people hate social media.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD: Typical social media, right? Like thanks for actually proving what we already know. I guess the question though is what is the right role of government here? Because -- look, Facebook, it angers me that Facebook is not held accountable the way we here at MSNBC are held accountable in what is aired on our platform.</p><p>We could get fined by the FCC. Facebook has been protected away from that. That said, I don`t know what the right policy answer is on this, and I don`t think lawmakers do either.</p><p>GERSON: I think the answer here is to have public pressure, not to have governmental action. I think it is more likely to get real results. There has been to some extent. They`ve responded.</p><p>TODD: Facebook does seem more nervous about -- they saw the stats. People did delete their Facebook accounts in a significant enough numbers that they at least now claim to care about privacy.</p><p>CALDWELL: I don`t think Congress knows what to do yet. I think part of that problem is that the Senate especially, it is an older body. I don`t think they totally get it. And social media is years ahead of where Congress is thinking on this.</p><p>They`re trying but then you have all the cyber security components of it that they`re trying to get ahead of, which they`re also behind on. Technology is a constant battle for Congress. We are seeing it in the social media.</p><p>BENNETT: That`s the big challenge. Any policy solution would be inherently reactive, not forward looking.</p><p>CALDWELL: Right.</p><p>BENNETT: And so any law that gets past would probably answer a problem that we had five years ago.</p><p>GERSON: The problem is not just the excess. That is the difficulty here. When you reduce a presidential campaign to a Twitter campaign as Trump did, you`re actually shrinking the discourse in a way that people used to give large policy speeches. He didn`t give a single one during the campaign. It is actually lighter on substance --</p><p>TODD: I think he spent all of like two nights outside of either Mar-a-Lago or New York. He didn`t even like spend the night in another state that he was campaigning in. Geoff, before I go, the president is ending his day in Beverly Hills.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD: I`m sorry. He declared a national emergency and wants to go to the border. Do they at all acknowledge the bad optics of that?</p><p>BENNETT: No, they don`t. They don`t care. I mean, that`s the short answer. They don`t care.</p><p>TODD: Imagine what Hannity would say if President Obama went from the border to Beverly Hills.</p><p>BENNETT: It would be breaking news report.</p><p>TODD: All right. Geoff, Leigh Ann, and Michael, thank you very much. Up ahead, Pete and repeat.</p><p>TODD: Well, in case you missed it, the South Bend mayor, Pete Buttigieg, is apparently a jack of many trades. For starter, he was a Rhode scholar. He served in Afghanistan as a naval intel officer. And he says he speaks eight languages.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: (UNTRANSLATED).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: He`s also a skilled piano player. In fact, he is so good he can hold his own with singer Ben Folds. Ben Folds Six. But he could also secretly be an NBA coach? Seriously, folks, the Celtics are coached by this man. He claims his name is Brad Stevens. But take another look. You have to wonder. Has anyone ever seen Brad Stevens and Pete Buttigieg in the same room at the same time in the same Boston garden? Me thinks not.</p><p>And honestly, wouldn`t it explain why the Celtics are sitting at just fourth place at the Eastern Conference this year? The coach has been busy running a city and running for president. They were supposed to be number one in the Eastern Conference with no Lebron and they haven`t been. That`s what happens if you have too many jobs.</p><p>We`ll just have to leave it to you to decide. Is it Stevens or Buttigieg? But one of those two men will be joining me this weekend. Utah Senator Mitt Romney will also be here. Don`t miss it. Fascinating show, Buttigieg and Romney, because if it`s Sunday, it`s MEET THE PRESS.</p><p>That`s all we have for tonight. We`ll be back Monday with more MEET THE PRESS daily.</p><p>And \"THE BEAT\" with Yasmin Vossoughian, who`s in for Ari, starts right now.</p><p>Good evening, Yasmin.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MSNBC-2019040501cb454</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MSNBC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VTP-VRR1-DXH2-652B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257765</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7883\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019  ASC Services II Media, LLC<br/>All Rights Reserved<br/></copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 MSNBC</copyright><publicationName>MSNBC</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 5, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Joe Biden</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democratic Party</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Presidential Candidates</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Border Visit</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democrats</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Presidential Election 2020</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>National Action Network Conference</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Poll</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Federal Reserve</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Herman Cain</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stephen Moore</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Pete Buttigieg</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Brad Stevens</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

I`m Nicolle Wallace. Thank you so much for watching. \"MTP DAILY\" starts right now. I`m sorry, Chuck Todd.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHUCK TODD, MSNBC HOST:  It`s OK.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(LAUGHTER)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TODD:  Just remember, Donald Trump has lived his whole life in search of cheap credit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WALLACE:  That`s right. And Shuckey Duckey.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TODD:  So, why should he change now?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD:  Thank you, Nicolle. If it`s Friday, the frontrunner speaks.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>TODD:  Good evening. I`m Chuck Todd here in Washington. Welcome to MEET THE PRESS DAILY. As always, we have a big one for you tonight, especially for a Friday night. You are looking at live pictures of the president at the border where he is about to tour a section of renovated wall. We are going to get to his border visit and his latest threats in just a moment. You won`t believe just how many threats he has made just about the border, frankly just in the last few months.</p><p>We`ll begin tonight with the Democratic frontrunner, Joe Biden, speaking to reporters at length for the first time this calendar year. Boy, he had a lot to say about everything from those allegations of inappropriate physical contact to his view of the Democratic Party, Donald Trump, and a lot more.</p><p>Biden`s actual speech to the electrical workers union and his back and forth with reporters was in some ways his first campaign event, because he has made it clear, he is running. There is no thinking about it anymore. We also saw Biden`s biggest challenge on full display, how he addresses concern that he`s out of touch with this Democratic Party.</p><p>On that front, Biden was defiant. He took a clear shot at the progressive wing of the party. He seemed to put folks like AOC on notice. He joked twice about the allegations facing him. He responded to President Trump`s taunts. Perhaps the most revealing thing we saw from Biden this afternoon was a steadfast belief that this is still the Obama-Biden Democratic Party.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The vast majority of the members of the Democratic Party are still basically liberal moderate Democrats in the traditional sense.</p><p>The definition of progressive now seems to be changing. Are you a socialist? Well, that`s a real progressive. Or you believe in, you know, whatever. The idea all of the sudden the Democratic Party woke up and, you know, everybody asked what kind of Democrat -- I`m an Obama-Biden Democrat, man. I`m proud of it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD:  Joining me now is Michigan Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Dingell. She says she has talked to Biden`s team regularly through this pre-campaign period, and is a long-time friend of the vice president. With me is also tonight`s panel: Geoff Bennett, he is an NBC News White House correspondent; Leigh Ann Caldwell, NBC News Capitol Hill reporter; Michael Gerson, one of the more thoughtful (ph) columnists for The Washington Post.</p><p>Congresswoman, let me start with you. You heard Joe Biden`s remarks today. I`m curious. Do you believe he is right that the Democratic Party is still the Obama-Biden Democratic Party, or is he sounding like someone who`s hoping it is still the Obama-Biden Democratic Party?</p><p>REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN:  OK. I`m from the Midwest. I`m going to tell you -- I told you for three years -- three years ago now that President Trump could become president because he listened to people in the Midwest. He talked about economic issues. He talked about issues that mattered to working people.</p><p>I`m going to tell you now President Trump could win re-election if we don`t nominate the right candidate. Obama-Biden party, I think it`s a party of working men and women that want somebody to care about them that are going to talk about those issues that matter to families across this country.</p><p>TODD:  It does seem as if, congresswoman, that this issue, the specific debate about the personal space issue with the vice president is more symbolic of this larger question, is he 21st century enough for this Democratic Party? How would you answer that question?</p><p>DINGELL:  Well, I think he`s acknowledged that he had a problem. I don`t even call it a problem. He got in people`s space. I think any person, man or woman, needs to tell somebody when they make them feel uncomfortable.</p><p>I think the challenge right now on this particular subject is how do you address the \"Me Too\" movement and sexual harassment which is very real and lord knows I have experienced it in my career, but how do you make sure you respect people, don`t get in their space, but keep compassion?</p><p>Joe Biden`s strength is his ability to connect with people, the empathy that he has. He`s gone through a lot of difficult things in life and he connects with people.</p><p>TODD:  I want to play for you -- he joked about it today and not everybody was comfortable with him joking about it. Let me play the two pieces of sound where he joked about this issue of personal space.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN:  I just want you to know I had permission to hug Lonnie.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BIDEN:  And you guys can sit on the edge. I don`t want you to have to stand all along but -- by the way, he gave me permission to touch him.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD:  Was it too soon, congresswoman?</p><p>DINGELL:  You know it`s his first public event. I`m not going to judge him on it or not on it. The crowd reacted. You know, Joe Biden is Joe Biden. If he runs for president, he`s going to win because he is Joe Biden. He`s got to respect people`s space. He`s got to understand that there are some people -- and he`s acknowledged it -- that don`t like it but his strength is his empathy.</p><p>TODD:  All right. I`m going to bring in the panel here a little bit. Geoff, what do you see here? How is he handling this?</p><p>GEOFF BENNETT, NBC NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Clearly his staff thought his attempts at humor today were a miscalculation because they had Joe Biden come out and speak to the press right after to do some clean-up work.</p><p>TODD:  You feel as if -- we were told he wasn`t going to talk to the press.</p><p>BENNETT:  Right.</p><p>TODD:  So, this -- you do get the sense this was done for clean-up.</p><p>BENNETT:  Absolutely. But on the other side of this, I think Democrats and not so much Democrats but progressives, liberals, have to figure out, come to grips with what is an acceptable level of their own political fragility because whoever emerges as the Democratic nominee is going to go against Donald Trump who has perfected the art of political shamelessness and who uses shamelessness in the public realm as a cudgel.</p><p>And as evidence of that, we saw him today when he was asked by reporters on the south lawn, the president was asked, was it appropriate for you to re-tweet the doctored video mocking Joe Biden? The president said people got a kick out of it. He felt justified in doing that. He`s been able to use that, we`ve seen for this last two years, to his political benefit.</p><p>TODD:  Let me play a piece of that, Leigh Ann. Here it is. Number two, guys.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN:  I made it clear that if I made anyone feel uncomfortable, I feel badly about that. That was never my intention, ever, ever, ever. I`m sorry I didn`t understand that. I`m not sorry for any of my intentions. I`m not sorry for anything that I have ever done. I have never been disrespectful intentionally to a man or a woman.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD:  Leigh Ann, I should bring up that both Lucy Flores, the original woman who came out, and -- she didn`t like the joking and she has already made it clear. Another person who came out didn`t like it either.</p><p>LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, NBC NEWS CAPITOL HILL REPORTER:  Yeah. These women who have issues with this, for them, this joking was too soon. You also have to look at the audience. This was an IBEW union, probably mostly men who are in this audience, probably not the right place to make these jokes.</p><p>But also, this is also not only an issue of the \"Met Too\" movement because this is not sexual harassment or sexual assault. But this is also a generational issue. This brings into focus, is Joe Biden too old to run for president in this Democratic Party at this point?</p><p>MICHAEL GERSON, COLUMNIST, THE WASHINGTON POST:  Well, I think you have to recognize that this is the flip side of his strengths --</p><p>TODD:  Right.</p><p>GERSON:  -- which is the ability to go in to a fire station, get out of the car and go to a fire station and relate to people. I think that is going to be after the Clinton nomination, the fire station test is going to have to be a test that`s applied in this circumstance.</p><p>TODD:  Interesting.</p><p>GERSON:  Yeah.</p><p>TODD:  In that case, Joe Biden would pass the fire station test.</p><p>GERSON:  Absolutely.</p><p>TODD:  I want to go, congresswoman, and bring in his ideological back and forth that he had. I thought it was fascinating how he is trying to portray his ideology versus frankly what he views is what`s being called progressive. Let me play for you something. I`m curious what you think of it on the other side. Number four, guys.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN:  The traditional judgments of whether or not you were a \"liberal,\" was whether or not -- what your positions on race were, on women, what your position on LGBT community, what is your position on civil liberties. I`ll stack my record on those things against anybody who`s ever run, who is running now or who will run.</p><p>I went into 65, 66, 67 races on the ground. I campaigned, I think, for virtually every one of the 41 people who won. Show me the really left, left, left wingers who beat a Republican, a Republican. So the idea of the Democratic Party sort of stood on its head. I don`t get it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD:  I thought he put the progressive left on notice calling them left, left, left wingers. Basically saying, hey, AOC, that`s nice that you beat a fellow Democrat. Your politics doesn`t beat Republicans.</p><p>DINGELL:  You know, the issues that he mentioned in there have been important over the history of this country. We`ve got a lot of other issues, by the way. I mean, you know, I`m from Medicare for All. I don`t think anybody is going to call me left, left, left. But I`m co-chair of Medicare for All.</p><p>TODD:  What does that mean, though? You want to scrap Obamacare?</p><p>DINGELL:  I want universal health care. I think every American has a right to quality affordable health care.</p><p>TODD:  Scrap Obamacare and do something else or use Obamacare and bill (ph) on it, because that`s a big difference between the two views on Medicare for All for what it`s worth.</p><p>DINGELL:  I would like to go to universal health care and a single payer. I want to get there. The first universal health care was actually introduced in 1945. We got Medicare 20 years later. You got to have that vision. But at most, I`m going to tell you that the environment is a critical issue and how we talk about the issue.</p><p>President Obama is the one that said, you know, the highest and most stringent CAFE standard that we had in the history of this country. But at the same time, you have people that take CAFE again. It`s back. How do you make sure we are making more fuel efficient vehicles and protecting jobs? There are a lot of those issues that matter in the Midwest. And then you have real issues like pensions and issues that matter to working people. It`s complicated.</p><p>TODD:  Geoff Bennett, I thought this was ironically the most important thing he said today, because this was the first time he was pretty defiant and drawing a line here, like, guys, I`m not a progressive. You`re not going to call me that. Because I view -- this is Biden -- I view progressive as some version of socialist Democrat. I`m not that.</p><p>BENNETT:  Yeah. He said, I`m an Obama-Biden Democrat and I`m proud of it.</p><p>TODD:  Yeah. I think we`re going to hear the words Obama-Biden --</p><p>BENNETT:  Oh, sure.</p><p>TODD:  -- Democrat from him --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD:  -- over and over and over again. His first name may become Obama.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD:  Former Vice President Obama-Biden.</p><p>BENNETT:  I wouldn`t compare Donald Trump to Joe Biden in many ways. In this way, I think they are similar. The Republicans who have baked in all of their views about Donald Trump and love him come what may, there are Democrats who feel the same way about Joe Biden and the Obama-Biden halcyon years.</p><p>And so once we get past the dust-up with Joe Biden, I do think that he will -- whenever he announces will stay at the top of the pack because of those people who view him favorably and have viewed him favorably.</p><p>GERSON:  It`s an important case here. You have perceived weaknesses on the other ideological side. There are two reactions. One is let`s get everything we always wanted, or let`s build a coalition that includes a different group of people.</p><p>TODD:  Yeah.</p><p>GERSON:  Those are different political tasks. Bill Clinton did the extension. Barack Obama, I think, extended. I don`t think you can run a presidential campaign by saying we are going to get everything we want.</p><p>TODD:  Yeah.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Joe Biden has run for president twice. He didn`t become the nominee twice. He`s leading the pack right now because he`s not in office. Of course there is this nostalgia. I think he has a huge challenge once he officially jumps in the race to stay there especially with so many fresh, new candidates. What might keep him at the top is the fractured --</p><p>TODD:  Yeah.</p><p>CALDWELL:  -- components of this.</p><p>TODD:  Congresswoman, you are a historian of the Democratic Party. You`ve lived --</p><p>DINGELL:  I`m not that old. I`m a little seasoned but not old.</p><p>TODD:  No, you have been a witness like me. I`m not --</p><p>DINGELL:  OK.</p><p>TODD:  I was putting us together here.</p><p>DINGELL:  OK.</p><p>TODD:  In our lifetimes, OK, I`m going to give you the names of three Democrats who won the presidency and the last three who lost the presidency, and I want to ask who which one Joe Biden looks like. The last three successful presidential nominees on the Democratic side were Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. They were all outsiders. They were all the first-time candidates when they ran.</p><p>The last three nominees to lose were Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, and Al Gore. Very resume heavy. I look at this and I ask you, it`s like Joe Biden looks a lot like the ones that didn`t get there. Well, there are a lot of other candidates on this field that look a lot more like the Jimmy Carter model. What say you? What`s the better place to be?</p><p>DINGELL:  First of all, it`s a lifetime between now and next year. And by the way, I don`t have a candidate. I have 20 friends running for president.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DINGELL:  Let`s be real about this.</p><p>TODD:  There are 22 running, so let me -- let me do the math. Which two you`re not friends with? I`m kidding. I`m kidding. Go ahead.</p><p>DINGELL:  I know. But the fact of the matter is that he may benefit a little from the Trump factor which is -- we were just talking about it -- is that his base is strong. When you have that many candidates, you divide it up. The other fallacy I hear people say is he`s too old. Well, Bernie did really well in the last election. Young kids like Joe Biden, you know, a Democratic society represents all ages.</p><p>I think he`s going to appeal to the college campus. Some of the kids really like Joe Biden. Some of the kids really like Bernie Sanders. Some of the kids like Mayor Pete. Mayor Pete is doing really well right now. Is he a flash in the pan? So I think we have to get through a summer, see where people are in the fall. That`s the one thing when you are seasoned, not old, you know? It`s a lifetime in the next few months.</p><p>TODD:  That`s for sure. Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, Democrat from Michigan, it is always interesting to get your point of view on this. Thanks for doing this today. Jeff, Leigh Ann, and Michael, you guys are sticking around.</p><p>Coming up, President Trump visits the border. How many threats is he making about walls, about the border, about Mexico? Oh, let us count the ways because we will, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Welcome back. The president just finished an event at the southern border where he showcased a border wall renovation project that was actually started on the Obama administration. His visit comes after he backed off threats to close the border which he replaced with threats to punish Mexico in other ways.</p><p>Moments ago, he seemed to put the threat about closing the border back on the table. The barrage of Mr. Trump`s various border-related threats are simply too many to count. But that didn`t stop us from trying. Oh yes, we had to do a scroll. As you can see, these are the various threats he has made.</p><p>You missed the build the wall, birth right citizenship, closing the entire border, parts of the border, habeas corpus. Don`t forget, he once appointed immigration czar in the name of Kris Kobach. Remember that one? Impose zero tolerance, withdraw from NAFTA, and levy new tariffs. Perhaps, the one that people forget, charge Mexico $100,000 per illegal immigrant, cancel all funds to sanctuary cities.</p><p>It seems the president is looking for ways to keep the story in the headlines. That is what is going on here which raises the question, is it a crisis he wants to go away, or is it a crisis he needs to stay at least politically?</p><p>Let`s bring back the panel here: Geoff Bennett, Leigh Ann Caldwell, and Michael Gerson. Michael, I want to start with you. It does feel as if whenever the president hits a political wall, so to speak, whether it`s Mueller, health care, whatever is in the moment, he gets to the political crutch of immigration because it is one thing that unites the party around him.</p><p>GERSON:  Yeah. I think that`s true. But he did that in the midterms as his closing strategy. In fact, the closing strategy was to warn that the country was being invaded by a caravan of brown people that should be shot, he said.</p><p>TODD:  It worked in Missouri Senate and Indiana Senate.</p><p>GERSON:  Right. But it didn`t work more broadly.</p><p>TODD:  Right.</p><p>GERSON:  And I think that he turns to this because it does unite his coalition to some extent and excite a portion of his coalition. But he`s going to have to get beyond those numbers in order to win in states in the Midwest and other places.</p><p>TODD:  He doesn`t care about this. He`s told this all the time. You know, you ought to expand your palate here.</p><p>BENNETT:  We know that he doesn`t care the party already lost dearly in the midterms. They lost 40-something seats in the House. They lost comfortably Republican districts.</p><p>TODD:  Have you looked at the border states?</p><p>BENNETT:  Right.</p><p>TODD:  I mean he got smashed. It`s a wipe-out in New Mexico. They got a terrible night in Arizona, they held the governorship. And we all know what happened in Texas.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Let`s admit that immigration was a big reason why they lost.</p><p>BENNETT:  For sure. And we saw Mitch McConnell this past week even --</p><p>TODD:  Claire McCaskill will tell you one of the reasons she lost was the caravan.</p><p>BENNETT:  Yeah. Mitch McConnell this past week even said the president`s idea to shut down the border was a bad one. He said it would be an economic catastrophe for the country and on the border.</p><p>The problem with the kind of demagoguery the president engages in is that it doesn`t allow him to reposition, because anything less than what he`s doing now looks like he`s capitulating, so he comes up with all of these empty threats week after week, in the course of one week changing his position three times, but it`s because he started from the very beginning saying horrible things about brown people coming across the border.</p><p>TODD:  Leigh Ann?</p><p>CALDWELL:  The issue of immigration is doing exactly what Trump wants it to do. He`s forcing some Democrats, especially the presidential candidates, to talk about it. We have Castro who --</p><p>TODD:  By the way, there is a problem on the border. Some of it, you could say he has helped create the problem, but we now have a larger asylum issue where our laws do feel out of date. But the question is who created this crisis.</p><p>CALDWELL:  And there is no effort to try to solve the crisis. There are efforts to try to make it more -- to be more bombastic about it. But Castro came out with a policy this week that says, look, these people --</p><p>TODD:  Julian Castro, the former San Antonio mayor, one of the candidates running for president?</p><p>CALDWELL:  Yes, not the member of Congress.</p><p>TODD:  Right.</p><p>CALDWELL:  He came out with a policy this week that said there was much more to the left than many other things that Democrats have been talking about regarding immigration, saying, let`s decriminalize the thing of crossing the border. And this is what Trump wants, to show that the Democratic Party is weak on immigration and wants open borders.</p><p>GERSON:  I think one of the worst elements of this is that he is talking about cutting aide off to countries in the triangle.</p><p>TODD:  Central American countries that Fox called Mexican countries.</p><p>GERSON:  Right, exactly. The conditions in those countries are partially producing what we are seeing.</p><p>TODD:  Right.</p><p>GERSON:  You can`t really confront these problems unless you confront the despair and hopelessness and illegality in these countries.</p><p>TODD:  I want to remind people, Michael, you remember this, remember the Mexican peso crisis and the United States intervened. There were some -- well, one of the big reasons was help Mexico because if you didn`t, the economy would collapse and everybody would come over the border. That`s what`s happening in Central America.</p><p>GERSON:  Yeah.</p><p>TODD:  Does he not have any other issue he can go to anymore? Is this what it is or is this just his comfort zone?</p><p>BENNETT:  Well, I mean, remember there were those two existential issues by which Republicans who even had misgivings about Donald Trump the man said they would get behind him on policy. One was immigration. The other is getting conservatives on the Supreme Court.</p><p>Well, until he could put another conservative on the Supreme Court, we keep dipping back in that well of immigration issues. His numbers of Republicans are fairly strong. It is like 89 percent approval rating among his base. Overall, it`s not moving the needle for him obviously.</p><p>CALDWELL:  And trade is going to be much more difficult in the next year and a half for the president when he has no results yet on the issue and he has a bunch of Democratic people running for president who are to the left of him on trade.</p><p>TODD:  What is interesting, he did have one presidential candidate on his mind today, and that was Joe Biden.</p><p>BENNETT:  Yeah.</p><p>TODD:  After Joe Biden gives the speech, he sent out a tweet, all those electrical workers are going to vote for me, which does tell me to go to connect or two conversations, as much hand wringing that the Democrats are having about Joe Biden, it`s so clear to me, Michael, that Donald Trump fears Joe Biden more than anybody else.</p><p>GERSON:  He would much rather have that than -- much rather have a Sanders race than a Biden race.</p><p>TODD:  Right.</p><p>GERSON: I mean, clearly. I think there`s good reason that he holds these views.</p><p>TODD:  Leigh Ann, you brought up who was in the room and how uncomfortable it might have been for him talking about the women, that they were the burly white guys --</p><p>CALDWELL:  Yeah.</p><p>TODD:  -- that the Democratic Party lost. Joe Biden says, I`m the candidate for those guys.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Exactly. And the president, I think, you know, you talk to Republicans and you talk to Democrats. The talk is that the president in the White House does fear a Joe Biden candidacy the most. Obviously they know the most about Joe Biden. It`s going to be interesting to see how the other candidates do especially in the Midwest. But there`s also a lot of candidates who know that that is the critical demographic that they need and they are going to work for it.</p><p>TODD:  Their path to re-election goes through the states that have a lot of people like IBEW members in it.</p><p>BENNETT:  That`s right.</p><p>TODD:  In Wisconsin. The way they view their calculation to 270 goes through those voters.</p><p>BENNETT:  Absolutely. I have talked to people in the president`s orbit and they say the one candidate they fear is Joe Biden. Part of that is because they don`t necessarily know how to run against a Kamala Harris or even a Beto O`Rourke at this point.</p><p>TODD:  I have to say that the contrast that is the hardest to figure out, like I have been trying to picture this -- Mayor Pete and Donald Trump.</p><p>BENNETT:  Wow.</p><p>TODD:  How about that contrast?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BENNETT:  Good luck with that.</p><p>TODD:  Fascinating. Panel, you guys are sticking around. Up ahead, unfriending social media. Our new poll shows most Americans think it is bad for us and it is driving us apart. Why can`t we give it up?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Welcome back. Tonight in \"2020 Vision,\" many of the Democratic presidential hopefuls made sure to make a stop this week at Reverend Al Sharpton`s National Action Network`s annual conference. It is a chance to make in-roads with the key Democratic voting block African-Americans. And for some candidates, they use it as an opportunity to address areas where they come under a bit of scrutiny.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D), VERMONT:  We have a president today who is a racist, who is a sexist, who is a homophobe, who is a xenophobe.</p><p>TODD (voice-over):  Bernie Sanders reinforced his campaign`s ongoing efforts to reach out to African-Americans because in 2016, he lost them by about 50 points to Hillary Clinton. Pete Buttigieg addressed recent criticism over his 2015 use of the phrase \"all lives matter\" which some say diminishes the Black Lives Matter movement.</p><p>MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG, SOUTH BEND, INDIANA:  We assert what should go without saying but in these times must be said clearly and again and again that black lives matter.</p><p>TODD (voice-over):  Kamala Harris, who has faced criticism over her tenure as California`s attorney general, touted her record on criminal justice.</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D), CALIFORNIA:  You can look at my track record to know that`s what I would do because that`s what I did when I ran the California Department of Justice.</p><p>TODD (voice-over):  And Beto O`Rourke, who has taken hits for being short on substance, was very direct when it came to supporting a bill to research reparations for the descendants of slaves.</p><p>BETO O`ROURKE, FORMER TEXAS REPRESENTATIVE:  Absolutely I would sign that into law.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TODD:  By the way, Bernie Sanders, John Hickenlooper, and Pete Buttigieg also agreed to sign the bill on reparations, joining Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Julian Castro, who have already said they would as well. We will be back with more MTP DAILY right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Welcome back. If I were to tell you there is something out there that the majority of Americans believe is dividing our country, wasting our time and spreading lies, you probably want us to get rid of it. You probably demand the problem get fixed immediately. You might even want someone to declare a national emergency. But what if I told you that something is social media?</p><p>According to our latest NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll, 57 percent of Americans say social media is doing more to divide us than unite us. Eight-two percent say it does more to waste time than use our time well, 82 percent. And 55 percent say it does more to spread lies and falsehoods than news and information.</p><p>So are Americans ready to give up Facebook or Twitter or Instagram?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD:  No. Sixty-nine percent, that`s right, nearly seven in 10 Americans say they still use social media at least once a day. They still use this toxic thing once a day. It is easy to recognize something may be bad for us. It is much harder to do something about it.</p><p>With me now is Tony Romm. He is an MSNBC contributor and a tech policy reporter for The Washington Post. He has been covering technology in tech companies for most of the past decade. Welcome.</p><p>TONY ROMM, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR, TECH POLICY REPORTER FOR THE WASHINGTON POST:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>TODD:  The thing that struck me the most here and as somebody who is absolutely a believer that social media has done more to destroy a lot of things that we have held near and dear to us, in our poll Americans did separate social media from technology. There`s been this perception that our anger at social media is engulfed in our anger or fear of technology. That wasn`t the case in our poll.</p><p>ROMM:  Yeah, it`s much more nuanced than that. The business model suggests that Facebook and Google are much different than companies like Apple and Amazon in the ways that they make money and the kinds of products that they put out.</p><p>The numbers really track with the series of scandals that we saw over the better part of the past year. Facebook sort of leads the way in terms of generating bad headlines. We saw a number of incidents in which they misused people`s private information. A number of cases in which Facebook hasn`t really been held to account for some of those misuses here in the nation`s capital.</p><p>And so I think that`s reflected in the fact that people are very unhappy with these companies, social media companies, and what happens to their information.</p><p>TODD:  We did ask some favorable ratings of the social media companies. I want to put them up. It was interesting here. It certainly was more negative for Twitter and Facebook as you`ll see here. But Google is still basically 3-1, 4-1 here. Sixty-three positive, just 13 negative. Facebook and Twitter were more sort of dead-even and polarizing.</p><p>So, as much as we don`t like social media, it`s not total anger yet. It`s like we know smoking is bad but we don`t hate Marlboro yet.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD:  You know type of thing.</p><p>ROMM:  Yeah. The addiction is an interesting one here because it is reflected in the fact that people --</p><p>TODD:  This feels like an addiction issue.</p><p>ROMM:  And some people would say there are experts out there now who are really thinking critically about the incentives that are baked into some of these platforms like Facebook that keep us coming back for more, that keep us logging on and surrendering our personal information.</p><p>TODD:  That`s their business model, though.</p><p>ROMM:  Yeah. These companies don`t make money unless they have some of that data.</p><p>TODD:  They are trying to keep you there. So the whole goal is to keep you there. Then of course, it`s an addiction.</p><p>ROMM:  At some level, they don`t have to do very much. Remember --</p><p>TODD:  Digital nicotine.</p><p>ROMM:  The reason that Facebook is as big as it is right now among many reasons is that all your friends are on there and so you want to be in the place where your friends are. And so that`s also why in some cases it is very hard to quit from these services, because you`re missing out on the things that your friends are saying and the things your friends are sharing.</p><p>TODD:  One other thing we saw in here is that they don`t think the federal government is doing enough to have oversight over the media, 54 percent are not satisfied and 36 percent are satisfied. What was interesting is Mark Zuckerberg is suddenly down at 180. He went from not saying it is a problem to not saying they`re going to be -- you know, care about privacy and he`s on a bit of a media tour. Here he is on ABC yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  The current laws around what is political advertising don`t consider discussing issues to be political. It`s not clear to me that we want a private company to be making that kind of fundamental decision about what is political speech and how should that be regulated. That seems like something there should be a more Democratic process over.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD:  This frustrates me because Mark Zuckerberg is basically claiming that he does not have a responsibility that you at The Washington Post and I at MSNBC News have. It just drives me batty. We are private companies. We do face regulatory responsibility.</p><p>We do have a responsibility not to proactively, you know, for instance, if that killing video had been here, NBC would have been held accountable by the federal government. So, I feel like he continues to want to believe he doesn`t run a media company.</p><p>ROMM:  Yeah. That 180 you`re talking about though is because Facebook has no choice here. We have lawmakers around the country who are talking about these things including liability and whether these companies which have long been protected from that liability are relic of the days when internet companies were much smaller than they are now should continue to have a legal shield. In fact, there will be a hearing on this in the Senate just next week.</p><p>But we even have a 2020 candidates talking about these things which we hadn`t heard before. Elizabeth Warren is out there talking about breaking up big tech companies. Amy Klobuchar is one of the bigger voices when it comes to political ads that Zuckerberg talked about in that clip. So the interest among lawmakers is certainly much more heightened than it used to be. It`s even something on the campaign trail. We didn`t see that in previous campaign cycles.</p><p>TODD:  To go back to the addiction metaphor, 1964 is when the surgeon general came out and said smoking was bad for us. You can make an argument it essentially took us a generation to agree, right? It really wasn`t until the 90s that suddenly, oh, yeah, we shouldn`t have smoking sections in restaurants, smoking sections on airplanes, things like that.</p><p>This to me feels like the country now knows social media is bad but we`re addicted to it. Is it fixable or do we just kick the habit and it just takes a generation?</p><p>ROMM:  We have had some of the same warnings here. We have been warned by the government about privacy and what happens when you surrender your data. We have been warned by report after report about disinformation on line and the effect that Russian agents and other digital factors have on our conversations about politics.</p><p>And now it is the question of what do we do. And there have been many efforts on Capitol Hill over the better part of the past few years that have intensified recently that just haven`t gone anywhere. We don`t have a federal overarching privacy law. We don`t have something that says that every time Facebook makes a mistake on privacy, it is going to face tough fines. And so this is the question that is being put to Congress right now. Are they willing to turn that angst into something like regulation?</p><p>TODD:  Let me ask you this. What -- I`ve been surprised I haven`t heard somebody say we should have a privacy bill of rights.</p><p>ROMM:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>TODD:  Right? I heard some chatter. What would that look like? Is that like truth in algorithms? What does it look like that the average Joe and Jane can understand?</p><p>ROMM:  Yeah. This has taken many forms over the year. President Obama back at the time was talking about a privacy bill of rights. It went nowhere. The idea was put out. He said that folks should know what`s collected about them.</p><p>TODD:  I feel like the Europeans are doing more to protect your privacy and my privacy than the Americans.</p><p>ROMM:  Yeah. They are the world`s privacy cops right now. They have the tough laws in the book that say you must give people choice over what happens to your data. If you don`t, we`re going to hit you with huge fines as a result of that. We have seen companies like Facebook and Google face investigations. But here, the situation is much, much different.</p><p>TODD:  How much more complicated though is it by our First Amendment?</p><p>ROMM:  Well, it depends what you are talking about. With privacy, it is not in a lot of cases. Giving people the ability to know what`s collected about them and say yes or no in response to that data collection isn`t something that is immediately implicated by the First Amendment.</p><p>When you talking about things like the terrible things that folks like share on social media like hate speech, racism, things of that sort, the New Zealand video that you mentioned --</p><p>TODD:  Right.</p><p>ROMM:  -- that`s where things are complicated. That is why you have seen Australia, the United Kingdom, other countries looking at content restrictions when the U.S. isn`t so much.</p><p>TODD:  And obviously if they do, that might have more impact than anything we do here. Tony Romm, great conversation.</p><p>ROMM:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>TODD:  Nice to have you on. Much appreciate it. Up ahead, I`m obsessed with why it is the best of times and the worst of times. That`s at least according to President Trump. We`ll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Welcome back. Tonight, I`m obsessed with the president`s position on the economy. It`s the best.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The economy is roaring.</p><p>We have the strongest economy. So strong.</p><p>Stronger that it has even been before.</p><p>Strongest economy perhaps ever.</p><p>The best economy.</p><p>The great economy.</p><p>The greatest economy.</p><p>The hottest place economically anywhere in the world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD:  In fact, it`s so good he says we need to do something that is only necessary when the economy is bad.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Well, I personally think the Fed should drop rates. I think they really slowed us down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD:  I`m very confused. According to the president, lowering interest rates is good for the economy but guess who disagrees? A guy named Donald Trump. \"The Fed`s reckless policies of low interest and flooding the market with dollars need to be stopped.\"</p><p>Wait, that tweet was from 2011. So 2011 Trump and 2019 Trump are at loggerheads. Why could that be? Could it be because the Fed rate hikes so far have cost the president a lot of money? Like more than $5 million a year personally? Because he took out those business loans between 2012 and 2015, which came after he sent that tweet slamming low interest rates? You might say it`s all about changing his views to whatever benefits him best in the moment. I guess really who`s to say?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  The Electoral College is genius.</p><p>I have never really been in favor of it, but now I appreciate it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Welcome back. Time for \"The Lid.\" The panel is back: Geoff, Leigh Ann, and Michael. Geoff, I got to ask you quickly, I don`t want to get bogged down on this Fed stuff --</p><p>GEOFF BENNETT, NBC NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah.</p><p>TODD:  But to hear the president even use the phrase quantitative easy, I`m sure Ben Bernanke was probably listening, you know, going -- what are you talking about? We are not going back to that again.</p><p>BENNETT:  Yeah, my ears perked up, too.</p><p>TODD:  The president is looking for a scapegoat for a softening economy that`s inevitable.</p><p>BENNETT:  Right.</p><p>TODD:  It seems pretty clear to me he wants to point the blame somewhere else.</p><p>BENNETT:  He does. And yet, you know, as we know, he`s nominated Stephen Moore and Herman Cain to sit on the board whereas he got rid of Janet Yellen because apparently she didn`t look the part.</p><p>TODD:  Yellen would have kept interest rates lower.</p><p>BENNETT:  Exactly. Exactly. Explain that.</p><p>MICHAEL GERSON, COLUMNIST, THE WASHINGTON POST:  To look if part of a member of the Fed, you have to be boring. These guys aren`t boring.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD:  That`s the irony here. Janet Yellen would be giving him the Fed policy he wants right now.</p><p>GERSON:  I think that`s right.</p><p>TODD:  Leigh Ann, Herman Cain and Stephen Moore, you`re on Capitol Hill.</p><p>LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, NBC NEWS CAPITOL HILL REPORTER:  Mm-hmm.</p><p>TODD:  Republicans have seemed to be falling in line on some of these borderline nominees.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Mm-hmm.</p><p>TODD:  They complain about it. They get cranky about it. But when it gets to committee, they all seem to fall in line.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Yeah.</p><p>TODD:  Will that happen here?</p><p>CALDWELL:  I think so.</p><p>TODD:  Both of them? Or do you think one of them? Michael thinks Herman Cain is a bridge too far.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Well, I think it is going to depend on what comes out about these two. I mean, we already know --</p><p>TODD:  We know a lot about them. Herman Cain got driven out of a race because of sexual harassment --</p><p>CALDWELL:  Yes. Sexual harassment, yes.</p><p>TODD:  -- allegations.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Yes, allegations. But then -- and then Stephen Moore has this debts to the IRS, $75,000, I believe. So it`s not looking good.</p><p>TODD:  Mm-hmm.</p><p>CALDWELL:  But I think that if they can get past this storm and there is nothing else that comes out, we already know about Herman Cain. I mean, Purdue in Georgia knows Herman Cain very well. I know he -- he comes out --</p><p>TODD:  That`s Georgia. That`s kind of a home state thing.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Yeah. But still, I think that is this a hill the Republicans are going to die on?</p><p>TODD:  Mitt Romney seemed to mock it. He says they`ll make the rates 999. He actually joked about it.</p><p>GERSON:  I think when you look at it, Republicans object. They don`t object the things like the demonization of migrants. But they do object the things like monetary policy.</p><p>BENNETT:  Yeah.</p><p>GERSON:  That says something. I think they will object.</p><p>BENNETT:  And there have been instances when there are certain nominees where the kind of job matters. So for instance when the president nominated Ronny Jackson to be the head of V.A., there are Republicans who said, no, not the V.A. We`re not playing that game.</p><p>TODD:  But Fed governors.</p><p>BENNETT:  Exactly.</p><p>TODD:  I talked to a former Fed chair who said one or two governors can`t really ruin policy.</p><p>BENNETT:  Right.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Yeah.</p><p>TODD:  But four or five might over time.</p><p>CALDWELL:  But Stephen Moore has been out there several weeks now and no Republican has really come out strongly against him yet. I don`t --</p><p>TODD:  He`s been on both sides of every economic issue.</p><p>BENNETT:  There was one Republican on the Hill who privately said when it comes to this kind of nominees you don`t want names of people you have seen on Fox News. Those aren`t the guys you want for the Fed.</p><p>TODD:  I want to go to social media. Michael, I was heartened by the fact that the public has separated social media from technology, because I think there`s been this fear that we`re so angry with social media we`re afraid of technology. That`s not the case. Americans love advancement and I think correctly have realized social media is not one of the advancements.</p><p>GERSON:  I think it has both isolated people in a weird way but then turned our discourse into a battleground at the same time. So yeah, I think people are suspicious of social media. They use it but they`re not sure about it.</p><p>TODD:  What does that mean for the election going forward? Does that mean the public might be more suspicious of what they read on line? I mean, is this the -- look, I agree we`re not going to kick the habit today, but at least we know.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Yeah, I think people don`t like social media but they are addicted to it, and I don`t think that they are not going engage in it. I think the candidates are going to use every tool they have on social media to advance their message. Look at AOC. She is a social media star and she uses that platform very effectively.</p><p>And while we might not love social media, we know that it makes us twitch sometimes and we get frustrated with it. But I don`t see anything changing in this next cycle.</p><p>BENNETT:  Yeah, I think you`re right. I think we as journalists see using Twitter as a work hazard, right? I mean, how many times you follow journalists on Twitter who say, you know, today on Twitter it is a cesspool, but yet it is so enmeshed in our daily lives, certainly in our political lives, and even with all of the --</p><p>TODD:  My favorite hate tweets were, you needed a poll to find out that people hate social media.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD:  Typical social media, right? Like thanks for actually proving what we already know. I guess the question though is what is the right role of government here? Because -- look, Facebook, it angers me that Facebook is not held accountable the way we here at MSNBC are held accountable in what is aired on our platform.</p><p>We could get fined by the FCC. Facebook has been protected away from that. That said, I don`t know what the right policy answer is on this, and I don`t think lawmakers do either.</p><p>GERSON:  I think the answer here is to have public pressure, not to have governmental action. I think it is more likely to get real results. There has been to some extent. They`ve responded.</p><p>TODD:  Facebook does seem more nervous about -- they saw the stats. People did delete their Facebook accounts in a significant enough numbers that they at least now claim to care about privacy.</p><p>CALDWELL:  I don`t think Congress knows what to do yet. I think part of that problem is that the Senate especially, it is an older body. I don`t think they totally get it. And social media is years ahead of where Congress is thinking on this.</p><p>They`re trying but then you have all the cyber security components of it that they`re trying to get ahead of, which they`re also behind on. Technology is a constant battle for Congress. We are seeing it in the social media.</p><p>BENNETT:  That`s the big challenge. Any policy solution would be inherently reactive, not forward looking.</p><p>CALDWELL:  Right.</p><p>BENNETT:  And so any law that gets past would probably answer a problem that we had five years ago.</p><p>GERSON:  The problem is not just the excess. That is the difficulty here. When you reduce a presidential campaign to a Twitter campaign as Trump did, you`re actually shrinking the discourse in a way that people used to give large policy speeches. He didn`t give a single one during the campaign. It is actually lighter on substance --</p><p>TODD:  I think he spent all of like two nights outside of either Mar-a-Lago or New York. He didn`t even like spend the night in another state that he was campaigning in. Geoff, before I go, the president is ending his day in Beverly Hills.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TODD:  I`m sorry. He declared a national emergency and wants to go to the border. Do they at all acknowledge the bad optics of that?</p><p>BENNETT:  No, they don`t. They don`t care. I mean, that`s the short answer. They don`t care.</p><p>TODD:  Imagine what Hannity would say if President Obama went from the border to Beverly Hills.</p><p>BENNETT:  It would be breaking news report.</p><p>TODD:  All right. Geoff, Leigh Ann, and Michael, thank you very much. Up ahead, Pete and repeat.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Well, in case you missed it, the South Bend mayor, Pete Buttigieg, is apparently a jack of many trades. For starter, he was a Rhode scholar. He served in Afghanistan as a naval intel officer. And he says he speaks eight languages.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  (UNTRANSLATED).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD:  He`s also a skilled piano player. In fact, he is so good he can hold his own with singer Ben Folds. Ben Folds Six. But he could also secretly be an NBA coach? Seriously, folks, the Celtics are coached by this man. He claims his name is Brad Stevens. But take another look. You have to wonder. Has anyone ever seen Brad Stevens and Pete Buttigieg in the same room at the same time in the same Boston garden? Me thinks not.</p><p>And honestly, wouldn`t it explain why the Celtics are sitting at just fourth place at the Eastern Conference this year? The coach has been busy running a city and running for president. They were supposed to be number one in the Eastern Conference with no Lebron and they haven`t been. That`s what happens if you have too many jobs.</p><p>We`ll just have to leave it to you to decide. Is it Stevens or Buttigieg? But one of those two men will be joining me this weekend. Utah Senator Mitt Romney will also be here. Don`t miss it.  Fascinating show, Buttigieg and Romney, because if it`s Sunday, it`s MEET THE PRESS.</p><p>That`s all we have for tonight.  We`ll be back Monday with more MEET THE PRESS daily.</p><p>And \"THE BEAT\" with Yasmin Vossoughian, who`s in for Ari, starts right now.</p><p>Good evening, Yasmin.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

A bipartisan bill is raised to protect Robert Mueller`s Russia probe but for the third time, it was blocked by Republicans. Kara Swisher joins to discuss the latest from Facebook`s privacy breaches and why the company seems to keep using the same denial, debunk, downplay strategy the Trump administration has adopted. Dems march two-by-two into 2020. Do Dems have a Noah`s Ark trend going for the next election? Multiple states have two candidates vying for president in 2020, including Colorado where Sen. Michael Bennet and Gov. John Hickenlooper have both expressed interest in running. President Trump is facing some criticism from fellow Republicans for his decision to withdraw troops from Syria and claiming victory over ISIS in doing so.

And this is going to make a lot of people`s life better.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WALLACE: I love you for finding a silver lining. It`s a great point. Thank you for bringing that. My thanks to Ron Klein, Jason Johnson, Michelle Goldberg, and Nick Confessore.</p><p>That does it for our hour. I`m Nicolle Wallace. \"MTP DAILY\" starts right now. Hi, Chuck.</p><p>CHUCK TODD, MSNBC HOST: Hey. The last time they come they got a lot of nods around here, too.</p><p>WALLACE: Yes.</p><p>TODD: So, that`s well said. That`s well said. Thank you, Nicolle.</p><p>Yes, if it`s Wednesday, deny, debunk, downplay.</p><p>Good evening. I am not Patches O`Houlihan. I`m Chuck Todd here in Washington. And for the five of you that got that joke, enjoy it. Welcome to MTP DAILY.</p><p>We are following two major stories at this hour. A key part of the president`s legal defense involving that infamous Trump tower Moscow project has been debunked and you`re not going to believe how the president`s lawyer is responding to this one.</p><p>We are also following the fallout from a bombshell story in the New York Times that suggests Facebook may have lied about what it was doing with data as sensitive as your private messages. Which raises this question. Has Facebook, and frankly most of the social media companies been as dishonest as the president`s team has been when it comes to Russia? We`re going to get to that story in a moment as well.</p><p>But we will begin tonight with another unraveling denial involving the president`s ties to, you guessed it, Russia, and another brazen attempt to try to downplay that falsehood.</p><p>Just three days ago, the president`s lawyer said this about the Trump tower Moscow deal. Which remember, Mr. Trump was negotiating with Russia as Russia and Putin were executing its campaign against our democracy.</p><p>\"There was a letter of intent to go forward, but no one signed it.\" But then reporters got their hands-on that letter of intent, and of course it was signed, none other than by a person`s signature we have all become familiar with. Donald J. Trump`s.</p><p>Now here`s Giuliani`s response according to an interview he gave to the New York Daily News. Giuliani told the Daily News said, \"of course, Trump signed it. How could you send it but nobody signed it,\" he said? But Giuliani claimed the letter was B.S. because it didn`t go anywhere. \"That was the end of it,\" Giuliani said. \"It means nothing but an expression of interest that means very little unless it goes to a contract and it never did.\"</p><p>So, the president`s team didn`t publicly disclose the project. Then when they did, they didn`t mention the letter of intent. Then when they did, they claimed it wasn`t signed. Then when we learned it was, they claimed it`s all B.S. anyway.</p><p>Folks, this pattern of deny, which gets debunked so they downplay is frankly a story that we told so many times. And it`s always about the same topic. This one, Russia. When will it stop? Maybe when enough people demand that it stop.</p><p>Let`s bring in tonight`s panel. Eugene Scott, political reporter at the Washington Post. Ruth Marcus, Washington Post columnist and deputy editorial page editor, she`s also an MSNBC contributor, Matthew Continetti, editor-in-chief of the Washington Free Beacon. Welcome all.</p><p>Eugene, if I just stop there, we could just say this is Rudy Giuliani being Rudy Giuliani, but the same defense, deny, then downplay when it comes to firing Comey. Let me put up the examples here. \"The day it was happened the Russia investigation is not what this is about,\" said Mike Pence on May 10th.</p><p>Donald Trump on May 12th, \"when I decided to do it, I said to myself this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.\" Then of course, the Trump legal team memo, on January 29, 2018 where they said, \"A president can fire an FBI director at any time for any reason.\" The point is this is a pattern.</p><p>EUGENE SCOTT, POLITICAL REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST: It certainly is. And it`s not doing the president any favors at all. At least at the very least it`s certainly bringing in Rudy Giuliani`s legacy into question as we`ve seen someone who at least made headlines or was praised for being tough on law, among, you know, more conservative politicos.</p><p>Turn to someone who seems to dismiss criminal activities altogether when it involves someone that he is personally connected to. And it`s very problematic in this situation because there could be very real implications for the American people and those who rely on the president to serve citizen`s best interest when it comes to national security.</p><p>TODD: Matthew, I just don`t understand where, because like I said, let me do the Trump tower meeting. The same thing happened there. The story comes out on July 8th, 2017 Donald Trump, Jr., says we primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children.</p><p>Five days later, the answer is this. Donald Trump, \"it`s called opposition research. It`s very standard where they have information, you take the information.\" But July 30th, \"collusion is not a crime.\"</p><p>MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, WASHINGTON FREE BEACON: We go back even further in time and probably go to some of those articles in the New York Daily News and New York Post--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD: I got more here, don`t worry.</p><p>CONTINETTI: -- and National Enquirer.</p><p>TODD: I got hush money payments, Matt.</p><p>CONTINETTI: I mean, this is who the man is, right?</p><p>TODD: Yes. This is the pattern. It`s the same pattern. When does it stop?</p><p>CONTINETTI: Probably never. But here`s the difference, though, starting in January, Democrats are going to have control of the House and they are going to be in charge of those investigating committees and they are going to have subpoena power.</p><p>And even if that doesn`t reach the president, himself, it`s going to start getting at kind of the people in the president`s orbit and they are going to be held to kind of higher standard for truth and veracity than say the president has been or his lawyer in the national media.</p><p>TODD: Rush, as I`ve said, I got the hush money payment example. And I`ll be darn if I`m going to get all these examples on air. On November 4, 2016 the Trump campaign statement, \"We have no knowledge of any of this.\" By December 14, it became, Michael Cohen, \"Mr. Trump directed me to make the payments.\" And by December 14, \"This was not a big crime.\"</p><p>RUTH MARCUS, DEPUTY EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, THE WASHINGTON POST: Right.</p><p>TODD: That one took almost two years for them to their eventual--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MARCUS: To unravel.</p><p>TODD: They at least kept that one afloat for a while.</p><p>MARCUS: Well, from the president on down the first instinct is to lie to not tell the truth when confronted with an inconvenient fact or allegation and then you just start to peel the onion and the layers that you laid out until you get to the truth.</p><p>And for me, the touchstone is, if we knew during the campaign--</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>MARCUS: -- what we know how about all the things you`ve unspoiled about the fact that the president was negotiating to build a tower in Moscow when he was running, about the Trump tower meeting, about the hush money payments, where would we be? Would he be in the White House? I think that`s a serious question and you have been asking the next serious question, which is, when will it be enough? And maybe the answer is in the next election.</p><p>TODD: Eugene, does this even happen on policy? We put together, it`s a little bit out of order, it was decry, deny, downplay when it came to child separation. So that happened.</p><p>And then the president said, \"I hate to see the separation of parents and children.\" Secretary Nielsen says a couple of days later, \"We do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period.\"</p><p>Of course, we end up finding up that yes, this was the intent of doing this. And then by November 25th, the president said, \"We had the exact same policy as the Obama administration.\"</p><p>Again, I know it`s instinctual. It goes to what Ruth just said, but I guess the question is, you have about 55 percent of the country that`s worn out from this. But you do have you 40 to 45 percent that it doesn`t bother them.</p><p>SCOTT: Absolutely. And one thing that we know the president is mindful of is his base. These supporters who have gone--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD: That`s the only thing he`s mindful of.</p><p>SCOTT: Very much so. We usually we see presidents when he head towards the midterm start to think about the people who weren`t supportive of them initially hoping to win them.</p><p>TODD: You want to grow? Right?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCOTT: It`s the new people--</p><p>TODD: I know that`s crazy.</p><p>SCOTT: It`s the new people on the Trump train. Right? That`s not something that he`s seen. And one of the things that`s been really fascinating and disheartening about how the president has handled this Russia investigation, is he seems to be very mindful of his base, knowing these people will support him regardless. But he didn`t pay attention to the fact that the base is not as large as it was in 2016.</p><p>There are people who voted for Trump and Trump-like characters, candidates should I say, in 2016 who did not in 2018 and in part it`s because of this pattern of dishonesty.</p><p>TODD: You know, Matthew, I think he`s right. You know, watching the Trump base, and you look at it. It got as high as 46. But you do see it`s like if you look at it maybe it`s down to 34, 35, who believe he`s never been dishonest about it. You know, you`re starting to see it`s not a -- it`s like a small leak out of an inflated raft. You know, it`s not sinking yet, but.</p><p>CONTINETTI: Sure, his personal approval has always been pretty low even among the people who support him.</p><p>TODD: Right. People like -- that`s right. Yes.</p><p>CONTINETTI: Exactly. And so, he still retains pretty high support among Republicans, probably enough to deter any primary challenge.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD: Higher -- higher than the last two -- higher than the last two Republican presidents.</p><p>MARCUS: I went back and I looked at the approval ratings for the party of the president in power. He is above where President Obama was, above where most presidents have been in recent years. It`s extraordinary. But it is a kind of condensed stock that`s boiled down to its essence as the party base strengths.</p><p>SCOTT: And on this issue, they`re not really supportive. I`ve wrote about it today in the Washington Post, only about a third of Republicans actually believe what Trump is saying about Russia and the 2016 election. They still support him but they don`t believe him.</p><p>TODD: There is a, you know, the rhetorical question I asked is simply, when will it stop? When will enough people demand that it stopped? Well, there is a group of people that could have done something about it or attempted to, it`s elected Republicans in Washington. They have chosen not to. Here`s Paul Ryan today in his farewell speech.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAUL RYAN, UNITED STATES SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: I leave as I came here, an optimist to the core. Just as remarkable as what we have achieved is what we have the capacity to do still. So, here`s to the people. Here`s to the people`s House. Here`s to possibilities. Thank you for everything. God bless America.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: I lump the two here because you could make the Republican Party rank and file care if other Republicans like him cared.</p><p>CONTINETTI: Yes, maybe. I mean, other--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD: I`m just -- maybe not.</p><p>CONTINETTI: -- Republicans raise this issue are rejected by the Republican base, which is--</p><p>TODD: That`s true.</p><p>CONTINETTI: -- totally the president`s corner. So, I`m not so sure. But the irony is--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD: But that`s the truth. That look like an alien.</p><p>CONTINETTI: The Republican Congress--</p><p>TODD: Today.</p><p>CONTINETTI: -- or the Republican caucus in next year`s Congress is actually going to be more pro-Trump--</p><p>TODD: More Trumpy.</p><p>CONTINETTI: -- than the one that Paul Ryan led for the last two years, so.</p><p>TODD: Because he and a bunch of others are leaving.</p><p>CONTINETTI: This is where we are. I mean, the people who are going to stop Trump are not going to be Republicans, they are going to a combination of Democrats and independents.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD: But do you believe that?</p><p>CONTINETTI: Some Republicans in 2020 if they stop him.</p><p>TODD: I believe that if it`s at the ballot box. But if your -- if he is -- if you are going to hold him accountable before the election, then it is going to take Republicans jumping on board. Right?</p><p>MARCUS: Republican elected officials will desert the president if and only if, when and only when, it is in their political interest. And that will be, if something happens or the facts develop to the point where they understand that the base is deserting the president and that it will be safe for them in primaries. Period.</p><p>That`s why I think your question has it backwards. Paul Ryan isn`t leaving the people. The people are leaving Paul Ryan. It`s not just Paul Ryan.</p><p>TODD: I understand politically why he didn`t.</p><p>MARCUS: I think you did. I think that you understood politically.</p><p>TODD: No, I understand why he did it politically. But if you are frustrated, my whole point is there is one whole group of people that could have an impact if they chose to.</p><p>SCOTT: If they chose to, but they haven`t felt empower to do it because they are so mindful of the base. Now we did see after the midterms, some Republican lawmakers are bit more willing to speak out against Trump because they looked at the numbers and realized that the Republican electorate was not as on board with Trump as they perhaps previously thought.</p><p>And so, if that base continues to decline, and I don`t know what it would make for them to maybe some changes in the economy, I think we could see the Republican lawmakers stand up to Trump in ways we haven`t in the past two years.</p><p>MARCUS: We do. Do you see some outpourings of frustration on Khashoggi, on Yemen--</p><p>SCOTT: Right.</p><p>MARCUS: -- on Syria today. So, a little. Not a lot.</p><p>TODD: No, I mean, I know--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MARCUS: But it`s something.</p><p>TODD: I know it`s there. And you do -- but I also get like those that have popped up. I mean, Bob Corker wanted to get back in the race. He couldn`t have won. And Jeff Flake he didn`t retire because he wanted to retire. I mean, he, himself, if he could have gotten elected, I think he`d run.</p><p>CONTINETTI: I think the bargain that Trump has made with Republican lawmakers, is I`ll sign on to your agenda and in exchange for that you give me a pass on a lot of this other stuff. Once he starts departing from that agenda, that traditional Republicanism, if he starts flirting with taxes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD: What`s left? What do you mean if he is departing for judicial Republicanism?</p><p>CONTINETTI: If he nominates a Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court.</p><p>TODD: OK, that`s what it would take. Yes.</p><p>CONTINETTI: Judges, taxes, if he doesn`t build a wall.</p><p>TODD: But on national security.</p><p>CONTINETTI: National security we saw an outrage today from the United States Senate because he`s withdrawing precipitously from Syria. So, it`s there. It`s just on policy, not on the stuff that occupies a lot of (Inaudible)--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD: But even on--</p><p>CONTINETTI: from Washington.</p><p>TODD: But even on policy, it`s rhetorical and they do back off at the end of it.</p><p>CONTINETTI: What? I mean, what do you--</p><p>TODD: Meaning like they give you the sense of the Senate.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MARCUS: Brace a resolution.</p><p>TODD: That`s right. They--</p><p>CONTINETTI: That`s all they can do with a lot of these policies.</p><p>TODD: Well, no, they could do more if they chose to. Here they could have funding fights, they could do some things like this. They`re not --I guess- -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CONTINETTI: They are -- they are members of the same party.</p><p>TODD: I understand.</p><p>CONTINETTI: So, they do have to work together to some extent.</p><p>TODD: Right. I guess the question is, do any of them worry about what this is going to look like in two years?</p><p>SCOTT: I think certainly, and I think that`s what we got a taste of with the whole Khashoggi situation. Where we saw people come out and say, absolutely, Trump, the way you are responding to Saudi Arabia is not consistent with how we believe an American president or any elected leadership.</p><p>And they are very mindful of their legacy. So, I think in part because they`re looking at some of these farewell speeches that they saw Orrin Hatch give, Jeff Flake give, Paul Ryan give and some of these people were getting laughed out a bit.</p><p>TODD: Well, that is what`s funny. Every one of these farewell speeches, whether Republican or Democrat all contain these subtle shots at Trump. It is sort of remarkable whether really subtle or not, Ruth.</p><p>MARCUS: Well, maybe they`re looking at those farewell speeches and thinking I don`t want to be saying farewell like that guy had to. Because a lot of them as you pointed out--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD: Yes. Wanted to stay.</p><p>MARCUS: -- weren`t exactly leaving on the best of terms.</p><p>TODD: Right. All right. We got a lot more. Wait until we get to Facebook. That`s going to be quite the story in a little bit. But anyway, you guys are sticking around.</p><p>Up next, the bipartisan plan to try to protect Robert Mueller. How is that working out? They`re trying it one more time.</p><p>TODD: Welcome back. Well, you know the saying if at first you don`t succeed, try, try again.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JEFF FLAKE, (R) ARIZONA: We need to protect the independents of the special counsel and allow this crucial investigation and any like it in the future to run their course.</p><p>SEN. CHRIS COONS, (D) DELAWARE: This is an effective and ongoing federal investigation that must be allowed to reach its conclusion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: Those, of course, were Senators Jeff Flake and Chris Coons a few hours ago trying for the third time to force a vote on legislation protecting Robert Mueller`s investigation, and just as before, Republicans blocked this third attempt.</p><p>Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called it a solution in search of a problem. So now in a week in which President Trump tweeted again that the Russia probe should be shut down, and in a week in which a new report claimed that Russia disinformation teams targeted Robert Mueller, himself, will anything change?</p><p>With me now are those two senators, Republican Jeff Flake of Arizona, in his last few days as a senator and Democrat Chris Coons of Delaware. Welcome, gentleman.</p><p>COONS: Thank you.</p><p>FLAKE: Thanks, Chuck.</p><p>TODD: All right. Senator Flake, why was today not any different than before and will tomorrow be any different than today when it comes to this Mueller bill?</p><p>FLAKE: You know, this bill passed the judiciary committee back in April, so we have been waiting nine months. It passed on a bipartisan basis two to one. Even and including our chairman he has a languish on the House floor awaiting for -- I`m sorry, awaiting for action on the Senate floor since that time.</p><p>And since that time, notably, in November, the president fired the attorney general. So, to say, you know, the solution is in search of a problem, I think the problem is that the Mueller probe is in danger and we need to protect it.</p><p>TODD: Senator Coons, obviously, Mitch McConnell`s rationale has been it`s unconstitutional. He`s not convinced. Forget whether the president would veto it or not, he probably would unless you put it on the spending bill. But he argues it`s unconstitutional anyway so why bother?</p><p>COONS: I am certain that it`s not unconstitutional. And frankly, the fact that the Republican chairman of the judiciary committee, that a bipartisan majority of 14 to 7 on the judiciary committee voted it out and says it`s ready for action on the floor, strongly suggest that we think it is more important to protect the rule of law to provide a judicial review in the case of the inappropriate, without cause abrupt firing of the special counsel, than to litigate the fine points of its constitutionality on the floor of the Senate.</p><p>TODD: Senator Flake, why do you think your colleagues are willing to push back at the president on Saudi Arabia, how they`ve handled Khashoggi.</p><p>FLAKE: Right.</p><p>TODD: On Syria today. And I want to get you, guys, reactions to that actually in a second. But not on this. Why the fear on this but no fear at pushing back on him on trade, no fear on Saudi Arabia? Why so much fear on pushing back on this?</p><p>FLAKE: Well, this is so central to what the president talks about every day and he has been on this for months and months and months, how this is a witch hunt.</p><p>And I think my colleagues realize, they`ll be on the wrong end of a tweet or an outrage by the president. So, but I think it`s far more important to protect the integrity of this investigation. It is not a witch hunt. It has led to 12 indictments of Russian nationals, as well as indictments of Americans.</p><p>So, this is a serious investigation that has to reach its conclusion. I just don`t understand how my colleagues can be so sanguine about this. I really don`t.</p><p>TODD: Senator Coons, are you comforted by the fact that it looks like Mueller himself has protected himself. I mean, when you look at pieces of the investigation that he`s farmed out to the Southern District of New York, the U.S. attorney in D.C., the eastern district of Virginia, he seems to both been very careful about sticking to his mandate, staying very narrow on Russia and every other criminal enterprise he finds, he makes sure a fixed U.S. attorney has it. Does that make you feel better?</p><p>COONS: That`s right. That`s right, Chuck. I am reassured by the ways in which Robert Mueller is diligently, carefully, and with great persistence pursuing his mandate and then sending to other jurisdictions criminal matters that deserve prompt follow-up that they can handle.</p><p>But that doesn`t mean that the Mueller investigation is not at risk. As the tempo has picked up. As the number of indictments, and sentencing hearings and charges has picked up, I think it is at its greatest moment of risk.</p><p>When we leave when Congress goes out of session which I think may happen as soon as tonight or tomorrow--</p><p>TODD: Yes.</p><p>COONS: -- I am very concerned President Trump will act on what he repeatedly tweets or says almost every day. He has asserted over and over again that this is a baseless witch hunt that should be shut down. Why most of my Republican colleagues won`t take him at his word and act to stop this slow rolling constitutional crisis coming at us is beyond me.</p><p>I am so thankful to Senator Flake for standing up, for blocking 23 Republican judges in the judiciary committee and for again, joining me and Senator Booker on the floor today, forcing the majority leader to come out and object to our request for a live U.C. vote.</p><p>TODD: Let me pivot the conversation to Syria. Senator Flake, what concerns you more, the decision, itself, or how the president went about doing it and the lack of informing, it looks like state, Pentagon, and Congress at this point? Everybody seemed to cancel their briefings today for fear of not being able to answer any questions about it.</p><p>FLAKE: You know, any time the Pentagon is caught flat-footed, when the president says that he has agreed to withdraw troops from a country, you know you`re in trouble. And so, the process more than anything, but there are serious concerns about the policy implications as well.</p><p>But my golly, the process here to not consult among agencies, particularly with the Department of the State and the Department of Defense is just jaw dropping. It really is.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD: Senator Coons--</p><p>COONS: President Trump is the first president in our nation`s history with no previous experience either in the military or an elected service. And I would have hoped that he chose some humility and consult and rely upon the professional advice of the leaders of our military and also seek input from the State Department.</p><p>But, frankly, this abrupt and ill-considered decision is going to have terrible consequences on the ground in Syria. It`s going to hand the keys to a whole region of Syria to Iran`s forces, to Bashar al-Assad`s murderous regime--</p><p>TODD: Yes.</p><p>COONS: -- and reinforce Putin`s bad behavior, not just in Syria but globally.</p><p>TODD: There is one other group I`m concerned about that I wanted to -- and Senator Flake, I wanted to bring up, and that`s the Kurds, who, of course, basically have been perhaps the best ally the U.S. military has had.</p><p>We know the Turks are thinking, there has been a lot of speculation that Erdogan and Turkey is about to -- you know, that he views the Kurds in northern Syria as more of a threat to him than to ISIS.</p><p>FLAKE: Right.</p><p>TODD: If the U.S. military isn`t in there, are they going to get slaughtered?</p><p>FLAKE: You know, that concern was raised today certainly with the vice president here on Capitol Hill and that is a big concern that many of us have. So, you know, yes, the policy implication of this move are legion, and certainly, the way that the president has gone about this just leaves us all scratching our head.</p><p>TODD: Senator Coons, I can`t tell you, I`ve got a lot of reaction that asks the question of, you can`t help but wonder considering who the major players are in this issue, that the president`s ties to Russia the president`s ties to Saudi Arabia, suddenly are popping up here?</p><p>COONS: I`m gravely concerned by this abrupt decision. I do think it will lead to a lot of loss of life on the ground. And I think it raises the question, the Kurds who have fought so bravely and so hard alongside American troops to take on ISIS and to drive ISIS out of a whole region of Syria, a fight that is not yet over and not yet won.</p><p>For us to abandon them and to see this ground potentially to Turkey, I think more likely to Iran, is a grave mistake. And it does raise concerns about on what basis the president has made this decision.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>COONS: Not just the process but the substance, not just the process and substance, but the consequences of this decision I think are gravely concerning to all of us who heard about it today.</p><p>FLAKE: Let me just say this points up the need again that something that Chris and I have worked on and Tim Kaine and others is to pass an AUMF for- -</p><p>TODD: Yes.</p><p>FLAKE: -- Authorization for Use of Military Force that will allow at least at this point the president, if ISIS pops back up again, to clear authority to get back in. So that desperately, it should have been done by now.</p><p>COONS: Yes.</p><p>FLAKE: But it desperately needs to be done as soon as January.</p><p>TODD: Well, the equal branch of government. We`ll see if the president will abide by it when it comes to these issues of war and peace. Anyways, Senators Flake and Coons, thank you both for coming on together and sharing your views. I appreciate that.</p><p>COONS: Thank you.</p><p>FLAKE: Thank you, Chuck.</p><p>TODD: Up ahead, we told you about deny, debunk, and downplay. Well, it`s not just the team Trump strategy for Russia investigations. It`s also the strategy of most social media companies apparently. And now there is an entirely new uproar over what Facebook may be doing with your personal data. That`s ahead.</p><p>TODD: Welcome back. Tonight I`m obsessed with lunch, maybe dinner, maybe (INAUDIBLE). It all started with my obsession yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Going at loggerheads.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Loggerheads.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sort of loggerheads.</p><p>TODD (on camera): Loggerheads. Wait, loggerheads? We hear the term a lot that`s why I`m proud to announce our newest MTP Daily business idea. It`s Lagerheads Bar &amp; Grill. You know what they say, Washington`s always coming to Lagerheads. And do you know what goes perfectly with a loggerhead lager?</p><p>SEN. TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS: The underlying meaning is a nothingburger.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It`s a nothingburger.</p><p>TODD (on camera): There you have it. Come to Lagerheads and get a great, big nothingburger.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TODD: Well, guess what? A lot of you and a lot of us got to thinking, hey, maybe this ridiculous idea could actually work. So you know, let`s build a menu. So of course, you can`t build a whole restaurant on nothingburgers alone. What else could you put on the Lagerheads` menu?</p><p>Of course, a good meal has to start with bread, right? So how about a breadbasket of deplorables? It is the best of the world`s grain, served naturally with a side of margarine of error. On the appetizer menu, it`s a vast barbecue wing conspiracy. We`ll serve the right or the left wings. It`s your choice. We`re bipartisan at Lagerheads.</p><p>Maybe a side of lame duck fat fries is to your liking. Yes, we do all of our frying in duck fat, so it`s really good. Or for the health conscious costumer, how about a tossed word salad? And hey, you can even get it with Russian dressing on the side.</p><p>TODD: Welcome back. Earlier, we talked about the denial, debunked downplay strategy employed by President Trump and his allies with the Russian probe. Folks, they are not the only ones running this PR strategy.</p><p>The same playbook is being used by big tech. Here`s Facebook CEO and chairman Mark Zuckerberg testifying before the House in April, telling Congresswoman Doris Matsui that Facebook users have complete control over their data.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: One core tenant of our advertising system is that we don`t sell data to advertisers. Advertisers don`t get access to your data.</p><p>REP. DORIS MATSUI (D), CALIFORNIA: But we`re not controlling that data.</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: No, you have complete control over that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: Ah, not true. According to a story out in The New York Times today, some companies had access to users` data even if they had disabled all sharing. Facebook allowed Microsoft`s Bing search engine to see the names of virtually all Facebook users` friends without consent, and by the way gave Netflix and Spotify the ability to read Facebook users` private messages.</p><p>Facebook told the Times that most of its partner companies are \"service providers,\" which exempts them from data regulations. Ah, see, deny, then debunk. You see where they are going here.</p><p>Joining me now is somebody who just loves social media companies these days. It`s Kara Swisher, the executive editor of Recode.</p><p>KARA SWISHER, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, RECODE: Hi, Chuck.</p><p>TODD: Hi, Kara. I thought of you today. I thought of our podcast a few weeks ago.</p><p>SWISHER: Yep.</p><p>TODD: When you basically said, I don`t know if a social media, if there is any good that comes out of a social media company anymore, and I thought it was a pretty rough --</p><p>SWISHER: Yeah.</p><p>TODD: -- rough thing to say, and then the Facebook story this morning.</p><p>SWISHER: Well, I think the question is what control you have over it and what you know about it. I thin one of the issues -- when I read the story, one of the things that really struck me is how little, how sloppy they were around the data. I think that`s what people are worried about. What happens to data? What they think consent is? What they don`t think consent is?</p><p>And the fact that there are no real rules, even though they say their rules and say you have complete control, until regulators step in and really make it very clear what the rules of the road are, these companies are able to make rules of their own instead of stretch them.</p><p>And so that`s what gets confusing in this whole thing, is that they stay -- I think Mark Zuckerberg does believe you gave consent to do the things he`s allowed his partners to do.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>SWISHER: So that`s the problem here.</p><p>TODD: Let`s be realistic. We talked about it this morning. The consent -- their whole goal is to not inform you how often they plan on using your data, right? So, it`s like, OK, we`re going to get your consent --</p><p>SWISHER: Right.</p><p>TODD: -- as quickly and early as possible.</p><p>SWISHER: Yeah.</p><p>TODD: We`ll make you do it. If you want to download this app, give us all your consent now.</p><p>SWISHER: Right.</p><p>TODD: It`s like a pressure tactic. I don`t think we realize we are basically under a privacy sharing pressure tactic in that moment that they tell us, download that app.</p><p>SWISHER: Or if you want to use an app, you want to use Spotify by signing in with Facebook. All kinds of things. It`s highly confusing. It`s meant to be convenient. I think it`s hard (ph) it`s meant to be convenient. And what it is, is they tend to pars words. I was just having a Twitter war with someone who used to work at Facebook.</p><p>We don`t sell your data. Well, they actually don`t sell your data to advertisers. Mark is absolutely accurate in that. What they do is they take data and then they match (ph) it with other data and they pull it and they target and they put it on and then they sell the insights to advertisers and they let you target.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SWISHER: So they are kind of selling your data without selling your data. And so what you do is you get arguments with these ad people over -- the fact of the matter is you don`t have control over what happens. Are you are uploading so much data into these systems, not just via Facebook, via Twitter, via your cell phone, via your home nest machine, whatever, they`re everywhere.</p><p>So that`s the question, who has control over this data and what should happen to it? It is a really good question for regulators.</p><p>TODD: The other thing I have here is -- you know, we talk about all the time the trust that I think has been lost by the president and particularly his legal team with how far they`ve gone to spin Russia developments. Every one of them gets debunked. And suddenly if you apply the same standard to social media companies, we can start with Facebook, is Facebook aware of how bad they look?</p><p>Let me just put up four examples, three examples here to point this out. Obviously, it was Mark Zuckerberg`s first reaction, November 11, 2016 when he said, the idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of the content, influence the election in anyway I think is a pretty crazy idea.</p><p>Obviously, his tune has changed. What have we now learned? Two hundred sixty-three million engagements by the internet research agency of the Russians, a Russian troll content on Facebook platforms. That was from the Senate Intelligence Committee.</p><p>And then the story about Facebook employing a Republican oppositin research firm essentially to go after George Soros. That is a political tactic.</p><p>SWISHER: Yeah.</p><p>TODD: That`s attack that we would have expected from a campaign. This is a company that claims, oh, let`s go back to the way it was in the old days of Facebook. Whatever that was.</p><p>SWISHER: Yeah. I think you keep mistaking it for not a company. I mean, these are companies that make billions of dollars. Mark Zuckerberg is a multi-billionaire, $64 billion. These are very wealthy people that are doing a lot of growth at all cost strategies.</p><p>And so I think what happens is, you know, you sort of put them in hoodies and sneakers and you think they`re still not sort of people that want to make as much money as possible. And so these companies need to be aggressive and they should be competitive.</p><p>The question is how they`re doing it and how they`re communicating to users of what they`re using your data for. It`s an advertising business. It`s designed to advertise and to sell toilet paper or toothpaste or whatever.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>SWISHER: You got to keep that in mind. Facebook hates when I say this and they hate when a lot of people say it. In many ways, you are the product they`re selling in some way, but they`re not directly selling you.</p><p>TODD: That`s Tim Cook`s favorite line.</p><p>SWISHER: Yeah, it is. I think he`s right. Even though it`s in Tim Cook`s interest to say, he`s correct when he says it.</p><p>TODD: Here`s I guess the other aspect about this. Do you believe that the social media companies can get their arms around this problem now? You seem to think it`s too late, like as much as maybe they are actually genuinely would like to figure out how to keep these social media networks from being abused, as you have said, Russia used it the exact way it was meant to be used.</p><p>SWISHER: Yeah, I said that yesterday in a column in the Times. Yeah, exactly. I mean, they`re customers of Facebook. That`s what I call them. I said they`re customers of Facebook or Twitter or Google and YouTube.</p><p>I think the problem is the amount of stuff that is coming over these social networks or whatever, any of these digital platforms, it`s so vast. You have to use a combination. A.I. and humans and there`s all the sort of -- it`s global. There are issues that are different in India versus here versus Venezuela.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>SWISHER: It is such a massive -- and then it has societal impact, political impact. These are massive problems as if you took a newspaper and made it a global newspaper that everybody read at once. Who controls that? That`s the big problem. Who can be in charge of figuring this out? And at Facebook, there is only one person, that is Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>TODD: Is Facebook a media company?</p><p>SWISHER: Yes. Different kind.</p><p>TODD: Well, if they were a media company, the amount of fines they would have incurred by now would have put it out of business. Is it time for the federal government to essentially force Facebook to -- because what are you describing all the ways that they could stop this means they have to spend money to essentially on a whole bunch of stuff that will cost them money, not make them money.</p><p>SWISHER: That`s right.</p><p>TODD: And the only way you can make the tobacco companies stop selling, you have to force them. They are never going to do this out of the goodness of their heart.</p><p>SWISHER: There are lots. There is the Communications Decency Act which has Section 230 which grants broad immunity to these platforms. Should these platforms have this broad immunity to do whatever they want?</p><p>It is like they created a city without police, firemen, anything else, and everyone is running wild. It is like a version of \"The Purge\" that goes on every day. You know what I mean. It just keeps going on. The question is who can control this. Probably the government eventually.</p><p>TODD: We`re a long way from when we thought, oh, my god, the Arab spring, social media --</p><p>SWISHER: Yeah.</p><p>TODD: Now, it`s the authoritarian`s favorite tool of choice, is it not?</p><p>SWISHER: It is. It is. And that`s the problem. There is good and bad to it. There is good to it. I love tech. You love tech. It`s not a question of that. It`s a question of how do we manage this so that we can figure out how to make it all the good that it could bring to this world.</p><p>TODD: We just all want to have control of our own privacy.</p><p>SWISHER: Yes, that`s true.</p><p>TODD: That`s all. Not a lot to ask. Probably a lot to spend money, Mr. Zuckerberg. Anyway, Kara Swisher, thank you for never holding back.</p><p>SWISHER: Thanks a lot.</p><p>TODD: Up ahead, why Democrats might have an election situation of biblical proportions. 2020 Vision is next.</p><p>TODD: Welcome back. Today in 2020 Vision, do Democrats have a Noah`s Arc situation, marching two by two into the fray? We love this. The potential field includes at least two Californians, two Ohioans, two Texans, two from Massachusetts and now maybe two Coloradans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D), COLORADO (voice over): I`m thinking about it.</p><p>TODD (voice over): Colorado Senator Michael Bennet confirmed in an interview with Yahoo News that he is considering a run for president, and he is already showing how he`d offer a contrast to President Trump.</p><p>BENNET (voice over): What we have is carnage of our institutions.</p><p>TODD (voice over): But believe it or not, he might find himself competing against his former boss in the 2020 primary. Then it used to be the chief of staff to a mayor of Denver by the name of John Hickenlooper who of course is now about to be the outgoing governor of Colorado. And guess what, he sounds like he wants to be president, too.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How close are you?</p><p>GOV. JOHN HICKENLOOPER (D), COLORADO: I`d say we`re past 50-50, I think we`re probably 63, 64 percent.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TODD: I love the accuracy there. It`s 63 percent, not 62 and not 65. At this rate, though, we can get Democrats from every state marching into the 2020 primary. So why not? Let`s make it 100 candidates, Democrats. We will be back with more MTP Daily right after this.</p><p>TODD: Time now for The Lid. President Trump as you heard earlier is facing some withering criticism from some fellow Republicans for his decision to withdraw troops from Syria and claiming victory over ISIS in doing so. Take listen to some of the push back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA: The decision to withdraw American -- an American presence in Syria is a colossal in my mind a mistake, a great error.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: If Trump withdraws from Syria and they do come back, like I think they will, he will be one of the reasons they came back.</p><p>SEN. BOB CORKER (R), TENNESSEE: Honestly, this makes what Obama did in Iraq, it`s replicating that, but in many ways, it`s even worse.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: The panel is back. Eugene Scott, Ruth Marcus, Matthew Continetti. Matthew, there are sort of two pieces of criticism the president is receiving today. How he unveiled it and the substance of it, what was interesting is the near unanimous, apparently like even the president`s own cabinet is not happy with this decision. I`m referring to both Mattis and Pompeo.</p><p>MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, WASHINGTON FREE BEACON: Well, they have reason not to be happy with it. That`s our presence in Syria providing reassurance there to our allies and presence to kind of deter Assad and the Russia, Turkey, Iran, all the various bad actors in that country from taking hostile actions, we are now removing that.</p><p>And just as American power is off in the lid on that pressure cooker and around the world, you remove that lid from pressure cooker, bad things come out.</p><p>TODD: Ruth, I do think it was interesting to watch the president`s tweets by this. He said I was only there because of ISIS. As we know, he`s a bit of a dove when it came to troops in the Middle East, period. So, he`s always actually been at odds with that one wing of his party (ph).</p><p>RUTH MARCUS, COLUMNIST, THE WASHINGTON POST: More like Obama in that sense than like --</p><p>TODD: I think he`s less hawkish than Obama is. I think you would put him actually to the left on some of these issues.</p><p>MARCUS: I think that`s true. But the thing that`s so tragic to me in this decision is our apparent inability to learn from the mistakes of the past. His own advisers were saying just last week and the other day that the one thing we`ve learned is if you withdraw physical presence, you allow the same problem to recreate itself. Yet, we did it in Afghanistan years ago. We did it in Iraq. We`re about to do it again.</p><p>TODD: And what happened each time? Each time, we have to send more troops back.</p><p>MARCUS: Precisely.</p><p>EUGENE SCOTT, POLITICAL REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST: I think there are two things happening. One, it`s a reminder that we have a president who has not visited any of our troops in action and therefore is perhaps making decisions with a lack of awareness and knowledge that one would hope that a commander in chief would be able to do.</p><p>But something else I`m thinking about is that we see our president campaigning for reelection based on the slogan promises kept. This is a promise he made to his voters in 2016 about ISIS and has not been able to deliver on.</p><p>So whether or not it`s the best decision or the most well informed decision, he wants to double down on it because he can lean in on that, just kind of like the wall, right? Something he campaigned on and that he has to push through despite there being no support for it really or significant support from the base.</p><p>MARCUS: I`m not even sure -- I understand he wants to be out of there, but there`s not a clamor from the base to withdraw the troops.</p><p>TODD: Yeah.</p><p>MARCUS: It`s a small number of troops.</p><p>TODD: Yeah.</p><p>MARCUS: While I think he should go visit the troops, you don`t have to go visit troops to understand that your policy makers, your Republican compatriots in the Senate and the House understand, for good reason, that this is a really bad idea. I wonder if if it`s not a base appeasing mechanism, it`s a distraction mechanism. That`s really scary, terrible thing to suggest.</p><p>CONTINETTI: Or it`s just an impulse that he has and so --</p><p>TODD: It doesn`t help though that there`s a whole bunch of countries involved here that also are being investigated for their ties to Trump.</p><p>CONTINETTI: Sure, but they don`t --</p><p>TODD: I`m just saying --</p><p>CONTINETTI: Saudi Arabia doesn`t benefit from this decision. Saudi Arabia --</p><p>TODD: They don`t but Russia does.</p><p>CONTINETTI: Russia does.</p><p>TODD: Erdogan does. Turkey does.</p><p>CONTINETTI: Americans fired on Russian troops. It`s not like we have the - -</p><p>TODD: No doubt.</p><p>CONTINETTI: Here`s what this reminds me of. His decision to have the summit with Kim earlier this year. If you go back to last spring, that decision came about because Trump was in a conversation with the South Korean national security adviser who brought up President Moon`s progress with Kim and Trump seized on that and said, oh, we`re going to have a summit.</p><p>MARCUS: What does he seize on here?</p><p>CONTINETTI: He seized on a conversation recently he had with the Turkish president, Erdogan.</p><p>TODD: When he found out that Erdogan --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CONTINETTI: We don`t know the contents of that conversation but the fact that this decision is following rapidly on the heels of it suggests to me something was said during that phone call that has led to this result which I believe threatens the national security of the United States.</p><p>TODD: And what happens if the Kurds do get slaughtered there without our presence?</p><p>MARCUS: Well, you know, we will have abandoned them yet again. This is a tragedy in its own right. It`s a mistake in its own right. It also so undercuts the ability of not just the Kurds but of other allies to rely on the United States to do the job, keep its word. Have a policy that is rational and predictable policy. That`s not what we have here.</p><p>SCOTT: And it reinforces some data we have seen in the past year about how the standing of the United States has declined globally in the eyes of many world leaders and just citizens abroad who look to the United States to make the best and most informed decisions on things like this.</p><p>TODD: It`s just a case of us not being there. Thank you, guys. Much appreciate it. Up ahead, something really is out there.</p><p>TODD: In case you missed it, space. It`s quite literally all around us. But do we really know anything about it? Well, perhaps we`re going to know more now. Thanks to one of NASA`s newest hires. Meet Bettina Inclan. She`s a long time GOP spokesperson and activist, and now she`s the newest associate administrator for communication.</p><p>And for Bettina Inclan, talking about space runs in the family. This is her mom. Battina Rodriguez Aguilera. This year, she ran unsuccessfully for Congress in Florida. She was even endorsed by they way by the Miami Herald which called her an unusual candidate. Now, why, you might ask why she is so unusual. Because Bettina Rodriguez Aguilera claims she was once abducted by aliens.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BETTINA RODRIGUEZ AGUILERA, REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR FLORIDA`S 27TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT IN THE U.S. HOUSEI (through translator): My first experience was when I was seven years old. I had a dark connection with three people who look a little bit like you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): Seriously?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TODD: Look, I can`t say for sure whether she was abducted or not, but I can say I know someone who would be jealous.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Beam me up. Beam me up. Beam me up.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: It never did work for legendary Ohio Congressman Jim Traficant.

And this is going to make a lot of people's life better. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WALLACE:  I love you for finding a silver lining. It's a great point. Thank  you for bringing that. My thanks to Ron Klein, Jason Johnson, Michelle  Goldberg, and Nick Confessore. </p><p>That does it for our hour. I'm Nicolle Wallace. \"MTP DAILY\" starts right  now. Hi, Chuck. </p><p>CHUCK TODD, MSNBC HOST:  Hey. The last time they come they got a lot of  nods around here, too.</p><p>WALLACE:  Yes.</p><p>TODD:  So, that's well said. That's well said. Thank you, Nicolle. </p><p>Yes, if it's Wednesday, deny, debunk, downplay. </p><p>Good evening. I am not Patches O'Houlihan. I'm Chuck Todd here in  Washington. And for the five of you that got that joke, enjoy it. Welcome  to MTP DAILY. </p><p>We are following two major stories at this hour. A key part of the  president's legal defense involving that infamous Trump tower Moscow  project has been debunked and you're not going to believe how the  president's lawyer is responding to this one. </p><p>We are also following the fallout from a bombshell story in the New York  Times that suggests Facebook may have lied about what it was doing with  data as sensitive as your private messages. Which raises this question. Has  Facebook, and frankly most of the social media companies been as dishonest  as the president's team has been when it comes to Russia? We're going to  get to that story in a moment as well. </p><p>But we will begin tonight with another unraveling denial involving the  president's ties to, you guessed it, Russia, and another brazen attempt to  try to downplay that falsehood. </p><p>Just three days ago, the president's lawyer said this about the Trump tower  Moscow deal. Which remember, Mr. Trump was negotiating with Russia as  Russia and Putin were executing its campaign against our democracy. </p><p>\"There was a letter of intent to go forward, but no one signed it.\" But  then reporters got their hands-on that letter of intent, and of course it  was signed, none other than by a person's signature we have all become  familiar with. Donald J. Trump's. </p><p>Now here's Giuliani's response according to an interview he gave to the New  York Daily News. Giuliani told the Daily News said, \"of course, Trump  signed it. How could you send it but nobody signed it,\" he said? But  Giuliani claimed the letter was B.S. because it didn't go anywhere. \"That  was the end of it,\" Giuliani said. \"It means nothing but an expression of  interest that means very little unless it goes to a contract and it never  did.\" </p><p>So, the president's team didn't publicly disclose the project. Then when  they did, they didn't mention the letter of intent. Then when they did,  they claimed it wasn't signed. Then when we learned it was, they claimed  it's all B.S. anyway.</p><p>Folks, this pattern of deny, which gets debunked so they downplay is  frankly a story that we told so many times. And it's always about the same  topic. This one, Russia. When will it stop? Maybe when enough people demand  that it stop. </p><p>Let's bring in tonight's panel. Eugene Scott, political reporter at the  Washington Post. Ruth Marcus, Washington Post columnist and deputy  editorial page editor, she's also an MSNBC contributor, Matthew Continetti,  editor-in-chief of the Washington Free Beacon. Welcome all. </p><p>Eugene, if I just stop there, we could just say this is Rudy Giuliani being  Rudy Giuliani, but the same defense, deny, then downplay when it comes to  firing Comey. Let me put up the examples here. \"The day it was happened the  Russia investigation is not what this is about,\" said Mike Pence on May  10th. </p><p>Donald Trump on May 12th, \"when I decided to do it, I said to myself this  Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.\" Then of course, the  Trump legal team memo, on January 29, 2018 where they said, \"A president  can fire an FBI director at any time for any reason.\" The point is this is  a pattern. </p><p>EUGENE SCOTT, POLITICAL REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST:  It certainly is.  And it's not doing the president any favors at all. At least at the very  least it's certainly bringing in Rudy Giuliani's legacy into question as  we've seen someone who at least made headlines or was praised for being  tough on law, among, you know, more conservative politicos. </p><p>Turn to someone who seems to dismiss criminal activities altogether when it  involves someone that he is personally connected to. And it's very  problematic in this situation because there could be very real implications  for the American people and those who rely on the president to serve  citizen's best interest when it comes to national security. </p><p>TODD:  Matthew, I just don't understand where, because like I said, let me  do the Trump tower meeting. The same thing happened there. The story comes  out on July 8th, 2017 Donald Trump, Jr., says we primarily discussed a  program about the adoption of Russian children. </p><p>Five days later, the answer is this. Donald Trump, \"it's called opposition  research. It's very standard where they have information, you take the  information.\" But July 30th, \"collusion is not a crime.\" </p><p>MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, WASHINGTON FREE BEACON:  We go back  even further in time and probably go to some of those articles in the New  York Daily News and New York Post--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD:  I got more here, don't worry.</p><p>CONTINETTI:  -- and National Enquirer. </p><p>TODD:  I got hush money payments, Matt. </p><p>CONTINETTI:  I mean, this is who the man is, right?</p><p>TODD:  Yes. This is the pattern. It's the same pattern. When does it stop? </p><p>CONTINETTI:  Probably never. But here's the difference, though, starting in  January, Democrats are going to have control of the House and they are  going to be in charge of those investigating committees and they are going  to have subpoena power. </p><p>And even if that doesn't reach the president, himself, it's going to start  getting at kind of the people in the president's orbit and they are going  to be held to kind of higher standard for truth and veracity than say the  president has been or his lawyer in the national media. </p><p>TODD:  Rush, as I've said, I got the hush money payment example. And I'll  be darn if I'm going to get all these examples on air. On November 4, 2016  the Trump campaign statement, \"We have no knowledge of any of this.\" By  December 14, it became, Michael Cohen, \"Mr. Trump directed me to make the  payments.\" And by December 14, \"This was not a big crime.\" </p><p>RUTH MARCUS, DEPUTY EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, THE WASHINGTON POST:  Right.</p><p>TODD:  That one took almost two years for them to their eventual--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MARCUS:  To unravel. </p><p>TODD:  They at least kept that one afloat for a while. </p><p>MARCUS:  Well, from the president on down the first instinct is to lie to  not tell the truth when confronted with an inconvenient fact or allegation  and then you just start to peel the onion and the layers that you laid out  until you get to the truth. </p><p>And for me, the touchstone is, if we knew during the campaign--</p><p>TODD:  Right.</p><p>MARCUS:  -- what we know how about all the things you've unspoiled about  the fact that the president was negotiating to build a tower in Moscow when  he was running, about the Trump tower meeting, about the hush money  payments, where would we be? Would he be in the White House? I think that's  a serious question and you have been asking the next serious question,  which is, when will it be enough? And maybe the answer is in the next  election. </p><p>TODD:  Eugene, does this even happen on policy? We put together, it's a  little bit out of order, it was decry, deny, downplay when it came to child  separation. So that happened. </p><p>And then the president said, \"I hate to see the separation of parents and  children.\" Secretary Nielsen says a couple of days later, \"We do not have a  policy of separating families at the border. Period.\"</p><p>Of course, we end up finding up that yes, this was the intent of doing  this. And then by November 25th, the president said, \"We had the exact same  policy as the Obama administration.\"</p><p>Again, I know it's instinctual. It goes to what Ruth just said, but I guess  the question is, you have about 55 percent of the country that's worn out  from this. But you do have you 40 to 45 percent that it doesn't bother  them. </p><p>SCOTT:  Absolutely. And one thing that we know the president is mindful of  is his base. These supporters who have gone--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TODD:  That's the only thing he's mindful of. </p><p>SCOTT:  Very much so. We usually we see presidents when he head towards the  midterm start to think about the people who weren't supportive of them  initially hoping to win them. </p><p>TODD:  You want to grow? Right?</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SCOTT:  It's the new people-- </p><p>TODD:  I know that's crazy. </p><p>SCOTT:  It's the new people on the Trump train. Right? That's not something  that he's seen. And one of the things that's been really fascinating and  disheartening about how the president has handled this Russia  investigation, is he seems to be very mindful of his base, knowing these  people will support him regardless. But he didn't pay attention to the fact  that the base is not as large as it was in 2016. </p><p>There are people who voted for Trump and Trump-like characters, candidates  should I say, in 2016 who did not in 2018 and in part it's because of this  pattern of dishonesty. </p><p>TODD:  You know, Matthew, I think he's right. You know, watching the Trump  base, and you look at it. It got as high as 46. But you do see it's like if  you look at it maybe it's down to 34, 35, who believe he's never been  dishonest about it. You know, you're starting to see it's not a -- it's  like a small leak out of an inflated raft. You know, it's not sinking yet,  but. </p><p>CONTINETTI:  Sure, his personal approval has always been pretty low even  among the people who support him. </p><p>TODD:  Right. People like -- that's right. Yes.</p><p>CONTINETTI:  Exactly. And so, he still retains pretty high support among  Republicans, probably enough to deter any primary challenge.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TODD:  Higher -- higher than the last two -- higher than the last two  Republican presidents. </p><p>MARCUS:  I went back and I looked at the approval ratings for the party of  the president in power. He is above where President Obama was, above where  most presidents have been in recent years. It's extraordinary. But it is a  kind of condensed stock that's boiled down to its essence as the party base  strengths. </p><p>SCOTT:  And on this issue, they're not really supportive. I've wrote about  it today in the Washington Post, only about a third of Republicans actually  believe what Trump is saying about Russia and the 2016 election. They still  support him but they don't believe him. </p><p>TODD:  There is a, you know, the rhetorical question I asked is simply,  when will it stop? When will enough people demand that it stopped? Well,  there is a group of people that could have done something about it or  attempted to, it's elected Republicans in Washington. They have chosen not  to. Here's Paul Ryan today in his farewell speech. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAUL RYAN, UNITED STATES SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  I leave as I came here, an  optimist to the core. Just as remarkable as what we have achieved is what  we have the capacity to do still. So, here's to the people. Here's to the  people's House. Here's to possibilities. Thank you for everything. God  bless America. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD:  I lump the two here because you could make the Republican Party rank  and file care if other Republicans like him cared. </p><p>CONTINETTI:  Yes, maybe. I mean, other--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TODD:  I'm just -- maybe not. </p><p>CONTINETTI:  -- Republicans raise this issue are rejected by the Republican  base, which is--</p><p>TODD:  That's true.</p><p>CONTINETTI:  -- totally the president's corner. So, I'm not so sure. But  the irony is--</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TODD:  But that's the truth. That look like an alien. </p><p>CONTINETTI:  The Republican Congress--</p><p>TODD:  Today.</p><p>CONTINETTI:  -- or the Republican caucus in next year's Congress is  actually going to be more pro-Trump--</p><p>TODD:  More Trumpy.</p><p>CONTINETTI:  -- than the one that Paul Ryan led for the last two years, so. </p><p>TODD:  Because he and a bunch of others are leaving. </p><p>CONTINETTI:  This is where we are. I mean, the people who are going to stop  Trump are not going to be Republicans, they are going to a combination of  Democrats and independents. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD:  But do you believe that?</p><p>CONTINETTI:  Some Republicans in 2020 if they stop him. </p><p>TODD:  I believe that if it's at the ballot box. But if your -- if he is --  if you are going to hold him accountable before the election, then it is  going to take Republicans jumping on board. Right? </p><p>MARCUS:  Republican elected officials will desert the president if and only  if, when and only when, it is in their political interest. And that will  be, if something happens or the facts develop to the point where they  understand that the base is deserting the president and that it will be  safe for them in primaries. Period. </p><p>That's why I think your question has it backwards. Paul Ryan isn't leaving  the people. The people are leaving Paul Ryan. It's not just Paul Ryan. </p><p>TODD:  I understand politically why he didn't. </p><p>MARCUS:  I think you did. I think that you understood politically. </p><p>TODD:  No, I understand why he did it politically. But if you are  frustrated, my whole point is there is one whole group of people that could  have an impact if they chose to. </p><p>SCOTT:  If they chose to, but they haven't felt empower to do it because  they are so mindful of the base. Now we did see after the midterms, some  Republican lawmakers are bit more willing to speak out against Trump  because they looked at the numbers and realized that the Republican  electorate was not as on board with Trump as they perhaps previously  thought. </p><p>And so, if that base continues to decline, and I don't know what it would  make for them to maybe some changes in the economy, I think we could see  the Republican lawmakers stand up to Trump in ways we haven't in the past  two years. </p><p>MARCUS:  We do. Do you see some outpourings of frustration on Khashoggi, on  Yemen--</p><p>SCOTT:  Right.</p><p>MARCUS:  -- on Syria today. So, a little. Not a lot. </p><p>TODD:  No, I mean, I know--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MARCUS:  But it's something.</p><p>TODD:  I know it's there. And you do -- but I also get like those that have  popped up. I mean, Bob Corker wanted to get back in the race. He couldn't  have won. And Jeff Flake he didn't retire because he wanted to retire. I  mean, he, himself, if he could have gotten elected, I think he'd run. </p><p>CONTINETTI:  I think the bargain that Trump has made with Republican  lawmakers, is I'll sign on to your agenda and in exchange for that you give  me a pass on a lot of this other stuff. Once he starts departing from that  agenda, that traditional Republicanism, if he starts flirting with taxes. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD:  What's left? What do you mean if he is departing for judicial  Republicanism? </p><p>CONTINETTI:  If he nominates a Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court.</p><p>TODD:  OK, that's what it would take. Yes.</p><p>CONTINETTI:  Judges, taxes, if he doesn't build a wall. </p><p>TODD:  But on national security. </p><p>CONTINETTI:  National security we saw an outrage today from the United  States Senate because he's withdrawing precipitously from Syria. So, it's  there. It's just on policy, not on the stuff that occupies a lot of  (Inaudible)--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD:  But even on--</p><p>CONTINETTI:  from Washington. </p><p>TODD:  But even on policy, it's rhetorical and they do back off at the end  of it. </p><p>CONTINETTI:  What? I mean, what do you--</p><p>TODD:  Meaning like they give you the sense of the Senate.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MARCUS:  Brace a resolution. </p><p>TODD:  That's right. They--</p><p>CONTINETTI:  That's all they can do with a lot of these policies. </p><p>TODD:  Well, no, they could do more if they chose to. Here they could have  funding fights, they could do some things like this. They're not --I guess- -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CONTINETTI:  They are -- they are members of the same party. </p><p>TODD:  I understand. </p><p>CONTINETTI:  So, they do have to work together to some extent. </p><p>TODD:  Right. I guess the question is, do any of them worry about what this  is going to look like in two years? </p><p>SCOTT:  I think certainly, and I think that's what we got a taste of with  the whole Khashoggi situation. Where we saw people come out and say,  absolutely, Trump, the way you are responding to Saudi Arabia is not  consistent with how we believe an American president or any elected  leadership. </p><p>And they are very mindful of their legacy. So, I think in part because  they're looking at some of these farewell speeches that they saw Orrin  Hatch give, Jeff Flake give, Paul Ryan give and some of these people were  getting laughed out a bit. </p><p>TODD:  Well, that is what's funny. Every one of these farewell speeches,  whether Republican or Democrat all contain these subtle shots at Trump. It  is sort of remarkable whether really subtle or not, Ruth. </p><p>MARCUS:  Well, maybe they're looking at those farewell speeches and  thinking I don't want to be saying farewell like that guy had to. Because a  lot of them as you pointed out--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD:  Yes. Wanted to stay.</p><p>MARCUS:  -- weren't exactly leaving on the best of terms. </p><p>TODD:  Right. All right. We got a lot more. Wait until we get to Facebook.  That's going to be quite the story in a little bit. But anyway, you guys  are sticking around. </p><p>Up next, the bipartisan plan to try to protect Robert Mueller. How is that  working out? They're trying it one more time. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Welcome back. Well, you know the saying if at first you don't  succeed, try, try again.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. JEFF FLAKE, (R) ARIZONA:  We need to protect the independents of the  special counsel and allow this crucial investigation and any like it in the  future to run their course. </p><p>SEN. CHRIS COONS, (D) DELAWARE:  This is an effective and ongoing federal  investigation that must be allowed to reach its conclusion. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD:  Those, of course, were Senators Jeff Flake and Chris Coons a few  hours ago trying for the third time to force a vote on legislation  protecting Robert Mueller's investigation, and just as before, Republicans  blocked this third attempt. </p><p>Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called it a solution in search of a  problem. So now in a week in which President Trump tweeted again that the  Russia probe should be shut down, and in a week in which a new report  claimed that Russia disinformation teams targeted Robert Mueller, himself,  will anything change? </p><p>With me now are those two senators, Republican Jeff Flake of Arizona, in  his last few days as a senator and Democrat Chris Coons of Delaware.  Welcome, gentleman. </p><p>COONS:  Thank you.</p><p>FLAKE:  Thanks, Chuck. </p><p>TODD:  All right. Senator Flake, why was today not any different than  before and will tomorrow be any different than today when it comes to this  Mueller bill? </p><p>FLAKE:  You know, this bill passed the judiciary committee back in April,  so we have been waiting nine months. It passed on a bipartisan basis two to  one. Even and including our chairman he has a languish on the House floor  awaiting for -- I'm sorry, awaiting for action on the Senate floor since  that time. </p><p>And since that time, notably, in November, the president fired the attorney  general. So, to say, you know, the solution is in search of a problem, I  think the problem is that the Mueller probe is in danger and we need to  protect it. </p><p>TODD:  Senator Coons, obviously, Mitch McConnell's rationale has been it's  unconstitutional. He's not convinced. Forget whether the president would  veto it or not, he probably would unless you put it on the spending bill.  But he argues it's unconstitutional anyway so why bother? </p><p>COONS:  I am certain that it's not unconstitutional. And frankly, the fact  that the Republican chairman of the judiciary committee, that a bipartisan  majority of 14 to 7 on the judiciary committee voted it out and says it's  ready for action on the floor, strongly suggest that we think it is more  important to protect the rule of law to provide a judicial review in the  case of the inappropriate, without cause abrupt firing of the special  counsel, than to litigate the fine points of its constitutionality on the  floor of the Senate. </p><p>TODD:  Senator Flake, why do you think your colleagues are willing to push  back at the president on Saudi Arabia, how they've handled Khashoggi.</p><p>FLAKE:  Right.</p><p>TODD:  On Syria today. And I want to get you, guys, reactions to that  actually in a second. But not on this. Why the fear on this but no fear at  pushing back on him on trade, no fear on Saudi Arabia? Why so much fear on  pushing back on this? </p><p>FLAKE:  Well, this is so central to what the president talks about every  day and he has been on this for months and months and months, how this is a  witch hunt.</p><p>And I think my colleagues realize, they'll be on the wrong end of a tweet  or an outrage by the president. So, but I think it's far more important to  protect the integrity of this investigation. It is not a witch hunt. It has  led to 12 indictments of Russian nationals, as well as indictments of  Americans. </p><p>So, this is a serious investigation that has to reach its conclusion. I  just don't understand how my colleagues can be so sanguine about this. I  really don't. </p><p>TODD:  Senator Coons, are you comforted by the fact that it looks like  Mueller himself has protected himself. I mean, when you look at pieces of  the investigation that he's farmed out to the Southern District of New  York, the U.S. attorney in D.C., the eastern district of Virginia, he seems  to both been very careful about sticking to his mandate, staying very  narrow on Russia and every other criminal enterprise he finds, he makes  sure a fixed U.S. attorney has it. Does that make you feel better? </p><p>COONS:  That's right. That's right, Chuck. I am reassured by the ways in  which Robert Mueller is diligently, carefully, and with great persistence  pursuing his mandate and then sending to other jurisdictions criminal  matters that deserve prompt follow-up that they can handle. </p><p>But that doesn't mean that the Mueller investigation is not at risk. As the  tempo has picked up. As the number of indictments, and sentencing hearings  and charges has picked up, I think it is at its greatest moment of risk. </p><p>When we leave when Congress goes out of session which I think may happen as  soon as tonight or tomorrow--</p><p>TODD:  Yes.</p><p>COONS:  -- I am very concerned President Trump will act on what he  repeatedly tweets or says almost every day. He has asserted over and over  again that this is a baseless witch hunt that should be shut down. Why most  of my Republican colleagues won't take him at his word and act to stop this  slow rolling constitutional crisis coming at us is beyond me. </p><p>I am so thankful to Senator Flake for standing up, for blocking 23  Republican judges in the judiciary committee and for again, joining me and  Senator Booker on the floor today, forcing the majority leader to come out  and object to our request for a live U.C. vote. </p><p>TODD:  Let me pivot the conversation to Syria. Senator Flake, what concerns  you more, the decision, itself, or how the president went about doing it  and the lack of informing, it looks like state, Pentagon, and Congress at  this point? Everybody seemed to cancel their briefings today for fear of  not being able to answer any questions about it. </p><p>FLAKE:  You know, any time the Pentagon is caught flat-footed, when the  president says that he has agreed to withdraw troops from a country, you  know you're in trouble. And so, the process more than anything, but there  are serious concerns about the policy implications as well. </p><p>But my golly, the process here to not consult among agencies, particularly  with the Department of the State and the Department of Defense is just jaw  dropping. It really is. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD:  Senator Coons--</p><p>COONS:  President Trump is the first president in our nation's history with  no previous experience either in the military or an elected service. And I  would have hoped that he chose some humility and consult and rely upon the  professional advice of the leaders of our military and also seek input from  the State Department. </p><p>But, frankly, this abrupt and ill-considered decision is going to have  terrible consequences on the ground in Syria. It's going to hand the keys  to a whole region of Syria to Iran's forces, to Bashar al-Assad's murderous  regime--</p><p>TODD:  Yes.</p><p>COONS:  -- and reinforce Putin's bad behavior, not just in Syria but  globally. </p><p>TODD:  There is one other group I'm concerned about that I wanted to -- and  Senator Flake, I wanted to bring up, and that's the Kurds, who, of course,  basically have been perhaps the best ally the U.S. military has had. </p><p>We know the Turks are thinking, there has been a lot of speculation that  Erdogan and Turkey is about to -- you know, that he views the Kurds in  northern Syria as more of a threat to him than to ISIS. </p><p>FLAKE:  Right.</p><p>TODD:  If the U.S. military isn't in there, are they going to get  slaughtered? </p><p>FLAKE:  You know, that concern was raised today certainly with the vice  president here on Capitol Hill and that is a big concern that many of us  have. So, you know, yes, the policy implication of this move are legion,  and certainly, the way that the president has gone about this just leaves  us all scratching our head. </p><p>TODD:  Senator Coons, I can't tell you, I've got a lot of reaction that  asks the question of, you can't help but wonder considering who the major  players are in this issue, that the president's ties to Russia the  president's ties to Saudi Arabia, suddenly are popping up here? </p><p>COONS:  I'm gravely concerned by this abrupt decision. I do think it will  lead to a lot of loss of life on the ground. And I think it raises the  question, the Kurds who have fought so bravely and so hard alongside  American troops to take on ISIS and to drive ISIS out of a whole region of  Syria, a fight that is not yet over and not yet won. </p><p>For us to abandon them and to see this ground potentially to Turkey, I  think more likely to Iran, is a grave mistake. And it does raise concerns  about on what basis the president has made this decision. </p><p>TODD:  Right.</p><p>COONS:  Not just the process but the substance, not just the process and  substance, but the consequences of this decision I think are gravely  concerning to all of us who heard about it today. </p><p>FLAKE:  Let me just say this points up the need again that something that  Chris and I have worked on and Tim Kaine and others is to pass an AUMF for- -</p><p>TODD:  Yes.</p><p>FLAKE:  -- Authorization for Use of Military Force that will allow at least  at this point the president, if ISIS pops back up again, to clear authority  to get back in. So that desperately, it should have been done by now. </p><p>COONS:  Yes.</p><p>FLAKE:  But it desperately needs to be done as soon as January. </p><p>TODD:  Well, the equal branch of government. We'll see if the president  will abide by it when it comes to these issues of war and peace. Anyways,  Senators Flake and Coons, thank you both for coming on together and sharing  your views. I appreciate that. </p><p>COONS:  Thank you.</p><p>FLAKE:  Thank you, Chuck. </p><p>TODD:  Up ahead, we told you about deny, debunk, and downplay. Well, it's  not just the team Trump strategy for Russia investigations. It's also the  strategy of most social media companies apparently. And now there is an  entirely new uproar over what Facebook may be doing with your personal  data. That's ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Welcome back. Tonight I'm obsessed with lunch, maybe dinner, maybe  (INAUDIBLE). It all started with my obsession yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Going at loggerheads.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Loggerheads.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Sort of loggerheads.</p><p>TODD (on camera):  Loggerheads. Wait, loggerheads? We hear the term a lot  that's why I'm proud to announce our newest MTP Daily business idea. It's  Lagerheads Bar &amp; Grill. You know what they say, Washington's always coming  to Lagerheads. And do you know what goes perfectly with a loggerhead lager?</p><p>SEN. TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS:  The underlying meaning is a nothingburger.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's a nothingburger.</p><p>TODD (on camera):  There you have it. Come to Lagerheads and get a great,  big nothingburger.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TODD:  Well, guess what? A lot of you and a lot of us got to thinking, hey,  maybe this ridiculous idea could actually work. So you know, let's build a  menu. So of course, you can't build a whole restaurant on nothingburgers  alone. What else could you put on the Lagerheads' menu?</p><p>Of course, a good meal has to start with bread, right? So how about a  breadbasket of deplorables? It is the best of the world's grain, served  naturally with a side of margarine of error. On the appetizer menu, it's a  vast barbecue wing conspiracy. We'll serve the right or the left wings.  It's your choice. We're bipartisan at Lagerheads.</p><p>Maybe a side of lame duck fat fries is to your liking. Yes, we do all of  our frying in duck fat, so it's really good. Or for the health conscious  costumer, how about a tossed word salad? And hey, you can even get it with  Russian dressing on the side.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Welcome back. Earlier, we talked about the denial, debunked downplay  strategy employed by President Trump and his allies with the Russian probe.  Folks, they are not the only ones running this PR strategy.</p><p>The same playbook is being used by big tech. Here's Facebook CEO and  chairman Mark Zuckerberg testifying before the House in April, telling  Congresswoman Doris Matsui that Facebook users have complete control over  their data.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  One core tenant of our advertising system  is that we don't sell data to advertisers. Advertisers don't get access to  your data.</p><p>REP. DORIS MATSUI (D), CALIFORNIA:  But we're not controlling that data. </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  No, you have complete control over that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD:  Ah, not true. According to a story out in The New York Times today,  some companies had access to users' data even if they had disabled all  sharing. Facebook allowed Microsoft's Bing search engine to see the names  of virtually all Facebook users' friends without consent, and by the way  gave Netflix and Spotify the ability to read Facebook users' private  messages.</p><p>Facebook told the Times that most of its partner companies are \"service  providers,\" which exempts them from data regulations. Ah, see, deny, then  debunk. You see where they are going here.</p><p>Joining me now is somebody who just loves social media companies these  days. It's Kara Swisher, the executive editor of Recode.</p><p>KARA SWISHER, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, RECODE:  Hi, Chuck.</p><p>TODD:  Hi, Kara. I thought of you today. I thought of our podcast a few  weeks ago. </p><p>SWISHER:  Yep. </p><p>TODD:  When you basically said, I don't know if a social media, if there is  any good that comes out of a social media company anymore, and I thought it  was a pretty rough --</p><p>SWISHER:  Yeah.</p><p>TODD:  -- rough thing to say, and then the Facebook story this morning.</p><p>SWISHER:  Well, I think the question is what control you have over it and  what you know about it. I thin one of the issues -- when I read the story,  one of the things that really struck me is how little, how sloppy they were  around the data. I think that's what people are worried about. What happens  to data? What they think consent is? What they don't think consent is?</p><p>And the fact that there are no real rules, even though they say their rules  and say you have complete control, until regulators step in and really make  it very clear what the rules of the road are, these companies are able to  make rules of their own instead of stretch them.</p><p>And so that's what gets confusing in this whole thing, is that they stay --  I think Mark Zuckerberg does believe you gave consent to do the things he's  allowed his partners to do.</p><p>TODD:  Right.</p><p>SWISHER:  So that's the problem here.</p><p>TODD:  Let's be realistic. We talked about it this morning. The consent --  their whole goal is to not inform you how often they plan on using your  data, right? So, it's like, OK, we're going to get your consent --</p><p>SWISHER:  Right.</p><p>TODD:  -- as quickly and early as possible.</p><p>SWISHER:  Yeah.</p><p>TODD:  We'll make you do it. If you want to download this app, give us all  your consent now.</p><p>SWISHER:  Right.</p><p>TODD:  It's like a pressure tactic. I don't think we realize we are  basically under a privacy sharing pressure tactic in that moment that they  tell us, download that app.</p><p>SWISHER:  Or if you want to use an app, you want to use Spotify by signing  in with Facebook. All kinds of things. It's highly confusing. It's meant to  be convenient. I think it's hard (ph) it's meant to be convenient. And what  it is, is they tend to pars words. I was just having a Twitter war with  someone who used to work at Facebook.</p><p>We don't sell your data. Well, they actually don't sell your data to  advertisers. Mark is absolutely accurate in that. What they do is they take  data and then they match (ph) it with other data and they pull it and they  target and they put it on and then they sell the insights to advertisers  and they let you target.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SWISHER:  So they are kind of selling your data without selling your data.  And so what you do is you get arguments with these ad people over -- the  fact of the matter is you don't have control over what happens. Are you are  uploading so much data into these systems, not just via Facebook, via  Twitter, via your cell phone, via your home nest machine, whatever, they're  everywhere.</p><p>So that's the question, who has control over this data and what should  happen to it? It is a really good question for regulators.</p><p>TODD:  The other thing I have here is -- you know, we talk about all the  time the trust that I think has been lost by the president and particularly  his legal team with how far they've gone to spin Russia developments. Every  one of them gets debunked. And suddenly if you apply the same standard to  social media companies, we can start with Facebook, is Facebook aware of  how bad they look?</p><p>Let me just put up four examples, three examples here to point this out.  Obviously, it was Mark Zuckerberg's first reaction, November 11, 2016 when  he said, the idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount  of the content, influence the election in anyway I think is a pretty crazy  idea.</p><p>Obviously, his tune has changed. What have we now learned? Two hundred  sixty-three million engagements by the internet research agency of the  Russians, a Russian troll content on Facebook platforms. That was from the  Senate Intelligence Committee.</p><p>And then the story about Facebook employing a Republican oppositin research  firm essentially to go after George Soros. That is a political tactic.</p><p>SWISHER:  Yeah.</p><p>TODD:  That's attack that we would have expected from a campaign. This is a  company that claims, oh, let's go back to the way it was in the old days of  Facebook. Whatever that was.</p><p>SWISHER:  Yeah. I think you keep mistaking it for not a company. I mean,  these are companies that make billions of dollars. Mark Zuckerberg is a  multi-billionaire, $64 billion. These are very wealthy people that are  doing a lot of growth at all cost strategies.</p><p>And so I think what happens is, you know, you sort of put them in hoodies  and sneakers and you think they're still not sort of people that want to  make as much money as possible. And so these companies need to be  aggressive and they should be competitive.</p><p>The question is how they're doing it and how they're communicating to users  of what they're using your data for. It's an advertising business. It's  designed to advertise and to sell toilet paper or toothpaste or whatever.</p><p>TODD:  Right.</p><p>SWISHER:  You got to keep that in mind. Facebook hates when I say this and  they hate when a lot of people say it. In many ways, you are the product  they're selling in some way, but they're not directly selling you.</p><p>TODD:  That's Tim Cook's favorite line.</p><p>SWISHER:  Yeah, it is. I think he's right. Even though it's in Tim Cook's  interest to say, he's correct when he says it.</p><p>TODD:  Here's I guess the other aspect about this. Do you believe that the  social media companies can get their arms around this problem now? You seem  to think it's too late, like as much as maybe they are actually genuinely  would like to figure out how to keep these social media networks from being  abused, as you have said, Russia used it the exact way it was meant to be  used.</p><p>SWISHER:  Yeah, I said that yesterday in a column in the Times. Yeah,  exactly. I mean, they're customers of Facebook. That's what I call them. I  said they're customers of Facebook or Twitter or Google and YouTube.</p><p>I think the problem is the amount of stuff that is coming over these social  networks or whatever, any of these digital platforms, it's so vast. You  have to use a combination. A.I. and humans and there's all the sort of --  it's global. There are issues that are different in India versus here  versus Venezuela.</p><p>TODD:  Right.</p><p>SWISHER:  It is such a massive -- and then it has societal impact,  political impact. These are massive problems as if you took a newspaper and  made it a global newspaper that everybody read at once. Who controls that?  That's the big problem. Who can be in charge of figuring this out? And at  Facebook, there is only one person, that is Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>TODD:  Is Facebook a media company?</p><p>SWISHER:  Yes. Different kind.</p><p>TODD:  Well, if they were a media company, the amount of fines they would  have incurred by now would have put it out of business. Is it time for the  federal government to essentially force Facebook to -- because what are you  describing all the ways that they could stop this means they have to spend  money to essentially on a whole bunch of stuff that will cost them money,  not make them money.</p><p>SWISHER:  That's right.</p><p>TODD:  And the only way you can make the tobacco companies stop selling,  you have to force them. They are never going to do this out of the goodness  of their heart.</p><p>SWISHER:  There are lots. There is the Communications Decency Act which has  Section 230 which grants broad immunity to these platforms. Should these  platforms have this broad immunity to do whatever they want?</p><p>It is like they created a city without police, firemen, anything else, and  everyone is running wild. It is like a version of \"The Purge\" that goes on  every day. You know what I mean. It just keeps going on. The question is  who can control this. Probably the government eventually.</p><p>TODD:  We're a long way from when we thought, oh, my god, the Arab spring,  social media --</p><p>SWISHER:  Yeah.</p><p>TODD:  Now, it's the authoritarian's favorite tool of choice, is it not?</p><p>SWISHER:  It is. It is. And that's the problem. There is good and bad to  it. There is good to it. I love tech. You love tech. It's not a question of  that. It's a question of how do we manage this so that we can figure out  how to make it all the good that it could bring to this world.</p><p>TODD:  We just all want to have control of our own privacy.</p><p>SWISHER:  Yes, that's true.</p><p>TODD:  That's all. Not a lot to ask. Probably a lot to spend money, Mr.  Zuckerberg. Anyway, Kara Swisher, thank you for never holding back.</p><p>SWISHER:  Thanks a lot.</p><p>TODD:  Up ahead, why Democrats might have an election situation of biblical  proportions. 2020 Vision is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Welcome back. Today in 2020 Vision, do Democrats have a Noah's Arc  situation, marching two by two into the fray? We love this. The potential  field includes at least two Californians, two Ohioans, two Texans, two from  Massachusetts and now maybe two Coloradans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D), COLORADO (voice over):  I'm thinking about it. </p><p>TODD (voice over):  Colorado Senator Michael Bennet confirmed in an  interview with Yahoo News that he is considering a run for president, and  he is already showing how he'd offer a contrast to President Trump.</p><p>BENNET (voice over):  What we have is carnage of our institutions.</p><p>TODD (voice over):  But believe it or not, he might find himself competing  against his former boss in the 2020 primary. Then it used to be the chief  of staff to a mayor of Denver by the name of John Hickenlooper who of  course is now about to be the outgoing governor of Colorado. And guess  what, he sounds like he wants to be president, too.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  How close are you?</p><p>GOV. JOHN HICKENLOOPER (D), COLORADO:  I'd say we're past 50-50, I think  we're probably 63, 64 percent.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TODD:  I love the accuracy there. It's 63 percent, not 62 and not 65. At  this rate, though, we can get Democrats from every state marching into the  2020 primary. So why not? Let's make it 100 candidates, Democrats. We will  be back with more MTP Daily right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  Time now for The Lid. President Trump as you heard earlier is facing  some withering criticism from some fellow Republicans for his decision to  withdraw troops from Syria and claiming victory over ISIS in doing so. Take  listen to some of the push back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA:  The decision to withdraw American -- an  American presence in Syria is a colossal in my mind a mistake, a great  error.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  If Trump withdraws from Syria and  they do come back, like I think they will, he will be one of the reasons  they came back.</p><p>SEN. BOB CORKER (R), TENNESSEE:  Honestly, this makes what Obama did in  Iraq, it's replicating that, but in many ways, it's even worse.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD:  The panel is back. Eugene Scott, Ruth Marcus, Matthew Continetti.  Matthew, there are sort of two pieces of criticism the president is  receiving today. How he unveiled it and the substance of it, what was  interesting is the near unanimous, apparently like even the president's own  cabinet is not happy with this decision. I'm referring to both Mattis and  Pompeo.</p><p>MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, WASHINGTON FREE BEACON:  Well, they  have reason not to be happy with it. That's our presence in Syria providing  reassurance there to our allies and presence to kind of deter Assad and the  Russia, Turkey, Iran, all the various bad actors in that country from  taking hostile actions, we are now removing that.</p><p>And just as American power is off in the lid on that pressure cooker and  around the world, you remove that lid from pressure cooker, bad things come  out.</p><p>TODD:  Ruth, I do think it was interesting to watch the president's tweets  by this. He said I was only there because of ISIS. As we know, he's a bit  of a dove when it came to troops in the Middle East, period. So, he's  always actually been at odds with that one wing of his party (ph). </p><p>RUTH MARCUS, COLUMNIST, THE WASHINGTON POST:  More like Obama in that sense  than like -- </p><p>TODD:  I think he's less hawkish than Obama is. I think you would put him  actually to the left on some of these issues.</p><p>MARCUS:  I think that's true. But the thing that's so tragic to me in this  decision is our apparent inability to learn from the mistakes of the past.  His own advisers were saying just last week and the other day that the one  thing we've learned is if you withdraw physical presence, you allow the  same problem to recreate itself. Yet, we did it in Afghanistan years ago.  We did it in Iraq. We're about to do it again.</p><p>TODD:  And what happened each time? Each time, we have to send more troops  back.</p><p>MARCUS:  Precisely.</p><p>EUGENE SCOTT, POLITICAL REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST:  I think there are  two things happening. One, it's a reminder that we have a president who has  not visited any of our troops in action and therefore is perhaps making  decisions with a lack of awareness and knowledge that one would hope that a  commander in chief would be able to do.</p><p>But something else I'm thinking about is that we see our president  campaigning for reelection based on the slogan promises kept. This is a  promise he made to his voters in 2016 about ISIS and has not been able to  deliver on.</p><p>So whether or not it's the best decision or the most well informed  decision, he wants to double down on it because he can lean in on that,  just kind of like the wall, right? Something he campaigned on and that he  has to push through despite there being no support for it really or  significant support from the base.</p><p>MARCUS:  I'm not even sure -- I understand he wants to be out of there, but  there's not a clamor from the base to withdraw the troops.</p><p>TODD:  Yeah.</p><p>MARCUS:  It's a small number of troops.</p><p>TODD:  Yeah.</p><p>MARCUS:  While I think he should go visit the troops, you don't have to go  visit troops to understand that your policy makers, your Republican  compatriots in the Senate and the House understand, for good reason, that  this is a really bad idea. I wonder if if it's not a base appeasing  mechanism, it's a distraction mechanism. That's really scary, terrible  thing to suggest.</p><p>CONTINETTI:  Or it's just an impulse that he has and so --</p><p>TODD:  It doesn't help though that there's a whole bunch of countries  involved here that also are being investigated for their ties to Trump.</p><p>CONTINETTI:  Sure, but they don't --</p><p>TODD:  I'm just saying --</p><p>CONTINETTI:  Saudi Arabia doesn't benefit from this decision. Saudi Arabia  --</p><p>TODD:  They don't but Russia does.</p><p>CONTINETTI:  Russia does.</p><p>TODD:  Erdogan does. Turkey does.</p><p>CONTINETTI:  Americans fired on Russian troops. It's not like we have the - -</p><p>TODD:  No doubt.</p><p>CONTINETTI:  Here's what this reminds me of. His decision to have the  summit with Kim earlier this year. If you go back to last spring, that  decision came about because Trump was in a conversation with the South  Korean national security adviser who brought up President Moon's progress  with Kim and Trump seized on that and said, oh, we're going to have a  summit.</p><p>MARCUS:  What does he seize on here?</p><p>CONTINETTI:  He seized on a conversation recently he had with the Turkish  president, Erdogan.</p><p>TODD:  When he found out that Erdogan --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CONTINETTI:  We don't know the contents of that conversation but the fact  that this decision is following rapidly on the heels of it suggests to me  something was said during that phone call that has led to this result which  I believe threatens the national security of the United States.</p><p>TODD:  And what happens if the Kurds do get slaughtered there without our  presence?</p><p>MARCUS:  Well, you know, we will have abandoned them yet again. This is a  tragedy in its own right. It's a mistake in its own right. It also so  undercuts the ability of not just the Kurds but of other allies to rely on  the United States to do the job, keep its word. Have a policy that is  rational and predictable policy. That's not what we have here.</p><p>SCOTT:  And it reinforces some data we have seen in the past year about how  the standing of the United States has declined globally in the eyes of many  world leaders and just citizens abroad who look to the United States to  make the best and most informed decisions on things like this.</p><p>TODD:  It's just a case of us not being there. Thank you, guys. Much  appreciate it. Up ahead, something really is out there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TODD:  In case you missed it, space. It's quite literally all around us.  But do we really know anything about it? Well, perhaps we're going to know  more now. Thanks to one of NASA's newest hires. Meet Bettina Inclan. She's  a long time GOP spokesperson and activist, and now she's the newest  associate administrator for communication.</p><p>And for Bettina Inclan, talking about space runs in the family. This is her  mom. Battina Rodriguez Aguilera. This year, she ran unsuccessfully for  Congress in Florida. She was even endorsed by they way by the Miami Herald  which called her an unusual candidate. Now, why, you might ask why she is  so unusual. Because Bettina Rodriguez Aguilera claims she was once abducted  by aliens.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BETTINA RODRIGUEZ AGUILERA, REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR FLORIDA'S 27TH  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT IN THE U.S. HOUSEI (through translator):  My first  experience was when I was seven years old. I had a dark connection with  three people who look a little bit like you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  Seriously?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TODD:  Look, I can't say for sure whether she was abducted or not, but I  can say I know someone who would be jealous.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Beam me up. Beam me up. Beam me up. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD:  It never did work for legendary Ohio Congressman Jim Traficant.

Happy weekend.</p><p>If it`s Friday, where there is smoke, you`re fired?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: Tonight, how serious was the President when he ordered his Counsel to fire Bob Mueller? Will Republicans now push to protect Mueller from a firing?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you want to fire Robert Mueller?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Fake news, folks. Fake news.</p><p>TODD: Plus, President Trump`s immigration plan hits a wall on both sides of the aisle.

We`ll talk to one of the lead Republican negotiators.</p><p>And in the wake of the Larry Nassar trial, Congress takes aim at the Olympics and USA gymnastics.</p><p>This is MTP DAILY and it starts right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: Good evening. I`m Chuck Todd here in Washington. Welcome to MTP DAILY.</p><p>By the way, did you know that Monday was the government shutdown?</p><p>Anyway, Republican leaders made it seem impossible. They told us that they could not believe it because it would end the Trump presidency, so they didn`t have to actually do anything about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BOB CORKER (R), TENNESSEE: I cannot imagine a serious conversation taking place in the White House about firing Mueller. That would be a major mistake.</p><p>SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: I can`t believe they would think of such a thing. Tell me what he`s done that would, in any way, intimate that this guy is not one of the most trustworthy people in America.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: Any effort to go after Mueller could be the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency unless Mueller did something wrong.</p><p>If there were some effort to do it without a good reason, there`d holy hell to play.</p><p>HUGH HEWITT, MSNBC HOST: Do you think Congress has any role in legislating about the Special Counsel right now?</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MAJORITY LEADER OF THE SENATE: I don`t think so. I don`t hear much pressure to pass anything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: Well, if Vin Scully were watching this Republican caucus, he might tell them that in a year that has been so improbable, the impossible has happened. The President gave the order to fire Mueller. So now, what do they do?</p><p>\"The New York Times,\" \"Washington Post,\" NBC News, and a lot of other news organizations are all reporting that President Trump did move to fire Bob Mueller last June, but the White House Counsel, Don McGahn, refused to follow through on it.</p><p>He threatened to quit if forced to do it. And the President then, ultimately, backed down.</p><p>The President`s lawyer, Ty Cobb, did not have a comment about these reports, but the President had a fairly predictable reaction earlier today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did you want to fire Robert Mueller?</p><p>TRUMP: Fake news, folks. Fake news. Typical \"New York Times\" fake stories.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: And then, of course, he decided to attack the press while speaking on the world stage.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: And it wasn`t until I became a politician that I realized how nasty, how mean, how vicious, and how fake the press can be. As the cameras start going off in the back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: As you saw, around the same time President Trump gave the order to fire Mueller, Republican leaders were warning the President that an order like that would blow up his presidency. But that was then.</p><p>Since then, the FBI and the Justice Department have been the subject of countless attacks by the President. His allies are warning him that Mueller is setting a perjury trap just by interviewing him. And, of course, the conservative echo chamber is blasting out allegations and conspiracy theories that Mueller is part of a so-called deep state to overthrow this President.</p><p>Last year, when there was speculation that the President might give the order to fire Mueller, Republican leaders sent a clear message to the President: don`t do it!</p><p>Well, we now know that the President actually gave that order, and the Republican reaction, so far, has been muted, to say the least.</p><p>Folks, if all of this was a coordinated leak -- which is what it looks like when all of these news organizations can independently confirm the same story so quickly -- you have to wonder if someone wanted to send a warning to either to President Trump or about President Trump.</p><p>But if that`s the case, where are the Republicans warning him? Is it because it`s a Friday? Is it because the President is overseas? Or is it because so few people were actually surprised by this news?</p><p>But, folks, to put it bluntly, if the GOP remains silent on the news that President Trump gave the order to fire Mueller, why would we think they`ll speak up if he follows through on that order the next time he decides to do this?</p><p>Let`s bring in tonight`s panel. Carol Lee is a reporter for NBC News; Eugene Robinson, a columnist for \"The Washington Post\" and MSNBC political analyst; and Bill Kristol, \"The Weekly Standard`s\" editor-at-large.</p><p>Carol, I want to start with you because, last June, all of us were pursuing this story. It was -- Christopher Ruddy, the President`s personal friend who happens to be a publisher of the news organization, openly said the President is contemplating doing this.</p><p>CAROL LEE, NBC NEWS NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER: Very candidly, yes.</p><p>TODD: The White House kept denying, no, no, no, he didn`t order it. Now, those same people that were telling us no are saying yes. What happened?</p><p>LEE: It`s unclear exactly what happened, but I think you hit on a very important point, which is this investigation is just getting tighter and tighter and tighter. And the President is in the White House and seething and continuing to seethe and see it quickening and getting closer, and now there`s questions about him, you know, perhaps sitting down with the Special Counsel`s office.</p><p>And so it`s very possible that people are nervous that he may try to do this again. He is impulsive. He lashes out. And there`s people in the White House who could not be clearer that this would be a disaster for him, and so you could see how they would want to move to try to cut that off.</p><p>TODD: But, Bill Kristol, you saw this as a leak meant to be as a warning. You tweeted the following.</p><p>Why would Trump have returned to the idea of firing Mueller now? Well, he may recently have learned how much Mueller now knows. He also, soon, has to agree to be interviewed or not. He may have decided not and thinks firing him might be better than refusing to talk or taking the Fifth.</p><p>BILL KRISTOL, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Yes. I think there is, in a way, a little there is too much -- well, just two things. When the story broke when the press went out and, you know, have said this might be happening, the White House denied it. Trump denied it. And people sort of believed it.</p><p>That`s a mistake, generally -- it turns ow. You really shouldn`t believe what Donald Trump says. I think we do know that.</p><p>But it turns out there are a lot of people at that White House -- this is something reporters have learned, I think, a little bit. I mean, reporters are trained to be suspicious and skeptical --</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>KRISTOL: -- but not to deal with this level of just flat out lying, either just lying about things people know about, staffers -- or staffers may not know about it, but then they just go out and deny something when they don`t know either way.</p><p>TODD: By the way, this is the --</p><p>KRISTOL: And now, it`s pretty clear. I mean, we know from many sources that Trump gave the order, you might say. Don McGahn threatened to quit, the White House counsel. And so it was a real thing, a real story.</p><p>But the main recent thing I would say is -- I mean, is it -- of course, it would be a political firestorm. But compared to what? It`s not because Trump is irritable. Trump is scared of Bob Mueller.</p><p>TODD: Yes.</p><p>KRISTOL: Trump is scared of what he would discover.</p><p>TODD: But by the way, just --</p><p>KRISTOL: Trump will not testify to Bob Mueller, and Trump wants this investigation to be stopped or slowed down or impeded or made more difficult or discredit it as much as possible. So you got to put yourself in Trump`s mind here and say, is it irrational for him to think that he should do anything he can to disrupt this investigation?</p><p>TODD: Gene, before you weigh in -- I know you want to -- I want to just put a button on this point here of how the President has been so openly misleading about this. Here he is in August, now claiming denying any of this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, have you thought or thought about or considered leading the dismissal of the Special Counsel? Is there anything that Bob Mueller could do that would send you in that direction?</p><p>TRUMP: I haven`t given it any thought. I mean, I`ve been reading about it from you people. You say, oh, I`m going to dismiss him.</p><p>No, I`m not dismissing anybody. I mean, I want them to get on with the task, but I also want the Senate and the House to come out with their findings.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: So that was his way of denying it. But, boy, when you hear him say it -- when you read it, it reads like a denial. When you hear him say it, you realize he is fudging it.</p><p>EUGENE ROBINSON, OPINION WRITER, THE WASHINGTON POST: Yes. Yes.</p><p>TODD: That`s his way of fudging it.</p><p>ROBINSON: Right. He is --</p><p>TODD: Yes.</p><p>ROBINSON: I mean, he is -- that did not sound like Donald Trump trying to be serious or be honest, frankly. And look, at this point, his credibility is in the negative numbers. You can`t believe him especially on --</p><p>TODD: Especially on this issue in particular.</p><p>ROBINSON: Well, on many issues.</p><p>TODD: Yes.</p><p>ROBINSON: But on this issue especially, you can`t take what he says at face value. You know, these kinds of leaks -- and obviously there was a leak somewhere -- are the way that people in the Trump White House often --</p><p>TODD: Speak.</p><p>ROBINSON: -- communicate to each other and to him. Especially to him. And this looks to me the way it looked to Bill, like a message to him, a brushback.</p><p>TODD: The reaction from Capitol Hill today has been somewhat muted. Orrin Hatch`s office re-tweeted a headline from a comment he made in October that said that it was supported -- he offered his support for Mueller.</p><p>James Lankford said the following, according to BuzzFeed, the White House and the President have said repeatedly, most recently yesterday, that they will comply with the Special Counsel and investigative committees, so I think we should take the White House at their word.</p><p>It was interesting he said White House, not the President.</p><p>And Chuck Grassley said, according to CNN, I just don`t think the President, as unpredictable as he is, would fire Mueller. And I take the view -- and I said so maybe not directly to the President, but indirectly to the President -- just let this work its course.</p><p>LEE: I would say he -- they hope that he`s not going to fire Bob Mueller.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LEE: But the Republicans, all those clips you played, they have been on the record about what they think about this. And I think there is this -- what you`ve seen today is a little -- they just don`t want to kind of poke him at all on this, and so they`re -- they`ve been, a little bit, playing games with their wording on this.</p><p>KRISTOL: But think how it`s changed from six months ago when he just --</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>KRISTOL: I mean, what has he done in the six months in between? In his own, you know, whacky, kind of impulsive way, he is not stupid, Trump. He has managed to get lots of Republicans on the Hill, especially in the House, to attack the inquiry, attack the FBI --</p><p>TODD: Even credible Republicans like Ron Johnson.</p><p>KRISTOL: Right.</p><p>TODD: Yes.</p><p>KRISTOL: What we would`ve called the normal Republicans who are not on the fringes and not conspiratorial to be talking about conspiracies in the FBI.</p><p>He`s got the conservative echo chambers you put at the beginning echoing the notion that the deep state is out to get Trump in a way that was -- would have been incredible if you told me six, seven, eight months ago some of the people who are saying that routinely day after a day. So he has made progress in his effort to lay the groundwork for firing Mueller.</p><p>ROBINSON: Yes.</p><p>TODD: And I want to pick up on another point that Bill was implying here. Donald Trump -- which is the idea of -- we might think firing Mueller, that`s crazy. Donald Trump has lived his whole life on one way of conducting business. Buying time, right?</p><p>ROBINSON: Yes.</p><p>TODD: He files a lawsuit -- you file a lawsuit against him.</p><p>ROBINSON: Yes.</p><p>TODD: He files a counter. Why? Buy time. Buy time.</p><p>ROBINSON: Buy time, yes.</p><p>TODD: He knows that doing this would be terrible for him, but what would it do? It would set the investigation back at least a few weeks.</p><p>ROBINSON: Yes.</p><p>TODD: A few months maybe. It buys more time. He is the king of buying time.</p><p>ROBINSON: Yes. Well, maybe that`s what he`s after. This is -- this would be a pyrrhic purchase, I think.</p><p>TODD: It would be too.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROBINSON: You know, if there is such a thing. You know, you read this in biographies. You know, one -- apparently, one of the jobs of Bob Haldeman was to listen to the crazy things Nixon said and ordered and then not do them. Pay no attention to them and look right past them. Maybe somebody is afraid that Kelly is going to actually take him seriously.</p><p>TODD: Right. Well, let me pause the political side of this conversation because I have some legal questions here, and as smart as all of you guys are, you`re not as smart as my next guest here.</p><p>Let me add a former federal prosecutor to the mix here. Anne Milgram was the Attorney General for the state of New Jersey. She had been a federal prosecutor at the Justice Department and an Assistant District`s Attorney in Manhattan.</p><p>Ms. Milgram, thanks for coming on the program again.</p><p>ANNE MILGRAM, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL OF NEW JERSEY: Thank you.</p><p>TODD: Let me start with a legal question. If you order a hit and the order is rejected, you still ordered the hit. Does that make it an obstruction of -- does that feed the obstruction of justice case in this scenario?</p><p>MILGRAM: So I think the answer here is absolutely yes. The way it would work, even though -- the President ordered that Mueller be fired. Even though that wasn`t carried out, you could still have a claim for attempted obstruction of justice. That would be equal under the eyes of the law in terms of the punishment.</p><p>But more importantly here, Chuck, I think when you look at this with the other evidence we have related to the President firing Comey, the comments that he made, it certainly strengthens that part of the case as well.</p><p>And so I think it`s important when we think about obstruction to think about all these individual acts as one piece of an obstruction of justice potential claim.</p><p>TODD: Well, let me put -- let me button that up. You mentioned Comey.</p><p>He asked Comey for loyalty, asked him to drop the Flynn probe. He pressured Sessions not to recuse himself. He pressured Wray to fire Andrew McCabe. He pressured Coats and Rogers and Pompeo and members of the intel community to lean on Comey to lay off of Flynn. Now, we know the failed attempt to fire Mueller.</p><p>So what you`re saying is you put all of that together, no individual piece you can -- you might be able to explain away, all of that together, there`s only one conclusion?</p><p>MILGRAM: Yes. And in addition to the fact that you put it all together and also remember that you have Trump`s specific words asking Comey to see past Flynn, to basically stop the investigation into Flynn explicitly, but now you also have a pattern.</p><p>And I think what that means and why this is so problematic for the President and his legal defense team is that if there is one instance of it -- and again, you just went through a lot of the comments and conversations, so there isn`t just one piece. But if there were just one or two pieces, it`s a lot easier to defend against or explain.</p><p>Here, now you have another really strong piece of evidence showing that the President was trying to stop the investigation by eliminating the chief prosecutor, Bob Mueller.</p><p>TODD: All right. So you`re Bob Mueller and you found out the guy you`re investigating wants to -- wanted to -- was trying to fire you. Now, you`re a professional, but you have to -- that information is going to have an impact.</p><p>It`s going to have an impact on your -- you said a good point, he really doesn`t want me to finish this investigation. Boy, I was suspicious of X over here and now I`m more suspicious of X.</p><p>I mean, as an investigator, what does this mean to him?</p><p>MILGRAM: So, you know, Bob Mueller, I think, is one of the best prosecutors in the country, one of the best investigators in the country. And he is as cool as can be and would take this in stride, and so I know someone like Bob Mueller wouldn`t take it personally.</p><p>But I think what he would take it as, he would want that evidence from the people who have now come forward to understand what was said, who said, you know, who did what. And again, it really goes to this question of what was the President`s intent when he fired Comey, when he tried to stop Sessions from recusing, all of those pieces.</p><p>And so I think, you know, Mueller is -- he`s extraordinarily good at what he does. He will take this in stride. And, you know, I almost believe that he probably expected this or something like this.</p><p>TODD: Sure.</p><p>MILGRAM: But, yes, it`s obviously strange to be the lead prosecutor and find out that the President of the United States has been trying to fire you.</p><p>TODD: Given that maybe it`s possible this is a warning flare from somebody inside the White House, if you`re Bob Mueller and you want to have this interview with the President, do you speed up that process and basically say, all right, let`s just subpoena him now and get this over with?</p><p>MILGRAM: I wonder. I mean, I think that all of the theories that have been offered tonight are very plausible as to why this has come out. I also wondered if it`s possible that the President is about to be interviewed soon and that it will come out as part of that interview.</p><p>And so people have told that to Mueller. They understand that that information will become known to the President as soon as the President walks into an interview because this clearly is something that Bob Mueller would ask about.</p><p>I don`t know if that`s right, but there does seem to be -- it was a very quick number of a large number of sources that came out saying it.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>MILGRAM: If I were Bob Mueller, I would want the President tomorrow because there is so much information, and I would want to be able to sit and go through it all really methodically. That being said, the one caveat is that we don`t know what else Bob Mueller is doing.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>MILGRAM: And so what you want before you go in with the President, who is the subject of this question of did he obstruct justice and potentially, also, will be questioned on the campaign and Russian interference in the election, you want to have all your ducks in a row. So you want to have --</p><p>TODD: I was just going to ask, you want one interview? You would want to do it all at once? You wouldn`t want to split this and basically do obstruction now, campaign and Trump organization later?</p><p>MILGRAM: I see a lot of reasons why you would want to split it and do multiple interviews. And so if you and I were talking about your sort of garden variety case, I think the short answer is you might do that.</p><p>TODD: Got you.</p><p>MILGRAM: I think it`s a lot more complicated when it`s the President of the United States, and you already have his lawyers pushing back on having him come in.</p><p>TODD: All right.</p><p>MILGRAM: So if I were Mueller, I would assume I`d get one bite at the apple, and I would try to do everything I need to do during or -- and particularly prioritize the things I know I need to touch on.</p><p>TODD: All right. Anne Milgram, I appreciate your perspective there.</p><p>MILGRAM: Thank you for having me.</p><p>TODD: Let me quickly go to the panel. Bill, you wanted to chime in on what you heard there?</p><p>KRISTOL: I just think the President is not going to give Mueller one bite at the apple. He`s going to give zero bites at the apple. I don`t believe him saying, oh, I want to -- that`s --</p><p>TODD: That`s pretending that he (ph) -- it`s not the President`s choice.</p><p>KRISTOL: Well, it is because then he can say no -- first of all, they can have endless -- they can drag out the negotiations.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>KRISTOL: As you said earlier, buying for time. Secondly, they can appeal to, if they wish to try, that the President shouldn`t be compelled to testify. Third, I gather they could then subpoena him before a grand jury. Then he might have to take the Fifth.</p><p>And everyone will all say, are you -- can you imagine the President taking the Fifth? I don`t think that`s what Donald Trump thinks.</p><p>LEE: No, he`ll be angry.</p><p>ROBINSON: Yes.</p><p>KRISTOL: Donald Trump thinks, you know what, it might be a lot safer for me to take the Fifth than possibly have to testify and here`s all these things.</p><p>ROBINSON: It would be --</p><p>KRISTOL: So he`ll take the Fifth.</p><p>ROBINSON: It would be a lot --</p><p>KRISTOL: So he`ll take the Fifth.</p><p>LEE: But he --</p><p>KRISTOL: And he`s conditioned Republicans on the Hill to say, well, I don`t know. You know, this was a pretty unsavory investigation.</p><p>TODD: Or I don`t trust Bob Mueller either.</p><p>LEE: Right.</p><p>TODD: Yes.</p><p>KRISTOL: What about those --</p><p>LEE: Exactly right.</p><p>KRISTOL: What about those FBI agents?</p><p>LEE: He has laid the --</p><p>KRISTOL: He has to take the Fifth.</p><p>LEE: He has completely laid the groundwork for saying something like that. Why would I sit with -- it`s clearly politically motivated. Look at the bias. Why would I sit in front of those?</p><p>ROBINSON: Look, you know, the only thing that militates against that is Trump`s ego and the fact that he might see it as humiliating --</p><p>TODD: To plead the Fifth.</p><p>ROBINSON: -- and belittling to take the Fifth.</p><p>TODD: He did --</p><p>ROBINSON: And he`d think --</p><p>TODD: He belittled the Hillary Clinton staffer that took the Fifth.</p><p>ROBINSON: Exactly, yes. And by the way, he thinks he can talk his way out of anything.</p><p>TODD: Yes, an important point there.</p><p>Again, Anne, you got to do the legal stuff, my panel here got to have fun with the politics stuff. Anne, thanks very much. I know we have to let you go.</p><p>You guys get to come back.</p><p>Up ahead, we are on the brink of a bipartisan DACA deal. Ah, maybe not. The White House, though, thinks so; the Democrats not so much.</p><p>We`ll break down the proposal with Republican Senator Lamar Alexander. That`s just ahead.</p><p>TODD: Welcome back. The reckoning over alleged sexual misconduct is now focusing on casino magnate and RNC finance chair Steve Wynn.</p><p>\"The Wall Street Journal\" reports dozens of current and former Wynn Casino employees accused the billionaire of sexually aggressive and inappropriate behavior that goes back decades. Some workers say they were pressured into sex acts with him.</p><p>Wynn strongly denies the allegations, saying, in part, the idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous.</p><p>We`ve been trying to get in touch with the RNC all day for their response to this story. So far, our e-mails and calls have gone completely unanswered, unresponded to, not even an off the record \"no comment.\"</p><p>We`ll have more MTP DAILY in 60 seconds.</p><p>TODD: Welcome back. While the Russia headlines piled up this week, the White House had one big P.R. triumph. It was able to announce an immigration plan last night that seems to have bipartisan support at least for now. And also some bipartisan opposition.</p><p>While achieving a number of the President`s very conservative priorities, the proposal would require a number of big concessions by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, including a limit on family-based migration, what Republicans call chain migration.</p><p>But Schumer told \"The New York Times\" podcast, \"The Daily,\" in an interview recorded yesterday afternoon that the White House plan, quote, will never pass.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MINORITY LEADER OF THE SENATE: In the process Leader McConnell presented, we`ll have our own amendment that will be much less of an excruciating choice and has a much better chance of passing.</p><p>We have a whole bunch of Democratic and Republican moderate senators right now working on a compromise position that won`t be the extreme kind of stuff that you just mentioned that the White House might put out, and I think that has a very good chance of passing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: Of course, we`ve seen this rodeo before. What can pass the Senate may not be able to pass the House.</p><p>I`m joined now by a member of the bipartisan group of senators trying to find a solution out of this, Republican Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.</p><p>Senator, welcome back to the show, sir.</p><p>SEN. LAMAR ALEXANDER (R), TENNESSEE: Thank you very much.</p><p>TODD: Let me start with the White House proposal. How should we look at it? Is it an opening bid in negotiations or their endpoint?</p><p>ALEXANDER: It`s what a president ought to do. I mean, the job of the executive is to lay out some suggestions and our job is to consider them, show respect for them. I hope we can do -- what we can do is, as Senator Schumer was just saying, have our own process.</p><p>Senator McConnell puts a bill down on the floor on the 8th. We offer our amendments. Hopefully, we`ll have 70 votes. Hopefully, the President can support it. If he does, the House is likely to pass it or more likely to pass it, and the President will sign it.</p><p>So that`s -- the President is doing what he -- if a president didn`t start the process, the process usually doesn`t work.</p><p>TODD: All right. Let me restart with the sticking point that Chuck Schumer brought up which is the family sponsorship issue.</p><p>The White House wants to, essentially, change immigration law for everybody. I believe the previous Graham-Durbin proposal was just to have these limits put on the DACA population. Where are you on this?</p><p>ALEXANDER: Well, where I am on -- you`re starting at the hardest part of the problem to solve. I would start at --</p><p>TODD: Yes, I am.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ALEXANDER: I would start at the easiest. I would start by saying --</p><p>TODD: Well, OK.</p><p>ALEXANDER: Let`s start with two things. One is the Dreamers which can be defined as 700,000 or maybe 800,000, the White House said, a pretty generous estimate of people who were brought here through no fault of their own. Find a way to give them legal status.</p><p>And border security. Something the Senate did in 2013 in a big-time way with 20,000 new border agents -- I voted for this -- 700 miles of barriers, et cetera.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>ALEXANDER: So let`s start with the smaller part, things we actually can agree on. Let`s have amendments about the harder part which is the -- which is how do we define what a family can do to bring other family members into the country. That`s a hard set of issues.</p><p>TODD: It does seem, though, that if that`s not there, then the White House isn`t on board with citizenship for those Dreamers.</p><p>ALEXANDER: I don`t think the White House has said that. But I think the President said here is what I think we ought to do, and I think that`s welcome.</p><p>As I said before, I mean, the job of the executive is to say, I propose this. Our job is to say, thank you, Mr. President. We respect that, and now we`ll go to work and see if we could come up with something you can support.</p><p>TODD: Well, it`s interesting, though. This is going to be a tough vote for some because of primary politics. It`s going to be tough on the left for some. It`s going to be tough on the right.</p><p>I use your home state of Tennessee. Marsha Blackburn, the Republican front-runner for that now open Senate seat there, the one that Bob Corker has given up.</p><p>She said this yesterday about the immigration proposals in general, there is more conversation about a path to legalization and this is why.</p><p>She goes, but we do not want to see anyone get in front of people that have been going through the legal immigration process.</p><p>I went down the line here. We haven`t been able to find many Republicans running in primaries in 2018 comfortable with supporting the President`s proposal. How much could that derail this if you have conservatives who feel they can`t get through primaries supporting any form of so-called amnesty?</p><p>ALEXANDER: It will be an issue in primaries. I voted for the 2013 bill which created a legal status for 11 million people who were here illegally, said they had to pay a fine, and it didn`t put them in front of anybody. It did say, eventually, they could get a legal status; eventually, they could dream of becoming a citizen.</p><p>And it also solved the border problems. If we would`ve passed the 2013 bill and made it law --</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>ALEXANDER: -- we wouldn`t be even having this discussion today. We had so much border security in there people were joking about it. I mean, they were saying that there are so many border agents, they could hold hands across the border.</p><p>So I think, yes, it`s an issue in primaries. But with appropriate border security, I think we can solve it.</p><p>And as far as a path to citizenship, I don`t want millions of people in this country on a permanent basis who never have an opportunity to dream of pledging allegiance to the United States. I don`t want them always dreaming of pledging allegiance to Russia or Mexico or Canada or Afghanistan. I want them to think, one day, they can be a citizen if they`re legally here as a permanent person.</p><p>TODD: Do you trust that the House will -- or, look, the Senate has -- Mitch McConnell has agreed to a fairly open process on this basically allowing this bill to almost organically happen. That doesn`t happen very often in the Senate these days, but he seems to be more open to have as open of a process as we`ve seen on a bill for quite some time, Democrat and Republican.</p><p>That isn`t the way the House is going to work. Do you think -- are you just hoping that as long as the President supports the Senate bill, it will get a vote in the House?</p><p>ALEXANDER: Yes. That`s as a short -- my experience is that we shouldn`t worry about the House. We should show respect to the House and respect to the President.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>ALEXANDER: But we need to do our job. We should pass a bill with border security, solve the DACA problem. I would start with the most limited bill that will do that, allow amendments.</p><p>And I would make the objective 70 votes. Not 60 because if we get to 70, we`ll have a lot of Republicans supporting it, the President is more likely to support it. If he supports it, I suspect the House will pass it.</p><p>TODD: By the way, you sound like you`re in the Marco Rubio camp now that says, don`t try to make this bill bigger. Just do Dreamers and border security.</p><p>ALEXANDER: Well, get -- you know, one step in the right direction is a good way to get where you want to go because you might take a second and a third. And then, certainly, the bill that Senator McConnell puts on the floor on February 8th, I hope it`s limited so that it could pass even if it -- even if the amendments don`t succeed.</p><p>TODD: Right. All right. I want to ask you a couple of housekeeping political issues. Bob Mueller.</p><p>ALEXANDER: OK.</p><p>TODD: You`ve heard the reports. Your reaction to the reports that the President actually ordered the firing of him and then the White House Counsel threatened resignation. Where are you on this, sir?</p><p>ALEXANDER: I`m going to be a little disrespectful. You know, there are about a half million people obsessing over these investigations, and I`m not one of them. I`m not going to --</p><p>TODD: I understand.</p><p>ALEXANDER: I`m not going to be commenting on what hasn`t happened. We`ve got a bipartisan Senate committee. We`ve got a respected counsel. We`ve got the President say he is going to cooperate with the Counsel. Let`s see what happens.</p><p>TODD: Well, let me -- so does that mean you`re not interested in legislation -- last June, you had Thom Tillis and Chris Coons introduce legislation that would, at least, have some sort of protection or fallback status if the President did follow through on firing Mueller. Do you think that`s something the Senate needs to think about?</p><p>ALEXANDER: Well, maybe. I think what the Senate ought to think more about is how to solve the immigration problem, how to make getting into higher education simpler, and how to lower insurance premiums. That`s what I`m working on and that`s -- there are other senators doing other things.</p><p>TODD: Do you have full confidence in Bob Mueller?</p><p>ALEXANDER: I think Bob Mueller is a very well respected person or the Trump administration wouldn`t have appointed him. He has a good reputation.</p><p>TODD: And you have confidence in him personally?</p><p>ALEXANDER: So far as I know I don`t point, but everything I know about him gives me confidence in him.</p><p>TODD: Do you -- does the RNC has a finance director named Steve Wynn? There is some horrible reports about some just horrific behavior that he has been accused of. I assume the RNC shouldn`t be keeping him as finance chair if these reports are confirmed?</p><p>ALEXANDER: I assume that we all have to wait and see what the reports are and whether they are true or not before we start making comments on him.</p><p>TODD: Fair enough. Senator Alexander, I will leave it there. I appreciate you coming on as always, sir.</p><p>ALEXANDER: All right and thanks very much.</p><p>TODD: You got it. Up ahead, the hill versus the valley. After last year`s election meddling fiasco, are online giants prepared to do better in 2018? the high stakes for high tech, next.</p><p>TODD: If it`s Sunday, it`s \"Meet the Press\" and if it`s Friday, we promote \"Meet the Press.\" We`re going to get into the immigration debate and go in depth inside the Russia investigation as well.</p><p>We`ll talk exclusively with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, plus West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, Democrat, who will also join us. We`ll be back in a moment.</p><p>TODD: Welcome back. We`re learning a lot more about activity from Russian operatives during the 2016 election. The Senate Intelligence Committee released a memo on Thursday detailing 129 phony political events connected to Russian troll farm.</p><p>The fake events publicized on Facebook took place in United States and drew nearly 340,000 RSVP from users. Facebook has revealed just 150 million American users received Russian-backed content during the 2016 election.</p><p>This newly disclosed detail users -- that users` willingness to take physical action at Russia`s direction is on another level. While Facebook shared details on a particular political event created by Russian operatives, the volume of these instances has not been previously disclosed.</p><p>Tech giants from Google, Twitter, and Facebook who testified before Congress in November say they do not believe Russian operatives interfered in the 2017 gubernatorial elections in Virginia, New Jersey.</p><p>The lawmakers have been largely unsatisfied with the responses from the tech companies and remain concerned about how they plan to combat state- sponsored meddling as 2018 mid-term elections loom.</p><p>Kara Swisher is the executive editor of Recode. She joins me now. Kara, let me start with --</p><p>KARA SWISHER, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, RECODE: Yes.</p><p>TODD: -- one aspect of the last year, Twitter, Facebook, in particular, which is everything -- you know, I mean, they`re worst than politicians.</p><p>SWISHER: Yes.</p><p>TODD: I`ll be honest. First it was -- first it was no --</p><p>SWISHER: Not fake.</p><p>TODD: Fake news had nothing.</p><p>SWISHER: Yes.</p><p>TODD: That`s what Mark Zuckerberg said within the first month. And then --</p><p>SWISHER: No impact.</p><p>TODD: Right. And then it became no impact. And then it became, well, now we hear they`re like hey, there were events, but it still feels like they are holding back. What are they afraid of?</p><p>SWISHER: You know, part of this feels like, the slow rolling is something that is very common among internet companies. They`ve done it before in the past. Oh, this battery isn`t this, oh, well, maybe this. Some of it is they don`t know.</p><p>TODD: The breaches too, right?</p><p>SWISHER: Right.</p><p>TODD: Oh, it only affected these accounts.</p><p>SWISHER: Not really blowing up their suitcase.</p><p>TODD: Yes, right.</p><p>SWISHER: But I think one of the issues is they don`t know. I think you imagine that these -- they put themselves as geniuses of all time. I think it is hard to discover and hard to figure out.</p><p>What I think the problem is, when they built the system in the first place, they didn`t anticipate this. And so they -- everyone thinks of opportunity and not problem. And so when you talk about any of their products, they are always not thinking something bad could be used.</p><p>TODD: You know, I had a -- (INAUDIBLE) Republican consultant who does a lot of digital work in campaigns. She noted how -- when Facebook was facing an early issue with child pornography --</p><p>SWISHER: Right.</p><p>TODD: Basically Facebook was being used to pass it around and to sell it and to advertise all this stuff. They had ways to quickly sort of shut that down.</p><p>SWISHER: Right.</p><p>TODD: Her point was they have the technology to root -- if they could root out the child pornographers --</p><p>SWISHER: Or the scammers.</p><p>TODD: They can root out the trolls from Russia and from state sponsors. Is she right?</p><p>SWISHER: Presumably, yes. But it think it is a little more -- it is not quite as easy as that because this stuff goes back a long way, any time there has been a tech -- AOL had the same problem with pornography and all kinds of issues. It`s just wasn`t being used in quite the same way. And no one had the impact of Facebook.</p><p>I think that is what is really -- it is billions of people with trillions of transactions all the time. I think that is the problem. It is so enormous. But they should have been focusing on it. They should have had tools in place for a lot of their products.</p><p>That is -- you know, now they`re completely aware of it and focused on it and they`re trying to find all kinds of ways to solve it. You can`t solve it in human way because there is not enough people on the planet --</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>SWISHER: -- because of the amount of transactions. A.I. is still not where it needs to be. And they haven`t been monitoring the platforms. You saw it with not just Russian troll. It is like anti-semitic or (INAUDIBLE) advertising all kinds of things.</p><p>TODD: Well, there is another aspect of this. Her other theory was, they could root it out but they don`t because it is a much bigger part of their revenue than they want to admit.</p><p>SWISHER: Well, I don`t know if that is the case. I think the problem is that their -- all their businesses, all these businesses, not all of them, not Apple, for example, are based on advertising and attention.</p><p>And it is a slot machine of attention. So, they want you to always be paying attention and engaged. Now, my argument is that you are engaged on things that make you feel bad and it creates a real cesspool. I mean, anyone (INAUDIBLE) Twitter sometimes, doesn`t it feel, you don`t feel good --</p><p>TODD: Sometimes?</p><p>SWISHER: (INAUDIBLE) great.</p><p>TODD: Yes.</p><p>SWISHER: That at the same --</p><p>TODD: Let me know where the great stuff is these days.</p><p>SWISHER: It seems like if they`re thinking about their businesses for the long-term, they have to (INAUDIBLE) this stuff out. They have to make it a priority.</p><p>TODD: I remember during the great recession and the attempt after -- after the Wall Street crash, and the attempt of Congress to try to regulate Wall Street.</p><p>SWISHER: Right.</p><p>TODD: And the fact of the matter is they don`t know what the hell they were doing.</p><p>SWISHER: Yes.</p><p>TODD: OK? They don`t understand what Wall Street did. They know it was bad. OK. I feel like we`re in the same territory as it is clear there needs to be a way to regulate these internet companies.</p><p>SWISHER: Right.</p><p>TODD: But Congress doesn`t -- it is not that they have a big issue, they don`t understand it. And it is OK that they don`t.</p><p>SWISHER: Right.</p><p>TODD: But if you don`t understand it, how do you regulate it?</p><p>SWISHER: They can`t. And they are not going to, by the way. I think it is going to be a very slow thing. Everyone said there got to be sort of a digital Armageddon for it to happen, but you had Equifax.</p><p>TODD: What is it? We have a digital Armageddon. It is happening.</p><p>SWISHER: In so many ways, not just -- in privacy, in manipulation platforms, in tech addiction, all kinds of things. The issue is can the regulators -- I mean, they passed many times on regulating these companies.</p><p>Not in Europe, not like (INAUDIBLE) and others, are very firm around data privacy and all kinds of things. It is just the will of government to do something about this and the knowledge to do something.</p><p>TODD: I had somebody suggest to me that they ought to use the super fund model. Meaning, you basically -- you tell an Equifax, OK, you got to pay a gigantic fine every time you have a breach.</p><p>SWISHER: Right.</p><p>TODD: So that, boy, you`ve got to spend whatever it takes to prevent breaches and financially it is not crippling but it is painful.</p><p>SWISHER: Right.</p><p>TODD: Because then it is -- it creates some self-regulation because maybe Washington isn`t up to speed actually to create regulation.</p><p>SWISHER: I think the problem here is this is one of our greatest industries. It is an American-born industry. It is still controlled by American companies. All of the big tech companies are American companies.</p><p>There are strong contenders from China and elsewhere in the world, but one of things that they push back on is, we can`t innovate if we are regulated. Well, that happens to everyone.</p><p>TODD: Every business claims this.</p><p>SWISHER: And so I think they are welcoming regulation by not monitoring the systems properly. Now the question is whether it is going to happen now. I don`t know. It seems to me that people in Washington can`t agree on lunch and so I don`t know if they are going to get to these people. And they are spending a lot of money.</p><p>TODD: But you know what? They will have hearings.</p><p>SWISHER: They will have hearings.</p><p>TODD: All right. Kara Swisher, thank you very much. By the way, be sure to join Kara and Ari Melber this Sunday for a special town hall event. They are sitting down with CEOs of Google and You Tube to talk about how we deal with all of the challenges we were talking about, the rapid pace of change taking place. So watch \"Revolution: Google and You Tube Changing the World\" this Sunday, 9:00 p.m. Eastern, MSNBC.</p><p>Up ahead, when sentencing a sexual predator to up to 175 years in prison is not enough.</p><p>TODD: Welcome back. Tonight, I`m obsessed with Dr. Larry Nassar and the stench of the scandal surrounding U.S. gymnastics. Nassar was sentenced to up to 175 years in prison this week with more than 150 people coming forward to a sentencing hearing to accuse the former USA Gymnastics team doctor of sexual abuse.</p><p>But this should not be the end of the story. The problem is not just one predator. The problem goes all the way up to the top. The United States Olympic Committee. Olympic gold medallist Aly Raisman wrote this week, the USOC is still not acknowledging its own role in this mess. Zero accountability. It`s like none of us were ever abused.</p><p>If the USOC thinks it is enough for Nassar to spend the rest of his life behind bars, they are wrong. If USA Gymnastics thinks it is enough for Nassar to spend the rest of his life behind bars, they are wrong. If the USOC thinks it is enough for the entire board of USA Gymnastics to resign, which they did today, they are wrong.</p><p>Today, the bipartisan with the House Commerce Committee announced it would investigate sexual abuse in organized sports, including the USOC and USA Gymnastics. It is a positive first step, but this is just the beginning of the story, not the end. Remember, the USOC exists because of an act of Congress. We`ll be right back.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEXANDER: There are about a half million people obsessing over these investigations and I`m not one of them. I think Bob Mueller is a very well respected person or the Trump administration wouldn`t have appointed him. He has a good reputation.</p><p>TODD: And you have confidence in him personally?</p><p>ALEXANDER: So far as I know I don`t point, but everything I know about him gives me confidence in him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: Bill Kristol? I was surprised by -- it was -- I don`t want to say he had distance, he just wasn`t going to lean in.</p><p>KRISTOL: No, and he wasn`t going to just say, you know, I want to say here that President Trump who might be watching, as he comes back from Davos, do not fire Bob Mueller. And if it looks like he is going to, I would support legislation that might stop that. He could have said that.</p><p>TODD: If I were President Trump, I would feel like --</p><p>KRISTOL: Lamar Alexander (INAUDIBLE) I mean, (INAUDIBLE) Republican.</p><p>TODD: Who would be one that you wouldn`t think that would be there to have Trump`s back --</p><p>KRISTOL: Right.</p><p>TODD: -- on this. All right. I want to switch to this Steve Wynn allegation. Carol, after reading the story in the journal, your former employer, it was sort of -- it was the closest things we have seen yet to Harvey Weinstein.</p><p>CAROL LEE, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, NBC NEWS: Exactly.</p><p>TODD: You know, but Harvey is in a class by himself.</p><p>LEE: Right.</p><p>TODD: But Steve -- these allegations against Steve Wynn and the specificity of them are very difficult to read.</p><p>LEE: Yes, and I was listening to the senator earlier talk about, you know, will we have to see the stories and look at that. I have worked at The Wall Street Journal, I know what it takes to get a story like that through that process, I know those reporters.</p><p>The stories are so detailed. They said they talked to 150 people, there were dozens of different instances that they cite. And to see -- and the reaction has been from the RNC --</p><p>TODD: Yes.</p><p>LEE: -- to candidates who have taken money from him, just silence.</p><p>TODD: Well, one interesting aspect of this, he`s RNC finance chair --</p><p>LEE: Right.</p><p>TODD: The RNC winter meeting comes up next week. My guess is that this is a President Trump decision --</p><p>EUGENE ROBINSON, COLUMNIST, THE WASHINGTON POST: Yes.</p><p>TODD: -- on Wynn. Pure and simple. And they`re close. And I have no doubt Steve Wynn is probably begging him not to dump him.</p><p>ROBINSON: Exactly. He probably is. So who knows what he`s going to do? Clearly, the politically right thing to do would be to make sure that that Steve Wynn doesn`t make it to that meeting. I mean, you know, I think the party and ultimately I think the party is going to have to get rid of him, but I don`t know what President Trump will do.</p><p>TODD: Let me put up a list here of Republicans who gotten Wynn money here. You got the RNC, the NRSC, Rubio, Portman, Toomey, Flake, Cruz, Johnson, Scott, Murkowski, Dean Heller is up for re-election. By the way, interestingly enough, Steve Wynn also is a donor to Hillary Clinton for America. He was a donor to her as well as well as Jeb`s campaign.</p><p>KRISTOL: A lot of the Vegas casino owners.</p><p>TODD: They usually do. They play mostly on one side and then they`ll do the other.</p><p>KRISTOL: I have gotten to the RNC meetings this week. The Republican National Committee is a legal entity. It is run by, I think, by 165 members. President Trump, of course, the incumbent president has a lot of sway, but there is a republican chair of the committee, Ronna Romney McDaniel, and there is the committee.</p><p>And someone should stand up at that meeting, whatever President Trump thinks, I should think, and say this man should not be our finance chairman. Is that really that hard?</p><p>TODD: In a normal political world, I would assume Steve Wynn is not going to be at this meeting.</p><p>KRISTOL: Right.</p><p>LEE: But here is the thing. Every time an allegation like this comes up, President Trump sees himself in that person. And so you can`t separate that from this. And so it will be very interesting to see what he does in this particular case, but he just feels like he`s been in their shoes, he`s been on that side. We saw it with Roy Moore, even.</p><p>TODD: By the way, speaking of reckoning, this is one of those days where we feel like we`re back in December, where every hour, there was a new person caught up. Now, we have a former Hillary Clinton aide, Burns Strider, and the story of this one is that Hillary Clinton was presented with sexual harassment allegations against Burns Strider in her 2008 campaign.</p><p>The campaign manager said we got to dump him, and she said no. Maybe -- it is not --Hillary Clinton having a blind spot for men behaving badly is not news.</p><p>ROBINSON: Look, time`s up. I mean, you know, you can`t -- you know, that shouldn`t happen. And so if that indeed happened, I would like to know why. I would like to know why --</p><p>KRISTOL: They moved him to another entity, that was an ally of the campaign, where he harassed --</p><p>TODD: By the way, he instagrammed --</p><p>KRISTOL: And eventually fired.</p><p>TODD: -- pictures with him having lunch with her earlier this year. And, you know, I feel like -- I don`t know how the Clintons function as an entity inside the Democratic Party right now. I feel like they`re becoming more and more toxic for Democrats.</p><p>LEE: Largely because of this issue, distancing from Bill Clinton and not defending him anymore. But this is what really frustrates some women about Hillary Clinton is this stuff, is that, you know, that she`s seen as someone who presents herself as this advocate for women but really when it comes down to it, that she will do more for her political ambitions than necessarily the --</p><p>TODD: But let me present --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TODD: -- this is 2008. And she -- it`s possible that going through their head as well, you fire him for sexual harassment, then I`m considered a hypocrite for sticking by my husband. Like, now, you could argue that that`s been the trap Democrats were in with the Clintons for the past 10 years.</p><p>ROBINSON: Yes, well, look, at some point, that does not matter. At some point, you have to do the right thing. And if -- did you know in 2008 that it was a bad thing to sexually harass women? I knew it was a bad thing. It was a bad thing and it should have been dealt with.</p><p>TODD: Yes. This certainly puts a wrinkle -- she has hopes of being sort of the galvanizing force for this movement these days. All right, guys, happy Friday. Again, the government shutdown was a Monday. Think about this week.</p><p>All right, up ahead, a potential game changer for young athletes.</p><p>TODD: Well, on the day we found out that the NFL had more concussions recorded than ever before, it`s worth telling you about this, you may have missed. Illinois is considering a game changer to protect kids on the field. The state legislature has proposed a ban on tackle football for kids younger than 12.</p><p>It is called the Dave Duerson Act, named after a Chicago Bears player who died in 2011. Duerson was later found to have suffered from CTE, the brain disease linked to concussions. At a news conference Thursday, Duerson`s family said, this legislation could save a lot of lives from very early on.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TREGG DUERSON, SON OF DAVE DUERSON: The research on my father`s brain and others, we now know with certainty that part of the solution is to guard young children`s developing brains from the dangers of tackle football.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: Keep an eye on this bill. If it becomes law, many other states can get on board too, all in the name of keeping young athletes safe. Do you think 12 is now -- we may not see tackle football until high school.</p><p>That`s all we have for tonight. We`ll be back Monday with more \"MTP Daily.\" And if it`s Sunday, it`s \"Meet the Press\" on NBC.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

It is MEET THE PRESS DAILY. I`m Chuck Todd. The headlines right now would be rightly characterized as absurd if they weren`t also tragic. Because folks, this is no way to govern amid a raging pandemic, as 10s of millions are out of work or fear being put out of work.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The president is once again defending the inaccurate and frankly dangerous and conspiratorial claims of a random doctor he found on Twitter. He acknowledges he knows nothing about his doctor, but she caught his attention on Twitter by claiming that hydroxychloroquine can prevent and cure COVID.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The FDA of course begs to differ. More than 150,000 people have died in the United States from this disease, there is no cure available, yet what the public is witnessing is a bizarre proxy battle pitting the advice of our nation`s top infectious disease expert against the musings of a random doctor elevated by the president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There was a woman who was spectacular in her statements about it. That she`s had tremendous success with it. She said that she`s had tremendous success with hundreds of different patients. And I thought her voice was an important voice, but I know nothing about her.</p><p>ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALERGY AND INFECTOUS DISEASE: The overwhelming prevailing clinical trials that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it is not effective in coronavirus disease.</p><p>TRUMP: I was very impressed with her and other doctors that stood with her. I think she made sense, but I know nothing about it, I just saw her, you know, making a statement with very respected doctors. She was not alone.</p><p>FAUCI: All of those trials show consistently that hydroxychloroquine is not effective in the treatment of coronavirus disease or COVID-19.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: Dr. Fauci also today warned that, quote, we have no way of knowing where we are in this pandemic, and health experts inside the administration are warning states to take additional action right now. A senior administration official has confirmed to NBC News, the authenticity of this task force report published by the New York Times urging 21 red zone states to impose more restrictions.</p><p>As the president spreads these conspiracy theories, downplaying the severity of the virus, he`s arguably left Republicans on Capitol Hill in a state of confusion and disarray as Congress tries to pass another emergency relief bill.</p><p>There aren`t two sides in these negotiations. There`s an awkward three sides, but the package Republicans finally cobbled together with the White House is being blasted by some of their own rank and file, and it was also just undermined by the president himself when he spoke to reporters this morning, because he didn`t seem to fully grasp what was actually in the agreement.</p><p>And only adding to the mess on Capitol Hill is the fallout from Republican Congressman Louie Gohmert disclosing he tested positive for the virus, twice, mind you, as he was about to travel with the president to Texas. And if you have followed Congressman Gohmert lately, you know, he hasn`t exactly embraced all the recommended safety guidelines on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Joining me now from the White House is my NBC News colleague Shannon Pettypiece, also with us is Politico`s Anna Palmer, who covers Capitol Hill, Morgan Chesky is in midland, Texas, where the president is. We just heard from him. And I have Dr. Kavita Patel, NBC news medical contributor and a former adviser to the Obama White House.</p><p>Shannon, let me start with you and the president now in his second day of defending a doctor he knew nothing about but thought she said some interesting things. What -- is there -- you know, I think we talked about this earlier. Are people in the White House throwing up their hands? I mean, in some ways, this is not shocking behavior by the president. He does this all the time.</p><p>I mean, you know, the first interview I did with him, he said he gets his military advice from watching the shows. So now we`re finding out he might get medical advice from watching something. Is there any remorse from the White House about how damaging this is?</p><p>SHANNON PETTYPIECE, NBC NEWS SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: I mean, they continue trying to push this message, a real urgent message to get people to follow these basic health guidelines that they have been promoting for months now. Inside the White House, from top advisers on down, there is an acknowledgment that the only way we are going to get baseball and schools and bars back is if we bring down the number of infections to basically a rounding error and then put in some contact tracing and some really good testing.</p><p>The way to get out of that, the most effective tool they have right now, is social distancing and masks. So there`s a real emphasis, I`m told, to try and get that message out to people in these states. You raise an interesting -- you used that word govern in your introduction, Chuck, and I think it is interesting when you look at what the president does might not be that effective in governing when you talk about defending this video and retweeting this controversial video.</p><p>But it is effective in winning a culture war. And there is a distinction here that is emerging between governing and a culture war, and so many people outside the White House who like seeing the president defending hydroxychloroquine and pushing back against the media and the left Democrat and this narrative that they say is out there against hydroxychloroquine.</p><p>They are in it because they like the culture war fight. And when the president does stuff like this, they like to see him as their culture war, you know, the leader. As far as governing, though, inside the White House, not effective, and yes, there is a lot of sighing and head shaking going on.</p><p>TODD: Well, by the way, it`s not a narrative on hydroxychloroquine it`s his own FDA, it`s the scientific community, it`s the medical community, so it`s really -- Anna Palmer, you guys, I`ll give you this. It was an epic lead in the playbook today, and in some ways, it sort of was a reminder of like we`re so used to the wash, rinse, repeat of the absurdity of how Congress negotiates now over the last decade that we sometimes numb to the games playing, but how extra crazy is this?</p><p>ANNA PALMER, SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, POLITICO: Yeah, I think what we tried to really lay out is kind of all of this back and forth negotiating and people saying things but kind of behind the scenes things moving. I do think things have broken down. Mark Meadows just left Nancy Pelosi`s office saying that even a short-term deal is a no go right now.</p><p>I think the real problem from Republicans and the White House is that they still aren`t on the same page. You know, you had a lot of Senate Republicans still concerned about the price tag of the overall bill, which is kind of funny.</p><p>Actually, Republicans try getting back to those principles of not wanting to spend a lot of government money right now, and at the same time, you have Nancy Pelosi who I believes she`s in a very strong position because Republicans are in disarray, they`re going to need House Democrats.</p><p>And so they`re trying to push, you know, this administration as far as possible, but right now, it does appear that unemployment benefits are going to expire on Friday. You know, of course, and I always say this with this caveat because I covered Congress for a long time.</p><p>Being that it is still only Wednesday, 5:00, you know, those benefits don`t expire until Friday, so that is a long time in Congressional terms, but it just shows you kind of how dysfunctional and really this kind of overwhelming sense on Capitol Hill right now of frustration around masks and the fact that Louie Gohmert tested positive.</p><p>I was getting emails from members of Congress really saying that they`re, you know, just pissed off, they don`t understand, they can`t even -- you know, this is going to become the next super spreader. And so you have this kind of tenseness really underlying the overall negotiations as well.</p><p>TODD: You brought up the Gohmert thing. You guys reported on the Louie Gohmert positive test, and it seems as if his office, your partner in crime there, Jake Sherman, got -- walk us through that. It seems as if his office is in an -- I told you so moment themselves, is a little bit of a revolt here on their boss, Congressman Gohmert?</p><p>PALMER: Yeah, you rarely see these kind of behind the scenes staffer fights with their bosses come out in public, and what happened today is, Jake Sherman, who I write playbook with, we reported on Louie Gohmert testing positive, and we had a really hard time getting in touch with this chief of staff, with others, to talk about what was happening, and frustrated staff members emailed Jake and said, listen, I hope when you report this, that you also report that Mr. Gohmert has made all of us, including three interns, come into the office every single day, and that when people who do wear masks, they are often looked down upon or told not to.</p><p>And so you kind of just see this culture war that Shannon was talking about playing out in real time in a Congressional office, and I think there`s just a lot of frustration because, you know, as you know and a lot of people know, each members of Congress operates their own staff and hires them and fires them, and there`s really not a centralized notion in terms of this is what is happens, you know, here`s the requirements.</p><p>Every office has its own thing. So you have members of Congress who aren`t following guidelines, the pressure comes down on staffers who are sometimes 23, you know, they`re interns, and it really came out in public today. And I think we wanted to make sure that we put that in there just to show what is actually happening on Capitol Hill.</p><p>TODD: These are real people. Very quickly, what does Mitch McConnell do when you`ve got Ben Sasse in your Senate Republican conference saying the big Gohmert and Democrat Steve Mnuchin, he doesn`t trust -- there shouldn`t be more money, and then Marco Rubio on the other going, yes, it`s a lot of money, but the damage to the economy in long term over yanking money from people might be worth, I mean, can he put a bill on the floor that has half of the conference against it?</p><p>PALMER: I don`t think right now in the way that the contours of the bill are right now. I think what you`re really seeing, and it`s even, you know, members in leadership, John Cornyn and others saying that they`re nowhere. That there`s frustration on the size of the bill, but also I think real frustration around some of the extraneous things that aren`t coronavirus related that this White House wanted, you know, kind of famously at this point, the $1.5 billion for the FBI headquarters.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>PALMER: And so I think there`s some -- an attempt to really rein them in. Right now, I think as often, you know, Mitch McConnell plays this game better than anyone. He`s really taken a step back. He said, you know, this is kind of more of a discussion between the White House and House Democrats. And he`s really letting them do that now, of course, I believe at the end of the day, Mitch McConnell will come in as he often does at the end and try to cobble together some kind of a deal.</p><p>TODD: He needs the numbers though and right now, he may be lacking in numbers there. Let me go down to Texas where Morgan Chesky is following the president. And you know, Morgan, if I said during the pandemic that the president was going to Texas, one would assume, well, he must be checking in. Texas is a hot spot. How are they doing? But this is not a coronavirus trip. Tell us what this trip is about, Morgan.</p><p>MORGAN CHESKY, NBC NEW CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Chuck, not officially a coronavirus trip. The president did acknowledge it briefly during remarks he made to a tour during a -- to a tour do an oil rig site he made just a short time ago, but really the purpose for this trip down here to West Texas was for the president to try and get some fresh funding into the campaign.</p><p>We do know that an event that was held in Odessa, Texas, which is just down the road from us, was hopefully raising about $7 million. The local NBC affiliate reporting that it was a $280,000 a plate dinner. You could have your picture taken with the president for $50,000 -- I`m sorry, $20,000 buy-in dinner, a picture for $50,000, and you could sit at his table for a cool half million dollars.</p><p>So, we know there right now, Chuck, that really the president is trying to essentially come here and give these people a bit of hope. It`s been a tough go for the oil and gas industry here in Texas now for some time. And so the purpose was to try to get some new funding into that campaign but also after such a rough past few month here with the crash of the oil market, the president was trying to give some encouraging words to them as well. Chuck.</p><p>TODD: What kind of campaign message did he have? I mean, it did seem as if, did he veer? How much did he veer into that world, and how much did he try to keep it about the oil and gas industry?</p><p>CHESKY: The majority of the speech was really about the energy sector and bringing it back to life here in Texas. Because if you go back a year ago, this was really the life blood of the oil and gas industry. One in every three barrels coming out of the United States came from right here in the Permian basin, and so the president was trying to give some encouraging words, saying that he was going to pass several measures that would incentivize private investments.</p><p>That would allow export easier with Mexico, and that`s really reassuring for the folks who live here, because unemployment has spiked from about 2 percent in Odessa, Texas, up to 13 percent right now. That`s the highest in the state. And that really was the focus of the president`s remarks, Chuck, whenever he wasn`t talking in a fund-raising kind of campaign mode.</p><p>TODD: Right. Got you. Morgan Chesky on the ground for us with those working rigs these days. I know they -- we`ve been having a glut lately. We shall see. Dr. Patel, I want to close with you and sort of, we have lamented about political leaders and contradicting public health guidance.</p><p>I guess, is Louie Gohmert now sort of example A for you even though right now I got to play for you this sound bite, you won`t believe it when you hear it. In fact, I want to play it for you, because I want you to react to it. Here`s what Congressman Gohmert said, how he thinks he contracted the virus. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>REP. LOUIE GOHMERT (R-TX): I can`t help but wonder if by keeping a mask on and keeping it in place that if I might have put some germs, some of the virus onto the mask and breathed it in. I don`t know. But I got it. We`ll see what happens from here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: Dr. Patel, your reaction.</p><p>KAVITA PATEL, NBC NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR, FELLOW AT THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION: Where to begin, Chuck. First, I hope he does not suffer the consequences that so many Americans and people worldwide have suffered, and we`re learning more and more about even people who are asymptomatic, Chuck, and the long-term effects that they have, even though long term is months, but could be years.</p><p>I would say to Representative Gohmert, it`s not exhibit A. It`s a through z because it`s just another kind of notch in this kind of confusion and misinformation, and to kind of comment that potentially mask wearing is actually promoting the virus just goes counter not only to the evidence but by kind of lighting that fuse, it just promotes some of the thinking that`s already existed around a mask being political, a mask not being effective, and we are beyond that.</p><p>I mean, you have heard many of my own colleagues call for a national mask mandate. We`re not going to get that, but when you see states, including many red states now, Chuck, who have clearly gone to a mandate indoors and effectively outdoors, that should tell you something. And doing this at this hour, you know, it`s destructive.</p><p>TODD: I want to ask you, in fact, there`s a report out today of some, and this is early studies, but that COVID patients that survive are reporting some heart-related problems. What can you tell us about this study and what should we take away from it?</p><p>PATEL: Yeah, the principle takeaway is that we now know that coronavirus for both patients who are hospitalized as well as even for those that are not, has some pretty serious effects. And in this study, 100 patients in Germany, almost two thirds of them, Chuck, had enzyme levels in their body as well as radio graphic or x-ray changes to their heart muscle that look almost like a heart attack.</p><p>So to make that just even more profound, some of these were people who were not very sick and did not have a lot of comorbid or chronic conditions. By the way, that just re-enforces studies that have been done in the United States of people who were not hospitalized who weeks later over two thirds of them had fatigue and reported other symptoms.</p><p>So I would just say a takeaway is, you know, we have been debating about one doctor who`s talking about hydroxychloroquine. The takeaway, hydroxychloroquine is not useful. We have some progress on treatments, but the best thing you can do is prevent even being in a position where you have to talk about the effects of coronavirus and that does come from masks, distancing, and hand hygiene, and a lot of the things we`ve talked about already.</p><p>TODD: Given everything we now know and now the fear that even a mild case of this virus could lead to long-term health impacts, would you be recommending a shelter in place in these hot spots at this point?</p><p>PATEL: I think it`s got to be considered. Yes. Now, I say that knowing the serious gravity with which the implications of that on working families, et cetera. But Chuck, we got here because we`re not taking it seriously. We had no national strategy, as you pointed out, and on top of that, we are never going to do any sort of economic recovery if people just don`t feel safe.</p><p>So I do think it has to be considered. But again, it would be also be really nice, Chuck, we keep talking about testing, when I talk to you, it would be nice if some of us could get our tests back as quickly as Representative Gohmert did. So, at this point, I would be willing to take a day or two, but you know, it`s hard to see how you get ahead of this without putting into place that type of infrastructure.</p><p>TODD: Yeah. You can`t get April back. That`s the big thing. The time machine is I guess what we`re missing at this point. Anyway, Shannon Pettypiece, Anna Palmer, Morgan Chesky, and Dr. Kavita Patel, thank you all for getting us started.</p><p>Up ahead, the coronavirus crisis is growing everywhere, including the state of Kentucky. Cases and deaths are up. But testing is going down. I`m going to ask the Governor what he plans to do about that issue.</p><p>And later, the scramble to strike a new deal for coronavirus relief. I`ll talk with a top Senate Democrat about what he knows about the very latest on these negotiations.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FAUCI: When the southern states that have already been hit, the Florida, Texas, Arizona, southern California, when you look back on, you saw an increase in the percent positives of the tests that were done. That`s a surefire indication that you are in a process where you`re heading towards a resurgence. We`re starting to see that in some of the states now. Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: Welcome back. That was Dr. Anthony Fauci with our own Andrea Mitchell, one day after The New York Times since reported that the coronavirus task force founded the situation in 21 states is serious enough to place them in a quote, red zone. And while Kentucky was not on that list, cases there are up 72 percent in the last two weeks. The fourths highest increase in any state during that time. Deaths are also up 20 percent over the last 14 days.</p><p>Joining me now is the Governor of Kentucky, Democrat Andy Beshear. And heard Dr. Fauci name check your state there. Basically, it sounded like Governor, there`s a fear that you`re not in the red zone yet, but you could be. Tell me the situation as you see it right now, sir.</p><p>GOV. ANDY BESHEAR (D-KY): Well, we`re in a very dangerous position in Kentucky. Where we had had a very good control to the degree we can have good control of this virus. We had had a real success in dealing with COVID-19, of people coming together, doing the right thing, of not just flattening but crushing our curve. But what we have seen, and in different pieces since maybe the beginning of May, is a steady increase in cases, and those cases have really started escalating the last four weeks.</p><p>And so I think it`s fair to say that we`re at a point in time that probably Florida or California or Texas found them in weeks if not months ago or maybe a state like Oklahoma, which seems to be suffering, found themselves in weeks ago. But I think what will be the difference here in Kentucky is we are taking aggressive action right now. I want to do everything I can to make sure we do not face the same devastation as states to our south. My heart goes out to them, but I do want to make sure we don`t go through the same thing.</p><p>TODD: Governor, I`ll be honest with you. In almost every example I have seen across the country, in every state, no matter, it does feel as if whatever decision you end up making, you wish you would have made it a week earlier. Are you at all concerned you`re not, you know, issuing a shelter- in-place order now at least for Jefferson County, or are you concerned that you`re going to be a week late no matter how aggressive you believe you`re being?</p><p>BESHEAR: Many times because of when the results come in, you`re almost always chasing this virus by about two weeks. But here in Kentucky, we have already had our mandatory facial covering, mandatory mask order in place for two weeks. We have already limited our social gatherings back down to 10 and reduced them. We just a couple days ago closed our bars and reduced our restaurant capacity.</p><p>So, I believe we are in front of what the national experts are suggesting. I feel like we`re moving faster in that than many other states, but I think there`s always a chance to look back and wonder what if, but I believe we`re being more aggressive than most. Our goal is to stabilize and decrease our cases while trying to keep our economy as open as we can.</p><p>TODD: Is your testing situation a deal where you feel like you`re maximizing the tests that you can process? Or do you need more testing and more processing capability? Do you need both?</p><p>BESHEAR: You know, having been a new Governor when all of this started, watching us deal with the virus that didn`t even exist, basically until two weeks after I became Governor, to creating a test, to getting it out there, I have lived all this in real time. Right now, Kentucky`s fortunate to have about four private labs in this state that developed the ability to test for this and continue to increase their capacity.</p><p>We currently face a couple of challenges. Number one is reagents. Many of our larger hospital systems in Kentucky and our universities are having real difficulty getting it. And that means we could administer tests, we could have enough swabs, but the processing becomes difficult. The second piece is outside of some major metropolitan areas, we may have people who don`t want to get tested or are a little hesitant to get tested.</p><p>We need to make sure that everybody knows that defeating this virus is our patriotic duty that we`re all in this together as Americans. We`re not Democrats or Republicans. We`re Americans versus the coronavirus. Or we`re citizens of this world versus this virus. And so those are our major challenges.</p><p>Last couple days, we had more than 10,000 results each day, and for us, that puts us in a path to where we can at least know what we`re facing. But I will take more testing every single day. But let me just say that we can`t test, we can`t contact trace our way out of this virus.</p><p>TODD: Right.</p><p>BESHEAR: We have to do what it takes to prevent the virus. We`ve got to be willing to change our lifestyle in a way that protects the people around us and understand that even if we don`t agree with every rule put into place, we have everyone else`s lives in our hands at every moment. It`s a test of our humanity. When we do things that we might not even like if it protects the life, the job, or the education of someone else around us.</p><p>TODD: Your fiscal situation and the amount of money you had to spend in dealing with this virus, do you expect the federal government -- do you expect some federal government aid? And if you do, what`s the conversation like with one of your constituents named Mitch McConnell?</p><p>BESHEAR: Every Governor of every state and every local mayor or county judge desperately needs fiscal stabilization funds to be included in the next round of CARES Act or if this is the HEALS act or if it`s going to be the HEROES act.</p><p>TODD: Whatever name.</p><p>BESHEAR: It take (inaudible) economist out there. We`ll say that we need two things. Number one, we need to continue the unemployment as it has been these last several months, and number two, we need state stabilization funds.</p><p>In Kentucky, we face a $1.1 billion shortfall in our next fiscal budget, which will cause us the largest cuts in our history. So, I have communicated that to Senator McConnell. I know every Governors out there pushing for this to be included. It`s something where if we want our economy to rebound, which I would hope everybody wants it to, it simply must be included.</p><p>TODD: All right. What has he said? He doesn`t seem to be very publicly in favor of this. Do you feel like he`ll move on this?</p><p>BESHEAR: Well, our conversations are cordial. I always had a good relationship, despite being in different parties with Senator McConnell. My hope is that something that he is willing to do, that it seems like everything is a negotiation in Washington, and isn`t that frustrating? I see a little bit of that here.</p><p>I mean, doing the right thing in the midst of an international pandemic shouldn`t be that hard and pushing all the rest aside and just saying what do we need and let`s do it instead of let`s horse trade back and forth.</p><p>But that`s the way things appear to be done in D.C. So my hope is that there are plans in that horse trade to get it done but it got to happen quickly. Both the unemployment assistance and state stabilization needs to happen quickly. It is urgent for every state. It is urgent for our economy.</p><p>And put it this way. I am grateful that they are going to include money to help our schools deal with COVID-19. But if we have the deepest budget cuts in our history --</p><p>TODD: Yeah.</p><p>BESHEAR: -- how many teachers are going to be there to actually provide that education for our students? This is all connected. Let`s make sure we do it right.</p><p>TODD: Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, Democrat from Kentucky, thank you for coming on and sharing your perspective. Good luck, stay safe, and stay healthy.</p><p>BESHEAR: Thank you, you too.</p><p>TODD: You got it. Up ahead, a new clash over Portland. Are federal agents staying or going? The answer may depend on who you ask and actually how you ask the question. The latest on the battle between the state and the Trump administration is next.</p><p>TODD: Welcome back. New developments today in the ongoing standoff between protesters and federal officers in Portland. Oregon Governor Kate Brown announced on Twitter this morning and reiterated in a statement this afternoon that the federal law enforcement officers tasked with suppressing protests are leaving downtown Portland tomorrow and going home shortly thereafter.</p><p>But the acting DHS secretary, Chad Wolf, said in a statement on a conference call and then on Fox News that federal officers are not leaving Portland. President Trump today also said federal officers are not leaving until Portland has secured their city.</p><p>So let`s try to clear all this up. Pete Williams is here to try to explain the situation. So Pete, I have to say is this a situation where everybody is hearing what they want to hear in their conversations with each other?</p><p>PETE WILLIAMS, NBC NEWS JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, to some extent. I mean, look, I think everybody agrees on this, that the role of standing out in front of the courthouse and protecting it from violent demonstrators is going to be shifted to Oregon State police.</p><p>You`re going to see fewer feds outside in front of the courthouse and more state police. There will be some -- I think you`re going to see an additional, if you will, perimeter beyond that fence that the feds have put up around the base of the courthouse. That`s where the state police will patrol. There will be some state police inside the federal perimeter, too.</p><p>So the real question is, OK, what happens to all those federal officials that were there, and it seems pretty clear that they`re not immediately going to get on the bus and leave town, that the Department of Homeland Security wants to make sure that this handoff works and does what they want it to do, which is to say protect the federal building.</p><p>So, some of those CBP and ICE people who have been there will probably go back inside the building. Some of them may be mustered nearby to stand by in case they`re needed. They`re clearly not -- quote/unquote -- \"leaving Portland.\"</p><p>I think it`s very interesting that the statement from the homeland security department says they`re leaving downtown Portland, but they`re not leaving the area that they can be called in if they`re needed.</p><p>And then, as the days go by, if this handoff works, they`ll undoubtedly draw down the federal force. I think that`s what everybody really agrees on.</p><p>TODD: And again, it sort of gets at -- it feels like everybody heard what they wanted and ran to their corner to say it. Very quickly, we understand these operations are supposedly being expanded to Cleveland, Milwaukee, and Detroit. What does that mean?</p><p>WILLIAMS: The operations to counter violent crime are being -- they say are being extended to those other cities, all this part of operation legend, this -- what they try to draw a distinction here on crime fighting.</p><p>TODD: So this is more similar to what they`re doing in Kansas City, not necessarily what we`re seeing in Portland.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That`s right.</p><p>TODD: But it has been getting conflated quite a bit.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes.</p><p>TODD: Pete Williams, as always, sir, thank you for doing your best to help clear that up. Much appreciate it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You bet.</p><p>TODD: Up next, we`re going to talk to a key Democratic senator about where the latest virus relief bill stands and the very harsh words the president had for the entire Democratic Party. It was just moments ago. We`ll show it to you after the break.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They don`t love our country. In any way, shape, or form, they don`t love our country. There`s no respect, but there is by you and there is by 95 percent of our people. Our people love our country. And our people love our anthem and they love our flag.</p><p>The radical left wants to tear down everything in its way and in its place, they want power for themselves. They want power. They want to indoctrinate our children, defund our police, abolish the suburbs, incite riots, and leave every city at the mercy of the radical left. That`s not going to happen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TODD: Welcome back. That was the sitting president of the United States talking about fellow Americans moments ago in Texas. Not exactly the words you might expect from a president whose current chief of staff has been negotiating with Speaker Nancy Pelosi right now on a coronavirus relief bill, sort of quite the odd backdrop between the two.</p><p>And joining me now is the number two Democrat in the United States Senate, Dick Durbin. Senator Durbin, welcome back to the show. And look, I know we`re all numb to sort of political rhetoric these days but, you know, I`m old enough to remember when Hillary Clinton used the word \"deplorable.\"</p><p>There was this collective outrage. This probably won`t even register on the political Richter scale (ph). Any response to the president?</p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): President Trump`s rants have become even more bizarre for some of his thinking for his Twitter account, for the tweets that he puts out every hour of the day and night. But then he gets on the microphone and just spews this craziness, one crazy statement after another.</p><p>It`s no way to run a great country. It certainly in the midst of a pandemic, national health crisis, and an economy that`s flat on its back. I`m worried about it. We`re seeing Washington at its worst.</p><p>At this moment in time, Chuck, the leader of the Senate Republicans will not sit at the same table with the leader of the Democrats of the House and Senate. I don`t understand that. That really isn`t the way you get things done.</p><p>Back in march, we passed the CARES Act with a 96 to nothing vote. It was a bipartisan measure. The American people, at least people in Illinois, came up to me and said, well, thank goodness, I didn`t think that was ever going to happen in Washington. But we`re not close to a conversation yet.</p><p>At this point, I think the Republican senators are in disarray. Half of them have said and we have heard this from this, they`re not going to vote for anything, nothing, not a penny for anything. And you take a look at America today and say, really, are we going to walk away from 30 million unemployed people receiving federal assistance that all ends in just a matter of hours?</p><p>TODD: I`m curious. I asked this earlier today. It does seem as if the piecemeal approach is what is going to happen. Are you willing to support basically the quick fixes that you hear thrown out there, maybe temporarily extending UI, temporarily extending some of this stuff, the eviction moratorium, and then keeping the negotiations going? Is that -- is that a realistic sort of plan C here right now?</p><p>DURBIN: Well, I asked Chuck Schumer just minutes ago on the floor of the Senate, what is this piecemeal approach? He said they haven`t made that offer to us in any way, shape, or form. Secretary Mnuchin, who I`m told does a great job as a negotiator, is moving from office to office, trying to see if there`s any basis for agreement.</p><p>Do I think we should send a lifeline to 30 million unemployed Americans who are about to lose the check they`re depending on to pay their rent, their mortgage, their utility bills, their health insurance, put food on the table? Of course, I do. I wouldn`t want to leave these people in the lurch.</p><p>When it comes to rent, you know, there are folks -- how are you going to deal with being evicted in the midst of a pandemic when you`re supposed to shelter in place? Where is your shelter when you`re homeless?</p><p>TODD: You have been around Washington a long time. You have been in leadership a long time. I normally sort of ignore the games playing at this point, right? I feel like it is wash, rinse, and repeat.</p><p>There`s a debt ceiling, there is a cliff, there is a government shutdown, and it all ends up at the end, something happens. I have to be honest, I have no idea how you guys land this plane. Do you?</p><p>DURBIN: I don`t. And I can tell you, if you just look at the calendar, it was 10 weeks ago that Nancy Pelosi passed this rescue package called the Heroes Act. It helped state and local governments.</p><p>You just heard the governor of Kentucky talk about how desperate they are for assistance. It`s true across America, states blue and red. They do need help, and we believe it should be part of this. We need to help the unemployed. We need to make sure that the businesses have a chance to come back and be strong again.</p><p>And the Federal Reserve chairman tells us, don`t take your foot off the accelerator or things are going to get worse for the national debt and worse for the economy.</p><p>But I have to agree with you, Chuck. I sit here and think, if Mitch McConnell will not sit in the same room at the same table as the other leaders of the democratic side and someone from the White House, we`re a long way from getting things done. This is truly Washington at its worst.</p><p>TODD: Let me ask you this. Are Senate -- I mean it does seem as if Senate Republicans are divided. Are there some that are reaching across to you, saying, hey, look, we`ll work with you on X, Y, and Z? I mean, are you starting to see -- are those conversations breaking out or not yet?</p><p>DURBIN: They`re waiting for their cue from their leader, Senator McConnell, who has basically held back for 10 weeks and not produced anything until this last Monday. This last Monday, he gave us eight different bills that they want to introduce on the floor of the Senate.</p><p>Chuck, you don`t end up in a last-minute negotiation by introducing a bill to the floor of the Senate, for goodness sakes. That is their proposal. So, no, we haven`t heard many -- I haven`t heard any overtures from Republicans. They`re waiting for the leadership of Senator McConnell.</p><p>TODD: Before I let you go, you are -- some would say you were very instrumental in helping a young junior senator from Illinois to get on the national radar, get a bunch of support in the Democratic Party and Barack Obama. Do you have advice to Joe Biden on his running mate selection? Somebody you know a long time.</p><p>I mean, I know you`re partial to a current junior senator, Senator Duckworth, but what kind of advice have you given Joe Biden about how to go about finding a running mate?</p><p>DURBIN: Chuck, it was a once in a political lifetime to tap your junior senator on the shoulder and say, I`m behind you, run for president, and to sit in an RV with him in Florida as I did with a legal pad in his lap and go through potential names of running mates. He didn`t make the decision there, but he asked me my advice. I was flattered that he would even take the time.</p><p>What does Joe Biden need to do? First, he needs to pick a credible running mate who could run the government of the United States being a heartbeat away. Secondly, he needs someone who fits with him on a personality and chemistry basis. Third, I hope it`s someone who can really add something to bring this nation back together again.</p><p>We have to bind the wounds of this nation as Abraham Lincoln said in the second inaugural. More than anything, we need someone, and I think Joe Biden is that person, who has the caring and compassion to start to bring this country back together. His running mate can help.</p><p>TODD: And I assume you believe that should be Tammy Duckworth?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DURBIN: Well, I`m for Tammy Duckworth. Let me tell you, she`s an American hero.</p><p>TODD: I know.</p><p>DURBIN: What that woman has done with her life, what she has given to this country, what she continues to give, not only as senator from Illinois but as the voice of veterans in the military and on the democratic side of the United States senate, she`s an extraordinary person.</p><p>And there are aspects of her life which I`m just learning now which just confirm in my mind that she`s an inspiration. I think she would be a great running mate. I leave it to Joe to make the final decision.</p><p>TODD: She would be the first veteran on any ticket of either party since 2008. Anyway, Senator Dick Durbin, Democrat from Illinois --</p><p>DURBIN: What a veteran.</p><p>TODD: Yeah, that`s for sure. Thank you, sir, for coming on and sharing your perspective. Much appreciate it.</p><p>DURBIN: You bet.</p><p>TODD: Here is a live look right now at the Georgia State Capitol rotunda where Congressman John Lewis will lie in state until tomorrow. His private funeral will be held tomorrow at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, which of course is the former pulpit of Dr. Martin Luther King.</p><p>A source familiar with the planning tells NBC News that former President Barack Obama will deliver the eulogy. The long-time Georgia congressman will then be buried in Atlanta. John Lewis died on July 17th at the age of 80. We`ll be right back.</p><p>TODD: Welcome back. Four of the most influential men in tech are currently appearing in front of Congress virtually. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos have all been questioned all day by the House Judiciary subcommittee in hearing about the power of tech companies and whether they`re operating as monopolies.</p><p>Honestly, the hearing has been marked by unfocused questioning, much of it not focusing on anti-trust laws, partisan fighting, and yes, technical difficulties. Even the biggest names in tech can`t always video conference without a problem. Jeff Bezos may be buff but he was also buffering a lot today.</p><p>Washington Post technology reporter and MSNBC contributor Tony Romm is here to help us break it down. I`ve been using that bad joke all day, Tony. So thank you for giving me a quick laugh. Tony, what happened today that mattered and what happened today that didn`t?</p><p>TONY ROMM, MSNBC TECHNOLOGY CONTRIBUTOR, SENIOR TECHNOLOGY REPORTER FOR THE WASHINGTON POST: Yeah. Well, a lot of it matters. It was very disorganized sometimes. It was characterized by a lot of members of Congress doing their normal member of Congress things where they sometimes yell stuff that`s not necessarily relevant to the hearing that`s happening.</p><p>But really what we saw today was an exploration of power. It may have a bit about anti-trust in the letter of the law and whether these companies actually are monopolies or could survive a lawsuit, challenging them as monopolies, but lawmakers were probing what happens when companies get big and get powerful and the myriad kinds of consequences that could have.</p><p>And so we saw lots of exchanges in which in some cases lawmakers were bringing up e-mails that Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook and Tim Cook and his other executives at Apple were sending in which they talked about ways that at least in the minds of lawmakers showed they were keeping down competitors or taking actions or making other decisions that could hurt consumers or jeopardize their data.</p><p>So really this could set the stage for Congress to hold additional hearings, to do further inquiry, potentially even to regulate. So I wouldn`t count all of it out.</p><p>TODD: What did -- did you get a sense of -- from our CEOs, who was trying to be the, you know, the sort of the white knight here to say, here`s how you regulate us, and here is what we -- you`re right, we don`t do some things right? Was there anyone of them that was trying to be above the fray, if you will?</p><p>ROMM: Yeah. We`ve heard that line from time to time, especially from Facebook which has said, hey, come regulate us, we know that there are things that we can`t do on our own. In this case, we heard much more from the executives talking about their imports to the U.S. economy, particularly as we are dealing with the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus.</p><p>Time and again, the executives were pointing to the fact that they are not just big tech companies but they are big job creators. They pay people lots of money and they offer good benefits and they pour lots of dollars into research and development.</p><p>And so in some cases, that was their argument against breaking up their companies. Google said this actually pretty explicitly. Google CEO Sundar Pichai is saying that if they weren`t the size that they are, they couldn`t do the work that they do on gambits like self-driving cars and drones and things of that sort.</p><p>But often lawmakers just weren`t buying it. They really didn`t think that that alone was enough to shiedl these companies from scrutiny.</p><p>TODD: It is the beginning of what is clearly going to be a long, drawn out fight. I have a feeling, Tony, you and I might be talking about this for years as far as how long --</p><p>ROMM: Yeah.</p><p>TODD: -- it is going to take them to figure out how they`re going to regulate big tech. I apologize for the short segment, but I appreciate your succinct analysis. Thank you, sir. We`ll be right back.</p><p>TODD: That`s all we have for tonight. We`ll be back tomorrow. We`ll have more MEET THE PRESS DAILY then. \"THE BEAT WITH ARI MELBER\" starts right now.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Google, we're told, is subject of a looming antitrust probe by the DOJ[2]. Amazon, we've learned, is facing growing scrutiny from the FTC[3]. Apple stock also briefly did a nose dive[4] on the news that it too may soon be subject to a significant new antitrust probe. On its surface, many of these actions aren't all that surprising. After all, experts have noted for a decade than US antitrust enforcement has grown toothless and frail[5], and our definitions of monopoly power need updating in the Amazon era[6]. Facebook's repeated face plants on privacy (and basic transparency and integrity) have only added fuel to the fire amidst calls to regulate \"big tech.\" </p><p>But while Silicon Valley faces an endless cavalcade of outrage, the telecom sector[7] is suddenly seeing no scrutiny whatsoever. Whether it's the speed at which the problematic T-Mobile merger is being shoveled through the DOJ and FCC[8] or the blind eye being turned to major telecom privacy scandals[9] (like location data), telecom lobbyists have been on a successful tear convincing well-heeled DC lawmakers to ignore the massive, obvious monopoly, privacy, and competition issues inherent in telecom to focus exclusively on the problems in \"big tech.\" Yet somehow, this asymmetrical policy paradigm is still treated as entirely coincidental in press coverage. Only recently have some news outlets started to notice how well things have been going for telecom lately in DC[10] (Axios calls it telecom's \"sweet summer of revenge\"). Outlets have even started to finally realize that with former telecom lawyers now running the FCC and DOJ (Ajit Pai and Bill Barr), that is not coincidentally being reflected in federal policies attempting to hamstring telecom's competitors:\"In a June speech, DOJ Antitrust Division Chief Makan Delrahim laid out ways his agency could could go after Big Tech for anti-competitive behavior. In a June Senate hearing, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said, 'The greatest threat to a free and open internet has been the unregulated Silicon Valley tech giants that do, in fact, today decide what you see and what you don't,' he said.\"It's routinely understated how telecom lobbying, not a sincere worry about market power or privacy, is what's driving much of this current policy paradigm in DC (including much of the hyperventilation over nonexistent Censorship of Conservatives[11]). The telecom sector is pushing hard into an online advertising sector traditionally dominated by Silicon Valley. As such, telecom lobbyists have spent several years now[12] pushing to hamstring their direct competitors with the help of cash-compromised lawmakers and full blown regulatory capture. That includes successfully convincing government that a sector filled with natural, historically-predatory monopolies should see no guard rails whatsoever (see the killing of net neutrality and the neutering of the FCC[13] as example A). Yet somehow, there are still a lot of folks in tech policy circles who see the lopsided focus on \"big tech\" as entirely authentic, and any failure to police telecom as somehow coincidental. But folks in DC (like former FCC lawyer Gigi Sohn), are well aware that much of this current policy paradigm is highly-produced theater and, shockingly, all about money: The larger point is that the focus on big tech to the benefit of big telecom, cable ...dia is no accident. It's part of a concerted campaign ... is working big time. \u2014 Gigi Sohn (@gigibsohn) September 3, 2019[14]Again, none of this is to say that there aren't massive problems with Silicon Valley giants and plenty of authentic calls for reform. But it is a reminder that an oversized portion of the current anti big tech sentiment in DC is telecom driven. Intellectual inconsistency and campaign finance data usually makes it clear which lawmakers are telecom sector marionettes. More often than not consumer rights, market power, or healthy competition are the very last thing on the minds of those pushing lopsided regulatory solutions to a \"big tech\" problem they don't actually care all that much about.Permalink[15] | Comments[16] | Email This Story[17] [ 1]: <url

That doesn't count bills still in committees and measures passed by both chambers with differences that have to be sorted out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Legislative leaders have their fingers crossed, hoping to wrap up this week. A lot of people, businesses, local governments, lobbyists and others are nervously watching to see what lives and what dies.</p><p> Here's a rundown on what's coming up:</p><p> * Abortion restrictions: The House is expected to take final action on a previously passed Senate bill that imposes 48-hour waiting period and mandatory informed consent by a physician for women seeking an abortion. Virtually every one of the 73 Republicans in the GOP-controlled House back the bill, as do some of the 26 Democrats.</p><p> * School vouchers: The Republican-controlled Senate has already passed this bill, just as it does every session. But it awaits action in the House Finance Subcommittee, where its prospects are unclear. The bill allows low-income parents to use tax dollars to send their children to private or religious schools - Protestant, Catholic, Jewish or Muslim - provided the student's zoned public school is in the bottom 5 percent for achievement statewide.</p><p> The bill would affect Hamilton County and four other systems with failing schools. It starts with 5,000 students, rising to 20,000 within a few years. If not enough parents use the vouchers, they could go to other low-income students attending nonfailing schools if their districts have even just one failing school.</p><p> * Auto insurance: Decades in the making, this bill finally puts teeth into enforcing the current mandatory insurance law. The bill, which passed the House last week, could affect one of every five vehicle registrations in Tennessee, or about 1.1 million vehicles and their owners who have no insurance.</p><p> The state's 95 county clerks will be required to check a computer to see if vehicle owners have insurance, and reject registrations if they don't. And they can revoke registrations if insurance is dropped.</p><p> * Common Core education standards: Action is expected in the House and Senate on a compromise on the state's Common Core standards for math and English language arts. Republican Gov. Bill Haslam hoped to stall an attack by conservatives on the states-initiated standards aimed at ensuring students know what they should.</p><p> The compromise retains Haslam's current review process. But it officially repeals Common Core standards. And it adds a 10-member commission with four gubernatorial appointees and three each by the House and Senate speakers. The commission would have to OK the new standards before passing them along to the state Board of Education for final approval. Proponents say it will retain high standards. Critics contend it's simply a rebranding of Common Core.</p><p> * Municipal de-annexation: Rep. Mike Carter, R-Ooltewah, and Sen. Bo Watson, R-Hixson, have a bill letting some city residents initiate referendums to \"de-annex\" their properties. If a majority of voters in the territory approved, the municipality still could levy taxes to pay for improvements like sewers incurred before the de-annexation.</p><p> Watson's version is ready for floor action. Carter's bill, a follow-up to his 2014 bill eliminating annexation by ordinance and requiring public votes, is up in the House Finance Committee on Tuesday.</p><p> Cities are opposed to de-annexation referendums. \"We believe these matters are best handled locally,\" said Lacie Stone, a spokeswoman for Chattanooga Mayor Andy Berke.</p><p> If the bill passes, Watson thinks some areas forcibly annexed into Chattanooga, such as Hixson, \"will look at it.\"</p><p> \"But remember,\" he added, \"when you get de-annexed your financial responsibilities to whatever improvements that were made don't go away. I think it's a reasonable process to remove without undue [burdens] on cities.\"</p><p> * Undocumented students: After passing the Senate 21-12 last week, Sen. Todd Gardenhire's bill granting in-state college tuition rates to some undocumented students living in Tennessee faces its next big test in the House Finance Subcommittee this week.</p><p> As amended, the bill affects would-be students who have been designated \"lawfully present\" under a 2012 federal program.</p><p> \"I was surprised at the [Senate vote] margin,\" the Chattanooga Republican said. \"That's pretty remarkable. I think this margin gives it a real boost in the House. They were sort of waiting to see what we did.\"</p><p> * App-based rideshare services: Popular online transportation networks like Uber and Lyft are bypassing cities and lobbying legislatures to authorize their operations.</p><p> A bill by Watson strips cities' authority to license and regulate rideshare services and makes them self-regulating. The companies would be required to conduct criminal background checks on drivers.</p><p> While traditional taxi services have complained, the battle over the bill has involved Big Tech and Big Insurance. But Uber and Lyft and the major auto insurers compromised, and the bill is on the House and Senate floors this week.</p><p> \"Uber and Lyft is a whole new concept in legislation and we're trying to build a model that's new,\" Watson said, who added the bill was \"crafted, really, from a national perspective.\"</p><p> That's not making Chattanooga happy, since the city set up its own rideshare regulations earlier this year.</p><p> Stone said, \"As you know, Mayor Berke fought for local control during his time in the legislature. We believe Chattanooga came up with a good, common sense solution to ride sharing and we would like to see our local legislation protected.\"</p><p> * Revenue reform: Senators are expected to take final action on Haslam's proposed Revenue Modernization Act. Haslam says the bill, passed last week by the House, brings fairness to Tennessee-based companies.</p><p> The state could collect its 7 percent sales tax on the online licensing of software by business as well as the purchase of video games.</p><p> A major change in state business franchise and excise taxes will benefit local-area companies such as Volkswagen and McKee Foods, with large workforces and major capital investments in plants and machinery. Changes increase the weight given to sales in the tax formula and decrease the portion for personnel and equipment.</p><p> The bargaining and negotiations on the bill were conducted secretly by the Haslam administration and various companies. The bill that originally would have raised some $45 million a year now will bring in about $17 million, according to the state Revenue Department.</p><p> Those changes are important, Carter told colleagues last week, citing McKee as an example.</p><p> \"Let me explain something for all of us in Hamilton County and all of us in Tennessee,\" Carter said. \"McKee family bakery is a huge employer in the state of Tennessee. Do you realize that without this modernization act, they are paying franchise and excise tax on more than 100 percent of their business, literally because payroll and plant and those things are more weighted?</p><p> \"So why would they continue to bring more jobs to Tennessee?\" he asked. \"Why would they continue to build plants in Tennessee when they can go to their other regions throughout the country and not pay that tax.\"</p><p> The bill is \"the first step in a process to correct [that inequity].\"</p><p> * Transportation Equity Fund: A bill makes major changes to the 4.5 cents-per-gallon aviation fuel tax that helps pay for improvements at dozens of Tennessee airports, including Chattanooga's.</p><p> The bill delivers a tax break to Memphis-based FedEx, capping its aviation-fuel tax liability at $10.5 million annually. As a result, the Transportation Equity Fund - now $41 million to $48 million - would shrink by two-thirds.</p><p>FedEx pays an average 66 to 75 percent of the fund's annual revenues, which provide an estimated $32 million in annual grants to airports. In the last three fiscal years, the Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport has received $7.35 million from the fund, according to state Transportation Department figures.</p><p> Proponents note the state has pumped hundreds of millions into incentives to lure and expand companies like Volkswagen, and say the break will help keep FedEx from moving refueling operations to other states.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKTN-1178556</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2898FC6AFE8AB7 NWBKTN2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FT5-3K51-F0NV-F3YG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401981</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-02-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1445\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Daily Herald, Stephens Media, LLC, d/b/a The Daily Herald<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Rockefeller.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Donald Trump weighed in ahead of the proceeding in late July, telling reporters \"there's no question that what the big tech companies are doing is very bad\" when he was asked about potential actions against social media company, TikTok. The president has railed against Amazon.com and its founder/CEO Jeff Bezos since taking office, and signed an executive order in May aiming to institute new regulations on social media platforms just days after Twitter posted a fact-check notice on a Trump tweet about mail-in voting.</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline, D- Rhode Island, is chairman of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law, which hosted the well-known tech CEOs in late July. Cicilline and his House colleagues were armed with a trove of material, the work product of an investigation that had been in play for over a year. The committee chairman said the inquiry had, in his opinion, uncovered evidence that Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook were guilty of \"killing the small business, manufacturing and the overall dynamism that are the engines of the American economy.\"</p><p>\"Many of the practices used by these companies have harmful economic effects,\" Cicilline said. \"They discourage entrepreneurship, hike costs and degrade quality.</p><p>\"Simply put, they have too much power.\"</p><p>And federal officials are not alone when it comes to putting the actions of U.S. tech behemoths under the legal microscope.</p><p>Multiple active investigations looking at tech companies by U.S. state attorneys general are currently underway, including two expansive efforts that have Facebook and Google in the crosshairs.</p><p>As Congress prepares to release its investigative findings, and state prosecutors continue to work toward possible indictments, the leading U.S. tech concerns share more than just the ire of elected officials who have been making political hay by pillorying them. These companies are all crushing it in their various enterprise spaces, and while some will point to that as further evidence that malfeasance is afoot, a more simple explanation might be that consumers' love for these companies' services and products is just more powerful than their collective concerns over good corporate conduct.</p><p>New data from university-based research group Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University suggests that may be exactly the case, particularly when user sentiment is filtered for opinions that may be being driven by the Beltway news cycle.</p><p>The national survey overseen the by the Center for Growth and Opportunity and conducted by pollster YouGov in July, found that trust in big tech companies, with Google as a stand-alone example, varied widely based on how much political news a respondent followed. While 47% of self-identified news junkies said they either partially or completely distrusted Google to collect and use their personal data, only 18% of those who \"hardly\" follow political news registered distrust in the search giant's use of personal information.</p><p>Christopher Koopman, executive director for the Center for Growth and Opportunity, said the polling data not only reflects a disconnect between the general population and the stances of many elected officials, but profound attitude differences in the respondents based on their relative news consumption habits.</p><p>\"Much of the anti-tech sentiment is the product of Beltway politics,\" Koopman wrote in a report on the polling data. \"Many questions we asked about these companies seem to divide Americans based on those who closely follow political news and those who do not.</p><p>\"On the surface, it is easy to watch what is happening today and think that Americans have soured on tech companies. In reality, however, this is more a reflection of insider politics than anything else. Our poll results indicate that, in many ways, the 'techlash' is a Beltway-manufactured crisis echoed only by those who follow it closely.\"</p><p>In an interview with the Deseret News, Koopman said the survey, which gathered responses from 1,000 U.S. adults, is reflecting a bigger trend when it comes to national issues.</p><p>\"I think the conversations happening right now focused on tech companies are emblematic of other conversations across the country,\" Koopman said. \"The issues in many ways have become unmoored from the bedrock principles of antitrust conduct and consumer welfare ... and politics and political theater are elevated over intellectual honesty.\"</p><p>Koopman noted that the attacks on tech companies reflect a rare moment of bipartisanship at a time when most issues are serving to widen the political gap.</p><p>\"The tech companies are being criticized on the left and right for slightly different reasons but the underlying arguments being made are quite similar,\" Koopman said. \"(Democratic Sen. Elizabeth) Warren and (Republican Sen. Ted) Cruz may not agree on much, but they would agree that Big Tech is a problem.\"</p><p>When it comes to how tech companies impact quality of life issues, the Center for Growth and Opportunity survey showed that when it comes to Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, the majority said a government-imposed breakup would either make their individual lives \"worse off\" or they were unsure of potential impacts.</p><p>If viewed through the lens of market performance, the stockholders in these companies have become decidedly better off in the last six months.</p><p>All four tech giants have seen meteoric rises in market values with Apple, at one point in August, hitting the unprecedented $2 trillion mark and earning the company the title of most valuable U.S. company in history.</p><p>Along with record earnings, U.S. tech companies also appear to be riding a tide of new consumer confidence amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>According to data collected in April by Harris Insights and Analytics, 81% of Americans approve of large tech companies helping to trace coronavirus cases they may have been exposed to.\u00a0And 38% said their view of the tech industry has, overall, become more positive since the start of the outbreak.</p><p>In an opinion piece for The Hill, Joshua Brown, industry commentator and CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, wrote that comparing the conduct of modern tech companies to the titans of the Industrial Age and their attendant monopolies, is a faulty analogy.</p><p>\"The monopolies of past eras of American history attracted the ire of antitrust proponents because, upon attaining a certain size within their industries, they had become abusive to everyday consumers who found themselves with a limited amount of choice,\" Brown wrote.</p><p>\"What's tricky about today's alleged monopolists is that they've actually used their size to do the opposite. Consumers have not been harmed by Amazon's dominance over e-commerce, they actually love it, which is why there are over 100 million Prime users paying an annual membership fee for the privilege.\"</p><p>And Brown noted that consumers continue to underscore their lack of outrage over the conduct of big tech concerns in the most basic way possible - by continuing to use the services.</p><p>\"Consumers have benefited from the size of these companies and they plainly like the integration of their apps, their preferences, their shopping habits and their browsing history,\" Brown wrote. \"If they didn't, they'd simply sign out and stop using them altogether.</p><p>\"But no one signs out.\"</p><p>email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:araymond@deseretnews.com\">araymond@deseretnews.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DESNWS-52785547</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DESNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60V3-1XW1-DY6J-M00F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1351\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Deseret News Publishing Co.</copyright><publicationName>Deseret Morning News (Salt Lake City)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 14, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Mueller's office was preparing to tell a federal court that Stone pushed an associate to get documents from WikiLeaks -- information that is now known to be stolen from the Democrats by Russian hackers -- that could help the Trump campaign, according to a draft of a court filing and other documents shared with CNN by Stone associate and conservative author Jerome Corsi. Democrats are warning President Trump that even dangling a pardon for Paul Manafort could lead to a charge of obstruction of justice. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders says she is not aware of any conversations for anyone's pardon involving this process. Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith won Mississippi's U.S. Senate runoff election, defeating Democratic challenger Mike Espy. That gives Republicans 53 seats in the Senate and Democrats 47. Meanwhile, in the House, the Dems picked up another seat after Xochitl Torres Small defeated Republican Yvette Herrell in a race in New Mexico, bringing the Democratic pickups to 39 seats, with one race to go. The main shelter housing Central American migrants in Tijuana is now at least three times above capacity, housing almost 6,000 people. CNN crews visiting the makeshift shelter finding squalid conditions.

I'm Dave Briggs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ROMANS: A deeper shade of blue by the day.</p><p>I'm Christine Romans. It is 30 minutes past the hour.</p><p>But let's begin with this. We have a much clearer idea, this morning, what special counsel Robert Mueller may know about the Trump confidant, Roger Stone's effort to get documents from WikiLeaks.</p><p>CNN has obtained draft court documents apparently written by Mueller's office. They cite e-mails between Stone and his associate, the right- wing author Jerome Corsi, during the 2016 campaign. In them, Stone pushes Corsi to get in touch with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and Corsi reports back Assange has document dumps in the works that will damage Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Political correspondent Sara Murray has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Christine and Dave.</p><p>Jerome Corsi's legal troubles could be giving us a glimpse into special counsel Robert Mueller's potential collusion case. Corsi was an associate of Roger Stone's and shared a pile of draft documents with CNN that allegedly show Stone pushing Corsi to try to obtain documents from WikiLeaks that could be helpful to the Trump campaign. This was in the summer of 2016. Now, the documents include a draft court filing that provides insight into what Mueller may know about Stone's efforts to obtain information from WikiLeaks in 2016.</p><p>Now, Corsi says that summer wasn't the only time Stone told him to go to WikiLeaks and try to get the goods. He claims he spoke to Stone on October seventh in the hours before the now-infamous \"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD\" tape became public. Stone wanted him to try to mitigate the fallout with some help from WikiLeaks.</p><p>JEROME CORSI, CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST: We get to October seven which was a very, very busy day from here in New York. And, Roger calls me three times -- we had -- three times we have a discussion.</p><p>Now, my recollection is that Roger is saying, you know, this Billy (Bush) is going to be dropped and Assange getter get going. You know, why don't you get to your buddy Assange and tell him to start.</p><p>Well, I didn't have any contact with Assange, you know, but Roger, going back to July and August, may have -- you know, may have led him on.</p><p>MURRAY: Stone denies Corsi's version of events, telling CNN it is pure, unadulterated B.S.</p><p>Now, Corsi still insists he never had any contact with Assange and Stone still says he never had any advanced knowledge of WikiLeaks document dumps.</p><p>So far, neither man is facing charges. Corsi says he won't sign on to a plea agreement the special counsel has offered him. They want him to plead guilty to perjury but he says he never knowingly lied to investigators.</p><p>As for what's next, Corsi says he doesn't know but he knows the special counsel's office is none too happy that he's gone on this publicity tour.</p><p>Back to you guys.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: All right, Sara. Thank you so much for that.</p><p>Democrats are warning President Trump that even dangling a pardon for Paul Manafort could lead to a charge of obstruction of justice.</p><p>White House press secretary Sarah Sanders says she's confident the president was involved in no wrongdoing and was not part of any campaign collusion. She was asked whether a pardon for Manafort is on the table.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONATHAN KARL, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, ABC NEWS: Given that the president said this morning that Robert Mueller is ruining people's lives, is he considering a pardon for Paul Manafort or for others who were prosecuted -- have been prosecuted?</p><p>SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I'm not aware of any conversations for anyone's pardon involving this process.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: But, Rudy Giuliani is not ruling anything out. He tells CNN the president has \"been upset for weeks about what he considers the un-American, horrible treatment of Manafort.\"</p><p>BRIGGS: Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith will keep her Senate seat, holding off a Democratic challenge in Mississippi. CNN projects Hyde- Smith will defeat Democrat Mike Espy in the Senate runoff election.</p><p>The race drew national attention centered largely on Hyde-Smith's comments evoking the state's dark history of racism and slavery. She acknowledged it was a difficult campaign.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HYDE-SMITH: You can get brutalized, you can get beat up. That's kind of part of this business.</p><p>We're putting it behind us. We can go forward and we're not looking back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Hyde-Smith will now finish out the final two years of Thad Cochran's term. He retired from the Senate earlier this year. She'll have to run again in 2020 for a full 6-year Senate term.</p><p>ROMANS: Meantime, the Democratic majority in the next House keeps growing. The party picked up another seat with Xochitl Torres Small beating Republican Yvette Herrell in New Mexico's second congressional district. That makes a net gain, so far, of 39 seats for the Democrats.</p><p>BRIGGS: Can they reach 40? Just one House race left to call -- that's California's 21st congressional district. Democrat T.J. Cox has pulled ahead of Republican Congressman David Valadao by just over 400 votes in the latest tally.</p><p>CNN and other news organizations had called that race for Valadao on election night and withdrew the projection as the count tightened.</p><p>[05:35:08] ROMANS: All right, let's bring in \"CNN POLITICS\" digital director Zach Wolf, live in Washington. Good morning, Zach.</p><p>And let's talk about that blue wave which is now sort of a blue tidal wave over the past few weeks.</p><p>Interesting -- Harry Enten ran the numbers for us after we were talking about this late yesterday. Before the election, 58 percent of the population had a GOP governor. After the election, it was 47 percent. So it's not just these House numbers, right? It's not just all of the state legislatures, which is true -- the governorships. You know, you look at that and that shows you just how blue that blue wave is.</p><p>ZACHARY WOLF, DIGITAL DIRECTOR, CNN POLITICS: Yes, it really changed, I think, the makeup of the -- of the country's political infrastructure. The thing that we always talk about is that Democrats now control the House.</p><p>Something just sort of nine million more people voted for a Democrat in this most-recent midterm than for a Republican. That's a huge margin, bigger than it was for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in the popular vote in the -- in the -- in the 2016 election. So you can sort of see this huge shift here.</p><p>Now the question is going to be is this something that lasts?</p><p>ROMANS: Right.</p><p>WOLF: Does it go through until 2020, and that's kind of the next question.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes, that 8.9 million vote margin larger than Watergate, which is the largest ever for the House Democrats.</p><p>But, Barack Obama lost 63 seats in 2010 and get reelected. So what does it tell us for 2020 beyond the Senate is turning redder and the House is turning bluer?</p><p>WOLF: I think you have to go back to Herbert Hoover to find a president who lost the majority and then went on to lose reelection. It doesn't happen very often. People -- they have a way of rebounding.</p><p>And, you know, Harry Truman went out after losing the majority and was able to villainize the Republicans, and you can bet that Donald Trump is going to do exactly the same thing here.</p><p>Now, Donald Trump, however, is vastly different as a politician than any president before him --</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>WOLF: -- and he's so much more polarizing, I think, that it's going to be a lot different with him.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes, a lot of those presidents then turn to the center --</p><p>ROMANS: Right.</p><p>BRIGGS: -- or triangulate, as Clinton did. We don't see that happening --</p><p>ROMANS: Right.</p><p>BRIGGS: -- by any means here. ROMANS: One of the reasons why citizen Donald Trump is President Donald Trump is because of places like Trumbull County, Ohio where there's this Lordstown Chevy Cruze -- where they make Chevrolet Cruze. A plant where the flip in that county -- I mean, 29 points -- rarely votes for a Democrat and flipped by 29 points to Trump for a Republican. He won there solidly.</p><p>Macomb, Michigan where there's the Warren -- the Warren, Michigan plant. Same sort of story. Huge flip from the Democrats to President Trump.</p><p>And they're losing their jobs. Those people there are losing their jobs after the president said you vote for me, I promise you, not going to happen.</p><p>Are his empty promises going to hurt him here or he is going to find a way to cast the blame on GM or on the Fed chief or find a boogeyman for this?</p><p>WOLF: Well, you did see Democrats in the midterms sort of rebuild a little bit of the Rust Belt with wins in governor's races in Michigan and in some other places, so that's really important, I think, for them. Can they -- can they get back Pennsylvania and Michigan -- these places that were so disaffected with Democrats -- part of the -- formerly part of the blue wall that essentially handed Trump the presidency?</p><p>And if there are a lot more plant closures I think that will be something that really worries President Trump. And I think that's probably also why he has gone so, so hard against GM for cutting those plants.</p><p>ROMANS: He said he was going to fix NAFTA. He fixed NAFTA, took the credit -- the victory lap for fixing NAFTA -- and you're still having five plants shut down in North America.</p><p>BRIGGS: Zach, I want to circle back to the top story. A lot of developments in the Russia investigation, including \"New York Times\" reporting that Paul Manafort's lawyers have been briefing the Trump team. Now we know that plea deal is off the table.</p><p>Trump on, and on, and on, tweeting about this yesterday. But, in part, he said, \"Heroes will come of this and it won't be Mueller and his terrible gang of angry Democrats.\"</p><p>Does this appear to you like a pardon is coming to Paul Manafort?</p><p>WOLF: Well, you know, for Paul Manafort to sort of get messed up with the plea deal doesn't make it seem like he's really working with Mueller.</p><p>So the other interesting thing is there's some reporting in \"The New York Times\" and also to CNN a little bit that it's possible that Mueller has actually been back-channeling, essentially, with the president's team. If they're in cahoots that would certainly seem to suggest that there could be a pardon coming down the pike. And in that clip you ran of Sarah Sanders, she certainly didn't rule it out. And I think that's kind of what everybody expects at this point, is a Mueller pardon.</p><p>BRIGGS: And if that happens, real quickly, do you think Senate Republicans would be on board with that?</p><p>[05:40:03] WOLF: Well, there's nothing they could do about it and I don't think there's -- they're sort of in bed with Trump at this point.</p><p>ROMANS: Right.</p><p>WOLF: There might a hue and cry but they're probably not going to do anything against him unless the public sentiment was so overwhelming that they had absolutely no other choice.</p><p>ROMANS: And, Trump famously has said he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and it wouldn't matter. That --</p><p>BRIGGS: So far, that has proven true.</p><p>ROMANS: So far, that has proven true.</p><p>BRIGGS: Zach Wolf, thank you.</p><p>WOLF: Thank you.</p><p>BRIGGS: All right.</p><p>President Trump explaining why he's so skeptical of his own administration's report on climate change.</p><p>He tells \"The Washington Post,\" \"One of the problems that a lot of people like myself -- we have very high levels of intelligence, but we're not necessarily such believers. You look at our air and our water and it's, right now, at a record clean.\"</p><p>For the record, the Environmental Performance Index ranks the U.S. 83rd in the world in air pollution, 29th in water and sanitation.</p><p>Sarah Sanders, by the way, insists the federal government's climate change study produced more than -- by more than 300 scientists and experts is not case in fact.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDERS: It's not data-driven. We'd like to see something that is more data-driven -- that's based on modeling, which is extremely hard to do when you're talking about the climate.</p><p>Again, our focus is on making sure we have the safest, cleanest air and water, and the president's going to do exactly that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) BRIGGS: When asked about the deadly wildfires in California, the president, once again, claimed the problem could be solved by continuing to rake the forests.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. The president blaming recent drops in the stock market and those plant closures at General Motors on the Federal Reserve. The president says he's not even a little bit happy with his pick for Fed chairman, Jerome Powell.</p><p>He tells \"The Washington Post\" -- \"So I'm doing deals and I'm not being accommodated by the Fed. I'm not happy with the Fed. They're making a mistake because I have a gut and my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else's brain can ever tell me.\"</p><p>You know, the Fed is still is being -- is accommodating.</p><p>BRIGGS: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>ROMANS: That's why they're raising interest rates because --</p><p>BRIGGS: That's a gem.</p><p>ROMANS: -- it's so accommodative that the -- yes.</p><p>BRIGGS: Enough.</p><p>ROMANS: I have no more. I have no more.</p><p>BRIGGS: Ahead, just hours from now, a Senate briefing on the murder of a \"Washington Post\" U.S. resident, Jamal Khashoggi. The Secretary of State and his Defense secretary will be there, but it's who will not be there that is certainly raising some eyebrows. That's next.</p><p>[05:46:38] BRIGGS: Senate aides telling CNN the White House does not want CIA director Gina Haspel to testify at today's classified briefing for the entire Senate on the murder of \"Washington Post\" journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Sec. James Mattis will be at the closed-door briefing.</p><p>ROMANS: Senate aides say Haspel may be able to shed some light on the contents of an audio recording of Khashoggi's killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. But, aides say the West Wing is keeping Haspel under wraps for fear she might share details that don't match up with the White House response to Khashoggi's murder.</p><p>The White House denies claims it is preventing her from testifying.</p><p>Ahead of today's hearing, \"The Wall Street Journal\" published a remarkable op-ed by the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. He says degrading ties between a Kingdom and the U.S. would harm national security and do nothing to push Riyadh in a better direction at home.</p><p>BRIGGS: All right, to the latest on the southern border. We're learning the main shelter housing Central American migrants in Tijuana is now at least three times above capacity, housing almost 6,000 people.</p><p>CNN crews visiting the makeshift shelter finding squalid conditions.</p><p>CNN's Leyla Santiago in Tijuana with the latest.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LEYLA SANTIAGO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Dave and Christine, this makeshift shelter -- these tents -- state officials here say are already three times -- at least three times over capacity. More than 5,000 Central American migrants are now calling this the home of the caravan.</p><p>And resources are now becoming a concern, not only for the mayor of Tijuana as well as state officials but also for the migrants themselves.</p><p>They tell me that food has become an issue. Many are saying that there is not enough of it and the food that is available will take hours and hours in line to get.</p><p>And then, let me walk you through here. This is -- these are the bathrooms.</p><p>I also want to point out what you may be able to hear, which is a helicopter flying over. That is sort of one of the things they see a lot of here. This has become part of the environment here, constantly hearing the helicopters that are flying over, and these are U.S. helicopters.</p><p>Let me get back to what I was showing you earlier. This is a problem -- the cleanliness. These are the bathrooms. They have -- and you can see water spilling out from the showers that are available, as well as the port-o-johns themselves.</p><p>And so, not only is cleanliness and food an issue, many of these migrants are sick because of the journey. Many have blistered feet, as well as cold symptoms, and their bodies are just sort of aching as they wait here to be able to seek asylum in the United States despite what happened over the weekend with a clash with U.S. officials on the other side of the border.</p><p>Again, let me make this clear. That, right there -- what you see just past that fence is the United States of America. That is where these migrants want to go but U.S. officials are now saying it could be at least six weeks before they can even begin to process the asylum claims of the caravan -- Dave, Christine.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[05:50:01] ROMANS: Leyla Santiago.</p><p>All right, let's get a check on \"CNN Business\" this morning.</p><p>Global markets higher as investors look ahead to that G20 summit.</p><p>In Asia, the Nikkei and the Shanghai indexes both up one percent. The Hang Seng also up.</p><p>European markets opened mixed here. The DAX, in Germany, a little bit higher. The FTSE, in London, down. And, the Paris up just a tiny bit.</p><p>On Wall Street, futures adding the small gains from Tuesday.</p><p>But the main event today is the Fed chief, Jerome Powell's speech at the Economic Club of New York. The president bashing him, blaming him for plant closures from GM and a lot of other things.</p><p>The Dow closed 109 points higher on Tuesday. The S&amp;P up just a little bit. The Nasdaq basically flat here. I'm calling that nothing.</p><p>General Motors closed down 2.6 percent after the president threatened to cut electric vehicle subsidies.</p><p>A buyer backs out and Papa John's stock tanks. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported asset manager Trian Management Funds no longer interested in bidding for Papa John's. According to the \"Journal,\" others are still considering taking a stake in the pizza company but not a total purchase.</p><p>Papa John's stock closed down 10 percent Tuesday.</p><p>The pizza chain has been working hard to distance itself from its controversial founder, John Schnatter. He resigned as chairman in July after news broke he had used the n-word on a conference call -- about sensitivity, of all things.</p><p>Earlier this month, Papa John's said same-store sales in North America fell by about 10 percent in the most recent quarter.</p><p>All right, is Microsoft the new tech heavyweight? Maybe.</p><p>Microsoft briefly overtook Apple to become the world's most valuable company on Tuesday. Microsoft closed up 107 points, Apple closed down 174 points, and that put Microsoft on top.</p><p>The rise is fueled by its ability to avoid all these disappointing earnings results and increased regulatory scrutiny that have plagued many of the big tech rivals recently, Dave.</p><p>BRIGGS: All right.</p><p>An Arizona man wanted his party to be a real blast. He got that and much more.</p><p>ROMANS: It's a boy and an $8 million fine.</p><p>BRIGGS: Congratulations. The stunt that ignited a disaster is next.</p><p>[05:56:22] BRIGGS: All right. A gender reveal party went horribly wrong, sparking a huge wildfire in southern Arizona. In this video from last April, a target containing explosive tannerite meant to explode and blue powder to reveal Dennis Hickey and his wife were having a son.</p><p>It also ignited a fire that grew to some 47,000 acres causing $8 million worth of damage.</p><p>Dickey pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge. He'll be paying restitution for the next 20 years.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes, so much for the college fund. It's paying to clean up the wildfire.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: It's a boy. No, it's a wildfire.</p><p>The creator of the mega-hit Nickelodeon cartoon series \"SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS\" has died.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>\"SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS\" clip.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Steven Hillenburg was 57. He suffered from Lou Gehrig's disease.</p><p>He combined his love of drawing and marine biology to create that Emmy-winning series. Hillenburg also wrote, directed, and produced two animated features. More recently, \"SPONGEBOB\" became a Broadway musical.</p><p>BRIGGS: All right, think table tennis isn't exciting, think again. Check out 50-year-old Norwegian player Christopher Chen. He fell to the ground trying to return a drop down by the seat of his pants, literally. Blindly, he stuck his paddle in the air and pulled off what some are calling the block of the decade.</p><p>Chen actually lost the point though when his opponent returned a miracle shot. The youngster, though, still the talk of the Internet.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. The freshman class has arrived in Washington and like all newbies, they're getting made fun of, including by the late- night shows.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIMMY FALLON, HOST, NBC \"THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON\": Down in Washington, the new members of Congress have started meeting their fellow lawmakers. Of course, it can be hard to meet new people, which is why a lot of them come prepared with their own statements to break the ice. Here's North Carolina Congressman David Price. His icebreaker is -- \"I have 60,000 unread e-mails because I do not know how to use the e- mail.\"</p><p>Next here, South Dakota Congressman Dusty Johnson. His icebreaker is -- \"I only got elected with the name Dusty Johnson because my opponent's name was Harry Dangler.\"</p><p>Here's New York Congressman Eliot Engel. His icebreaker is -- \"If you like my giant mustache, then it did its job of distracting you from my tiny eyebrows.\"</p><p>Next up us Utah Congressman John Curtis. His icebreaker is -- \"Nice to meet you, my precious.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: All right.</p><p>BRIGGS: That's not nice.</p><p>ROMANS: Welcome to Washington, everyone, and welcome to late-night comedy.</p><p>BRIGGS: A little hazy.</p><p>ROMANS: Thanks for joining us.

The Special Counsel investigation into Russian election meddling now reaching inside social media giant, Facebook.  Sources confirming to CNN, Robert Mueller's team has obtained a search warrant compelling Facebook to surrender information about campaign-related ads bought by account that now been linked back to the Russian government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's why this could really matter.  To get such a sweeping warrant, prosecutors need to demonstrate probable cause of a crime.  It's illegal for a foreign national to interfere in the U.S. election and it would be a crime if any U.S. citizen worked colluded with them, for example, to offer political advice like with issues and states.  Those ads should target.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So this is a, A, it's big deal anyway to have a private company like Facebook, have the Special Counsel come knocking saying, turn over the records.  And now you get into this whole question, this collusion question and the idea is the Trump campaign will tell you.  Their team dragged about their use of digital space particularly Facebook in the final weeks of the campaign they think is what turned Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.  Now the question is, if this Russian accounts, Russian bought ads were in the same places, coincidence or not?</p><p>JULIE PACE, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPODENT, ASSOCIATED PRESS:  Well, I mean, it's a huge open question I think at this point, but this is what the Mueller team is after right now.  We've been in this space with the Russian investigations where you've had a lot of rumors floating around, a lot of ticky-tack things out there.</p><p>This is pretty serious.  This is a big deal not just for this investigation.  It's a big deal for future U.S. elections.  And Facebook, the company that has been pretty opaque in their political dealings, pretty opaque in terms of how their ads are purchased, who they deal with there.  So the consequences of this, not just for the Mueller investigation but broadly for politics, for big tech and its relationship with Washington are -- could be hugely consequential.</p><p>JACKIE CALMES, WHIT HOUSE EDITOR, LOS ANGELES TIMES:  That's right.  I mean, we're into the mid-term cycle now which is a hugely consequential mid-term.  I mean, most of them are, but this one really is and with the control of Congress at stake in the mid-term of the Trump administration.  So, it's really -- you know, you have to wonder what's going on now that is going undetected.  They were so successful apparently in the 2016 election.</p><p>KING:  It's a great point both for the -- any campaign regulatory agencies and the social media giants in the idea that what do you have to do to more properly vet --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.</p><p>KING:  -- when you're taking money from, where is that money coming from.  It's hard, you say about its fake account, it's hard, but it's doable.  That's one of the challenges.</p><p>I want to go out for another piece of the story, dramatic story of the New York Times today about two of the President's lawyers sitting outdoors in a Washington D.C. steak house talking about the strategy in dealing with the special counsel investigation we just talked to. Talking about debates within the team about how cooperatively, debates within the team about transparent it could be.</p><p>Let's listen to the New York Times reporter who was sitting as close as I I'm to you, Jackie, Ken Vogel.  The President's lawyers are there.  He's, hance, at the next table and he hears this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEN VOGEL, REPORTER, NEW YORK TIMES:  As I sat there by myself at this table taking notes on my iPhone, they preceded to discuss --</p><p>UNIDETIFIED FEMALE:  Wow.</p><p>VOGEL:  -- some of the, you know, the most sensitive of the sensitive area in way that was very easily audible to me and allowed for us to get at some of these issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[12:35:09] KING:  Among the things they are talking is how cooperative to be.  And there's a picture of the two attorneys.  They're talking about (INAUDIBLE) sitting at the table at a D.C. steak house, very recognizable men, very well-known in the legal community, political community here in Washington D.C.  The restaurant happens to be steps from the New York Times Washington Bureau.  Smart choice.</p><p>The issues includes disagreements about how cooperative and transparent to be with Robert Mueller, the Special Counsel, whether to actually give him documents even before he ask for them or to wait and make sure only give him what he exactly asks for.  At one point, they said that Don McGhan, the White House Counsel, the President's White House Attorney had documents locked in a safe.  Now, we don't know what that means, but for two, the President's lawyers to be having a debate about strategy and to say that publicly is nuts.</p><p>PERRY BACON, SENIOR POLITICAL WRITER, FIVETHIRTYEIGHT:  The idea that it's in a restaurant, of course, bad form, (INAUDIBLE) and that kind of thing.  But I think the core that they're talking about is a real big issue is, are they going to cooperate or not.  This is where coming out Mueller is I feel like going for the kill (INAUDIBLE).  He is really pushing pretty hard inside the White House.</p><p>And, you know, (INAUDIBLE) the question of, will the White House cooperate, will documents going to be turned over in (INAUDIBLE).  So, now you're here, we're ultimately, this will going to come and it looks like a fight over executive privilege, over about with documents given this and become a place where this will be the politics that's really hard here.  What is Trump going to do with this investigation that could really change and may be harm obviously in his presidency.</p><p>His lawyers are not feel that threat and they're talking about which documents to hand over or which not, which tells you the level of stories here that were coming to.</p><p>KAROUN DEMIRJIAN, REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST:  And even what they've exposed also is a question -- it opens the question of whether other people in the White House will be now brought into Mueller's probe.  When you are in a -- yes, there is a turning point from this, but it's not exactly the same when you are an, you know, employee of the White House and you see.  They could now be brought in especially if there is, you know, credible evidence spoken out of the mouths of lawyers themselves, that there may be documents in the state for other things there.  You may see some of these other people getting pulled into the probe now which complicates the legal defense for the Trump team and even more.</p><p>BACON:  And with the White House.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KING:  There's a paragraph of the story about the fear inside the White House trepidation about this, inside the White House, that there are some people think that some of the colleagues might be wearing a wire, were wearing a wire for Bob Mueller.  I mean, that -- again, great going to work every day, right?</p><p>CALMES:  Well, and we saw some of that during the investigations on the second Clinton term.</p><p>KING:  Right.</p><p>CALMES:  But not like that.  I mean, this is a far more serious.  That went to the personnel --</p><p>BACON:  Conduct.</p><p>CALMES:  -- conduct of the President.  This goes to the entire campaign and potential colluding with an adversary.</p><p>KING:  And potential, emphasis potential, potential with Special Counsel looking into obstruction by the President --</p><p>CALMES:  Right, exactly.</p><p>KING:  -- of the United States, it's not the candidate. DEMIRJIAN:  But exactly it is potential and if we -- you know, if McGhan is right that there's nothing there and that's why he should be handing over more documents because it will show the President (INAUDIBLE) anything wrong.  They are creating --</p><p>KING:  Could be unlocking the safe, it's not locking the safe.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN:  Definitely.  But again, I mean, if this -- and this means something that is a self-constructed nightmare that didn't need to be there, then why?</p><p>CALMES:  Why did you say quickly -- I mean, nothing about what the lawyers reportedly said to each other surprised me really.  And Don McGhan, it is his job as a White House counsel, not to represent the President individually, but to represent the office of the President. So he has to be concern about President set.</p><p>What surprised me about this is that they were saying this.  I worked in the New York Times Bureau for nine years.  I had many lunches at DOT.  There, or any place out, I always looked around the room to see who was there before I talked.  And the fact that the two lawyers didn't is astounding.</p><p>KING:  Common sense.  That's one is interesting to watch.  We've seen the President blow off his legal team in the past.  We'll see how this story sets with the President today.</p><p>Up next, it seems the President spend a lot of time on Twitter this weekend.  But was it presidential tweets, including the rocket man. Next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[12:43:03] KING:  Moments ago, President Trump tweeting his praise for the United Nations Secretary General saying, \"We commend Antonio Guterres and his call for the U.N. to focus more on people and less on bureaucracy.\"  Compare that to this weekend.  We know the President spent a good part of his weekend preparing for that U.N. meeting and other speeches sessions at the U.N. general assembly.  The big speech is tomorrow.</p><p>The President also took some time to indulge in one of his favorite pastimes.  An early morning Twitter spree, among his many tweets and retweets, he shared this.  \"I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night.  Asked him how Rocket Man is doing.  Long gas lines forming in North Korea.  Too bad.\"</p><p>He also retweeted a video, heavily edited, to look like he's hitting Hillary Clinton with a golf ball.  You see that there.  This from a man who once promised this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  At some point, I'm going to be so presidential that you people will be so bored.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING:  Waiting.  Waiting.  Still waiting.  I want to distinguish between the two in that people foreign policy establishment will cringe a bit when you call Kim Jong-un, \"rocket man.\"  I think most Americans probably get the President a grace to say that's the way he wants to say it, that's just fine.</p><p>The video where you show, he retweets a video edited by a pro-Trump Twitter feed upon hitting a golf ball that hits the Secretary of State Democratic presidential candidate in the back of the head and she falls.  That was stripping into since she hit.  People yesterday took some laughter on the Sunday program is people thinking that, you know, we thought that was funny.  That part is not funny.  That part is not funny.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KING:  He's the President of the United States.  If your kid did this, your kid would be punished.</p><p>BACON:  I put that talking about, you know, (INAUDIBLE) in the Twitter and how bad it was his tweets about women in particular are bad.</p><p>KING:  Given his history of -- you're right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BACON:  This is bad.  The first one is maybe a little funny.  You can't fix the North Korea problems that he sort of venting act like a little bit, but the Hillary one is awful.</p><p>[12:45:06] DEMIRJIAN:  Yes.  Both of them were not good.  I think the North Korean one -- I mean, the Hillary one is really bad form.  The North Korea one has potential implications that are very, very \"geopolitically disastrous,\" right.  Kim Jong-un probably thinks it's cool to be called rocket man to the extent.  This is a guy who invite Dennis Rodman to hang out and, you know, in his country.</p><p>Anything that kind of gives him a little bit of levity in the situation makes it somehow less serious and it's extremely serious situation that they cannot find a way to cut through.  This is not going to make China turn around and start to, you know, extinctions pressure and everything else like that on North Korea.</p><p>KING:  To that point, again, I think a lot of people in the country with the President more grace, and his supporters probably like the golf video too some in many way.  But to the idea that the timing too, the timing, is this about to go to the United Nations, a lot of people trying to figure out, you know, Twitter Trump versus teleprompter Trump versus what the staff says, he really wants to do and he does something like this.</p><p>CALMES:  Well, you know, and this was weekend where the White House said he was preparing for this big week at the U.N.  And when you think of all the many issues in the world that he could have been studying up on, instead that tweet of him hitting his former rival with a golf ball was tweeted by someone else of -- well, shall we just say, of questionable reputation.  And what is the President of the United States doing indulging in those kind of tweets, didn't he have more to do this weekend than to be -- and not only seeing them, but retweeting them.</p><p>KING:  And if National Security advisers on national television, he's a combat veteran, he's a general, he's a man with a distinguished record serving his country and he has to defend the President of the United State's tweets than he even he knows --</p><p>PACE:  About rocket man and Hillary.  And it comes at a time when his aides were trying to, you know, were seen on Friday where they're talking about the U.N. and talking about how he's going to be very serious and how he's taking these meetings, you know, how he's taking them seriously and going to present a good front for the United States for the world.  They cringe too.  I mean, you have to be up front about this.</p><p>It's not just us in the media.  His own aides cringe when he decide to things happen because then they have to go out and defend it.  And I think we can also again wipe away any notion that John Kelly and any new structure in White House is going to end this.  It's just not.</p><p>KING:  It moderate at a time it seems but ending it no.  Everybody hold their breath.  Up next, the Hollywood rituals, dresses that cost more than your car.  And now barbwire (ph) jokes about the President.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[12:51:38] STEPHEN COLBERT, THE LATE SHOW HOST, CBS:  Is there anyone who can say how big the audience is?  Sean, do you know?</p><p>SEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmy's period both in person and around the world.</p><p>COLBERT:  Wow.  That really soothes my fragile ego.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING:  We haven't heard, there it was right there.  A new twist on an old line.  Sean Spicer rolling out on the stage.  It may have been the biggest surprise last night.  The biggest star unquestionably the President Hollywood loves the most.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS, ACTRESS, \"VEEP\":  We did have a whole story line about an impeachment but we abandoned that because they were worried that someone else might get to it at first.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING:  The President's approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes you might say once flat long ago.  But even some of the comedians who rose them for a living, some of them acknowledge the jokes are starting to feel a little tired.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES CORDEN, HOST, \"THE LATE LATE SHOW\":  And your show has been -- that thing you say about Trump being ban, so fresh.  So fresh.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING:  It was interesting.  It is interesting.  There's no question. The Hollywood largely liberal establishment does not like the current Republican President of the United States.  They also know that he likes to be liked.  And so they know that when they do this, it gets in his face.  Does it matter?  That he is so permeated pop culture this way.</p><p>PACE:  Well it's interesting that Trump did not respond.</p><p>KING:  Right.</p><p>PACE:  It was like the Oscars when he was almost tweeting in realtime.</p><p>KING:  Merrill Streep, one of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KING:  Yes.</p><p>(OFF-MIC)</p><p>PACE:  Look, to me, there's a difference between the jokes about Trump and then the joke with Spicer.  Maybe people will think that I'm being humorless about this but I don't think it's funny to have a press secretary basically acknowledging that they were lying from the White House podium.  It's not funny.  That has real damaging consequences.</p><p>KING:  Well, it's an interesting conversation.  The conversation in this town because people wonder if Sean Spicer redeems himself and gets a job in politics from public relations.  If you look at social media last night, a lot of Trump critics and a lot of liberals were mad at the own liberal Hollywood establishment saying do not help rehabilitate this man.</p><p>I would say this, number one, I know firsthand from friends in the town, Sean Spicer is having a really hard time getting his -- these are people reach out to some of the bigger firms here in town and the answer is been thanks, but no thanks.  Number two, he was the joke. And I know some people don't find it funny, but yes, he got a moment, yes, he got to mingle with the stars, yes he got to the party and drink beer and take selfie with stars but his moment on stage was he was the joke.</p><p>BACON:  And one probably the worst moment of a press secretary that I can remember. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.</p><p>BACON:  That January 21st, well always remember that, one of the worst moments any press secretaries (INAUDIBLE) it was a joke.  I'm not sure it helps them move on to the next stage.  He has been in the Republican Party a long time we have known it for a long time.  So, I assume he wants to get back into something like politics.  I don't know if that will be easy or hard, but he sort of -- I assume-- trying to make fun of himself in stage (ph).  Look, like Julie said, those big moments when you talk about April Ryan, those were not particularly funny or redeeming moments.</p><p>PACE:  Being in an administration is supposed to be able to get a golden ticket to get a job after in administration, right, and then cash out.  But if you sold your integrity to an extent, you know, that is, I guess a warning for anybody that might follow that making some more decisions.</p><p>[12:55:12] CALMES:  Right.  And I wouldn't wish anyone ill, but if Sean Spicer were indeed to find himself unable to get the big job that he wanted to parlay this into, it would really say something about Washington writ large and the Trump administration that there is, you know -- we always joke about Washington that there are always second acts in politics.  I mean, look at Newt Gingrich, he resigned in amidst of scandal and shame and he's back as a major commentator on politics.</p><p>And this -- if this is -- this would show that there is a limit.  That there some things like lying to the American public that are a bridge too far.</p><p>KING:  On the broader question of Hollywood versus Trump, I just want to say this, Kellyanne Conway this morning saying, go away.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  They've got pluck and polished and whacked and someone who didn't eat for two months and offer what?  To sound the same and they have a right to speak, but if you are tuning in to watch -- if you're American you're tuning in to watch your favorite actors and actresses and shows -- and I used to do it routinely as a kid.  Who is going to win?  And she lost and I love her show.  There is very little of that.  It's between the Emmys, the Miss America pageant was politicized.  Our sports are very politicized and it looks like the ratings are suffering.  It looks like America is responding by tuning out because they want you to stick to your knitting.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING:  I'm told the initial ratings were down from last night.  If that holds up in the final ratings, how long until the President tweets that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KING:  They have plucked and polished and wax and some didn't eat for two months.  That's a pretty priceless.</p><p>All right, we got to go.  Thanks for watching us in Inside Politics. We'll see you back here tomorrow.  President Trump set to meet with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next hour.  Wolf Blitzer picks up that important coverage after a quick break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[Byline: John King] [Guest: Julie Pace, Jackie Calmes, Ken Vogel, Perry Bacon, Karoun Demirjian] [High: Special counsel Robert Mueller and his team are now in possession of Russian-linked ads run on Facebook during the presidential election, after they obtained a search warrant for the information.

The Special Counsel investigation into Russian election meddling now reaching inside social media giant, Facebook.  Sources confirming to CNN, Robert Mueller's team has obtained a search warrant compelling Facebook to surrender information about campaign-related ads bought by account that now been linked back to the Russian government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's why this could really matter.  To get such a sweeping warrant, prosecutors need to demonstrate probable cause of a crime.  It's illegal for a foreign national to interfere in the U.S. election and it would be a crime if any U.S. citizen worked colluded with them, for example, to offer political advice like with issues and states.  Those ads should target.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So this is a, A, it's big deal anyway to have a private company like Facebook, have the Special Counsel come knocking saying, turn over the records.  And now you get into this whole question, this collusion question and the idea is the Trump campaign will tell you.  Their team dragged about their use of digital space particularly Facebook in the final weeks of the campaign they think is what turned Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.  Now the question is, if this Russian accounts, Russian bought ads were in the same places, coincidence or not?</p><p>JULIE PACE, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPODENT, ASSOCIATED PRESS:  Well, I mean, it's a huge open question I think at this point, but this is what the Mueller team is after right now.  We've been in this space with the Russian investigations where you've had a lot of rumors floating around, a lot of ticky-tack things out there.</p><p>This is pretty serious.  This is a big deal not just for this investigation.  It's a big deal for future U.S. elections.  And Facebook, the company that has been pretty opaque in their political dealings, pretty opaque in terms of how their ads are purchased, who they deal with there.  So the consequences of this, not just for the Mueller investigation but broadly for politics, for big tech and its relationship with Washington are -- could be hugely consequential.</p><p>JACKIE CALMES, WHIT HOUSE EDITOR, LOS ANGELES TIMES:  That's right.  I mean, we're into the mid-term cycle now which is a hugely consequential mid-term.  I mean, most of them are, but this one really is and with the control of Congress at stake in the mid-term of the Trump administration.  So, it's really -- you know, you have to wonder what's going on now that is going undetected.  They were so successful apparently in the 2016 election.</p><p>KING:  It's a great point both for the -- any campaign regulatory agencies and the social media giants in the idea that what do you have to do to more properly vet --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.</p><p>KING:  -- when you're taking money from, where is that money coming from.  It's hard, you say about its fake account, it's hard, but it's doable.  That's one of the challenges.</p><p>I want to go out for another piece of the story, dramatic story of the New York Times today about two of the President's lawyers sitting outdoors in a Washington D.C. steak house talking about the strategy in dealing with the special counsel investigation we just talked to. Talking about debates within the team about how cooperatively, debates within the team about transparent it could be.</p><p>Let's listen to the New York Times reporter who was sitting as close as I I'm to you, Jackie, Ken Vogel.  The President's lawyers are there.  He's, hance, at the next table and he hears this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEN VOGEL, REPORTER, NEW YORK TIMES:  As I sat there by myself at this table taking notes on my iPhone, they preceded to discuss --</p><p>UNIDETIFIED FEMALE:  Wow.</p><p>VOGEL:  -- some of the, you know, the most sensitive of the sensitive area in way that was very easily audible to me and allowed for us to get at some of these issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[12:35:09] KING:  Among the things they are talking is how cooperative to be.  And there's a picture of the two attorneys.  They're talking about (INAUDIBLE) sitting at the table at a D.C. steak house, very recognizable men, very well-known in the legal community, political community here in Washington D.C.  The restaurant happens to be steps from the New York Times Washington Bureau.  Smart choice.</p><p>The issues includes disagreements about how cooperative and transparent to be with Robert Mueller, the Special Counsel, whether to actually give him documents even before he ask for them or to wait and make sure only give him what he exactly asks for.  At one point, they said that Don McGhan, the White House Counsel, the President's White House Attorney had documents locked in a safe.  Now, we don't know what that means, but for two, the President's lawyers to be having a debate about strategy and to say that publicly is nuts.</p><p>PERRY BACON, SENIOR POLITICAL WRITER, FIVETHIRTYEIGHT:  The idea that it's in a restaurant, of course, bad form, (INAUDIBLE) and that kind of thing.  But I think the core that they're talking about is a real big issue is, are they going to cooperate or not.  This is where coming out Mueller is I feel like going for the kill (INAUDIBLE).  He is really pushing pretty hard inside the White House.</p><p>And, you know, (INAUDIBLE) the question of, will the White House cooperate, will documents going to be turned over in (INAUDIBLE).  So, now you're here, we're ultimately, this will going to come and it looks like a fight over executive privilege, over about with documents given this and become a place where this will be the politics that's really hard here.  What is Trump going to do with this investigation that could really change and may be harm obviously in his presidency.</p><p>His lawyers are not feel that threat and they're talking about which documents to hand over or which not, which tells you the level of stories here that were coming to.</p><p>KAROUN DEMIRJIAN, REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST:  And even what they've exposed also is a question -- it opens the question of whether other people in the White House will be now brought into Mueller's probe.  When you are in a -- yes, there is a turning point from this, but it's not exactly the same when you are an, you know, employee of the White House and you see.  They could now be brought in especially if there is, you know, credible evidence spoken out of the mouths of lawyers themselves, that there may be documents in the state for other things there.  You may see some of these other people getting pulled into the probe now which complicates the legal defense for the Trump team and even more.</p><p>BACON:  And with the White House.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KING:  There's a paragraph of the story about the fear inside the White House trepidation about this, inside the White House, that there are some people think that some of the colleagues might be wearing a wire, were wearing a wire for Bob Mueller.  I mean, that -- again, great going to work every day, right?</p><p>CALMES:  Well, and we saw some of that during the investigations on the second Clinton term.</p><p>KING:  Right.</p><p>CALMES:  But not like that.  I mean, this is a far more serious.  That went to the personnel --</p><p>BACON:  Conduct.</p><p>CALMES:  -- conduct of the President.  This goes to the entire campaign and potential colluding with an adversary.</p><p>KING:  And potential, emphasis potential, potential with Special Counsel looking into obstruction by the President --</p><p>CALMES:  Right, exactly.</p><p>KING:  -- of the United States, it's not the candidate. DEMIRJIAN:  But exactly it is potential and if we -- you know, if McGhan is right that there's nothing there and that's why he should be handing over more documents because it will show the President (INAUDIBLE) anything wrong.  They are creating --</p><p>KING:  Could be unlocking the safe, it's not locking the safe.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN:  Definitely.  But again, I mean, if this -- and this means something that is a self-constructed nightmare that didn't need to be there, then why?</p><p>CALMES:  Why did you say quickly -- I mean, nothing about what the lawyers reportedly said to each other surprised me really.  And Don McGhan, it is his job as a White House counsel, not to represent the President individually, but to represent the office of the President. So he has to be concern about President set.</p><p>What surprised me about this is that they were saying this.  I worked in the New York Times Bureau for nine years.  I had many lunches at DOT.  There, or any place out, I always looked around the room to see who was there before I talked.  And the fact that the two lawyers didn't is astounding.</p><p>KING:  Common sense.  That's one is interesting to watch.  We've seen the President blow off his legal team in the past.  We'll see how this story sets with the President today.</p><p>Up next, it seems the President spend a lot of time on Twitter this weekend.  But was it presidential tweets, including the rocket man. Next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[12:43:03] KING:  Moments ago, President Trump tweeting his praise for the United Nations Secretary General saying, \"We commend Antonio Guterres and his call for the U.N. to focus more on people and less on bureaucracy.\"  Compare that to this weekend.  We know the President spent a good part of his weekend preparing for that U.N. meeting and other speeches sessions at the U.N. general assembly.  The big speech is tomorrow.</p><p>The President also took some time to indulge in one of his favorite pastimes.  An early morning Twitter spree, among his many tweets and retweets, he shared this.  \"I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night.  Asked him how Rocket Man is doing.  Long gas lines forming in North Korea.  Too bad.\"</p><p>He also retweeted a video, heavily edited, to look like he's hitting Hillary Clinton with a golf ball.  You see that there.  This from a man who once promised this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  At some point, I'm going to be so presidential that you people will be so bored.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING:  Waiting.  Waiting.  Still waiting.  I want to distinguish between the two in that people foreign policy establishment will cringe a bit when you call Kim Jong-un, \"rocket man.\"  I think most Americans probably get the President a grace to say that's the way he wants to say it, that's just fine.</p><p>The video where you show, he retweets a video edited by a pro-Trump Twitter feed upon hitting a golf ball that hits the Secretary of State Democratic presidential candidate in the back of the head and she falls.  That was stripping into since she hit.  People yesterday took some laughter on the Sunday program is people thinking that, you know, we thought that was funny.  That part is not funny.  That part is not funny.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KING:  He's the President of the United States.  If your kid did this, your kid would be punished.</p><p>BACON:  I put that talking about, you know, (INAUDIBLE) in the Twitter and how bad it was his tweets about women in particular are bad.</p><p>KING:  Given his history of -- you're right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BACON:  This is bad.  The first one is maybe a little funny.  You can't fix the North Korea problems that he sort of venting act like a little bit, but the Hillary one is awful.</p><p>[12:45:06] DEMIRJIAN:  Yes.  Both of them were not good.  I think the North Korean one -- I mean, the Hillary one is really bad form.  The North Korea one has potential implications that are very, very \"geopolitically disastrous,\" right.  Kim Jong-un probably thinks it's cool to be called rocket man to the extent.  This is a guy who invite Dennis Rodman to hang out and, you know, in his country.</p><p>Anything that kind of gives him a little bit of levity in the situation makes it somehow less serious and it's extremely serious situation that they cannot find a way to cut through.  This is not going to make China turn around and start to, you know, extinctions pressure and everything else like that on North Korea.</p><p>KING:  To that point, again, I think a lot of people in the country with the President more grace, and his supporters probably like the golf video too some in many way.  But to the idea that the timing too, the timing, is this about to go to the United Nations, a lot of people trying to figure out, you know, Twitter Trump versus teleprompter Trump versus what the staff says, he really wants to do and he does something like this.</p><p>CALMES:  Well, you know, and this was weekend where the White House said he was preparing for this big week at the U.N.  And when you think of all the many issues in the world that he could have been studying up on, instead that tweet of him hitting his former rival with a golf ball was tweeted by someone else of -- well, shall we just say, of questionable reputation.  And what is the President of the United States doing indulging in those kind of tweets, didn't he have more to do this weekend than to be -- and not only seeing them, but retweeting them.</p><p>KING:  And if National Security advisers on national television, he's a combat veteran, he's a general, he's a man with a distinguished record serving his country and he has to defend the President of the United State's tweets than he even he knows --</p><p>PACE:  About rocket man and Hillary.  And it comes at a time when his aides were trying to, you know, were seen on Friday where they're talking about the U.N. and talking about how he's going to be very serious and how he's taking these meetings, you know, how he's taking them seriously and going to present a good front for the United States for the world.  They cringe too.  I mean, you have to be up front about this.</p><p>It's not just us in the media.  His own aides cringe when he decide to things happen because then they have to go out and defend it.  And I think we can also again wipe away any notion that John Kelly and any new structure in White House is going to end this.  It's just not.</p><p>KING:  It moderate at a time it seems but ending it no.  Everybody hold their breath.  Up next, the Hollywood rituals, dresses that cost more than your car.  And now barbwire (ph) jokes about the President.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[12:51:38] STEPHEN COLBERT, THE LATE SHOW HOST, CBS:  Is there anyone who can say how big the audience is?  Sean, do you know?</p><p>SEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmy's period both in person and around the world.</p><p>COLBERT:  Wow.  That really soothes my fragile ego.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING:  We haven't heard, there it was right there.  A new twist on an old line.  Sean Spicer rolling out on the stage.  It may have been the biggest surprise last night.  The biggest star unquestionably the President Hollywood loves the most.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS, ACTRESS, \"VEEP\":  We did have a whole story line about an impeachment but we abandoned that because they were worried that someone else might get to it at first.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING:  The President's approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes you might say once flat long ago.  But even some of the comedians who rose them for a living, some of them acknowledge the jokes are starting to feel a little tired.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES CORDEN, HOST, \"THE LATE LATE SHOW\":  And your show has been -- that thing you say about Trump being ban, so fresh.  So fresh.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING:  It was interesting.  It is interesting.  There's no question. The Hollywood largely liberal establishment does not like the current Republican President of the United States.  They also know that he likes to be liked.  And so they know that when they do this, it gets in his face.  Does it matter?  That he is so permeated pop culture this way.</p><p>PACE:  Well it's interesting that Trump did not respond.</p><p>KING:  Right.</p><p>PACE:  It was like the Oscars when he was almost tweeting in realtime.</p><p>KING:  Merrill Streep, one of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KING:  Yes.</p><p>(OFF-MIC)</p><p>PACE:  Look, to me, there's a difference between the jokes about Trump and then the joke with Spicer.  Maybe people will think that I'm being humorless about this but I don't think it's funny to have a press secretary basically acknowledging that they were lying from the White House podium.  It's not funny.  That has real damaging consequences.</p><p>KING:  Well, it's an interesting conversation.  The conversation in this town because people wonder if Sean Spicer redeems himself and gets a job in politics from public relations.  If you look at social media last night, a lot of Trump critics and a lot of liberals were mad at the own liberal Hollywood establishment saying do not help rehabilitate this man.</p><p>I would say this, number one, I know firsthand from friends in the town, Sean Spicer is having a really hard time getting his -- these are people reach out to some of the bigger firms here in town and the answer is been thanks, but no thanks.  Number two, he was the joke. And I know some people don't find it funny, but yes, he got a moment, yes, he got to mingle with the stars, yes he got to the party and drink beer and take selfie with stars but his moment on stage was he was the joke.</p><p>BACON:  And one probably the worst moment of a press secretary that I can remember. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.</p><p>BACON:  That January 21st, well always remember that, one of the worst moments any press secretaries (INAUDIBLE) it was a joke.  I'm not sure it helps them move on to the next stage.  He has been in the Republican Party a long time we have known it for a long time.  So, I assume he wants to get back into something like politics.  I don't know if that will be easy or hard, but he sort of -- I assume-- trying to make fun of himself in stage (ph).  Look, like Julie said, those big moments when you talk about April Ryan, those were not particularly funny or redeeming moments.</p><p>PACE:  Being in an administration is supposed to be able to get a golden ticket to get a job after in administration, right, and then cash out.  But if you sold your integrity to an extent, you know, that is, I guess a warning for anybody that might follow that making some more decisions.</p><p>[12:55:12] CALMES:  Right.  And I wouldn't wish anyone ill, but if Sean Spicer were indeed to find himself unable to get the big job that he wanted to parlay this into, it would really say something about Washington writ large and the Trump administration that there is, you know -- we always joke about Washington that there are always second acts in politics.  I mean, look at Newt Gingrich, he resigned in amidst of scandal and shame and he's back as a major commentator on politics.</p><p>And this -- if this is -- this would show that there is a limit.  That there some things like lying to the American public that are a bridge too far.</p><p>KING:  On the broader question of Hollywood versus Trump, I just want to say this, Kellyanne Conway this morning saying, go away.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  They've got pluck and polished and whacked and someone who didn't eat for two months and offer what?  To sound the same and they have a right to speak, but if you are tuning in to watch -- if you're American you're tuning in to watch your favorite actors and actresses and shows -- and I used to do it routinely as a kid.  Who is going to win?  And she lost and I love her show.  There is very little of that.  It's between the Emmys, the Miss America pageant was politicized.  Our sports are very politicized and it looks like the ratings are suffering.  It looks like America is responding by tuning out because they want you to stick to your knitting.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING:  I'm told the initial ratings were down from last night.  If that holds up in the final ratings, how long until the President tweets that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KING:  They have plucked and polished and wax and some didn't eat for two months.  That's a pretty priceless.</p><p>All right, we got to go.  Thanks for watching us in Inside Politics. We'll see you back here tomorrow.  President Trump set to meet with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next hour.  Wolf Blitzer picks up that important coverage after a quick break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[Byline: John King] [Guest: Julie Pace, Jackie Calmes, Ken Vogel, Perry Bacon, Karoun Demirjian] [High: Special counsel Robert Mueller and his team are now in possession of Russian-linked ads run on Facebook during the presidential election, after they obtained a search warrant for the information.

The Special Counsel investigation into Russian election meddling now reaching inside social media giant, Facebook.  Sources confirming to CNN, Robert Mueller's team has obtained a search warrant compelling Facebook to surrender information about campaign-related ads bought by account that now been linked back to the Russian government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Here's why this could really matter.  To get such a sweeping warrant, prosecutors need to demonstrate probable cause of a crime.  It's illegal for a foreign national to interfere in the U.S. election and it would be a crime if any U.S. citizen worked colluded with them, for example, to offer political advice like with issues and states.  Those ads should target.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> So this is a, A, it's big deal anyway to have a private company like Facebook, have the Special Counsel come knocking saying, turn over the records.  And now you get into this whole question, this collusion question and the idea is the Trump campaign will tell you.  Their team dragged about their use of digital space particularly Facebook in the final weeks of the campaign they think is what turned Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.  Now the question is, if this Russian accounts, Russian bought ads were in the same places, coincidence or not?</p><p> JULIE PACE, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPODENT, ASSOCIATED PRESS:  Well, I mean, it's a huge open question I think at this point, but this is what the Mueller team is after right now.  We've been in this space with the Russian investigations where you've had a lot of rumors floating around, a lot of ticky-tack things out there.</p><p> This is pretty serious.  This is a big deal not just for this investigation.  It's a big deal for future U.S. elections.  And Facebook, the company that has been pretty opaque in their political dealings, pretty opaque in terms of how their ads are purchased, who they deal with there.  So the consequences of this, not just for the Mueller investigation but broadly for politics, for big tech and its relationship with Washington are -- could be hugely consequential.</p><p> JACKIE CALMES, WHIT HOUSE EDITOR, LOS ANGELES TIMES:  That's right.  I mean, we're into the mid-term cycle now which is a hugely consequential mid-term.  I mean, most of them are, but this one really is and with the control of Congress at stake in the mid-term of the Trump administration.  So, it's really -- you know, you have to wonder what's going on now that is going undetected.  They were so successful apparently in the 2016 election.</p><p> KING:  It's a great point both for the -- any campaign regulatory agencies and the social media giants in the idea that what do you have to do to more properly vet --</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.</p><p> KING:  -- when you're taking money from, where is that money coming from.  It's hard, you say about its fake account, it's hard, but it's doable.  That's one of the challenges.</p><p> I want to go out for another piece of the story, dramatic story of the New York Times today about two of the President's lawyers sitting outdoors in a Washington D.C. steak house talking about the strategy in dealing with the special counsel investigation we just talked to. Talking about debates within the team about how cooperatively, debates within the team about transparent it could be.</p><p> Let's listen to the New York Times reporter who was sitting as close as I I'm to you, Jackie, Ken Vogel.  The President's lawyers are there.  He's, hance, at the next table and he hears this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KEN VOGEL, REPORTER, NEW YORK TIMES:  As I sat there by myself at this table taking notes on my iPhone, they preceded to discuss --</p><p> UNIDETIFIED FEMALE:  Wow.</p><p> VOGEL:  -- some of the, you know, the most sensitive of the sensitive area in way that was very easily audible to me and allowed for us to get at some of these issues.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> [12:35:09] KING:  Among the things they are talking is how cooperative to be.  And there's a picture of the two attorneys.  They're talking about (INAUDIBLE) sitting at the table at a D.C. steak house, very recognizable men, very well-known in the legal community, political community here in Washington D.C.  The restaurant happens to be steps from the New York Times Washington Bureau.  Smart choice.</p><p> The issues includes disagreements about how cooperative and transparent to be with Robert Mueller, the Special Counsel, whether to actually give him documents even before he ask for them or to wait and make sure only give him what he exactly asks for.  At one point, they said that Don McGhan, the White House Counsel, the President's White House Attorney had documents locked in a safe.  Now, we don't know what that means, but for two, the President's lawyers to be having a debate about strategy and to say that publicly is nuts.</p><p> PERRY BACON, SENIOR POLITICAL WRITER, FIVETHIRTYEIGHT:  The idea that it's in a restaurant, of course, bad form, (INAUDIBLE) and that kind of thing.  But I think the core that they're talking about is a real big issue is, are they going to cooperate or not.  This is where coming out Mueller is I feel like going for the kill (INAUDIBLE).  He is really pushing pretty hard inside the White House.</p><p> And, you know, (INAUDIBLE) the question of, will the White House cooperate, will documents going to be turned over in (INAUDIBLE).  So, now you're here, we're ultimately, this will going to come and it looks like a fight over executive privilege, over about with documents given this and become a place where this will be the politics that's really hard here.  What is Trump going to do with this investigation that could really change and may be harm obviously in his presidency.</p><p> His lawyers are not feel that threat and they're talking about which documents to hand over or which not, which tells you the level of stories here that were coming to.</p><p> KAROUN DEMIRJIAN, REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST:  And even what they've exposed also is a question -- it opens the question of whether other people in the White House will be now brought into Mueller's probe.  When you are in a -- yes, there is a turning point from this, but it's not exactly the same when you are an, you know, employee of the White House and you see.  They could now be brought in especially if there is, you know, credible evidence spoken out of the mouths of lawyers themselves, that there may be documents in the state for other things there.  You may see some of these other people getting pulled into the probe now which complicates the legal defense for the Trump team and even more.</p><p> BACON:  And with the White House.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KING:  There's a paragraph of the story about the fear inside the White House trepidation about this, inside the White House, that there are some people think that some of the colleagues might be wearing a wire, were wearing a wire for Bob Mueller.  I mean, that -- again, great going to work every day, right?</p><p> CALMES:  Well, and we saw some of that during the investigations on the second Clinton term.</p><p> KING:  Right.</p><p> CALMES:  But not like that.  I mean, this is a far more serious.  That went to the personnel --</p><p> BACON:  Conduct.</p><p> CALMES:  -- conduct of the President.  This goes to the entire campaign and potential colluding with an adversary.</p><p> KING:  And potential, emphasis potential, potential with Special Counsel looking into obstruction by the President --</p><p> CALMES:  Right, exactly.</p><p> KING:  -- of the United States, it's not the candidate. DEMIRJIAN:  But exactly it is potential and if we -- you know, if McGhan is right that there's nothing there and that's why he should be handing over more documents because it will show the President (INAUDIBLE) anything wrong.  They are creating --</p><p> KING:  Could be unlocking the safe, it's not locking the safe.</p><p> DEMIRJIAN:  Definitely.  But again, I mean, if this -- and this means something that is a self-constructed nightmare that didn't need to be there, then why?</p><p> CALMES:  Why did you say quickly -- I mean, nothing about what the lawyers reportedly said to each other surprised me really.  And Don McGhan, it is his job as a White House counsel, not to represent the President individually, but to represent the office of the President. So he has to be concern about President set.</p><p> What surprised me about this is that they were saying this.  I worked in the New York Times Bureau for nine years.  I had many lunches at DOT.  There, or any place out, I always looked around the room to see who was there before I talked.  And the fact that the two lawyers didn't is astounding.</p><p> KING:  Common sense.  That's one is interesting to watch.  We've seen the President blow off his legal team in the past.  We'll see how this story sets with the President today.</p><p> Up next, it seems the President spend a lot of time on Twitter this weekend.  But was it presidential tweets, including the rocket man. Next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [12:43:03] KING:  Moments ago, President Trump tweeting his praise for the United Nations Secretary General saying, \"We commend Antonio Guterres and his call for the U.N. to focus more on people and less on bureaucracy.\"  Compare that to this weekend.  We know the President spent a good part of his weekend preparing for that U.N. meeting and other speeches sessions at the U.N. general assembly.  The big speech is tomorrow.</p><p> The President also took some time to indulge in one of his favorite pastimes.  An early morning Twitter spree, among his many tweets and retweets, he shared this.  \"I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night.  Asked him how Rocket Man is doing.  Long gas lines forming in North Korea.  Too bad.\"</p><p> He also retweeted a video, heavily edited, to look like he's hitting Hillary Clinton with a golf ball.  You see that there.  This from a man who once promised this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  At some point, I'm going to be so presidential that you people will be so bored.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KING:  Waiting.  Waiting.  Still waiting.  I want to distinguish between the two in that people foreign policy establishment will cringe a bit when you call Kim Jong-un, \"rocket man.\"  I think most Americans probably get the President a grace to say that's the way he wants to say it, that's just fine.</p><p> The video where you show, he retweets a video edited by a pro-Trump Twitter feed upon hitting a golf ball that hits the Secretary of State Democratic presidential candidate in the back of the head and she falls.  That was stripping into since she hit.  People yesterday took some laughter on the Sunday program is people thinking that, you know, we thought that was funny.  That part is not funny.  That part is not funny.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KING:  He's the President of the United States.  If your kid did this, your kid would be punished.</p><p> BACON:  I put that talking about, you know, (INAUDIBLE) in the Twitter and how bad it was his tweets about women in particular are bad.</p><p> KING:  Given his history of -- you're right.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BACON:  This is bad.  The first one is maybe a little funny.  You can't fix the North Korea problems that he sort of venting act like a little bit, but the Hillary one is awful.</p><p> [12:45:06] DEMIRJIAN:  Yes.  Both of them were not good.  I think the North Korean one -- I mean, the Hillary one is really bad form.  The North Korea one has potential implications that are very, very \"geopolitically disastrous,\" right.  Kim Jong-un probably thinks it's cool to be called rocket man to the extent.  This is a guy who invite Dennis Rodman to hang out and, you know, in his country.</p><p> Anything that kind of gives him a little bit of levity in the situation makes it somehow less serious and it's extremely serious situation that they cannot find a way to cut through.  This is not going to make China turn around and start to, you know, extinctions pressure and everything else like that on North Korea.</p><p> KING:  To that point, again, I think a lot of people in the country with the President more grace, and his supporters probably like the golf video too some in many way.  But to the idea that the timing too, the timing, is this about to go to the United Nations, a lot of people trying to figure out, you know, Twitter Trump versus teleprompter Trump versus what the staff says, he really wants to do and he does something like this.</p><p> CALMES:  Well, you know, and this was weekend where the White House said he was preparing for this big week at the U.N.  And when you think of all the many issues in the world that he could have been studying up on, instead that tweet of him hitting his former rival with a golf ball was tweeted by someone else of -- well, shall we just say, of questionable reputation.  And what is the President of the United States doing indulging in those kind of tweets, didn't he have more to do this weekend than to be -- and not only seeing them, but retweeting them.</p><p> KING:  And if National Security advisers on national television, he's a combat veteran, he's a general, he's a man with a distinguished record serving his country and he has to defend the President of the United State's tweets than he even he knows --</p><p> PACE:  About rocket man and Hillary.  And it comes at a time when his aides were trying to, you know, were seen on Friday where they're talking about the U.N. and talking about how he's going to be very serious and how he's taking these meetings, you know, how he's taking them seriously and going to present a good front for the United States for the world.  They cringe too.  I mean, you have to be up front about this.</p><p> It's not just us in the media.  His own aides cringe when he decide to things happen because then they have to go out and defend it.  And I think we can also again wipe away any notion that John Kelly and any new structure in White House is going to end this.  It's just not.</p><p> KING:  It moderate at a time it seems but ending it no.  Everybody hold their breath.  Up next, the Hollywood rituals, dresses that cost more than your car.  And now barbwire (ph) jokes about the President.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> [12:51:38] STEPHEN COLBERT, THE LATE SHOW HOST, CBS:  Is there anyone who can say how big the audience is?  Sean, do you know?</p><p> SEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmy's period both in person and around the world.</p><p> COLBERT:  Wow.  That really soothes my fragile ego.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KING:  We haven't heard, there it was right there.  A new twist on an old line.  Sean Spicer rolling out on the stage.  It may have been the biggest surprise last night.  The biggest star unquestionably the President Hollywood loves the most.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS, ACTRESS, \"VEEP\":  We did have a whole story line about an impeachment but we abandoned that because they were worried that someone else might get to it at first.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KING:  The President's approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes you might say once flat long ago.  But even some of the comedians who rose them for a living, some of them acknowledge the jokes are starting to feel a little tired.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JAMES CORDEN, HOST, \"THE LATE LATE SHOW\":  And your show has been -- that thing you say about Trump being ban, so fresh.  So fresh.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KING:  It was interesting.  It is interesting.  There's no question. The Hollywood largely liberal establishment does not like the current Republican President of the United States.  They also know that he likes to be liked.  And so they know that when they do this, it gets in his face.  Does it matter?  That he is so permeated pop culture this way.</p><p> PACE:  Well it's interesting that Trump did not respond.</p><p> KING:  Right.</p><p> PACE:  It was like the Oscars when he was almost tweeting in realtime.</p><p> KING:  Merrill Streep, one of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KING:  Yes.</p><p> (OFF-MIC)</p><p> PACE:  Look, to me, there's a difference between the jokes about Trump and then the joke with Spicer.  Maybe people will think that I'm being humorless about this but I don't think it's funny to have a press secretary basically acknowledging that they were lying from the White House podium.  It's not funny.  That has real damaging consequences.</p><p> KING:  Well, it's an interesting conversation.  The conversation in this town because people wonder if Sean Spicer redeems himself and gets a job in politics from public relations.  If you look at social media last night, a lot of Trump critics and a lot of liberals were mad at the own liberal Hollywood establishment saying do not help rehabilitate this man.</p><p> I would say this, number one, I know firsthand from friends in the town, Sean Spicer is having a really hard time getting his -- these are people reach out to some of the bigger firms here in town and the answer is been thanks, but no thanks.  Number two, he was the joke. And I know some people don't find it funny, but yes, he got a moment, yes, he got to mingle with the stars, yes he got to the party and drink beer and take selfie with stars but his moment on stage was he was the joke.</p><p> BACON:  And one probably the worst moment of a press secretary that I can remember. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.</p><p> BACON:  That January 21st, well always remember that, one of the worst moments any press secretaries (INAUDIBLE) it was a joke.  I'm not sure it helps them move on to the next stage.  He has been in the Republican Party a long time we have known it for a long time.  So, I assume he wants to get back into something like politics.  I don't know if that will be easy or hard, but he sort of -- I assume-- trying to make fun of himself in stage (ph).  Look, like Julie said, those big moments when you talk about April Ryan, those were not particularly funny or redeeming moments.</p><p> PACE:  Being in an administration is supposed to be able to get a golden ticket to get a job after in administration, right, and then cash out.  But if you sold your integrity to an extent, you know, that is, I guess a warning for anybody that might follow that making some more decisions.</p><p> [12:55:12] CALMES:  Right.  And I wouldn't wish anyone ill, but if Sean Spicer were indeed to find himself unable to get the big job that he wanted to parlay this into, it would really say something about Washington writ large and the Trump administration that there is, you know -- we always joke about Washington that there are always second acts in politics.  I mean, look at Newt Gingrich, he resigned in amidst of scandal and shame and he's back as a major commentator on politics.</p><p> And this -- if this is -- this would show that there is a limit.  That there some things like lying to the American public that are a bridge too far.</p><p> KING:  On the broader question of Hollywood versus Trump, I just want to say this, Kellyanne Conway this morning saying, go away.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  They've got pluck and polished and whacked and someone who didn't eat for two months and offer what?  To sound the same and they have a right to speak, but if you are tuning in to watch -- if you're American you're tuning in to watch your favorite actors and actresses and shows -- and I used to do it routinely as a kid.  Who is going to win?  And she lost and I love her show.  There is very little of that.  It's between the Emmys, the Miss America pageant was politicized.  Our sports are very politicized and it looks like the ratings are suffering.  It looks like America is responding by tuning out because they want you to stick to your knitting.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KING:  I'm told the initial ratings were down from last night.  If that holds up in the final ratings, how long until the President tweets that.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KING:  They have plucked and polished and wax and some didn't eat for two months.  That's a pretty priceless.</p><p> All right, we got to go.  Thanks for watching us in Inside Politics. We'll see you back here tomorrow.  President Trump set to meet with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next hour.  Wolf Blitzer picks up that important coverage after a quick break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [Byline: John King] [Guest: Julie Pace, Jackie Calmes, Ken Vogel, Perry Bacon, Karoun Demirjian] [High: Special counsel Robert Mueller and his team are now in possession of Russian-linked ads run on Facebook during the presidential election, after they obtained a search warrant for the information.  Mueller may be looking to charge specific foreign entities with a crime.  Mueller probe now examining possible obstruction.  White House attorney Ty Cobb was overheard talking about the Russia probe and some of his colleagues at a Washington steakhouse by a New York Times reporter.  President Trump's legal team is fighting internally over how much it will cooperate with the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. President Donald Trump began his Sunday morning on Twitter, raising eyebrows with a series of posts and retweets on subjects ranging from North Korea to Hillary Clinton.  Politics took centre stage at the Emmy Awards with Donald Trump being skewered from all angles.] [Spec: Facebook Bob Mueller; Russia; Washington; New York Times; Don McGhan; Kim Jong-un; Twitter; Democratic; U.N.; North Korea; Hillary Clinton; John Kelly; Rotten Tomatoes; Emmy Award; Republican; Oscars; Merrill Street; Sean Spicer]</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2017 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

The Special Counsel investigation into Russian election meddling now reaching inside social media giant, Facebook.  Sources confirming to CNN, Robert Mueller's team has obtained a search warrant compelling Facebook to surrender information about campaign-related ads bought by account that now been linked back to the Russian government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's why this could really matter.  To get such a sweeping warrant, prosecutors need to demonstrate probable cause of a crime.  It's illegal for a foreign national to interfere in the U.S. election and it would be a crime if any U.S. citizen worked colluded with them, for example, to offer political advice like with issues and states.  Those ads should target.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So this is a, A, it's big deal anyway to have a private company like Facebook, have the Special Counsel come knocking saying, turn over the records.  And now you get into this whole question, this collusion question and the idea is the Trump campaign will tell you.  Their team dragged about their use of digital space particularly Facebook in the final weeks of the campaign they think is what turned Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.  Now the question is, if this Russian accounts, Russian bought ads were in the same places, coincidence or not?</p><p>JULIE PACE, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPODENT, ASSOCIATED PRESS:  Well, I mean, it's a huge open question I think at this point, but this is what the Mueller team is after right now.  We've been in this space with the Russian investigations where you've had a lot of rumors floating around, a lot of ticky-tack things out there.</p><p>This is pretty serious.  This is a big deal not just for this investigation.  It's a big deal for future U.S. elections.  And Facebook, the company that has been pretty opaque in their political dealings, pretty opaque in terms of how their ads are purchased, who they deal with there.  So the consequences of this, not just for the Mueller investigation but broadly for politics, for big tech and its relationship with Washington are -- could be hugely consequential.</p><p>JACKIE CALMES, WHIT HOUSE EDITOR, LOS ANGELES TIMES:  That's right.  I mean, we're into the mid-term cycle now which is a hugely consequential mid-term.  I mean, most of them are, but this one really is and with the control of Congress at stake in the mid-term of the Trump administration.  So, it's really -- you know, you have to wonder what's going on now that is going undetected.  They were so successful apparently in the 2016 election.</p><p>KING:  It's a great point both for the -- any campaign regulatory agencies and the social media giants in the idea that what do you have to do to more properly vet --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.</p><p>KING:  -- when you're taking money from, where is that money coming from.  It's hard, you say about its fake account, it's hard, but it's doable.  That's one of the challenges.</p><p>I want to go out for another piece of the story, dramatic story of the New York Times today about two of the President's lawyers sitting outdoors in a Washington D.C. steak house talking about the strategy in dealing with the special counsel investigation we just talked to. Talking about debates within the team about how cooperatively, debates within the team about transparent it could be.</p><p>Let's listen to the New York Times reporter who was sitting as close as I I'm to you, Jackie, Ken Vogel.  The President's lawyers are there.  He's, hance, at the next table and he hears this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEN VOGEL, REPORTER, NEW YORK TIMES:  As I sat there by myself at this table taking notes on my iPhone, they preceded to discuss --</p><p>UNIDETIFIED FEMALE:  Wow.</p><p>VOGEL:  -- some of the, you know, the most sensitive of the sensitive area in way that was very easily audible to me and allowed for us to get at some of these issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[12:35:09] KING:  Among the things they are talking is how cooperative to be.  And there's a picture of the two attorneys.  They're talking about (INAUDIBLE) sitting at the table at a D.C. steak house, very recognizable men, very well-known in the legal community, political community here in Washington D.C.  The restaurant happens to be steps from the New York Times Washington Bureau.  Smart choice.</p><p>The issues includes disagreements about how cooperative and transparent to be with Robert Mueller, the Special Counsel, whether to actually give him documents even before he ask for them or to wait and make sure only give him what he exactly asks for.  At one point, they said that Don McGhan, the White House Counsel, the President's White House Attorney had documents locked in a safe.  Now, we don't know what that means, but for two, the President's lawyers to be having a debate about strategy and to say that publicly is nuts.</p><p>PERRY BACON, SENIOR POLITICAL WRITER, FIVETHIRTYEIGHT:  The idea that it's in a restaurant, of course, bad form, (INAUDIBLE) and that kind of thing.  But I think the core that they're talking about is a real big issue is, are they going to cooperate or not.  This is where coming out Mueller is I feel like going for the kill (INAUDIBLE).  He is really pushing pretty hard inside the White House.</p><p>And, you know, (INAUDIBLE) the question of, will the White House cooperate, will documents going to be turned over in (INAUDIBLE).  So, now you're here, we're ultimately, this will going to come and it looks like a fight over executive privilege, over about with documents given this and become a place where this will be the politics that's really hard here.  What is Trump going to do with this investigation that could really change and may be harm obviously in his presidency.</p><p>His lawyers are not feel that threat and they're talking about which documents to hand over or which not, which tells you the level of stories here that were coming to.</p><p>KAROUN DEMIRJIAN, REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST:  And even what they've exposed also is a question -- it opens the question of whether other people in the White House will be now brought into Mueller's probe.  When you are in a -- yes, there is a turning point from this, but it's not exactly the same when you are an, you know, employee of the White House and you see.  They could now be brought in especially if there is, you know, credible evidence spoken out of the mouths of lawyers themselves, that there may be documents in the state for other things there.  You may see some of these other people getting pulled into the probe now which complicates the legal defense for the Trump team and even more.</p><p>BACON:  And with the White House.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KING:  There's a paragraph of the story about the fear inside the White House trepidation about this, inside the White House, that there are some people think that some of the colleagues might be wearing a wire, were wearing a wire for Bob Mueller.  I mean, that -- again, great going to work every day, right?</p><p>CALMES:  Well, and we saw some of that during the investigations on the second Clinton term.</p><p>KING:  Right.</p><p>CALMES:  But not like that.  I mean, this is a far more serious.  That went to the personnel --</p><p>BACON:  Conduct.</p><p>CALMES:  -- conduct of the President.  This goes to the entire campaign and potential colluding with an adversary.</p><p>KING:  And potential, emphasis potential, potential with Special Counsel looking into obstruction by the President --</p><p>CALMES:  Right, exactly.</p><p>KING:  -- of the United States, it's not the candidate. DEMIRJIAN:  But exactly it is potential and if we -- you know, if McGhan is right that there's nothing there and that's why he should be handing over more documents because it will show the President (INAUDIBLE) anything wrong.  They are creating --</p><p>KING:  Could be unlocking the safe, it's not locking the safe.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN:  Definitely.  But again, I mean, if this -- and this means something that is a self-constructed nightmare that didn't need to be there, then why?</p><p>CALMES:  Why did you say quickly -- I mean, nothing about what the lawyers reportedly said to each other surprised me really.  And Don McGhan, it is his job as a White House counsel, not to represent the President individually, but to represent the office of the President. So he has to be concern about President set.</p><p>What surprised me about this is that they were saying this.  I worked in the New York Times Bureau for nine years.  I had many lunches at DOT.  There, or any place out, I always looked around the room to see who was there before I talked.  And the fact that the two lawyers didn't is astounding.</p><p>KING:  Common sense.  That's one is interesting to watch.  We've seen the President blow off his legal team in the past.  We'll see how this story sets with the President today.</p><p>Up next, it seems the President spend a lot of time on Twitter this weekend.  But was it presidential tweets, including the rocket man. Next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[12:43:03] KING:  Moments ago, President Trump tweeting his praise for the United Nations Secretary General saying, \"We commend Antonio Guterres and his call for the U.N. to focus more on people and less on bureaucracy.\"  Compare that to this weekend.  We know the President spent a good part of his weekend preparing for that U.N. meeting and other speeches sessions at the U.N. general assembly.  The big speech is tomorrow.</p><p>The President also took some time to indulge in one of his favorite pastimes.  An early morning Twitter spree, among his many tweets and retweets, he shared this.  \"I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night.  Asked him how Rocket Man is doing.  Long gas lines forming in North Korea.  Too bad.\"</p><p>He also retweeted a video, heavily edited, to look like he's hitting Hillary Clinton with a golf ball.  You see that there.  This from a man who once promised this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  At some point, I'm going to be so presidential that you people will be so bored.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING:  Waiting.  Waiting.  Still waiting.  I want to distinguish between the two in that people foreign policy establishment will cringe a bit when you call Kim Jong-un, \"rocket man.\"  I think most Americans probably get the President a grace to say that's the way he wants to say it, that's just fine.</p><p>The video where you show, he retweets a video edited by a pro-Trump Twitter feed upon hitting a golf ball that hits the Secretary of State Democratic presidential candidate in the back of the head and she falls.  That was stripping into since she hit.  People yesterday took some laughter on the Sunday program is people thinking that, you know, we thought that was funny.  That part is not funny.  That part is not funny.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KING:  He's the President of the United States.  If your kid did this, your kid would be punished.</p><p>BACON:  I put that talking about, you know, (INAUDIBLE) in the Twitter and how bad it was his tweets about women in particular are bad.</p><p>KING:  Given his history of -- you're right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BACON:  This is bad.  The first one is maybe a little funny.  You can't fix the North Korea problems that he sort of venting act like a little bit, but the Hillary one is awful.</p><p>[12:45:06] DEMIRJIAN:  Yes.  Both of them were not good.  I think the North Korean one -- I mean, the Hillary one is really bad form.  The North Korea one has potential implications that are very, very \"geopolitically disastrous,\" right.  Kim Jong-un probably thinks it's cool to be called rocket man to the extent.  This is a guy who invite Dennis Rodman to hang out and, you know, in his country.</p><p>Anything that kind of gives him a little bit of levity in the situation makes it somehow less serious and it's extremely serious situation that they cannot find a way to cut through.  This is not going to make China turn around and start to, you know, extinctions pressure and everything else like that on North Korea.</p><p>KING:  To that point, again, I think a lot of people in the country with the President more grace, and his supporters probably like the golf video too some in many way.  But to the idea that the timing too, the timing, is this about to go to the United Nations, a lot of people trying to figure out, you know, Twitter Trump versus teleprompter Trump versus what the staff says, he really wants to do and he does something like this.</p><p>CALMES:  Well, you know, and this was weekend where the White House said he was preparing for this big week at the U.N.  And when you think of all the many issues in the world that he could have been studying up on, instead that tweet of him hitting his former rival with a golf ball was tweeted by someone else of -- well, shall we just say, of questionable reputation.  And what is the President of the United States doing indulging in those kind of tweets, didn't he have more to do this weekend than to be -- and not only seeing them, but retweeting them.</p><p>KING:  And if National Security advisers on national television, he's a combat veteran, he's a general, he's a man with a distinguished record serving his country and he has to defend the President of the United State's tweets than he even he knows --</p><p>PACE:  About rocket man and Hillary.  And it comes at a time when his aides were trying to, you know, were seen on Friday where they're talking about the U.N. and talking about how he's going to be very serious and how he's taking these meetings, you know, how he's taking them seriously and going to present a good front for the United States for the world.  They cringe too.  I mean, you have to be up front about this.</p><p>It's not just us in the media.  His own aides cringe when he decide to things happen because then they have to go out and defend it.  And I think we can also again wipe away any notion that John Kelly and any new structure in White House is going to end this.  It's just not.</p><p>KING:  It moderate at a time it seems but ending it no.  Everybody hold their breath.  Up next, the Hollywood rituals, dresses that cost more than your car.  And now barbwire (ph) jokes about the President.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[12:51:38] STEPHEN COLBERT, THE LATE SHOW HOST, CBS:  Is there anyone who can say how big the audience is?  Sean, do you know?</p><p>SEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmy's period both in person and around the world.</p><p>COLBERT:  Wow.  That really soothes my fragile ego.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING:  We haven't heard, there it was right there.  A new twist on an old line.  Sean Spicer rolling out on the stage.  It may have been the biggest surprise last night.  The biggest star unquestionably the President Hollywood loves the most.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS, ACTRESS, \"VEEP\":  We did have a whole story line about an impeachment but we abandoned that because they were worried that someone else might get to it at first.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING:  The President's approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes you might say once flat long ago.  But even some of the comedians who rose them for a living, some of them acknowledge the jokes are starting to feel a little tired.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES CORDEN, HOST, \"THE LATE LATE SHOW\":  And your show has been -- that thing you say about Trump being ban, so fresh.  So fresh.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING:  It was interesting.  It is interesting.  There's no question. The Hollywood largely liberal establishment does not like the current Republican President of the United States.  They also know that he likes to be liked.  And so they know that when they do this, it gets in his face.  Does it matter?  That he is so permeated pop culture this way.</p><p>PACE:  Well it's interesting that Trump did not respond.</p><p>KING:  Right.</p><p>PACE:  It was like the Oscars when he was almost tweeting in realtime.</p><p>KING:  Merrill Streep, one of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KING:  Yes.</p><p>(OFF-MIC)</p><p>PACE:  Look, to me, there's a difference between the jokes about Trump and then the joke with Spicer.  Maybe people will think that I'm being humorless about this but I don't think it's funny to have a press secretary basically acknowledging that they were lying from the White House podium.  It's not funny.  That has real damaging consequences.</p><p>KING:  Well, it's an interesting conversation.  The conversation in this town because people wonder if Sean Spicer redeems himself and gets a job in politics from public relations.  If you look at social media last night, a lot of Trump critics and a lot of liberals were mad at the own liberal Hollywood establishment saying do not help rehabilitate this man.</p><p>I would say this, number one, I know firsthand from friends in the town, Sean Spicer is having a really hard time getting his -- these are people reach out to some of the bigger firms here in town and the answer is been thanks, but no thanks.  Number two, he was the joke. And I know some people don't find it funny, but yes, he got a moment, yes, he got to mingle with the stars, yes he got to the party and drink beer and take selfie with stars but his moment on stage was he was the joke.</p><p>BACON:  And one probably the worst moment of a press secretary that I can remember. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.</p><p>BACON:  That January 21st, well always remember that, one of the worst moments any press secretaries (INAUDIBLE) it was a joke.  I'm not sure it helps them move on to the next stage.  He has been in the Republican Party a long time we have known it for a long time.  So, I assume he wants to get back into something like politics.  I don't know if that will be easy or hard, but he sort of -- I assume-- trying to make fun of himself in stage (ph).  Look, like Julie said, those big moments when you talk about April Ryan, those were not particularly funny or redeeming moments.</p><p>PACE:  Being in an administration is supposed to be able to get a golden ticket to get a job after in administration, right, and then cash out.  But if you sold your integrity to an extent, you know, that is, I guess a warning for anybody that might follow that making some more decisions.</p><p>[12:55:12] CALMES:  Right.  And I wouldn't wish anyone ill, but if Sean Spicer were indeed to find himself unable to get the big job that he wanted to parlay this into, it would really say something about Washington writ large and the Trump administration that there is, you know -- we always joke about Washington that there are always second acts in politics.  I mean, look at Newt Gingrich, he resigned in amidst of scandal and shame and he's back as a major commentator on politics.</p><p>And this -- if this is -- this would show that there is a limit.  That there some things like lying to the American public that are a bridge too far.</p><p>KING:  On the broader question of Hollywood versus Trump, I just want to say this, Kellyanne Conway this morning saying, go away.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  They've got pluck and polished and whacked and someone who didn't eat for two months and offer what?  To sound the same and they have a right to speak, but if you are tuning in to watch -- if you're American you're tuning in to watch your favorite actors and actresses and shows -- and I used to do it routinely as a kid.  Who is going to win?  And she lost and I love her show.  There is very little of that.  It's between the Emmys, the Miss America pageant was politicized.  Our sports are very politicized and it looks like the ratings are suffering.  It looks like America is responding by tuning out because they want you to stick to your knitting.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING:  I'm told the initial ratings were down from last night.  If that holds up in the final ratings, how long until the President tweets that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KING:  They have plucked and polished and wax and some didn't eat for two months.  That's a pretty priceless.</p><p>All right, we got to go.  Thanks for watching us in Inside Politics. We'll see you back here tomorrow.  President Trump set to meet with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next hour.  Wolf Blitzer picks up that important coverage after a quick break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[Byline: John King] [Guest: Julie Pace, Jackie Calmes, Ken Vogel, Perry Bacon, Karoun Demirjian] [High: Special counsel Robert Mueller and his team are now in possession of Russian-linked ads run on Facebook during the presidential election, after they obtained a search warrant for the information.  Mueller may be looking to charge specific foreign entities with a crime.  Mueller probe now examining possible obstruction.  White House attorney Ty Cobb was overheard talking about the Russia probe and some of his colleagues at a Washington steakhouse by a New York Times reporter.  President Trump's legal team is fighting internally over how much it will cooperate with the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. President Donald Trump began his Sunday morning on Twitter, raising eyebrows with a series of posts and retweets on subjects ranging from North Korea to Hillary Clinton.  Politics took centre stage at the Emmy Awards with Donald Trump being skewered from all angles.] [Spec: Facebook Bob Mueller; Russia; Washington; New York Times; Don McGhan; Kim Jong-un; Twitter; Democratic; U.N.; North Korea; Hillary Clinton; John Kelly; Rotten Tomatoes; Emmy Award; Republican; Oscars; Merrill Street; Sean Spicer]</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2017 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

The Special Counsel investigation into Russian election meddling now reaching inside social media giant, Facebook.  Sources confirming to CNN, Robert Mueller's team has obtained a search warrant compelling Facebook to surrender information about campaign-related ads bought by account that now been linked back to the Russian government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Here's why this could really matter.  To get such a sweeping warrant, prosecutors need to demonstrate probable cause of a crime.  It's illegal for a foreign national to interfere in the U.S. election and it would be a crime if any U.S. citizen worked colluded with them, for example, to offer political advice like with issues and states.  Those ads should target.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> So this is a, A, it's big deal anyway to have a private company like Facebook, have the Special Counsel come knocking saying, turn over the records.  And now you get into this whole question, this collusion question and the idea is the Trump campaign will tell you.  Their team dragged about their use of digital space particularly Facebook in the final weeks of the campaign they think is what turned Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.  Now the question is, if this Russian accounts, Russian bought ads were in the same places, coincidence or not?</p><p> JULIE PACE, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPODENT, ASSOCIATED PRESS:  Well, I mean, it's a huge open question I think at this point, but this is what the Mueller team is after right now.  We've been in this space with the Russian investigations where you've had a lot of rumors floating around, a lot of ticky-tack things out there.</p><p> This is pretty serious.  This is a big deal not just for this investigation.  It's a big deal for future U.S. elections.  And Facebook, the company that has been pretty opaque in their political dealings, pretty opaque in terms of how their ads are purchased, who they deal with there.  So the consequences of this, not just for the Mueller investigation but broadly for politics, for big tech and its relationship with Washington are -- could be hugely consequential.</p><p> JACKIE CALMES, WHIT HOUSE EDITOR, LOS ANGELES TIMES:  That's right.  I mean, we're into the mid-term cycle now which is a hugely consequential mid-term.  I mean, most of them are, but this one really is and with the control of Congress at stake in the mid-term of the Trump administration.  So, it's really -- you know, you have to wonder what's going on now that is going undetected.  They were so successful apparently in the 2016 election.</p><p> KING:  It's a great point both for the -- any campaign regulatory agencies and the social media giants in the idea that what do you have to do to more properly vet --</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.</p><p> KING:  -- when you're taking money from, where is that money coming from.  It's hard, you say about its fake account, it's hard, but it's doable.  That's one of the challenges.</p><p> I want to go out for another piece of the story, dramatic story of the New York Times today about two of the President's lawyers sitting outdoors in a Washington D.C. steak house talking about the strategy in dealing with the special counsel investigation we just talked to. Talking about debates within the team about how cooperatively, debates within the team about transparent it could be.</p><p> Let's listen to the New York Times reporter who was sitting as close as I I'm to you, Jackie, Ken Vogel.  The President's lawyers are there.  He's, hance, at the next table and he hears this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KEN VOGEL, REPORTER, NEW YORK TIMES:  As I sat there by myself at this table taking notes on my iPhone, they preceded to discuss --</p><p> UNIDETIFIED FEMALE:  Wow.</p><p> VOGEL:  -- some of the, you know, the most sensitive of the sensitive area in way that was very easily audible to me and allowed for us to get at some of these issues.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> [12:35:09] KING:  Among the things they are talking is how cooperative to be.  And there's a picture of the two attorneys.  They're talking about (INAUDIBLE) sitting at the table at a D.C. steak house, very recognizable men, very well-known in the legal community, political community here in Washington D.C.  The restaurant happens to be steps from the New York Times Washington Bureau.  Smart choice.</p><p> The issues includes disagreements about how cooperative and transparent to be with Robert Mueller, the Special Counsel, whether to actually give him documents even before he ask for them or to wait and make sure only give him what he exactly asks for.  At one point, they said that Don McGhan, the White House Counsel, the President's White House Attorney had documents locked in a safe.  Now, we don't know what that means, but for two, the President's lawyers to be having a debate about strategy and to say that publicly is nuts.</p><p> PERRY BACON, SENIOR POLITICAL WRITER, FIVETHIRTYEIGHT:  The idea that it's in a restaurant, of course, bad form, (INAUDIBLE) and that kind of thing.  But I think the core that they're talking about is a real big issue is, are they going to cooperate or not.  This is where coming out Mueller is I feel like going for the kill (INAUDIBLE).  He is really pushing pretty hard inside the White House.</p><p> And, you know, (INAUDIBLE) the question of, will the White House cooperate, will documents going to be turned over in (INAUDIBLE).  So, now you're here, we're ultimately, this will going to come and it looks like a fight over executive privilege, over about with documents given this and become a place where this will be the politics that's really hard here.  What is Trump going to do with this investigation that could really change and may be harm obviously in his presidency.</p><p> His lawyers are not feel that threat and they're talking about which documents to hand over or which not, which tells you the level of stories here that were coming to.</p><p> KAROUN DEMIRJIAN, REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST:  And even what they've exposed also is a question -- it opens the question of whether other people in the White House will be now brought into Mueller's probe.  When you are in a -- yes, there is a turning point from this, but it's not exactly the same when you are an, you know, employee of the White House and you see.  They could now be brought in especially if there is, you know, credible evidence spoken out of the mouths of lawyers themselves, that there may be documents in the state for other things there.  You may see some of these other people getting pulled into the probe now which complicates the legal defense for the Trump team and even more.</p><p> BACON:  And with the White House.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KING:  There's a paragraph of the story about the fear inside the White House trepidation about this, inside the White House, that there are some people think that some of the colleagues might be wearing a wire, were wearing a wire for Bob Mueller.  I mean, that -- again, great going to work every day, right?</p><p> CALMES:  Well, and we saw some of that during the investigations on the second Clinton term.</p><p> KING:  Right.</p><p> CALMES:  But not like that.  I mean, this is a far more serious.  That went to the personnel --</p><p> BACON:  Conduct.</p><p> CALMES:  -- conduct of the President.  This goes to the entire campaign and potential colluding with an adversary.</p><p> KING:  And potential, emphasis potential, potential with Special Counsel looking into obstruction by the President --</p><p> CALMES:  Right, exactly.</p><p> KING:  -- of the United States, it's not the candidate. DEMIRJIAN:  But exactly it is potential and if we -- you know, if McGhan is right that there's nothing there and that's why he should be handing over more documents because it will show the President (INAUDIBLE) anything wrong.  They are creating --</p><p> KING:  Could be unlocking the safe, it's not locking the safe.</p><p> DEMIRJIAN:  Definitely.  But again, I mean, if this -- and this means something that is a self-constructed nightmare that didn't need to be there, then why?</p><p> CALMES:  Why did you say quickly -- I mean, nothing about what the lawyers reportedly said to each other surprised me really.  And Don McGhan, it is his job as a White House counsel, not to represent the President individually, but to represent the office of the President. So he has to be concern about President set.</p><p> What surprised me about this is that they were saying this.  I worked in the New York Times Bureau for nine years.  I had many lunches at DOT.  There, or any place out, I always looked around the room to see who was there before I talked.  And the fact that the two lawyers didn't is astounding.</p><p> KING:  Common sense.  That's one is interesting to watch.  We've seen the President blow off his legal team in the past.  We'll see how this story sets with the President today.</p><p> Up next, it seems the President spend a lot of time on Twitter this weekend.  But was it presidential tweets, including the rocket man. Next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [12:43:03] KING:  Moments ago, President Trump tweeting his praise for the United Nations Secretary General saying, \"We commend Antonio Guterres and his call for the U.N. to focus more on people and less on bureaucracy.\"  Compare that to this weekend.  We know the President spent a good part of his weekend preparing for that U.N. meeting and other speeches sessions at the U.N. general assembly.  The big speech is tomorrow.</p><p> The President also took some time to indulge in one of his favorite pastimes.  An early morning Twitter spree, among his many tweets and retweets, he shared this.  \"I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night.  Asked him how Rocket Man is doing.  Long gas lines forming in North Korea.  Too bad.\"</p><p> He also retweeted a video, heavily edited, to look like he's hitting Hillary Clinton with a golf ball.  You see that there.  This from a man who once promised this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  At some point, I'm going to be so presidential that you people will be so bored.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KING:  Waiting.  Waiting.  Still waiting.  I want to distinguish between the two in that people foreign policy establishment will cringe a bit when you call Kim Jong-un, \"rocket man.\"  I think most Americans probably get the President a grace to say that's the way he wants to say it, that's just fine.</p><p> The video where you show, he retweets a video edited by a pro-Trump Twitter feed upon hitting a golf ball that hits the Secretary of State Democratic presidential candidate in the back of the head and she falls.  That was stripping into since she hit.  People yesterday took some laughter on the Sunday program is people thinking that, you know, we thought that was funny.  That part is not funny.  That part is not funny.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KING:  He's the President of the United States.  If your kid did this, your kid would be punished.</p><p> BACON:  I put that talking about, you know, (INAUDIBLE) in the Twitter and how bad it was his tweets about women in particular are bad.</p><p> KING:  Given his history of -- you're right.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BACON:  This is bad.  The first one is maybe a little funny.  You can't fix the North Korea problems that he sort of venting act like a little bit, but the Hillary one is awful.</p><p> [12:45:06] DEMIRJIAN:  Yes.  Both of them were not good.  I think the North Korean one -- I mean, the Hillary one is really bad form.  The North Korea one has potential implications that are very, very \"geopolitically disastrous,\" right.  Kim Jong-un probably thinks it's cool to be called rocket man to the extent.  This is a guy who invite Dennis Rodman to hang out and, you know, in his country.</p><p> Anything that kind of gives him a little bit of levity in the situation makes it somehow less serious and it's extremely serious situation that they cannot find a way to cut through.  This is not going to make China turn around and start to, you know, extinctions pressure and everything else like that on North Korea.</p><p> KING:  To that point, again, I think a lot of people in the country with the President more grace, and his supporters probably like the golf video too some in many way.  But to the idea that the timing too, the timing, is this about to go to the United Nations, a lot of people trying to figure out, you know, Twitter Trump versus teleprompter Trump versus what the staff says, he really wants to do and he does something like this.</p><p> CALMES:  Well, you know, and this was weekend where the White House said he was preparing for this big week at the U.N.  And when you think of all the many issues in the world that he could have been studying up on, instead that tweet of him hitting his former rival with a golf ball was tweeted by someone else of -- well, shall we just say, of questionable reputation.  And what is the President of the United States doing indulging in those kind of tweets, didn't he have more to do this weekend than to be -- and not only seeing them, but retweeting them.</p><p> KING:  And if National Security advisers on national television, he's a combat veteran, he's a general, he's a man with a distinguished record serving his country and he has to defend the President of the United State's tweets than he even he knows --</p><p> PACE:  About rocket man and Hillary.  And it comes at a time when his aides were trying to, you know, were seen on Friday where they're talking about the U.N. and talking about how he's going to be very serious and how he's taking these meetings, you know, how he's taking them seriously and going to present a good front for the United States for the world.  They cringe too.  I mean, you have to be up front about this.</p><p> It's not just us in the media.  His own aides cringe when he decide to things happen because then they have to go out and defend it.  And I think we can also again wipe away any notion that John Kelly and any new structure in White House is going to end this.  It's just not.</p><p> KING:  It moderate at a time it seems but ending it no.  Everybody hold their breath.  Up next, the Hollywood rituals, dresses that cost more than your car.  And now barbwire (ph) jokes about the President.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> [12:51:38] STEPHEN COLBERT, THE LATE SHOW HOST, CBS:  Is there anyone who can say how big the audience is?  Sean, do you know?</p><p> SEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmy's period both in person and around the world.</p><p> COLBERT:  Wow.  That really soothes my fragile ego.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KING:  We haven't heard, there it was right there.  A new twist on an old line.  Sean Spicer rolling out on the stage.  It may have been the biggest surprise last night.  The biggest star unquestionably the President Hollywood loves the most.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS, ACTRESS, \"VEEP\":  We did have a whole story line about an impeachment but we abandoned that because they were worried that someone else might get to it at first.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KING:  The President's approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes you might say once flat long ago.  But even some of the comedians who rose them for a living, some of them acknowledge the jokes are starting to feel a little tired.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JAMES CORDEN, HOST, \"THE LATE LATE SHOW\":  And your show has been -- that thing you say about Trump being ban, so fresh.  So fresh.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KING:  It was interesting.  It is interesting.  There's no question. The Hollywood largely liberal establishment does not like the current Republican President of the United States.  They also know that he likes to be liked.  And so they know that when they do this, it gets in his face.  Does it matter?  That he is so permeated pop culture this way.</p><p> PACE:  Well it's interesting that Trump did not respond.</p><p> KING:  Right.</p><p> PACE:  It was like the Oscars when he was almost tweeting in realtime.</p><p> KING:  Merrill Streep, one of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KING:  Yes.</p><p> (OFF-MIC)</p><p> PACE:  Look, to me, there's a difference between the jokes about Trump and then the joke with Spicer.  Maybe people will think that I'm being humorless about this but I don't think it's funny to have a press secretary basically acknowledging that they were lying from the White House podium.  It's not funny.  That has real damaging consequences.</p><p> KING:  Well, it's an interesting conversation.  The conversation in this town because people wonder if Sean Spicer redeems himself and gets a job in politics from public relations.  If you look at social media last night, a lot of Trump critics and a lot of liberals were mad at the own liberal Hollywood establishment saying do not help rehabilitate this man.</p><p> I would say this, number one, I know firsthand from friends in the town, Sean Spicer is having a really hard time getting his -- these are people reach out to some of the bigger firms here in town and the answer is been thanks, but no thanks.  Number two, he was the joke. And I know some people don't find it funny, but yes, he got a moment, yes, he got to mingle with the stars, yes he got to the party and drink beer and take selfie with stars but his moment on stage was he was the joke.</p><p> BACON:  And one probably the worst moment of a press secretary that I can remember. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.</p><p> BACON:  That January 21st, well always remember that, one of the worst moments any press secretaries (INAUDIBLE) it was a joke.  I'm not sure it helps them move on to the next stage.  He has been in the Republican Party a long time we have known it for a long time.  So, I assume he wants to get back into something like politics.  I don't know if that will be easy or hard, but he sort of -- I assume-- trying to make fun of himself in stage (ph).  Look, like Julie said, those big moments when you talk about April Ryan, those were not particularly funny or redeeming moments.</p><p> PACE:  Being in an administration is supposed to be able to get a golden ticket to get a job after in administration, right, and then cash out.  But if you sold your integrity to an extent, you know, that is, I guess a warning for anybody that might follow that making some more decisions.</p><p> [12:55:12] CALMES:  Right.  And I wouldn't wish anyone ill, but if Sean Spicer were indeed to find himself unable to get the big job that he wanted to parlay this into, it would really say something about Washington writ large and the Trump administration that there is, you know -- we always joke about Washington that there are always second acts in politics.  I mean, look at Newt Gingrich, he resigned in amidst of scandal and shame and he's back as a major commentator on politics.</p><p> And this -- if this is -- this would show that there is a limit.  That there some things like lying to the American public that are a bridge too far.</p><p> KING:  On the broader question of Hollywood versus Trump, I just want to say this, Kellyanne Conway this morning saying, go away.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  They've got pluck and polished and whacked and someone who didn't eat for two months and offer what?  To sound the same and they have a right to speak, but if you are tuning in to watch -- if you're American you're tuning in to watch your favorite actors and actresses and shows -- and I used to do it routinely as a kid.  Who is going to win?  And she lost and I love her show.  There is very little of that.  It's between the Emmys, the Miss America pageant was politicized.  Our sports are very politicized and it looks like the ratings are suffering.  It looks like America is responding by tuning out because they want you to stick to your knitting.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KING:  I'm told the initial ratings were down from last night.  If that holds up in the final ratings, how long until the President tweets that.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KING:  They have plucked and polished and wax and some didn't eat for two months.  That's a pretty priceless.</p><p> All right, we got to go.  Thanks for watching us in Inside Politics. We'll see you back here tomorrow.  President Trump set to meet with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next hour.  Wolf Blitzer picks up that important coverage after a quick break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [Byline: John King] [Guest: Julie Pace, Jackie Calmes, Ken Vogel, Perry Bacon, Karoun Demirjian] [High: Special counsel Robert Mueller and his team are now in possession of Russian-linked ads run on Facebook during the presidential election, after they obtained a search warrant for the information.  Mueller may be looking to charge specific foreign entities with a crime.  Mueller probe now examining possible obstruction.  White House attorney Ty Cobb was overheard talking about the Russia probe and some of his colleagues at a Washington steakhouse by a New York Times reporter.  President Trump's legal team is fighting internally over how much it will cooperate with the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. President Donald Trump began his Sunday morning on Twitter, raising eyebrows with a series of posts and retweets on subjects ranging from North Korea to Hillary Clinton.

The Special Counsel investigation into Russian election meddling now reaching inside social media giant, Facebook.  Sources confirming to CNN, Robert Mueller's team has obtained a search warrant compelling Facebook to surrender information about campaign-related ads bought by account that now been linked back to the Russian government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's why this could really matter.  To get such a sweeping warrant, prosecutors need to demonstrate probable cause of a crime.  It's illegal for a foreign national to interfere in the U.S. election and it would be a crime if any U.S. citizen worked colluded with them, for example, to offer political advice like with issues and states.  Those ads should target.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So this is a, A, it's big deal anyway to have a private company like Facebook, have the Special Counsel come knocking saying, turn over the records.  And now you get into this whole question, this collusion question and the idea is the Trump campaign will tell you.  Their team dragged about their use of digital space particularly Facebook in the final weeks of the campaign they think is what turned Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.  Now the question is, if this Russian accounts, Russian bought ads were in the same places, coincidence or not?</p><p>JULIE PACE, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPODENT, ASSOCIATED PRESS:  Well, I mean, it's a huge open question I think at this point, but this is what the Mueller team is after right now.  We've been in this space with the Russian investigations where you've had a lot of rumors floating around, a lot of ticky-tack things out there.</p><p>This is pretty serious.  This is a big deal not just for this investigation.  It's a big deal for future U.S. elections.  And Facebook, the company that has been pretty opaque in their political dealings, pretty opaque in terms of how their ads are purchased, who they deal with there.  So the consequences of this, not just for the Mueller investigation but broadly for politics, for big tech and its relationship with Washington are -- could be hugely consequential.</p><p>JACKIE CALMES, WHIT HOUSE EDITOR, LOS ANGELES TIMES:  That's right.  I mean, we're into the mid-term cycle now which is a hugely consequential mid-term.  I mean, most of them are, but this one really is and with the control of Congress at stake in the mid-term of the Trump administration.  So, it's really -- you know, you have to wonder what's going on now that is going undetected.  They were so successful apparently in the 2016 election.</p><p>KING:  It's a great point both for the -- any campaign regulatory agencies and the social media giants in the idea that what do you have to do to more properly vet --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.</p><p>KING:  -- when you're taking money from, where is that money coming from.  It's hard, you say about its fake account, it's hard, but it's doable.  That's one of the challenges.</p><p>I want to go out for another piece of the story, dramatic story of the New York Times today about two of the President's lawyers sitting outdoors in a Washington D.C. steak house talking about the strategy in dealing with the special counsel investigation we just talked to. Talking about debates within the team about how cooperatively, debates within the team about transparent it could be.</p><p>Let's listen to the New York Times reporter who was sitting as close as I I'm to you, Jackie, Ken Vogel.  The President's lawyers are there.  He's, hance, at the next table and he hears this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEN VOGEL, REPORTER, NEW YORK TIMES:  As I sat there by myself at this table taking notes on my iPhone, they preceded to discuss --</p><p>UNIDETIFIED FEMALE:  Wow.</p><p>VOGEL:  -- some of the, you know, the most sensitive of the sensitive area in way that was very easily audible to me and allowed for us to get at some of these issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[12:35:09] KING:  Among the things they are talking is how cooperative to be.  And there's a picture of the two attorneys.  They're talking about (INAUDIBLE) sitting at the table at a D.C. steak house, very recognizable men, very well-known in the legal community, political community here in Washington D.C.  The restaurant happens to be steps from the New York Times Washington Bureau.  Smart choice.</p><p>The issues includes disagreements about how cooperative and transparent to be with Robert Mueller, the Special Counsel, whether to actually give him documents even before he ask for them or to wait and make sure only give him what he exactly asks for.  At one point, they said that Don McGhan, the White House Counsel, the President's White House Attorney had documents locked in a safe.  Now, we don't know what that means, but for two, the President's lawyers to be having a debate about strategy and to say that publicly is nuts.</p><p>PERRY BACON, SENIOR POLITICAL WRITER, FIVETHIRTYEIGHT:  The idea that it's in a restaurant, of course, bad form, (INAUDIBLE) and that kind of thing.  But I think the core that they're talking about is a real big issue is, are they going to cooperate or not.  This is where coming out Mueller is I feel like going for the kill (INAUDIBLE).  He is really pushing pretty hard inside the White House.</p><p>And, you know, (INAUDIBLE) the question of, will the White House cooperate, will documents going to be turned over in (INAUDIBLE).  So, now you're here, we're ultimately, this will going to come and it looks like a fight over executive privilege, over about with documents given this and become a place where this will be the politics that's really hard here.  What is Trump going to do with this investigation that could really change and may be harm obviously in his presidency.</p><p>His lawyers are not feel that threat and they're talking about which documents to hand over or which not, which tells you the level of stories here that were coming to.</p><p>KAROUN DEMIRJIAN, REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST:  And even what they've exposed also is a question -- it opens the question of whether other people in the White House will be now brought into Mueller's probe.  When you are in a -- yes, there is a turning point from this, but it's not exactly the same when you are an, you know, employee of the White House and you see.  They could now be brought in especially if there is, you know, credible evidence spoken out of the mouths of lawyers themselves, that there may be documents in the state for other things there.  You may see some of these other people getting pulled into the probe now which complicates the legal defense for the Trump team and even more.</p><p>BACON:  And with the White House.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KING:  There's a paragraph of the story about the fear inside the White House trepidation about this, inside the White House, that there are some people think that some of the colleagues might be wearing a wire, were wearing a wire for Bob Mueller.  I mean, that -- again, great going to work every day, right?</p><p>CALMES:  Well, and we saw some of that during the investigations on the second Clinton term.</p><p>KING:  Right.</p><p>CALMES:  But not like that.  I mean, this is a far more serious.  That went to the personnel --</p><p>BACON:  Conduct.</p><p>CALMES:  -- conduct of the President.  This goes to the entire campaign and potential colluding with an adversary.</p><p>KING:  And potential, emphasis potential, potential with Special Counsel looking into obstruction by the President --</p><p>CALMES:  Right, exactly.</p><p>KING:  -- of the United States, it's not the candidate. DEMIRJIAN:  But exactly it is potential and if we -- you know, if McGhan is right that there's nothing there and that's why he should be handing over more documents because it will show the President (INAUDIBLE) anything wrong.  They are creating --</p><p>KING:  Could be unlocking the safe, it's not locking the safe.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN:  Definitely.  But again, I mean, if this -- and this means something that is a self-constructed nightmare that didn't need to be there, then why?</p><p>CALMES:  Why did you say quickly -- I mean, nothing about what the lawyers reportedly said to each other surprised me really.  And Don McGhan, it is his job as a White House counsel, not to represent the President individually, but to represent the office of the President. So he has to be concern about President set.</p><p>What surprised me about this is that they were saying this.  I worked in the New York Times Bureau for nine years.  I had many lunches at DOT.  There, or any place out, I always looked around the room to see who was there before I talked.  And the fact that the two lawyers didn't is astounding.</p><p>KING:  Common sense.  That's one is interesting to watch.  We've seen the President blow off his legal team in the past.  We'll see how this story sets with the President today.</p><p>Up next, it seems the President spend a lot of time on Twitter this weekend.  But was it presidential tweets, including the rocket man. Next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[12:43:03] KING:  Moments ago, President Trump tweeting his praise for the United Nations Secretary General saying, \"We commend Antonio Guterres and his call for the U.N. to focus more on people and less on bureaucracy.\"  Compare that to this weekend.  We know the President spent a good part of his weekend preparing for that U.N. meeting and other speeches sessions at the U.N. general assembly.  The big speech is tomorrow.</p><p>The President also took some time to indulge in one of his favorite pastimes.  An early morning Twitter spree, among his many tweets and retweets, he shared this.  \"I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night.  Asked him how Rocket Man is doing.  Long gas lines forming in North Korea.  Too bad.\"</p><p>He also retweeted a video, heavily edited, to look like he's hitting Hillary Clinton with a golf ball.  You see that there.  This from a man who once promised this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  At some point, I'm going to be so presidential that you people will be so bored.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING:  Waiting.  Waiting.  Still waiting.  I want to distinguish between the two in that people foreign policy establishment will cringe a bit when you call Kim Jong-un, \"rocket man.\"  I think most Americans probably get the President a grace to say that's the way he wants to say it, that's just fine.</p><p>The video where you show, he retweets a video edited by a pro-Trump Twitter feed upon hitting a golf ball that hits the Secretary of State Democratic presidential candidate in the back of the head and she falls.  That was stripping into since she hit.  People yesterday took some laughter on the Sunday program is people thinking that, you know, we thought that was funny.  That part is not funny.  That part is not funny.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KING:  He's the President of the United States.  If your kid did this, your kid would be punished.</p><p>BACON:  I put that talking about, you know, (INAUDIBLE) in the Twitter and how bad it was his tweets about women in particular are bad.</p><p>KING:  Given his history of -- you're right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BACON:  This is bad.  The first one is maybe a little funny.  You can't fix the North Korea problems that he sort of venting act like a little bit, but the Hillary one is awful.</p><p>[12:45:06] DEMIRJIAN:  Yes.  Both of them were not good.  I think the North Korean one -- I mean, the Hillary one is really bad form.  The North Korea one has potential implications that are very, very \"geopolitically disastrous,\" right.  Kim Jong-un probably thinks it's cool to be called rocket man to the extent.  This is a guy who invite Dennis Rodman to hang out and, you know, in his country.</p><p>Anything that kind of gives him a little bit of levity in the situation makes it somehow less serious and it's extremely serious situation that they cannot find a way to cut through.  This is not going to make China turn around and start to, you know, extinctions pressure and everything else like that on North Korea.</p><p>KING:  To that point, again, I think a lot of people in the country with the President more grace, and his supporters probably like the golf video too some in many way.  But to the idea that the timing too, the timing, is this about to go to the United Nations, a lot of people trying to figure out, you know, Twitter Trump versus teleprompter Trump versus what the staff says, he really wants to do and he does something like this.</p><p>CALMES:  Well, you know, and this was weekend where the White House said he was preparing for this big week at the U.N.  And when you think of all the many issues in the world that he could have been studying up on, instead that tweet of him hitting his former rival with a golf ball was tweeted by someone else of -- well, shall we just say, of questionable reputation.  And what is the President of the United States doing indulging in those kind of tweets, didn't he have more to do this weekend than to be -- and not only seeing them, but retweeting them.</p><p>KING:  And if National Security advisers on national television, he's a combat veteran, he's a general, he's a man with a distinguished record serving his country and he has to defend the President of the United State's tweets than he even he knows --</p><p>PACE:  About rocket man and Hillary.  And it comes at a time when his aides were trying to, you know, were seen on Friday where they're talking about the U.N. and talking about how he's going to be very serious and how he's taking these meetings, you know, how he's taking them seriously and going to present a good front for the United States for the world.  They cringe too.  I mean, you have to be up front about this.</p><p>It's not just us in the media.  His own aides cringe when he decide to things happen because then they have to go out and defend it.  And I think we can also again wipe away any notion that John Kelly and any new structure in White House is going to end this.  It's just not.</p><p>KING:  It moderate at a time it seems but ending it no.  Everybody hold their breath.  Up next, the Hollywood rituals, dresses that cost more than your car.  And now barbwire (ph) jokes about the President.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[12:51:38] STEPHEN COLBERT, THE LATE SHOW HOST, CBS:  Is there anyone who can say how big the audience is?  Sean, do you know?</p><p>SEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmy's period both in person and around the world.</p><p>COLBERT:  Wow.  That really soothes my fragile ego.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING:  We haven't heard, there it was right there.  A new twist on an old line.  Sean Spicer rolling out on the stage.  It may have been the biggest surprise last night.  The biggest star unquestionably the President Hollywood loves the most.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS, ACTRESS, \"VEEP\":  We did have a whole story line about an impeachment but we abandoned that because they were worried that someone else might get to it at first.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING:  The President's approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes you might say once flat long ago.  But even some of the comedians who rose them for a living, some of them acknowledge the jokes are starting to feel a little tired.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES CORDEN, HOST, \"THE LATE LATE SHOW\":  And your show has been -- that thing you say about Trump being ban, so fresh.  So fresh.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING:  It was interesting.  It is interesting.  There's no question. The Hollywood largely liberal establishment does not like the current Republican President of the United States.  They also know that he likes to be liked.  And so they know that when they do this, it gets in his face.  Does it matter?  That he is so permeated pop culture this way.</p><p>PACE:  Well it's interesting that Trump did not respond.</p><p>KING:  Right.</p><p>PACE:  It was like the Oscars when he was almost tweeting in realtime.</p><p>KING:  Merrill Streep, one of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KING:  Yes.</p><p>(OFF-MIC)</p><p>PACE:  Look, to me, there's a difference between the jokes about Trump and then the joke with Spicer.  Maybe people will think that I'm being humorless about this but I don't think it's funny to have a press secretary basically acknowledging that they were lying from the White House podium.  It's not funny.  That has real damaging consequences.</p><p>KING:  Well, it's an interesting conversation.  The conversation in this town because people wonder if Sean Spicer redeems himself and gets a job in politics from public relations.  If you look at social media last night, a lot of Trump critics and a lot of liberals were mad at the own liberal Hollywood establishment saying do not help rehabilitate this man.</p><p>I would say this, number one, I know firsthand from friends in the town, Sean Spicer is having a really hard time getting his -- these are people reach out to some of the bigger firms here in town and the answer is been thanks, but no thanks.  Number two, he was the joke. And I know some people don't find it funny, but yes, he got a moment, yes, he got to mingle with the stars, yes he got to the party and drink beer and take selfie with stars but his moment on stage was he was the joke.</p><p>BACON:  And one probably the worst moment of a press secretary that I can remember. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.</p><p>BACON:  That January 21st, well always remember that, one of the worst moments any press secretaries (INAUDIBLE) it was a joke.  I'm not sure it helps them move on to the next stage.  He has been in the Republican Party a long time we have known it for a long time.  So, I assume he wants to get back into something like politics.  I don't know if that will be easy or hard, but he sort of -- I assume-- trying to make fun of himself in stage (ph).  Look, like Julie said, those big moments when you talk about April Ryan, those were not particularly funny or redeeming moments.</p><p>PACE:  Being in an administration is supposed to be able to get a golden ticket to get a job after in administration, right, and then cash out.  But if you sold your integrity to an extent, you know, that is, I guess a warning for anybody that might follow that making some more decisions.</p><p>[12:55:12] CALMES:  Right.  And I wouldn't wish anyone ill, but if Sean Spicer were indeed to find himself unable to get the big job that he wanted to parlay this into, it would really say something about Washington writ large and the Trump administration that there is, you know -- we always joke about Washington that there are always second acts in politics.  I mean, look at Newt Gingrich, he resigned in amidst of scandal and shame and he's back as a major commentator on politics.</p><p>And this -- if this is -- this would show that there is a limit.  That there some things like lying to the American public that are a bridge too far.</p><p>KING:  On the broader question of Hollywood versus Trump, I just want to say this, Kellyanne Conway this morning saying, go away.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT:  They've got pluck and polished and whacked and someone who didn't eat for two months and offer what?  To sound the same and they have a right to speak, but if you are tuning in to watch -- if you're American you're tuning in to watch your favorite actors and actresses and shows -- and I used to do it routinely as a kid.  Who is going to win?  And she lost and I love her show.  There is very little of that.  It's between the Emmys, the Miss America pageant was politicized.  Our sports are very politicized and it looks like the ratings are suffering.  It looks like America is responding by tuning out because they want you to stick to your knitting.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING:  I'm told the initial ratings were down from last night.  If that holds up in the final ratings, how long until the President tweets that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KING:  They have plucked and polished and wax and some didn't eat for two months.  That's a pretty priceless.</p><p>All right, we got to go.  Thanks for watching us in Inside Politics. We'll see you back here tomorrow.  President Trump set to meet with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next hour.  Wolf Blitzer picks up that important coverage after a quick break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[Byline: John King] [Guest: Julie Pace, Jackie Calmes, Ken Vogel, Perry Bacon, Karoun Demirjian] [High: Special counsel Robert Mueller and his team are now in possession of Russian-linked ads run on Facebook during the presidential election, after they obtained a search warrant for the information.

The Special Counsel investigation into Russian election meddling now reaching inside social media giant, Facebook. Sources confirming to CNN, Robert Mueller's team has obtained a search warrant compelling Facebookto surrender information about campaign-related ads bought by account that now been linked back to the Russian government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's why this could really matter. To get such a sweeping warrant, prosecutors need to demonstrate probable cause of a crime. It's illegal for a foreign national to interfere in the U.S. election and it would be a crime if any U.S. citizen worked colluded with them, for example, to offer political advice like with issues and states. Those ads should target.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So this is a, A, it's big deal anyway to have a private company like Facebook, have the Special Counsel come knocking saying, turn over the records. And now you get into this whole question, this collusion question and the idea is the Trump campaign will tell you. Their team dragged about their use of digital space particularly Facebookin the final weeks of the campaign they think is what turned Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Now the question is, if this Russian accounts, Russian bought ads were in the same places, coincidence or not?</p><p>JULIE PACE, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPODENT, ASSOCIATED PRESS: Well, I mean, it's a huge open question I think at this point, but this is what the Mueller team is after right now. We've been in this space with the Russian investigations where you've had a lot of rumors floating around, a lot of ticky-tack things out there.</p><p>This is pretty serious. This is a big deal not just for this investigation. It's a big deal for future U.S. elections. And Facebook, the company that has been pretty opaque in their political dealings, pretty opaque in terms of how their ads are purchased, who they deal with there. So the consequences of this, not just for the Mueller investigation but broadly for politics, for big tech and its relationship with Washington are -- could be hugely consequential.</p><p>JACKIE CALMES, WHIT HOUSE EDITOR, LOS ANGELES TIMES: That's right. I mean, we're into the mid-term cycle now which is a hugely consequential mid-term. I mean, most of them are, but this one really is and with the control of Congress at stake in the mid-term of the <person><nameText>Trump administration. </nameText></person>So, it's really -- you know, you have to wonder what's going on now that is going undetected. They were so successful apparently in the 2016 election.</p><p>KING: It's a great point both for the -- any campaign regulatory agencies and the social media giants in the idea that what do you have to do to more properly vet --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right.</p><p>KING: -- when you're taking money from, where is that money coming from. It's hard, you say about its fake account, it's hard, but it's doable. That's one of the challenges.</p><p>I want to go out for another piece of the story, dramatic story of the New York Times today about two of the President's lawyers sitting outdoors in a Washington D.C. steak house talking about the strategy in dealing with the special counsel investigation we just talked to. Talking about debates within the team about how cooperatively, debates within the team about transparent it could be.</p><p>Let's listen to the New York Times reporter who was sitting as close as I I'm to you, Jackie, Ken Vogel. The President's lawyers are there. He's, hance, at the next table and he hears this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEN VOGEL, REPORTER, NEW YORK TIMES: As I sat there by myself at this table taking notes on my iPhone, they preceded to discuss --</p><p>UNIDETIFIED FEMALE: Wow.</p><p>VOGEL: -- some of the, you know, the most sensitive of the sensitive area in way that was very easily audible to me and allowed for us to get at some of these issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[12:35:09] KING: Among the things they are talking is how cooperative to be. And there's a picture of the two attorneys. They're talking about (INAUDIBLE) sitting at the table at a D.C. steak house, very recognizable men, very well-known in the legal community, political community here in Washington D.C. The restaurant happens to be steps from the New York Times Washington Bureau. Smart choice.</p><p>The issues includes disagreements about how cooperative and transparent to be with Robert Mueller, the Special Counsel, whether to actually give him documents even before he ask for them or to wait and make sure only give him what he exactly asks for. At one point, they said that Don McGhan, the White House Counsel, the President's White House Attorney had documents locked in a safe. Now, we don't know what that means, but for two, the President's lawyers to be having a debate about strategy and to say that publicly is nuts.</p><p>PERRY BACON, SENIOR POLITICAL WRITER, FIVETHIRTYEIGHT: The idea that it's in a restaurant, of course, bad form, (INAUDIBLE) and that kind of thing. But I think the core that they're talking about is a real big issue is, are they going to cooperate or not. This is where coming out Mueller is I feel like going for the kill (INAUDIBLE). He is really pushing pretty hard inside the White House.</p><p>And, you know, (INAUDIBLE) the question of, will the White House cooperate, will documents going to be turned over in (INAUDIBLE). So, now you're here, we're ultimately, this will going to come and it looks like a fight over executive privilege, over about with documents given this and become a place where this will be the politics that's really hard here. What is Trump going to do with this investigation that could really change and may be harm obviously in his presidency.</p><p>His lawyers are not feel that threat and they're talking about which documents to hand over or which not, which tells you the level of stories here that were coming to.</p><p>KAROUN DEMIRJIAN, REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST: And even what they've exposed also is a question -- it opens the question of whether other people in the White House will be now brought into Mueller's probe. When you are in a -- yes, there is a turning point from this, but it's not exactly the same when you are an, you know, employee of the White House and you see. They could now be brought in especially if there is, you know, credible evidence spoken out of the mouths of lawyers themselves, that there may be documents in the state for other things there. You may see some of these other people getting pulled into the probe now which complicates the legal defense for the Trump team and even more.</p><p>BACON: And with the White House.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KING: There's a paragraph of the story about the fear inside the White House trepidation about this, inside the White House, that there are some people think that some of the colleagues might be wearing a wire, were wearing a wire for Bob Mueller. I mean, that -- again, great going to work every day, right?</p><p>CALMES: Well, and we saw some of that during the investigations on the second Clinton term.</p><p>KING: Right.</p><p>CALMES: But not like that. I mean, this is a far more serious. That went to the personnel --</p><p>BACON: Conduct.</p><p>CALMES: -- conduct of the President. This goes to the entire campaign and potential colluding with an adversary.</p><p>KING: And potential, emphasis potential, potential with Special Counsel looking into obstruction by the President --</p><p>CALMES: Right, exactly.</p><p>KING: -- of the United States, it's not the candidate. DEMIRJIAN: But exactly it is potential and if we -- you know, if McGhan is right that there's nothing there and that's why he should be handing over more documents because it will show the President (INAUDIBLE) anything wrong. They are creating --</p><p>KING: Could be unlocking the safe, it's not locking the safe.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: Definitely. But again, I mean, if this -- and this means something that is a self-constructed nightmare that didn't need to be there, then why?</p><p>CALMES: Why did you say quickly -- I mean, nothing about what the lawyers reportedly said to each other surprised me really. And Don McGhan, it is his job as a White House counsel, not to represent the President individually, but to represent the office of the President. So he has to be concern about President set.</p><p>What surprised me about this is that they were saying this. I worked in the New York Times Bureau for nine years. I had many lunches at DOT. There, or any place out, I always looked around the room to see who was there before I talked. And the fact that the two lawyers didn't is astounding.</p><p>KING: Common sense. That's one is interesting to watch. We've seen the President blow off his legal team in the past. We'll see how this story sets with the President today.</p><p>Up next, it seems the President spend a lot of time on Twitter this weekend. But was it presidential tweets, including the rocket man. Next.</p><p>[12:43:03] KING: Moments ago, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>tweeting his praise for the United Nations Secretary General saying, \"We commend Antonio Guterres and his call for the U.N. to focus more on people and less on bureaucracy.\" Compare that to this weekend. We know the President spent a good part of his weekend preparing for that U.N. meeting and other speeches sessions at the U.N. general assembly. The big speech is tomorrow.</p><p>The President also took some time to indulge in one of his favorite pastimes. An early morning Twitter spree, among his many tweets and retweets, he shared this. \"I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night. Asked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad.\"</p><p>He also retweeted a video, heavily edited, to look like he's hitting <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>with a golf ball. You see that there. This from a man who once promised this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: At some point, I'm going to be so presidential that you people will be so bored.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: Waiting. Waiting. Still waiting. I want to distinguish between the two in that people foreign policy establishment will cringe a bit when you call Kim Jong-un, \"rocket man.\" I think most Americans probably get the President a grace to say that's the way he wants to say it, that's just fine.</p><p>The video where you show, he retweets a video edited by a pro-Trump Twitter feed upon hitting a golf ball that hits the Secretary of State Democratic presidential candidate in the back of the head and she falls. That was stripping into since she hit. People yesterday took some laughter on the Sunday program is people thinking that, you know, we thought that was funny. That part is not funny. That part is not funny.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KING: He's the President of the United States. If your kid did this, your kid would be punished.</p><p>BACON: I put that talking about, you know, (INAUDIBLE) in the Twitter and how bad it was his tweets about women in particular are bad.</p><p>KING: Given his history of -- you're right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BACON: This is bad. The first one is maybe a little funny. You can't fix the North Korea problems that he sort of venting act like a little bit, but the Hillary one is awful.</p><p>[12:45:06] DEMIRJIAN: Yes. Both of them were not good. I think the North Korean one -- I mean, the Hillary one is really bad form. The North Korea one has potential implications that are very, very \"geopolitically disastrous,\" right. Kim Jong-un probably thinks it's cool to be called rocket man to the extent. This is a guy who invite Dennis Rodman to hang out and, you know, in his country.</p><p>Anything that kind of gives him a little bit of levity in the situation makes it somehow less serious and it's extremely serious situation that they cannot find a way to cut through. This is not going to make China turn around and start to, you know, extinctions pressure and everything else like that on North Korea.</p><p>KING: To that point, again, I think a lot of people in the country with the President more grace, and his supporters probably like the golf video too some in many way. But to the idea that the timing too, the timing, is this about to go to the United Nations, a lot of people trying to figure out, you know, Twitter Trump versus teleprompter Trump versus what the staff says, he really wants to do and he does something like this.</p><p>CALMES: Well, you know, and this was weekend where the White House said he was preparing for this big week at the U.N. And when you think of all the many issues in the world that he could have been studying up on, instead that tweet of him hitting his former rival with a golf ball was tweeted by someone else of -- well, shall we just say, of questionable reputation. And what is the President of the United States doing indulging in those kind of tweets, didn't he have more to do this weekend than to be -- and not only seeing them, but retweeting them.</p><p>KING: And if National Security advisers on national television, he's a combat veteran, he's a general, he's a man with a distinguished record serving his country and he has to defend the President of the United State's tweets than he even he knows --</p><p>PACE: About rocket man and Hillary. And it comes at a time when his aides were trying to, you know, were seen on Friday where they're talking about the U.N. and talking about how he's going to be very serious and how he's taking these meetings, you know, how he's taking them seriously and going to present a good front for the United States for the world. They cringe too. I mean, you have to be up front about this.</p><p>It's not just us in the media. His own aides cringe when he decide to things happen because then they have to go out and defend it. And I think we can also again wipe away any notion that <person><nameText>John Kelly </nameText></person>and any new structure in White House is going to end this. It's just not.</p><p>KING: It moderate at a time it seems but ending it no. Everybody hold their breath. Up next, the Hollywood rituals, dresses that cost more than your car. And now barbwire (ph) jokes about the President.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[12:51:38] STEPHEN COLBERT, THE LATE SHOW HOST, CBS: Is there anyone who can say how big the audience is? Sean, do you know?</p><p><person><nameText>SEAN SPICER, </nameText></person>FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmy's period both in person and around the world.</p><p>COLBERT: Wow. That really soothes my fragile ego.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: We haven't heard, there it was right there. A new twist on an old line. <person><nameText>Sean Spicer </nameText></person>rolling out on the stage. It may have been the biggest surprise last night. The biggest star unquestionably the President Hollywood loves the most.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS, ACTRESS, \"VEEP\": We did have a whole story line about an impeachment but we abandoned that because they were worried that someone else might get to it at first.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: The President's approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes you might say once flat long ago. But even some of the comedians who rose them for a living, some of them acknowledge the jokes are starting to feel a little tired.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES CORDEN, HOST, \"THE LATE LATE SHOW\": And your show has been -- that thing you say about Trump being ban, so fresh. So fresh.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: It was interesting. It is interesting. There's no question. The Hollywood largely liberal establishment does not like the current Republican President of the United States. They also know that he likes to be liked. And so they know that when they do this, it gets in his face. Does it matter? That he is so permeated pop culture this way.</p><p>PACE: Well it's interesting that Trump did not respond.</p><p>KING: Right.</p><p>PACE: It was like the Oscars when he was almost tweeting in realtime.</p><p>KING: Merrill Streep, one of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KING: Yes.</p><p>(OFF-MIC)</p><p>PACE: Look, to me, there's a difference between the jokes about Trump and then the joke with Spicer. Maybe people will think that I'm being humorless about this but I don't think it's funny to have a press secretary basically acknowledging that they were lying from the White House podium. It's not funny. That has real damaging consequences.</p><p>KING: Well, it's an interesting conversation. The conversation in this town because people wonder if <person><nameText>Sean Spicer </nameText></person>redeems himself and gets a job in politics from public relations. If you look at social media last night, a lot of Trump critics and a lot of liberals were mad at the own liberal Hollywood establishment saying do not help rehabilitate this man.</p><p>I would say this, number one, I know firsthand from friends in the town, <person><nameText>Sean Spicer </nameText></person>is having a really hard time getting his -- these are people reach out to some of the bigger firms here in town and the answer is been thanks, but no thanks. Number two, he was the joke. And I know some people don't find it funny, but yes, he got a moment, yes, he got to mingle with the stars, yes he got to the party and drink beer and take selfie with stars but his moment on stage was he was the joke.</p><p>BACON: And one probably the worst moment of a press secretary that I can remember. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right.</p><p>BACON: That January 21st, well always remember that, one of the worst moments any press secretaries (INAUDIBLE) it was a joke. I'm not sure it helps them move on to the next stage. He has been in the Republican Party a long time we have known it for a long time. So, I assume he wants to get back into something like politics. I don't know if that will be easy or hard, but he sort of -- I assume-- trying to make fun of himself in stage (ph). Look, like Julie said, those big moments when you talk about April Ryan, those were not particularly funny or redeeming moments.</p><p>PACE: Being in an administration is supposed to be able to get a golden ticket to get a job after in administration, right, and then cash out. But if you sold your integrity to an extent, you know, that is, I guess a warning for anybody that might follow that making some more decisions.</p><p>[12:55:12] CALMES: Right. And I wouldn't wish anyone ill, but if <person><nameText>Sean Spicer </nameText></person>were indeed to find himself unable to get the big job that he wanted to parlay this into, it would really say something about Washington writ large and the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>that there is, you know -- we always joke about Washington that there are always second acts in politics. I mean, look at Newt Gingrich, he resigned in amidst of scandal and shame and he's back as a major commentator on politics.</p><p>And this -- if this is -- this would show that there is a limit. That there some things like lying to the American public that are a bridge too far.</p><p>KING: On the broader question of Hollywood versus Trump, I just want to say this, Kellyanne Conway this morning saying, go away.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: They've got pluck and polished and whacked and someone who didn't eat for two months and offer what? To sound the same and they have a right to speak, but if you are tuning in to watch -- if you're American you're tuning in to watch your favorite actors and actresses and shows -- and I used to do it routinely as a kid. Who is going to win? And she lost and I love her show. There is very little of that. It's between the Emmys, the Miss America pageant was politicized. Our sports are very politicized and it looks like the ratings are suffering. It looks like America is responding by tuning out because they want you to stick to your knitting.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: I'm told the initial ratings were down from last night. If that holds up in the final ratings, how long until the President tweets that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KING: They have plucked and polished and wax and some didn't eat for two months. That's a pretty priceless.</p><p>All right, we got to go. Thanks for watching us in Inside Politics. We'll see you back here tomorrow. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>set to meet with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next hour. Wolf Blitzer picks up that important coverage after a quick break.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2017091802CNV15</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PHD-3HV1-JB20-G2SH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3290\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 18, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000262S</classCode><className>ASSOCIATED PRESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009SVI</classCode><className>LOS ANGELES TIMES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And the former special counsel has just added to it with a last-minute request that his deputy be sworn in alongside him.</p><p>A source says the deputy is expected to provide advice but not to testify. Feverish preparations are underway for the back-to-back hearings by the House Judiciary Committee and the Intelligence Committee. Judiciary Democrats want to explore alleged obstruction by the president while the Intelligence Committee will focus in on Russia's interference in the 2016 election.</p><p>The Justice Department has instructed Mueller not to stray beyond the boundaries of his report. For the dozens of Democrats who are pushing for an impeachment inquiry, this could be a do or die moment.</p><p>For Republicans, it could be a chance to shut the door on the Russia probe while President Trump is showing signs of agitation, once again speaking of a witch hunt. I'll speak with Democratic presidential candidate New York mayor Bill de Blasio, along with Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi of the Intelligence Committee and our correspondents will have full coverage of the top stories.</p><p>First, let's go straight to our senior congressional correspondent, Manu Raju.</p><p>Robert Mueller, Manu, has made a last-minute request to have his deputy sworn in to appear at his side in tomorrow's hearings.</p><p>What are you learning?</p><p>MANU RAJU, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, big drama in this months-long negotiations to bring in the special counsel after the Democrats were told by the special counsel's team that he wanted Aaron Zebley, his deputy, to be sworn in alongside him.</p><p>Republicans objected, saying this was a last-minute change and they said this was not the way that this was agreed to initially.</p><p>But we're now told by sources familiar with the matter that Zebley will, in fact, be there but not sworn in. He'll be sitting alongside the special counsel to provide advice and counsel to Robert Mueller as he gets questions for hours tomorrow in a public setting before the House Judiciary Committee, followed by the House Intelligence Committee.</p><p>But for hours today, there were questions about exactly what would happen in this very high-stakes hearing with millions of people watching. The chairman of the committee just told us moments ago the hearing will undoubtedly go on and he explained how the format will take place.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RAJU: Is the hearing going to go on tomorrow?</p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: The hearing is going to go on tomorrow.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA), CHAIR, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: We want this hearing to be about Director Mueller. We are in discussions with them about the role of his counsel and those discussions are ongoing. I expect that he will be there.</p><p>But we would like to make sure that, to the degree that he participates, that it may be on technical issues or other matters, we don't want him as a substitute for Mueller's voice.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAJU: Now right now in the door, right next to me, the House Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee are having a mock hearing to go through exactly their lines of questioning for the special counsel tomorrow.</p><p>They are trying to narrow down their lines of questioning to a handful of areas that they believe will be digestible to the American public. roughly five areas of potential obstruction of justice involving the president's effort to allegedly fire the special counsel, to allegedly limit the scope of the investigation to exclude him as well as potential witness tampering that the president appears to have been involved in, according to the Mueller report.</p><p>Those questions will take shape tomorrow. Republicans have a different plan. They want to poke holes in the credibility of the special counsel's team, raise questions about alleged bias by --</p><p>[17:05:00]</p><p>RAJU: -- the special counsel, so all the negotiations of the format really just a preview of tomorrow's very dramatic testimony, as Democrats hope this reshapes the narrative and the public understanding about alleged criminal conduct in the White House.</p><p>But others are downplaying the impact this will have and Republicans hoping it does what the president has hoped, to show, in his view, that he was exonerated.</p><p>BLITZER: Manu Raju on Capitol Hill. Stand by. I want to bring in our crime and justice reporter, Shimon Prokupecz.</p><p>Shimon, why is Mueller insisting on having his deputy by his side?</p><p>SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN CRIME AND JUSTICE PRODUCER: Quite honestly, for me, it seems that they want to protect Mueller whichever way they can, they want to give him cover. So they're hoping to have -- they were hoping to have him sit there and answer some of the questions that the committee members were going to have.</p><p>And what we're seeing here from the letter yesterday that the Department of Justice published, from Mueller asking for guidance about what he can testify to, what he can't testify to. And now we have word that Mueller wants his deputy -- yes, he was a special counsel there -- sitting next to him, wanted him answering questions.</p><p>The committee said no. That is not going to happen. It all seems to be every effort possible from all sides, certainly from the Mueller folks, that they want to protect Robert Mueller from what's going to happen tomorrow from the Republicans.</p><p>And it could also be from the Democrats. There's going to be a lot of tough questions posed to him from the Democrats and it seems that by all accounts, everyone wants to protect Mueller.</p><p>A spokesperson for Mueller did release this statement. He said that Aaron Zebley was the deputy special counsel and had the day-to-day oversight of the investigation conducted by the office. He will accompany special counsel Mueller to the Wednesday hearing as was discussed with the committees more than a week ago.</p><p>They're saying this was no surprise to them. We'll see what happens.</p><p>BLITZER: So was it a last-minute decision on the part of Mueller?</p><p>PROKUPECZ: This is what they're saying.</p><p>But why are we just learning of this today?</p><p>It is not entirely clear. It's the same reason, why did we just learn of the letter yesterday from the Department of Justice, that Mueller was seeking guidance about what he can and can't testify to?</p><p>It all seems like everyone right now wants to protect Robert Mueller from about what is to happen tomorrow. It's going to be A lot of tough questions and they're trying to insulate him. It is the only reason you would want someone else, I think, sitting next to him.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes, clearly a lot after stake right now. Shimon, stand by as well.</p><p>President Trump appears to be on the edge ahead of Mueller's testimony. Let's go to our White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins.</p><p>The stakes are clearly very high for the president.</p><p>KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: And officials back here at the White House have been downplaying the upcoming testimony tomorrow. But behind the scenes they're paying close attention to what will happen tomorrow, including the last-minute drama you just heard from Manu and Shimon, as the president himself sounds irritated that the man who has been leading this investigation is now going to be front and center in front of the cameras.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COLLINS (voice-over): On the eve of Robert Mueller's Capitol Hill testimony... TRUMP: How about this whole witch hunt?</p><p>COLLINS (voice-over): -- the White House is bracing for impact.</p><p>TRUMP: First of all, it is very bad for our country.</p><p>COLLINS (voice-over): Tonight, sources telling CNN, President Trump has spent the last several days discussing Mueller's upcoming appearance and he seems more irritated than anxious than he is to watch the man who has loomed over his presidency take center stage.</p><p>TRUMP: I saw Mueller is to testify tomorrow. Yes. How many times? Two and a half years --</p><p>COLLINS (voice-over): Trump has been quizzing people about what to expect while complaining that Democrats will never let the investigation go.</p><p>TRUMP: They think this is helping them.</p><p>COLLINS (voice-over): His Republican allies are assuring him, it won't change a thing.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): I've heard all I need to hear from Mueller.</p><p>COLLINS (voice-over): But even if Mueller reveals nothing new, sources say Trump wants to expose the investigation as the hoax he believes it is.</p><p>TRUMP: Actually, it started practically from the time I came down on the escalator.</p><p>COLLINS (voice-over): Trump tweeting that Republicans should turn the tables by asking why were all of Clinton's people given immunity and why were the text messages of Peter S. and his lover, Lisa Page, deleted or destroyed right after they left Mueller and after we requested them?</p><p>TRUMP: I'm not going to be watching -- probably -- maybe I'll see a little bit of it.</p><p>COLLINS (voice-over): And while Mueller will be front and center in front of the cameras, Trump's schedule is currently wide open.</p><p>The focus on Mueller in Washington may help a budget deal that's facing blowback from fiscal conservatives, pass through Congress and win the president's signature. Congressional leaders and White House officials are working overtime to sell the deal that raises spending levels by $320 billion over the next two years.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: It is a pretty good deal under the circumstances. That is the way I would put it.</p><p>COLLINS (voice-over): And with an eye on 2020, the president is ramping up his attacks on four Democratic freshman congresswomen. TRUMP: This Tlaib, Tlaib -- from Michigan, right? That is a great state. We won Michigan.</p><p>COLLINS (voice-over): Telling a group of young conservatives Tuesday, Rashida Tlaib is --</p><p>[17:10:00]</p><p>COLLINS (voice-over): -- a lunatic after a video of her shouting at a Trump event in 2016 resurfaces.</p><p>TRUMP: She's vicious. She's like a crazed lunatic. She's screaming.</p><p>COLLINS (voice-over): But Trump making clear the attacks are part of a bigger political strategy.</p><p>TRUMP: Socialism is not as easy to beat as you think.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COLLINS: Now Wolf, Robert Mueller's first hearing will get kicked off around 8:30 tomorrow morning, which sources say is long before the president typically arrives in the West Wing. He's usually still in the residence, reading the newspapers, watching television, making phone calls.</p><p>The only other thing right now on his schedule is a lunch with the vice president before he goes to West Virginia tomorrow night for a fundraiser. We'll likely hear from him as he's on his way out of the White House.</p><p>BLITZER: I suspect we will. Kaitlan, thank you.</p><p>Joining us now, Democratic Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, a member of the Intelligence Committee.</p><p>Congressman, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>Do you have any reservations, first of all, about letting Mueller's deputy, Aaron Zebley, to testify alongside him?</p><p>REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): My understanding is that he will not necessarily testify but he be there so that Robert Mueller can occasionally seek his advice.</p><p>But I hope that we're not going to be interrupted by consultations as much as Mr. Mueller has a chance to kind of speak his mind and tell us what is in the report and why it matters.</p><p>BLITZER: Will Aaron Zebley be formally sworn in as a witness or will he just sit there as an aide to the former special counsel and whisper in his ear from time to time?</p><p>KRISHNAMOORTHI: I'm not sure. I think that is being hashed out right now. But it appears he will be at least accessible to Mr. Mueller. BLITZER: Your colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee plan to focus their questions on issues surrounding potential obstruction of justice by the president. Your committee, the Intelligence Committee, will focus in on Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p><p>What is the biggest question you have for the former special counsel on that front?</p><p>KRISHNAMOORTHI: I've several questions but I think the biggest question is, what did he find and what does it matter?</p><p>Especially with regard to the Trump campaign having advance knowledge of this interference that was about to happen in 2016, then welcoming it and then using the product of that interference, having numerous contacts with Russians, which they didn't report to the FBI or law enforcement, and then finally covering it up.</p><p>So we'll be asking Mr. Mueller about all of those things, plus did he look at the counterintelligence aspects of the links, the 140-plus links between the Trump campaign and Russia, even if it didn't amount to a criminal conspiracy?</p><p>BLITZER: Because as you know, the Mueller report concluded on the sensitive issue of collusion or whatever you want to call it -- he doesn't use the word collusion -- the report said, \"The evidence was not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with representatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.\"</p><p>That is a significant statement, which I assume Mueller is going to repeat tomorrow.</p><p>KRISHNAMOORTHI: He will likely do that. But on the other hand, there were so many links, just take one example, Trump Tower Moscow, where the president repeatedly said he had nothing to do with Russia.</p><p>Meanwhile Michael Cohen, his personal attorney, was negotiating a deal to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.</p><p>And the reason why that is significant is that if the Russians know that the president is not telling the truth, they could use that information to compromise him. And that is very serious and that is the source of counterintelligence concerns in this investigation.</p><p>BLITZER: The Department of Justice has instructed Mueller to stick to his report, the 448-page report.</p><p>Will that significantly impact the questions that you guys, the lawmakers, will ask Mueller?</p><p>KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, as you know, he's not necessarily confined to that report, despite what DOJ is asking and we are not necessarily confined in asking questions.</p><p>That being said, I think that we will be very happy to hear him talk about what is in the report, because him giving voice to those findings will likely be the first time that much of the audience, who has not read the report, will actually hear what it is about.</p><p>As you know, this is kind of like a lot more people have seen the movie \"The Godfather\" rather than read the book.</p><p>BLITZER: Should Mueller ignore the instructions from the Justice Department?</p><p>KRISHNAMOORTHI: I think that -- look, he is a man of high integrity and honor. He's a patriot. I think he has to do what is right. If the Justice Department and Bill Barr are somehow instructing him not to talk about certain things, even though he should talk about them at the hearing, then he should do what is right and answer the --</p><p>[17:15:00]</p><p>KRISHNAMOORTHI: -- questions because at the end of the day, this is about protecting our country and our national security as well.</p><p>BLITZER: Eighty-eight Democrats so far on the House support beginning formal impeachment proceedings against the president. You're not among them.</p><p>Could Mueller's testimony tomorrow change your mind?</p><p>KRISHNAMOORTHI: Possibly. He's one person who commands a tremendous amount of stature and credibility and, depending on what he says, a lot of people's minds could be changed tomorrow. And so that is why I think tomorrow's hearing is so important and that is why I think so many people are going to watch it as well.</p><p>BLITZER: Some Democrats hope Mueller's testimony will certainly bring his report to life, as you say.</p><p>But do you worry, Congressman, it could backfire and instead give the president potentially fresh ammunition, that the investigation is over and it is time for the country to move on?</p><p>KRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't think so. I think that the conclusions of the report were so significant and such a small portion of the country has actually read the report that I think tomorrow, it is going to be about educating the public and I think a lot more people will understand the import and the significance of what he found.</p><p>And hopefully, that will be an impetus for action as well in protecting our 2020 elections from similar interference by Russia and our other adversaries.</p><p>BLITZER: We'll of course have special coverage all day tomorrow. Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>KRISHNAMOORTHI: Thank you, Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: Up next, with the next round of debates only a week away here on CNN, I'll speak live with Democratic presidential candidate New York City mayor Bill de Blasio. There you see him. And President Trump is showing signs of irritation just ahead of Robert Mueller testimony, calling the Russia investigation once again a witch hunt and asking allies what to expect from the hearing.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>[17:20:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>BLITZER: Breaking news: we're following the last-minute scramble on Capitol Hill as the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees prepare to question the former special counsel, Robert Mueller. President Trump is described as irritated about the public testimony.</p><p>With us here in THE SITUATION ROOM, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, he's running for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination.</p><p>Mayor, thank you very much for coming in.</p><p>MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D), NEW YORK CITY, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Thank you, Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: So what are you expecting from Mueller's testimony tomorrow?</p><p>DE BLASIO: I think we'll hear the truth. I think Mueller is a guy that actually is respected across this country and, at the press conference, he was trying to tell us something more. That was clear. So I think some of the questions will give us an opportunity here, maybe a deeper thinking.</p><p>BLITZER: So what specifically would you want him to answer?</p><p>What do you want to learn tomorrow?</p><p>What do you think the American public should be hearing?</p><p>DE BLASIO: I think the obvious question; if it were not for the restrictions that he was told were placed on him, would he have seen a path to prosecution?</p><p>And I think the report -- I mean, from my read of it, the answer is yes. But I think they're going to try to get him to say it out loud.</p><p>BLITZER: Because the Department of Justice guidelines is a sitting president can't be indicted. You're raising questions about that guideline?</p><p>DE BLASIO: It makes no sense. It doesn't fit with American values and American history.</p><p>How can one person be above the law? You know, we read about this in other countries, where folks want to be president or prime minister to avoid prosecution. You don't think of that in the case of the United States of America. We think of what happened to Richard Nixon as an example of the system working and finding corruption to do something about it.</p><p>It made no sense that Mueller's hands were tied and I think the committee and the American people will want to hear him say out loud, if he had his druthers, what would he do?</p><p>BLITZER: The Department of Justice guideline is a sitting president can't be charged or indicted but the House of Representatives can begin impeachment proceedings against a sitting President of the United States. So you support that.</p><p>DE BLASIO: Yes.</p><p>BLITZER: But most of the Democrats in the House of Representatives still oppose formal impeachment proceedings, at least at this point.</p><p>DE BLASIO: Wolf, the straw that broke the camel's back for me was that Oval Office interview, where the president invited hostile nations to share dirt on his opponents with him, invited treason, in effect.</p><p>And I saw that and I said, wait a minute, this guy is -- you know, he's been extreme in so many ways but that goes beyond anything that is acceptable in America. We've got to start the impeachment process. The evidence has to come out.</p><p>But the American people have to be convinced during that process. And I also say, as a Democrat, Democrats should not only talk about impeachment; I fear sometimes they do too much. Talk about the issues of working people to show we're doing the work that Americans sent us to do, not just talk.</p><p>BLITZER: Because a lot of the Democratic leadership fears exactly what you are saying, focusing on Trump, Trump, Trump, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, you're ignoring all the substantive issues, like health care, infrastructure, stuff like that, that has to be worked out.</p><p>DE BLASIO: And it is a real danger. Now I do want to give the House credit. They passed the $15 minimum wage in the last days and they showed the willingness to act on something that is an actual kitchen table issue that affects everyday people, working people. That is good.</p><p>But they got to keep that balance all of the time. Keep talking about those kitchen table issues that affect everyday Americans, if it is just impeachment --</p><p>[17:25:00]</p><p>DE BLASIO: -- I think a lot of voters will say, whoa, whoa, whoa, this is not about us. And one of the things that I'm working on is to push this Democratic Party of mine to talk about working people, which, bluntly has not been the Democratic agenda for a long time, to actually talk things like that $15 minimum wage, how to make sure that people have decent working conditions, some time off each year, some paid vacation, which millions of Americans don't have, the right to keep your job.</p><p>And if you're challenged by a boss, actually having some due process, just cause termination, not just whatever the boss thinks. These are the things -- and I put it in this workers' bill of rights, this is what the election could be about for Democrats.</p><p>And in 2016 we lost a lot of working people because they didn't hear Democrats talking about their lives, what it meant for them to try to make ends meet. If Democrats this time talk about working people, I think you'll see a very different result.</p><p>BLITZER: We'll find out fairly soon. Let me get your thoughts on the president making it clear that he's going to continue his attack on these four progressive Democratic congresswomen, all of color. It is part of his political strategy that seems to be emerging, looking ahead to the 2020 presidential election. He wants them to be the face of your party.</p><p>What do you say about that?</p><p>DE BLASIO: It is a clear tactic to try to distract people from the more central issues. In the end, voters do vote according to those kitchen table issues and here is my argument.</p><p>Trump goes after those four women, demonizes them and tries to create a racial divide and tries to blame immigrants for all the problems in the country, all the problems that regular, everyday, working-class, middle class Americans are suffering, when, in fact, the truth is, the challenges everyday people are facing, they are caused by those in power, they are caused by Wall Street, they're caused by the big corporations.</p><p>And people are angry, Wolf. They're really angry about their circumstances. It came out in 2016. In frustration, folks voted for Donald Trump, who probably disagreed with him on a lot of things but they thought maybe he'll shake things up.</p><p>Democrats cannot let that happen again. Trump is succeeding if he manages to demonize these women and Democrats do not come back and say, no, that is not acceptable.</p><p>And in fact what Trump is really doing is baiting and switching, giving away the store to the 1 percent and trying to distract people from it.</p><p>BLITZER: Let me get your thoughts on a very sensitive issue that occurred in New York City. The president the other day once again directly blamed Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for scuttling the new Amazon project in New York City that the president said would have created so many jobs.</p><p>You were a champion of that deal until it fell apart. Listen to what the president said about the congresswoman.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: One of them kept Amazon out of New York. Tens of thousands of jobs and would have been a great thing and she kept Amazon from going -- it would have been a good deal. I mean, pretty have made better maybe. But tens of thousands of jobs and New York has not been the same since that happened. It has really hurt New York and New York City.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: He's a New Yorker and you're a New Yorker.</p><p>What is your response to the president?</p><p>DE BLASIO: He was a New Yorker.</p><p>BLITZER: He still has got a place in New York.</p><p>DE BLASIO: Yes. And I'm sure he's welcome back when this is over. So the bottom line, Wolf, he's wrong on pretty much every score. The New York City economy is strong; we've been adding jobs since Amazon made their decision and that is the crucial point. Amazon made the decision.</p><p>BLITZER: But do you blame her in part --</p><p>DE BLASIO: No.</p><p>BLITZER: -- for Amazon -- because she was one of those urging Amazon to get out of New York City. She thought it would hurt the working class.</p><p>DE BLASIO: She was wrong in my opinion. And I said that at the time because it was a plan that would have brought us tens of thousands of jobs and a huge amount of tax revenue that we could have done things with.</p><p>BLITZER: But it is a major setback for New York City. On that you agree with the president.</p><p>DE BLASIO: Yes. But I disagree with the way he thinks it went down. Amazon walked away. We had a deal and they walked away from the deal.</p><p>BLITZER: But you understand why they walked away, given all the political pressure?</p><p>DE BLASIO: I don't buy it. I don't buy it.</p><p>BLITZER: Because there were so many other communities across the country --</p><p>DE BLASIO: No.</p><p>BLITZER: -- that were dying for Amazon to -- DE BLASIO: They made a deal and they walked away. It is not even her congressional district. So I disagree with what she assumed about the deal. But let's put the horse before the cart.</p><p>Amazon had a deal; everything was moving along and, in the dead of night, they just said, we're out of here. I don't put that on her. I put that on them.</p><p>But it was a lost opportunity for the communities that would have benefited, for sure. New York City is doing just fine, nonetheless. We have 4.5 million jobs. We're doing just fine.</p><p>BLITZER: Let's talk about the former Vice President Joe Biden, arguably the front-runner still right now. He released his criminal justice reform plan. I don't know if you've had a chance to go through it but it is already being criticized by several of your colleagues, including New Jersey senator Cory Booker, who said, \"Biden's policy falls short of the transformative change our broken criminal justice system needs.\"</p><p>Do you see short comings in Biden's plan?</p><p>DE BLASIO: Sure. And the bigger problem with Joe Biden is that he's associated with so many things that have backfired on everyday Americans.</p><p>[17:30:00] So that criminal justice plan -- he led the way in the crime bill in the '90s and it backfired and it helped create mass incarceration.</p><p>He was a strong backer of NAFTA. We lost a million manufacturing jobs. NAFTA is coming back again. How are people going to trust if it's Joe Biden that he's not going to make the same mistake again?</p><p>Here's a guy who voted for the Iraq war. I respect his service to the country, but he has to answer these concerns because how is it believable?</p><p>We got to take on Donald Trump who's a very tough customer. We got to beat him by showing we are the party of change, that we're actually going to change the lives of working Americans. The Democratic Party is not entirely believable to a lot of working-class and middle-class Americans. We've got to show them something different.</p><p>How is Joe Biden going to say he's anything but the candidate of the status quo? He had a big fundraiser in New York. It was well reported, he invited the media in. And he literally said to some of the richest people in New York City, don't worry, nothing's going to change if I'm president. How is that going to tell working people that they should have any faith in the Democrats then?</p><p>BLITZER: So, at the CNN debate in Detroit, you're going to be on the stage with the -- with Vice President Biden. You're going to look at him. What are you going to say to him?</p><p>DE BLASIO: Look, I'm not going over every strategy right now, but I'll the bottom line. The bottom line is we have to put working people first in America, and Democrats have to be the party of working people again. We are not seen that way by enough working people. And if we don't fix it, we're going to lose this election.</p><p>So, if I happen to have a conversation with Joe Biden, I'm going to challenge him -- I'm going to challenge all my colleagues, prove that you're not part of the status quo. Prove that you're actually willing to do things like this Bill of Rights that literally put power back in the hands of working people, take it away from multi-national corporations.</p><p>Prove you're not going to just approve another NAFTA, which Donald Trump wants Democrats to do right now. And, Wolf, I am scared that a lot of Democrats in the House and Senate are going to quietly vote for a new NAFTA and dig that hole again for working Americans. I think there is a lot to talk about in Detroit, and it's how are we going to be the party of change again.</p><p>BLITZER: But you don't have to wait to have an opportunity. If you want to go after Biden at that debate, you could just do it.</p><p>DE BLASIO: Unquestionably, but the point is, it's not just about Joe Biden. It is the heart and soul of the Democratic Party.</p><p>BLITZER: But he doesn't represent the heart and soul of the Democratic Party.</p><p>DE BLASIO: He is absolutely a Democrat. And I give him credit for some real good public service, but I have to say, if we're at a moment where we have to change or die -- let's be clear, we have to either be party of change, be the party that will resist a broken status quo, show working people in all those states in the Midwest that went for Trump, show working people that we actually are on their side again, not on the side of one percent.</p><p>I challenge Biden. I challenge all Democrats. Prove to people that that's who you are. I can prove it because of what I've done in New York. We've done a host of things to put money back in the hands of working people.</p><p>I'm going to challenge people because this is a fight we better have now. It's not a fight that could wait for the debate stage with Donald Trump. If Donald Trump can run to the left of the Democrat and act like he's more on the side of working people than the Democrat -- that's what he did in 2016, and he got away with it. If he can do it again, we're in a bad -- really bad place as a party.</p><p>BLITZER: We're going to see you in Detroit next Tuesday and Wednesday. The first round on Tuesday, second round on Wednesday. CNN will have -- obviously, will host that debate next week.</p><p>DE BLASIO: Looking forward to it.</p><p>BLITZER: Mayor, thanks so much for coming in.</p><p>DE BLASIO: Thank you, Wolf. BLITZER: Good luck out there on the campaign trail.</p><p>We're going to get a lot more information coming in right now about the former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's last-minute request to allow his top aide to join him at tomorrow's hearing.</p><p>Also, the President's legal team sues to keep congressional investigators from seeing the President's tax returns. We'll be right back.</p><p>[17:33:41] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER: The breaking news, President Trump is described as irritated, and there has been plenty of last-minute jockeying going on up on Capitol Hill just ahead of the former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's public testimony about his investigation. Let's bring in our legal and political analysts. We'll discuss the latest developments.</p><p>And, Laura Coates, what do you make of this request -- maybe it's a last-minute request -- by Mueller to bring his top deputy in to sit alongside him.</p><p>LAURA COATES, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: It tells me he wants to give comprehensive answers, and he wants them to have one bite at this testimonial apple. He doesn't want to go back and say, let me check it out, I'll figure it out, I'll come back to you. He wants this to be the moment he turns to the person and says, you know the answers, let me get back to them right now.</p><p>It also shows to me that he is hoping to really have not evasive answers but actually forthcoming, be candid, and actually give them the information they are seeking. And also, somebody to maybe to nudge or remind him, we're actually not talking about that. We may have 12 of other investigations we have to report on, sir, let's tamp it down.</p><p>BLITZER: What do you think of the Justice Department's warning to him in this letter that they sent him last night, saying he should stay within the constraints of his official 448-page report?</p><p>COATES: Well, thanks for that opinion, people at DOJ, but, in reality, he can stay in the four corners of the actual report and still be very comprehensive. The questions people have are not asking him to go beyond. It's about going behind the scenes and behind the 448 pages with the sound bites there.</p><p>Also, the idea of trying to putting the toothpaste back in the tube, trying to assert, now, executive privilege and saying, please be quiet about privilege issues, you had all these interviews. You had 500 witnesses. You had thousands of subpoenas issued. Now, you'd ask him to say, when the public has a chance to hear from the horse's mouth, to be quiet? I don't think so.</p><p>GLORIA BORGER, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST: But Mueller asked for this letter, and that's -- COATES: He asked for guidance, right.</p><p>[17:39:57] BORGER: And -- but he wanted the guidance, so it's sitting right there, so -- and he's a reluctant witness, as we all know. So, he could look at this guidance and say, well, the Department of Justice says, you know, I can't really answer that because of privilege.</p><p>And then he's got somebody who worked with him in the counsel's office sitting on the other side of him, you know, saying, well, you can't really answer that question. So, I wonder if this means that, you know, Mueller is sort of cocooning himself in a way against the committee's questions.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes, you're right.</p><p>COATES: Well, here's why I wonder about the cover, though, in that area because, remember, he has a conflict, a little bit, not in terms of ethical but with Barr --</p><p>BORGER: Yes, sure.</p><p>COATES: -- essentially trying to say, here is the cover I need. He wants to be able to address what Barr did to roll this out and how the DOJ did not cover him.</p><p>BORGER: Not -- exactly.</p><p>BLITZER: You know, Ryan, it's pretty clear what the Democrats want to achieve tomorrow.</p><p>RYAN LIZZA, CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, ESQUIRE: Yes.</p><p>BLITZER: But the Republicans, they have their own agenda. They're going to get almost as much time for their questioning.</p><p>LIZZA: Yes. Look, they have to make a decision of whether they're going to go with one of the two strategies that Trump and Republicans have toyed with. One is that this report just exonerates the President and that, you know, Mueller is this great investigator. He looked at everything, and it's pure exoneration.</p><p>The flip side of that is that a lot of them have argued, oh, this was -- you know, he was conflicted from the beginning and this entire investigation was a hoax, and that's it's more about, you know, damaging his credibility. And I think, basically, as a team, they want to pick one of those or the other because they're not in harmony, and Trump goes back and forth with the tweets between those two.</p><p>BLITZER: We all remember, Carl Bernstein, your excellent reporting, Bob Woodward's excellent reporting during Watergate. We remember the Watergate hearings that eventually resulted with new information that caused then-President Nixon to resign. Do you think there is a make- or-break moment like that, potentially, that could occur tomorrow?</p><p>CARL BERNSTEIN, CO-AUTHOR, \"THE FINAL DAYS\": It seems unlikely because in the Watergate hearings, you had the testimony of John Dean from the inside turning dramatically on the President of the United States for the minute-by-minute account of the President's direction of the cover-up. So, I don't think something like that is likely. But one thing that is happening here is that we now have an Attorney General of the United States who has put a gag order on the Special Prosecutor.</p><p>And the difference between Watergate and this is that the system worked in Watergate because Republicans were open to joining Democrats in trying to learn the truth rather than suppress it. And what we're seeing so far about tomorrow is the Attorney General and the Republicans want to continue to suppress the truth and are happy that a cover-up may well be going on.</p><p>BLITZER: So, you don't think we'll get a John Dean type bombshell from Robert Mueller tomorrow?</p><p>BERNSTEIN: There is reacted material. In Watergate, for instance, the redacted material reached the Congress of the United States. Very significant, as Laura, I think, knows better than anybody. But here, there is no access to that redacted material. There has been an insidious attempt to keep the American people and the Congress of the United States from the facts in this investigation beyond those in the Mueller report itself, and it's quite extraordinary.</p><p>BLITZER: It was very clear today, Laura, the President is clearly irritated by Mueller's upcoming testimony tomorrow morning. He suggested earlier today that the U.S. constitution basically gives him the right to do whatever he wants. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Then I have an Article Two where I have the right to do whatever I want as president, but I don't even talk about that. Because they did a report and there was no obstruction.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLITZER: What's your reaction? Because you know the constitution.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>COATES: Well, clearly, he does not, Wolf Blitzer, in that respect. Think about it. The entire premise is the separation of powers and three co-equal branches of government whose job it is to impose checks and balances as appropriate. And it's a government of, for, and by the people, so the notion that the President would be able to be a king and that constituents are now subjects is completely off the mark.</p><p>And isn't it that we have heard the President -- the President, ad nauseam, talk about all the reasons he could do what he wants to do, one particular point, in particular, is why you want to hear from Mueller tomorrow, because he has been able to stonewall Congress' attempts to actually impose those checks and balances. So, the question is, what did Mueller intend for them to do about it, with a process or an indictment?</p><p>BORGER: Well, you know, he is parroting his lawyers because his lawyers have been saying to him this entire time, Article Two of the Constitution allows you to fire anybody you would like -- meaning James Comey, for example -- and it gives you extraordinary authority over the entire executive branch. What it doesn't do is give him the right to do something illegal which he should not be doing. And, Carl, you know about this better than anybody.</p><p>BERNSTEIN: But he has a habit of doing it.</p><p>BORGER: And -- but --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BORGER: So, the President is saying, oh, have you ever heard of our -- remember, he said, have you ever heard of Article Two? Well, this is what has been -- he's been hearing from his lawyers.</p><p>BERNSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>BORGER: And so, he feels, well, you know, I've got Teflon on.</p><p>LIZZA: Yes, he's mangling --</p><p>BORGER: There's nothing can touch me.</p><p>LIZZA: He's mangling this, you know --</p><p>BORGER: Yes.</p><p>LIZZA: -- serious legal case that some on the right make that if you obstruct justice or something that looks like obstructing justice in the course of using your Article Two powers, that's not actually obstruction of justice.</p><p>BORGER: Right.</p><p>LIZZA: Now, that's not exactly what he said, but that's what the sort of --</p><p>BORGER: That's what he means.</p><p>[17:45:00] LIZZA: That's germ. But even that, obviously, is a controversial view.</p><p>BERNSTEIN: But it's still a version of unlimited power designated to the President of the United States --</p><p>BORGER: And unchecked.</p><p>BERNSTEIN: -- at the expense of the other branches of government. The question --</p><p>BLITZER: But it isn't unlimited power because --</p><p>BERNSTEIN: Of course, it's -- right.</p><p>BLITZER: -- if he does something really, really bad --</p><p>BORGER: Illegal.</p><p>BLITZER: -- there is an impeachment proceeding that can begin in the House, impeachment, and then a trial in the Senate. If convicted, he is removed from office.</p><p>BERNSTEIN: Yes, that could happen. But what you have -- again, you had Nixon who asserted similarly that he was above the law -- but he did it in private, his assertion.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>COATES: Right.</p><p>BERNSTEIN: What's so unusual here is that the President of the United States gets up almost every day and really asserts, I am above the law. I am contemptuous of the law. I will do what I want and not what the law says.</p><p>COATES: And that --</p><p>BLITZER: Hold on. Hold on. Hold on for a moment. We're some getting breaking news coming into THE SITUATION ROOM. I want to go to our justice correspondent Jessica Schneider.</p><p>Jessica, what are you learning?</p><p>JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, we are learning in the past few minutes tonight that the Department of Justice will be launching a formal antitrust review of the nation's biggest tech companies. The DOJ not saying exactly what those companies would be, but it could encompass Google, Amazon, Facebook.</p><p>Now, we have known that the DOJ has been inquiring into Google in tandem with the FTC at the beginning stages of a probe of some other tech companies. But now, the DOJ is confirming that this antitrust review is happening, and it will explore how digital platforms compete and deal with consumer demands.</p><p>This is of note because the topic of privacy and competition and fairness of these search engines has really been a hot topic on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers in recent days and weeks have had -- held multiple hearings grilling these tech executives about their practices. And in particular, President Trump has been lashing out repeatedly over the last several months on Twitter, in interviews, going after Facebook and Twitter and Google, calling a lot of these companies biased against conservatives.</p><p>Even the Attorney General, Bill Barr, at his confirmation hearing in January talked about how these companies, these behemoths as he called them, aren't being properly investigated, saying once he got into the DOJ, that that was something that he wanted his antitrust division to look into. So, now, Wolf, we know that the DOJ will be launching this extensive review, a widespread review, of these digital and techno -- and tech platforms like Google and Amazon and Facebook. The way they are putting it is they're going to be looking at how these online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that, as they put it, have reduced competition, stifled innovation, and harmed consumers.</p><p>So, we've been kind of awaiting something from DOJ. And, Wolf, now we know that this big review is happening, likely sending shock waves now through Silicon Valley.</p><p>LIZZA: Wolf --</p><p>BLITZER: I'm sure it is. Jessica Schneider, thank you very much.</p><p>Laura Coates, give us your analysis. This is a major development.</p><p>COATES: It is. And, of course, we knew -- we had that hint from Bill Barr's confirmation hearing about him taking tech companies very seriously. There is an interesting coincidence. The President also happens to have an issue with each of those particular companies and, now, it's a priority of DOJ. But it does still have bipartisan support.</p><p>Well, the interesting thing about this issue will be how they are able to get information about whether they have engaged in unfair practices. It would to require them to hand over documents. Will it be voluntarily? Will it be through a subpoena?</p><p>Will this be a contentious battle to say, you know, it's possible you may have become the so-called behemoth lawfully, but in the event you didn't, hand me all of your documents, including about search engines, user profiles, user search tendencies and tactics? We have had -- we're going to have a very long road ahead of us, and it's going to be about privacy.</p><p>BLITZER: It has significant political implications, Gloria, as well.</p><p>BORGER: Sure.</p><p>BLITZER: A bunch of Democrats have been talking about stricter regulations, as well, as far as these big tech companies.</p><p>BORGER: Right, and it's sort of strange bedfellows. We were talking about this. You could have somebody like Elizabeth Warren who's called for the breakup of these companies joining with conservative voices who feel like they've been treated unfairly by these companies.</p><p>So, I think the question that I have is that the President himself has suggested that the United States should sue Google and Facebook and is this the result of that, or is this -- or is this something else? And will that complicate their case --</p><p>BLITZER: Because we --</p><p>BORGER: -- because the President has weighed in to a degree in it.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes, he often criticizes these big tech companies as being biased against conservatives.</p><p>LIZZA: Yes. And, look, we'll have to see more about what they're investigating, but I don't think what they are investigating is that. I don't think --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BERNSTEIN: You got it.</p><p>LIZZA: Trump and a lot of people on the right believe that, Twitter and Facebook, their algorithms can sometimes be biased against right- wing views, right? But that is not an antitrust issue.</p><p>BERNSTEIN: That's right.</p><p>LIZZA: I'm not an antitrust expert, but I don't think that's an antitrust issue. What it looks like the Justice Department is looking at is, frankly, what the same thing that Elizabeth Warren --</p><p>COATES: Yes.</p><p>LIZZA: -- and other Democrats have been concerned about, is anticompetitive behavior.</p><p>BLITZER: Carl, how do you see it?</p><p>[17:49:46] BERNSTEIN: First thing is that the whole question of this Attorney General conducting this kind of a politicized investigation, seems to me, is fraught. And if there were ever an occasion for the do-nothing Congress of the United States to have a select committee, both Republicans and Democrats joining together, to look at the whole question of privacy, of the power of these companies, it is a great subject to be undertaken on a bipartisan basis. But trust this Attorney General and this atmosphere to do it and the antitrust division of the Justice Department? I wouldn't.</p><p>BLITZER: You think there's bipartisan cooperation --</p><p>BORGER: Well, there could be --</p><p>BLITZER: -- just ahead?</p><p>BORGER: I would never predict that, Wolf, but --</p><p>BERNSTEIN: Why not let Congress do it?</p><p>BORGER: But I do think that there are people on both sides of the aisle who agree that these companies need to be looked at seriously. Not necessarily broken up the way Elizabeth Warren believes they should be, but I think that there's enough interest in it. So, a serious investigation like Carl talks about would be something that lots of folks on Capitol Hill --</p><p>BERNSTEIN: Including First Amendment questions.</p><p>BORGER: -- would entertain.</p><p>BERNSTEIN: It'd enter into it, which is very important.</p><p>BLITZER: All right.</p><p>BORGER: Exactly, but not what the President is talking about, which is they're not nice to conservatives. That's --</p><p>BLITZER: This is a significant development. We're going to have a lot more on this coming up.</p><p>There's other important news just coming in, as well. North Korea has published photos of the dictator Kim Jong-un inspecting what's said to be a submarine under construction. And given the North's nuclear arsenal, the implications are ominous.</p><p>Brian Todd has been working his sources. What are you learning, Brian?</p><p>BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, tonight, we're told that this submarine, an enormous vessel much bigger than one Kim showed off about three years ago, could have the capability of firing multiple nuclear-tipped missiles. Analysts say this poses a threat to the region including nearly 30,000 American troops there, and they're examining whether it could have implications for the U.S. homeland.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TODD (voice-over): Experts say this is the latest example of Kim Jong-un's unbridled military ambition and the newest threat he poses to the U.S. and its allies. In these newly released pictures, Kim is inspecting what appears to be a submarine under construction. Kim's news agency says this hulking vessel, which analysts worry could fire nuclear missiles, will soon be deployed to the waters between North Korea and Japan.</p><p>ANKIT PANDA, ADJUNCT SENIOR FELLOW IN THE DEFENSE POSTURE PROJECT, FEDERATION OF AMERICAN SCIENTISTS: For the first time since February 2018, the North Korean leader has publicly inspected something that is very much designed to carry and launch nuclear weapons. And that's significant because we've been in this diplomatic process where Kim Jong-un has really put a lid on things.</p><p>TODD (voice-over): A senior U.S. official tells CNN, the U.S. has been tracking the development of this submarine for a year-and-a-half. Analysts say Kim Jong-un could well be signaling to President Trump his frustration over the diplomatic impasse regarding his nuclear weapons.</p><p>REAR ADMIRAL JOHN KIRBY (RET.), CNN MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC ANALYST: This is an opportunity for Kim to say, look, I'm not testing nukes, I'm not launching intercontinental ballistic missiles, but I still have this ability or I want to get this capability and you need to take me seriously. TODD (voice-over): Analysts say Kim's got about 70 submarines, most of which are old, slow, and loud, but the regime has used the fleet to deadly effect. In 2010, a North Korean submarine torpedoed the South Korean Navy ship, the Cheonan, killing more than 40 sailors.</p><p>And Kim has been determined to modernize his undersea fleet in recent years. In 2016, he successfully test-fired a ballistic missile from a submarine for the first time, a missile that traveled about 300 miles and landed in the Sea of Japan. Experts say this newest submarine looks to be much bigger.</p><p>PANDA: This submarine does appear to be capable of carrying multiple ballistic missiles, possibly as many as three or four. And once they build this and they build it out, I fully expect that they'll continue building submarines like this.</p><p>TODD (voice-over): Analysts say there's no question that, tonight, Kim's submarine fleet poses a significant threat to Japan, South Korea, and to the 28,000 U.S. troops in South Korea. But they also believe he's trying to build bigger, quieter submarines that could travel further and go undetected.</p><p>RICHARD FISHER, SENIOR FELLOW, INTERNATIONAL ASSESSMENT AND STRATEGY CENTER: They could, potentially, within the next decade, develop submarines capable of transiting the Pacific Ocean, within range sufficient to launch missile strikes against the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TODD: A senior U.S. official telling CNN tonight, the U.S. assessment is that this latest vessel Kim was seen with is likely a refurbished, old submarine. Still, it could be lethal to the U.S.</p><p>Now, how can the U.S. and its allies counter the submarine missile threat from Kim Jong-un? Military analysts say the allies are going to have to put more spy planes in the air, more ships and underwater sensors in the Pacific Ocean to try to detect and intercept those North Korean subs. It's going to be difficult, expensive, and it could provoke China and Russia into being more aggressive in the Pacific. But the allies really may have no other choice at this point -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: All right, Brian, thank you. Brian Todd reporting.</p><p>Coming up, President Trump is on edge right now just ahead of the landmark testimony by Robert Mueller. The President is complaining once again of a witch-hunt. He's asking aides what to expect from the hearings. And why is the former Special Counsel suddenly asking for his deputy to be sworn in with him?</p><p>[17:54:54] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BLITZER: Happening now, breaking news. Mueller under oath. On the eve of his highly anticipated congressional appearance, former Special Counsel Robert Mueller makes a surprise last-minute request to be joined by his deputy as he testifies before two House committees. Ready to pounce. President Trump tweeting and talking repeatedly about Mueller, even to a group of students after days on the phone with aides and allies discussing tomorrow's testimony. How will he respond?</p><p>Trump goes to court. The President files suit against the House Ways and Means Committee, the New York State Attorney General, and the New York tax commissioner to prevent the disclosure of his tax returns. Why is he going to extreme lengths to keep them secret?</p><p>[18:00:08]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019072301CNV16</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN4-CBK1-DXH2-60WT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8951\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 23, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, July 24th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now, 7:00 on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mueller is on the hot seat today. His highly anticipated testimony on Capitol Hill starts in just over an hour. We will speak with one lawmaker on the House Judiciary Committee coming up this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Another big day for earnings. Dow components Boeing and Caterpillar set to report later this hour. For Boeing, we're taking a look at the effect of the grounding of the 737 Max jet. We'll bring you the numbers and full analysis coming up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wall street waiting Mueller and earnings. Futures are indicating a lower opening for the broader averages. We are well off of the lows of the morning I should point out. But the Dow futures are now down 40 points, S&amp;P futures down 6, and Nasdaq futures lower by 34.</p><p>After a big day yesterday, stocks rallied ending the day near session highs yesterday. Check it out. DowIndustrials were up 177 points, two-thirds of 1 percent. The S&amp;P was up 20 points, and the Nasdaq was up 47, also two-thirds of a percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the markets look like this. We've got another round of weak purchasing managers indexes data out of France and Germany. The FT 100 is down 76. Of course, in the U.K. Boris Johnson will become prime minister later today. The DAX Index is higher in Germany, up 48 points.</p><p>In Asia overnight, most of the markets saw gains under new U.S.-China trade talks, except South Korea. We know that the meetings will resume in Shanghai next week.</p><p>Trouble for big tech meanwhile. The Justice Department is opening an anti- trust review. What this could mean for companies including Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon. Top story in the \"Journal\" this morning.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning. And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; Rosecliff CEO, managing partner Mike Murphy; and former U.S. Attorney, Bud Cummins. Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO/MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL: Good morning.</p><p>BUD CUMMINS, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Great to see you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:: Great to see you in this new studio -- Maria Bartiromo.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. new studio looking bright and beautiful, loving the colors.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I know. It looks like morning. Morning has broken. And it's always the news breaking.</p><p>MURPHY: I said it last hour but I think it's worth repeating. A lot of people, friends in New York support you and support what you're doing on the show and the new studio is well deserved.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you. I want to hear about the people you were with the other night.</p><p>we have breaking news right now. UPS second quarter earnings just came out.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the numbers right now -- Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hey double beat from UPS -- Maria. So for EPS, $1.96 a share. Market liking it, stock up 1 percent. Revenue also better than expected at $18.05 billion in the quarter, the estimate there was for $17.97 billion.</p><p>Could be the stock is getting this 1.1 percent pop because they have -- they backed their view for the year of adjusted earnings of the range, $745 to $775 a share but as you know, we are ordering a lot of stuff online and UPS is delivering it.</p><p>Next year they will go to seven day a week delivery. They will do that Sunday delivery. Their free cash flow, $2.2 billion. So so far, decent report from ups.</p><p>Maria -- back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Lauren -- thanks so much. Stock is up at 1 percent. I guess this is an indicator for the overall economy, Mike, as well.</p><p>MURPHY: It is. I think also, you know, UPS and FedEx have both had years year-to-date because Amazon was coming in to handle the deliveries themselves.</p><p>I think yesterday saw a big move in FedEx stock and I think this anti-trust search now, looking into Amazon, maybe they have to step away from certain segments of their business like shipping, would be a huge positive for both UPS and FedEx.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really a good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good news, bad news. Coca-Cola hit an all-time high yesterday on its results which is pretty incredible. There's a great story by Tim Higgins, who's a frequent guest on this program, in the \"Wall Street Journal\" today.</p><p>Tesla reports after the bell today. The stock is down like double digits in the last year, 14 percent, up 45 percent since the low in June but Tim's story looks at the number of registrations of the high end Model S sedan and that sales of this high end sedan have taken a big hit in the California market.</p><p>They looked at the number of registrations of the Model S in Cali, plummeting 54 percent in the second quarter. This is hard core, serious reporting and it's a window into what Tesla could be facing down the road.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. He's done a great job with Tesla over the years as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He really has.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Lauren, thank you, on earnings. We'll come back to you as we get more.</p><p>Our top story this hour is former special counsel Robert Mueller testifying before two House committees today.</p><p>Hillary Vaughn covering the story this morning. Hillary -- what can you tell us?</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Maria -- the President is already waking up and reacting on Twitter. He tweeted this moments ago. quote, \"So Democrats and others can illegally fabricate a crime, try pinning it on a very innocent president and when he fights back against this illegal and treasonous attacks on our country, they call it obstruction. Wrong. Why didn't Robert Mueller investigate the investigators?\"</p><p>House Democrats have been preparing for this day, holding mock Mueller hearings. They're finally getting their chance for a face-to-face with the special counsel, Robert Mueller himself. But Democrats already have an idea of what he's going to say because the special counsel says he is sticking to what he already published to the public, his report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D), WASHINGTON: I don't know that we are, but perhaps the media is setting expectations high. I mean, I said consistently from the beginning that what we will get out of this is Mueller's words dramatized because everyone will be watching. And that is the most important thing in my view.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN: Today Mueller will face lawmakers before two committees. First, the House Judiciary Committee at 8:00 a.m. led by chairman Jerry Nadler.</p><p>And then at noon for more questions, he'll go for round two in front of the House Intelligence Committee chaired by Adam Schiff.</p><p>Mueller will not be appearing solo today. He'll have his deputy counsel, Aaron Zebley (ph), who will be sworn in by his side. We're expecting a lot of fireworks as questioning gets going. But again, Maria -- the special counsel intending to stick to exactly what was in his report -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Hillary -- thank you. We'll be watching. Hillary Vaughn on Capitol Hill this morning.</p><p>President Trump just tweeted again on the hearing. He said this. \"It was never agreed that Robert Mueller could use one of his many Democrat never Trumper lawyers to sit next to him and help him with his answers. This was specifically not agreed to. And I would never have agreed to it. The greatest witch hunt in U.S. history by far.\"</p><p>Joining us right now is Arizona Congressman, House Judiciary Committee member and House Freedom Caucus member, Andy Biggs.</p><p>Congressman -- it's good to have you this morning. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>REP. ANDY BIGGS (R-AZ): Thanks -- Maria, good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Can you give us your sense of what you want to get from Mueller? I mean he says he's going to stick to the report. What do you think the Judiciary Committee needs to ask?</p><p>BIGGS: Well, we need to get to the origins of this report, the conflicts that Mr. Mueller had. We need to find out when he determined that there was no coordination, collusion and conspiracy with the Russians. Those are important things.</p><p>And, you know, he's going to try to limit his testimony but he's a subpoenaed witness. He doesn't have the right to come in and just say well, I'm going to only answer questions I want to answer. Unless he's going to assert some kind of privilege, then I expect him to answer every question that's put to him today, including the ones that I just told you that --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So he's going to be asked then about the Steele dossier. What he did in terms of when he found that Steele dossier, when he looked at it, what it did in terms of his Mueller report, how much of that is in it.</p><p>BIGGS: Oh, absolutely right. And the origins of that, why he continued to get FISA warrants, why he stopped getting FISA warrants, all of these things are so important because they flush (ph) out what was not put into the Mueller report.</p><p>And we'll see how it goes. But I think on one hand it could be potentially a big dud because if the chairman allows him to just say I'm not going to answer that because it's not in my report, then it's going to be basically a dud for both sides. Both sides aren't going to get what they want to know and the American people are going to be left in the dark on this.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Congressman, Bob Mueller has previously said that the report is his testimony and he plans to submit the full report as his opening statement. Putting an exclamation point on that.</p><p>But do the Republicans, yourself included, run the risk that if you hammer him on questions that he clearly is not willing to answer, that you look bad and that you overplay your hand?</p><p>BIGGS: Well, it has to be done in a certain way -- Dagen. You're exactly right. And I think -- I think we need to ask the questions because we need to also show that Mr. Mueller won't answer questions that I think all of us want to know.</p><p>When I say all of us, let's just face it. Most of America has gotten over the Mueller thing. But those of us who are still involved in this, we really want to know answers to questions like origins, when did you know that there was no conspiracy, the FISA issues.</p><p>I mean, these things we want to know and if he's not going to answer them, then we're going to make him say that out loud. I'm not going to answer your questions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. So what about that -- Bud Cummins? I mean Robert Mueller takes over in May of 2017. May of 2017. You've got a whole year and-a- half. Then you have the midterm elections. When do you think he figured out that there was no collusion.</p><p>BIGGS: I'm looking to when he quit getting FISA warrants and that was in, in the fall there of '17. So I think he knew pretty early on that certain areas of this were not going to go directly to Russian collusion or conspiracy. And that he switched his direction.</p><p>Look, he started looking at 10-year-old tax beefs for Paul Manafort, 10- year-old. And I mean so at some point they switched their focus and really expanded their scope and stopped looking at Russian conspiracy with the Trump campaign.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to ask you about Joseph Mifsud in a second because we've done a lot of reporting on this guy.</p><p>But first, we've got former U.S. Attorney Bud Cummins on the set this morning.</p><p>CUMMINS: I thought the Congressman made a good point. I do anticipate that if you ask him those questions about things that aren't in the report, about the origin and the investigation, that he's going to try and say, well, I'm a prosecutor, you know, those are confidential matters and it's not in the report.</p><p>But you make a good point because everything that's in the report is not supposed to be public. So where does he draw that line. This report should not be public -- Congressman. So how does he say, Well, I'm only going to address things in the report and not other things because he really can't defend the fact that we're all going to be reading allowed from this report today. It shouldn't be in the public domain.</p><p>BIGGS: Well, you're exactly right. And so the Democrats are going to turn it into a readers' theater which I don't think makes for good television if you want the truth. And then Mr. Mueller is going to try to say, look, I just did what I had to do.</p><p>He's going to -- on one hand he's going to say this was unique, which is why we published this. And on the other hand he's going to say this is unique, that's why I can't answer any questions beyond the report and what I told you.</p><p>So he's going to try to have it both ways, I think and I don't think that's going to play very well for either side.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile AG Barr has John Durham investigating this and Durham's team is looking to interview Joseph Mifsud according to John Solomon from the Hill. Mifsud tasked with giving former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos access to Russian intelligence, basically George Papadopoulos met Mifsud in Rome and Mifsud drops a bomb on his lap by saying the Russians have Hillary Clinton's emails.</p><p>Back in May, I spoke with George Papadopoulos and asked him about that meeting with Mifsud in Rome.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So he tells you Russia has e-mails of Hillary Clinton's and this is the bomb that you feel was the whole reason that they wanted you to go to Rome, to meet him, because they wanted him to tell you about these e- mails that Russia had of Hillary Clinton, is that right?</p><p>GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS, FORMER TRUMP AIDE: That's absolutely correct. I think this person was some sort of plant for years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They wanted you to go back and tell Trump about Russia having Hillary Clinton emails. Did you do that?</p><p>PAPADOPOULOS: Absolutely not. That wasn't my job.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you told the FBI, you believe you met him in March when in fact you met him in April and that was the perjury. So you went to jail for what? How many nights?</p><p>PAPADOPOULOS: I went to jail for 11 nights because of this, after I had honey pots money thrown my way, wiretaps, surveillance by foreign countries and then I finally get caught in some perjury trap and I go to jail tore 11 nights. It was ridiculous.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you feel that this was entrapment.</p><p>PAPADOPOULOS: Absolutely. I feel it was entrapment. I'm very happy to see Congressman Devin Nunes and the letter that he sent to Secretary Pompeo and Gina Haspel to get more information on this person, Mifsud. Because if it's indeed proven that this person was really entrapping me, not even spying on me and then there was a coordinated effort between these other various intelligence agencies, including the DIA and Australians to extract this fake information, let them spy on me with another honey pot in London with Halper --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>PAPADOPOULOS: -- this thing reeks of spying entrapment and an and illegal and illicit behavior.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So Congressman -- real quick, what is the significance of finding out that Joseph Mifsud actually worked for the FBI?</p><p>BIGGS: The significance is that this was the incident that started this whole wretched affair and Mifsud is working for the FBI and we need to know why he was working there and why they set up Papadopoulos. I mean because it looks like an absolute setup based on everything that we've seen, both publicly and behind closed doors.</p><p>And it looks like a setup to me. And, you know, if this whole thing was started with bad false motives and intentions on the part of some people in our federal government, imagine -- imagine what that does to a free republic, a constitutional republic like we have. We've got to stop that and we need to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That's absolutely right. Congressman -- it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>BIGGS: Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman Andy Biggs. What are the odds that Joseph Mifsud turns up in this hearing this morning?</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>CUMMINS: We would like to think for the American public that we get the truth. You know, regardless of what side you are politically like you want to know because it could be you being spied on next if there's actually spying going on. You want it to stop.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bingo.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Andy McCarthy has said this. We need to show to the American people that these tools like FISA warrants weren't abused because otherwise they won't be able to investigate terrorists.</p><p>MURPHY: They'll take them away.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Terrorists --</p><p>MURPHY: They'll take them away.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll take a break. When we come back, big tech is under the microscope this morning. The Department of Justice opening an anti-trust investigation. We've got all the he details when we come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Boris Johnson set to become British prime minister later today. Take a look at a live picture of parliament. Outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May taking her final questions this morning before formally submitting her resignation to Queen Elizabeth.</p><p>Joining me right now in a \"Fox Business Exclusive\" is the former CEO of WPP and the current executive chairman of S4 Capital, Sir Martin Sorrell.</p><p>SIR MARTIN SORRELL, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, S4 CAPITAL: Good morning. New studio, new BoJo.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SORRELL: I mean Boris Johnson, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've got new digs here.</p><p>SORRELL: Some call him Britain's Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell me about that. What do you think about him?</p><p>SORRELL: Well, it depends on which Boris turns up, really. I mean there's many different Borises that I know -- probably best was when he was mayor of London. and that was a good Boris actually.</p><p>He surrounded himself with a very good set of people. We'll see what cabinet he deploys. He said the inside story, it will represent modern Britain, represent the ethnic minorities and women and gender diversity in all senses.</p><p>So I think on balance, I think the pressure that he's under -- because he only has a majority of two or three members of parliament. So it's a very, very sort of difficult situation for him.</p><p>He said we will come out of the E.U. on October 31st, certainly in his campaign to become prime minister, he clearly wanted to be prime minister. His central objective was to become prime minister.</p><p>So he's got what he wanted. Now he has to make a fist of it, as we say.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Will he have an easier time taking Britain out of the E.U. than Theresa May had?</p><p>SORRELL: I don't think so. I think he's in exactly in the same position.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Same position.</p><p>SORRELL: Well, the same position, they had to wrestle with a new leader of the E.U. already some criticism. So mess in the E.U. which you didn't expect it.</p><p>They said we're not going to change anything in relation to the Irish backstop which was the big issue that parliament was concerned about in relation to the agreement that Theresa May negotiated.</p><p>So I think it's going to be quite a fractious time. But he's an interesting character, very different to Theresa May, very engaging, very witty. Quite an intellectual in his way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SORRELL: His speech yesterday was interesting in terms of direction and energy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. He's a real character.</p><p>SORRELL: A lot of EQ actually, a love of EQ, IQ and EQ. So I think I would be in the optimistic camp.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ok.</p><p>SORRELL: But you know, this is -- fresh leadership, it's a new dawn, a new day. So we have to see what happens.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me switch gears. You've been obviously an advertising tycoon for a long time. And you're among the first to --</p><p>SORRELL: Mini-tycoon.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- to tell me about the threat coming from social media, from technology.</p><p>SORRELL: Now we're in the midst of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And now we're in the midst of it. There's this a crackdown though to talk about, the Department of Justice opening an anti-trust investigation into the tech sector. Your reaction to that.</p><p>SORRELL: Well, the crackdown as you put it has been going on -- E.U. has fined Google three times I think it is, certainly. I think there are three decisions that's best to (INAUDIBLE) in relation to their competitive activity.</p><p>So this issue around the tech titans really I think hovers around the problem of whether they acknowledge they're a media company or not. As you well know, Google have hired I think 15,000 people now to monitor editorial content. Facebook has hired about 30,000 people to monitor content.</p><p>And the essential issue from a media point of view is whether they're tech companies or media companies. When they reach market capitalizations of $1 trillion, which Amazon has, which Microsoft has, which Apple has -- it draws attention, particularly to the regulators to their market positions and their potential dominance.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think they're media companies?</p><p>SORRELL: I've always said they are. I mean you went to Cannes this year, I think maybe for the first time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>SORRELL: I think there's eight or nine years ago, the very first question when I was trying to do the poor man's job of sort of what you do, I said to people from tech companies including those and others, are you a media or tech companies, they both said they were tech companies.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well I mean Devin Nunes is right now suing Twitter saying, that they are content developers. If you're a content developer, you're not just a tech company.</p><p>SORRELL: I think they're responsible for their content. Just in the same way you're responsible for your content here. So I think they have to say you're responsible. They can't say they went just for the digital 're digital engineers tightening the nuts on the digital pipes of the digital scanners.</p><p>So but you know, let's be quite frank about it. The digital advertising revenues is where the growth is. you know, the industry's about a $500 billion industry, about $300 billion in old media, so-called and $200 billion in new.</p><p>And the new is growing at about 20 percent. The old is probably flat and in some cases down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell me about your new venture, S4 Capital, what are you trying to do? Obviously you had a controversial exit from WPP. Are you trying to create another WPP?</p><p>SORRELL: Well, we have a much more contemporary, a new era, a new age model is what we call, four things. Purely digital because that's where the growth it. What we call a holy trinity model of data driving the development of content of advertising content and programmatic, which means algorithmic distribution, media planning and buying.</p><p>A mantra around faster, better, cheaper. In a low growth world where there's little inflation and clients have little pricing power, there's a focus on being faster, more agile, being better in terms of use of agnostic use of technology and being more efficient.</p><p>And last but not least, having a unitary structure, not a fragmented structure with earnouts when business is required by the other person holding the companies. They tend to Vietnam. I'm on fragmented payment terms around each individual business.</p><p>We're having a much more unitary structure. So those four elements of what we think are the new era, new age structure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you're investing. You're investing.</p><p>SORRELL: Yes. Well, we started with zero. We're now market cap of $750 million, I mean three quarters of a unicorn is the way I would put it. So we're on our way.</p><p>And we're moving fast in those three areas, I mentioned. First party data, which drives the relationship with the consumer, with digital advertising content, and then media planning and buying, delivered algorithmically.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Martin -- good luck with it.</p><p>SORRELL: Thank you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great to have you.</p><p>SORRELL: Thank you very much and good to see you again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very good to see you again.</p><p>Martin Sorrell joining us.</p><p>Coming up Boeing earnings are out in the next couple of minutes, the aerospace giant expected to report second quarter numbers momentarily. We'll have the numbers. Check out the stock impact as well.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo.</p><p>We have breaking news. We are awaiting earnings from two Dow components any minute -- Caterpillar and Boeing.</p><p>For Boeing we are looking at the effects of the grounding of the 737 max. The stock this morning is up a fraction. Caterpillar is also up half a percent. That will give us a good idea in terms of the strength, economic backdrop across the world, particularly China.</p><p>We're awaiting those numbers and we will get those numbers and tell you how it's impacting markets this morning.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour are the earnings expected any moment right now.</p><p>Joining us, Fox Business reporter Jeff Flock, Blueline Futures president Bill Baruch, and president of Boyd Group, International and aviation analyst Mike Boyd. Great to see everybody this morning. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>Mike Boyd -- let me kick it off with you. What are you expecting out of Boeing?</p><p>MIKE BOYD, BOYD GROUP INTERNATIONAL: I think we're going to see a wider picture than just the Max. Remember, the Max is just one part of their entire program. So it's affecting them. It's going to affect them big- time in the future.</p><p>But we've got to keep in mind, there are a lot more things at Boeing than just the 737.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jeff?</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Yes, I don't know that -- there's just huge pile of unknown at this point. It's uncertainty. And I don't know that anything that you're going to learn today either from the earnings numbers or the earnings call, which is as 10:30 Eastern time is going to do anything to dispel any of the unknowns. I don't think we're going to get those answers today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I mean you're going to get an impact though of this issue on the quarter.</p><p>FLOCK: Well, Yes.. Here's your numbers, by the way -- Maria. We're looking Charlie Brady tells us we're looking for a $1.87 earnings per share and $18 billion in revenue. That's down 43 percent and 23 percent.</p><p>So it's going to be bad. But I don't know that -- unless there's something way out of the box on this, that we're going to learn anything about when this plane is going to get back in the air. And that is the big question.</p><p>At this point, that's something we don't know and it's something that really is weighing on this airline. Because they're burning cash right now. They're still making this plane and they're not selling it and they're not getting any money for it and that's a tough position to be in.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bill, weigh in here. What's your expectation?</p><p>BILL BARUCH, BLUELINE FUTURES: Well, there is a lot of unknowns here but this is a black box number. You're going to see some reaction here, ultimately this stock has been resilient. That's for the long run, I think that's great to see here.</p><p>Where do the deliveries go, looking out, 42 a month, do they go up 57, do they go out better. I think we'll see future cash flow come in solid. And that's going to be a positive.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Maybe we'll get some clarity hopefully from the company. The companies has said it's hoping to resume deliveries of the 737 Max in the fourth quarter. But you've heard from airlines, at least some of them, an officials saying that it will stay out of service until next year. So some clarity on that front, on the conference call, would be welcome to say the least.</p><p>MURPHY: And I think a big thing here will be if they can kind of give us some clue on what their total liabilities are from this, if we hear anything about an update on what they're setting aside or what they see as the fallout from the plane crashes that we've seen. And then, talking about future, future deliveries of not just the 737 but other planes.</p><p>As someone pointed out, the stock has performed really well in the wake -- in the face of all of this. So, some sort of good news would be able to get the stock moving back higher again.</p><p>CUMMINS: Are they still conducting an internal investigation? Is that still pending?</p><p>MURPHY: Yes, I don't think they've given the total breakdown of where they are with the investigation yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, the company lost money in the second quarter. It is a loss and we are -- $5.82 a share is the loss that is just hitting the tape right now on revenue of $15.75 billion. The numbers are just hitting the tape now. Real quick, Jeff Flock, your reaction?</p><p>FLOCK: Yes, 15.7, that's a pretty good miss. You know, we thought that might be a miss. But the number was 18.5 was what the Street was expecting so that's three billion less. That's a pretty good chunk there. You have EPS yet? I haven't seen that yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, the EPS is a loss, yes, of 5.82.</p><p>FLOCK: Oh, wow. Well, that's out of the box.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The stock is -- the stock is down two percent right now. Lauren Simonetti is looking at the second quarter numbers right now.</p><p>FLOCK: That's quite out of the box.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Lauren, we were expecting a loss. We got it, but it looks like it's worse than expected.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Worse than expected and the Dow is now down triple digits, Maria, because obviously, Boeing is a Dow component.</p><p>So, we were expecting -- and I'm giving you the expectation first for EPS so you can see how bad the miss was. EPS to decline about 48 percent, $1.87 a share. But we got an adjusted loss of a $5.82. Also major miss when it comes to revenue. $15.8 billion was the number. The expectation was $18.55 billion. So these are bad numbers out of Boeing right now.</p><p>I know this is, you know, the largest U.S. manufacturing exporter out there with a profile that's much bigger than the 737 Max. But that is the squeaky wheel and that's what everyone is focusing on right now. So we're going to see how bruising the grounding of that plane. You know, Boeing says they expect it and they gave some guidance last week, the grounding to, you know, last into the fourth quarter. But maybe that will be pushed back into 2020, so waiting for comments on that.</p><p>And of course, the ripple effects that this grounding has on the broader economy, right. The carriers, the workers that are affected here. But you're seeing Boeing, a Dow component down 1.3 percent now and with that, Dow is down about 90 points.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we're going to come back to you in a second on Caterpillar.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's just across on the tape as well. Boeing says this is a defining moment for the company and you know, you've got new orders being pushed back as well, Mike. This is really has been a hard-hitting impact to this company. And it was -- it was flying high, if you will, huge.</p><p>MURPHY: For sure. And you know, we talked about before the numbers came out on what sort of guidance we would get and they're still saying that they're abandoning guidance until they get this 737 issue figured out.</p><p>As an investor, you do not want to put new money to work in a company where you really have very little clarity on where the company's going to be in the future.</p><p>MCDOWELL: When the company says, what does the future look like? I don't know. That's essentially what Boeing is telling you right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You got a miss on Caterpillar as well. Revenues and earnings coming in and it is moving the stock. Let's get back to Lauren Simonetti on Caterpillar. Because Caterpillar, Lauren, is a real indication of the global economy.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The stock is down 2.5 percent right now.</p><p>SIMONETTI: 20 percent of their shares, Maria, come from Asia. So here you go. The barometer for the broader economy and it is not looking good. So the EPS is a miss, $2.83 a share. The expectation was $3.12. Revenue, $15.8 billion. That looks a little bit better than the expectation. Correct me if I'm wrong, producers, the expectation was $14.4 billion.</p><p>So those are the numbers coming out of Caterpillar. It is down just about three percent in the premarket. Together, Caterpillar and Boeing shaving 73 points off the Dow. So the Dow would almost be positive if it weren't for these two Dow components reporting just now, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: As viewers of the show know, that I'm a huge nerd but I'll explain why Boeing has such a major impact on the Dow, because it's a price weighted index. So the higher the priced stock, the S&amp;P is not like this, the NASDAQ is not like this. The higher the price of the stock, the greater the weighting in that Dow 30. And at last look, Boeing still had the highest priced stock in the Dow 30. So, when Boeing declines, it's going to have an out-sized drag on the overall performance of those 30 blue chips.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and Caterpillar missing expectations also coming in with guidance at the low end. So what you're getting here is a situation where two major companies -- for whatever reason, you've got the 737 issue at Boeing, Caterpillar you've got just a global slowdown issue and China problems. But from both companies you're getting a situation of uncertainty when it comes to what's ahead.</p><p>MURPOHY: Yes, and I think when you look at Caterpillar now, the stock will actually be when what's been a very strong year for the U.S. markets, the stock will be down when it opens up this morning for the year.</p><p>So again, if you're making an investment in Caterpillar right now, I think you're making the bet that you're going to have a global recovery and large orders coming in for their products and I think it's kind of tough to predict that right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you want to do as an investor here? You want to wait, take the sideline as you get more information in terms of what's ahead? I mean, this stock is now down three percent. This is going to take other names with it.</p><p>MURPHY: Yes, so on Caterpillar, I think there's so many other areas that you can focus on where do you see growth. You know, you can look to technology for growth and Caterpillar, I don't see the growth there and I don't know when that story turns where the global macro picture gets better and Caterpillar's numbers pick up. So, I just wouldn't be a buyer of Caterpillar here whether it's on three percent or more today.</p><p>But Boeing, I think if you shift back to that a second, I haven't had a chance to go through the entire report. But there must be something more there to Boeing, because on just the headline numbers you're getting, you wouldn't see a half a percent decline. I know it's early, but there could be a bigger reaction to the stock price there. So there --</p><p>BARTIROMO: But do you think they have a plan in terms of fixing what went wrong with the 737? I mean, do you believe their, you know, answer and solution to the next crop of planes?</p><p>MURPHY: I do, for sure. I mean, Boeing, look at them historically, they built great planes. The global orders, although they're not there for Caterpillar, global orders for large aircrafts are there. There's massive demand. That was kind of the story behind Boeing, was that they were going to be selling a lot of planes in 2020, 2021, 2022.</p><p>So, you know, this isn't something you just wake up and decide you're going to order a 757 plane.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MURPHY: These orders are out there. So you could look at Boeing and say, they're going to be selling planes for a long time. Now that uncertainty is there. The 737 mess has caused some uncertainty. But I believe Boeing is a better story than Caterpillar for investors.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A lot of this also falls on the regulators which Boeing lays out in its earnings statement. It's saying that regulatory authorities will determine the process for certifying the Max software and training updates as well as the timing of lifting the grounding.</p><p>CUMMINS: I mean, I can tell you from a legal and political background, they're going to do an internal investigation. They're going to uncover mistakes that were made and probably technical defects or software and or more likely training shortcomings. They're going to have to set aside money for victims.</p><p>The question is, how long does this take and the regulators are going to have their finger on that pulse. They're not going to let this go to the place where to punish Boeing where they start having massive layoffs. So, at some point --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, the base is going right to Airbus.</p><p>CUMMINS: -- they're going to let them resolve it. And then the question is at, you know, what point does it become a value to buy it?</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, Mike Boyd, weigh in here, in terms of this pushback in orders at Boeing and when would you expect stabilization in terms of new production?</p><p>BOYD: End of 2020, to be very blunt with you. Right now, today, we have over 500 airplanes Boeing is going to have to deal with when the regulations are changed, 500. 200 they produce, 350 out there. It's going to be huge to get them back into the system. It will be hard for airlines. It's going to be like another production line. So I'm thinking, you're probably looking at this disruption not ending even if it's lifted today until probably the end of next year for Boeing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Wow.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bill?</p><p>BARUCH: Boeing have a strategy change.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Go ahead.</p><p>BARUCH: Yes, Boeing's going to have a strategy change here. They're going to improve on this. I mean, I think when you look at the stock, the resilience has been there. I mean, they ultimately from my understanding, the software that was put into these planes made the pilot feel like they're in a smaller jet.</p><p>So ultimately, I think there's a strategy change. They're going to roll out changes here and they're going to improve on this. The stock itself has been extremely resilient with all of these headwinds ahead.</p><p>Yes, I'm a little surprise if it's only down one to two percent here. I would imagine it goes lower. There's nothing to do here. But again, I said before, this is a black box reaction and you're going to see some additional selling once the market opens and if it can continue to be resilient stock, I think you're going to see some ground work be laid technically and one of the best things I like on a technical basis is a fundamental rejection.</p><p>So, if this cannot go much lower and people are sort of looking out at seeing potential good news, then you've got a good technical wave that could come from that as well. And I think that's what you want to look at.</p><p>Again, there's nothing to do here right now. But I think as you look into the next 24 hours, into the end of the week, if we hold ground, that could be a great sign going forward. This is a bad number. Don't misinterpret that at all. This is a bad number. But the fact that they didn't put new guidance out there is going to leave people sort of intrigued going forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's interesting to see this really benign reaction to this miss. And the stock has really held up well. What is it up 15 percent year-to-date or so, Bill. So should we be reading into this reaction of a flat performance, down just $0.35, as a positive in terms of what's ahead for Boeing shares?</p><p>BARUCH: Well, certainly, yes. It is a positive right now. Let's see how it is when the market opens and you know, the people are coming in there and actually trading this. But if you take a step back, Boeing is tracked the Dow this year. It's underperformed aerospace.</p><p>And again, I think there is room to the upside broadly speaking going farther out that it can regain where the aerospace is up 30 percent on the year compared to the Dow just being up 20 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BARUCH: So again, if we see some good technical groundwork here and holding ground and a lack of selling, you could see a lack of selling after a bad news like this and you get the feeling that everybody who wants to sell has already sold. And then from there, the buyers step in.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I understand that Boeing has a huge impact on the Dow and on markets and it's a very expensive stock as well. But I think the more important number in terms of impact is Caterpillar this morning.</p><p>Caterpillar stock is falling out of bed, it's down better than three percent. Whether let's see where it is right now, maybe it's off of the lows. But it had a miss in expectations on earnings, revenue, also weak and it's the guidance that has investors unnerved this morning as well. Low end of guidance.</p><p>I think Caterpillar is going to have much more information, it's much more indicative of what's going on in the world today. Because Boeing's a specific problem.</p><p>MURPHY: Yes, agreed. However, when you look at the management of both companies, investors will have more faith in Boeing's management versus Caterpillar's management. Caterpillar has given bad guidance and kind of - - so Wall Street doesn't trust what's coming out of Caterpillar as much as what they trust out of what's coming out of Boeing.</p><p>So, I think you could argue that both give you a read on the global economy but you'd expect a better read from Boeing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Caterpillar's more vulnerable to the global economy, correct?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Then Boeing at least -- if you believe in the management, then they will fix this problem. That they're in control of their short-term destiny. Caterpillar is at the mercy of the world, really.</p><p>CUMMINS: I'm told anecdotally by a very senior pilot, one of their customer airlines that the pilots love the airplane. There's nothing wrong with the airplane itself. He though it was purely a training --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, I've heard that yesterday from another pilot that they suspect one of the reasons that the stock has not reacted more, is that it pilots who have flown it, think it is a training issue, not necessarily -- not necessarily all on Boeing's shoulders.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jeff Flock, do you agree with that? Real quick before we go.</p><p>FLOCK: Yes, I was going to say, one thing about Boeing. You know, the wisdom on Boeing had been Boeing and Airbus, these are -- these are companies you want to own because they're the big magumbas in the world -- in the air world.</p><p>But, you know, China's making planes now, Russia's making big planes. The Japanese are in there. There could be competition going down the road. Maybe not anytime real soon that there could be other players on this. So, in terms of a long-term hold, maybe Boeing, you know, is not the solid one that you thought it was.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know what? But an American company isn't going to come into your country and steal your intellectual property and steal your information.</p><p>Again, Congress is putting the hammer down on buying railcars from China. So again, because of the backdrop, because of what President Trump has done, I don't mean to digress but again, shining a light on Huawei and what Huawei's intentions are and what the communist government's intentions are around the world, in terms of stealing information and stealing intelligence and spying on the rest of the world and trying to dominate the globe, maybe China's aircraft down the road is not really the sales force that Boeing is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And no wonder they've got their own aircrafts now. They've been studying Boeing's technology for long enough. They've got the whole model and know how to build it --</p><p>FLOCK: But that's the thing, there won't be a --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- and they're doing just that in China.</p><p>FLOCK: But they won't be a buyer anymore, that's the thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>FLOCK: Maybe they'll be making their own aircraft instead of buying from us. So that kind of shrinks the market --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I would -- I would push back on that. I think they're probably going to be buying some, maybe not as many, but to rely only on their Chinese aircraft and not on Boeing I think is a stretch. I don't know. We'll have to see.</p><p>BOYD: Maria, there are airplanes that --</p><p>FLOCK: Not yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Not yet, exactly right.</p><p>BOYD: -- long way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jeff Flock, Bill Baruch and Mike Boyd, thank you, gentlemen. Good to see you all. Thank you.</p><p>President Trump just tweeted ahead of the Mueller testimony. This is what the president just said. Why didn't Robert Mueller and his band of 18 angry Democrats spend any time investigating crooked Hillary Clinton, lying and leaking James Comey, Lisa Page and her psycho lover Peter Strzok, Andy McCabe, the beautiful Ohr family, Fusion GPS, and many more, including himself and Andrew W.? Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. President Trump tweeting again this morning, ahead of the Mueller testimony. The president says this. So why didn't the highly conflicted Robert Mueller investigate how and why crooked Hillary Clinton deleted and acid washed 33,000 e-mails immediately after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress? She must have great lawyers, writes the president.</p><p>Let's not forget, those 33,000 e-mails never showed up and we know that Hillary Clinton used BleachBit to destroy her devices. I think there were more than 10 devices at one point she used a hammer to destroy them.</p><p>CUMMINS: I've never -- I'm not familiar with any federal investigation where anybody around the investigation there was a target destroyed evidence on a wholesale basis like that and was not held accountable. I'm not personally familiar with any --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and yet --</p><p>CUMMINS: That seems to be an automatic. Contrast that with 200 pages about obstruction where he had the legal authority, you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. Well, that's what I was saying. And yet today, we're talking about obstruction of justice of Donald Trump.</p><p>CUMMINS: Crazy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: God. Meanwhile, the House overwhelmingly approves a bipartisan resolution that opposes a boycott against Israel. Cheryl Casone with the details in headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Maria, the symbolic 398 to 17 vote did not have the support of three progressive Democrats, Representatives Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Omar has compared the anti-Israel resolution to boycotts of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.</p><p>Shares of Deutsche Bank under pressure in the premarket after Germany's largest bank posted a second quarter net loss of nearly $3.5 billion, stock down about 3-1/4 percent right now. The number due to a massive restructuring program aimed at returning Deutsche to profitability. Deutsche also says it's been trying to separate itself from Jeffrey Epstein in the wake of his arrest on sex trafficking charges here in the United States. Epstein has been a client since 2013. Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, God. All right, thank you so much, Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, parents pay attention, the Facebook Messenger app could be letting your children talk to strangers. Details when we come back.</p><p>And then awaiting Mueller, the special counsel goes before lawmakers in about 40 minutes. We've got like live coverage right before it. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We want to show you this video, just moments ago Robert Mueller has arrived on Capitol Hill. Of course, he's testifying today in about 35 minutes in front of the Judiciary Committee and then in front of the House Intel Committee. We're going to take that live and we are talking about that going into this hearing, Robert Mueller now on Capitol Hill has arrived as you saw those pictures and we'll be beginning his statements for this testimony coming up on Capitol Hill. It begins at 8:30. So stay with us. We're going to take it live and we'll be going into the 8:00 hour this morning with a all hands on deck approach with fantastic guests.</p><p>Meanwhile, we're looking at the other big story of the morning and that is technology, big anti-trust investigation. Facebook is under fire, a design flaw on the Messenger Kids app allows children to join group chats with strangers. This app is supposed to only green light communication with parent approved users.</p><p>Joining us now is the cyber guy Kurt Knutsson. And Kurt, of course, the big story of the morning is that A.G. Barr has started this new anti-trust inquiry into the technology giants. This is a separate situation here with this -- with this app. Tell us about it.</p><p>KURT KNUTSSON, THE CYBER GUY: We've got a lot of eye balls heading to Facebook for regulatory issues and these fines and investigations that go on. And here we are again with Mark Zuckerberg getting an F grade with this app violation where essentially the Messenger for kids app or the Messenger Kids, as it's called exactly, allowed for -- and again, just sort of like in the back seat was the idea of how this should really operate. And while Facebook calling this a technical error, the fact is, your own kids would be able to meet and speak with strangers in a group chat of friends of friends that you, while it said you should approve them as a parent, had no ability to approve them.</p><p>So Facebook said they fixed the problem at this point but guess what? Will it affect the stock? Probably not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we'll see if this investigation affects the stock and the entire industry --</p><p>KNUTSSON: That might.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- given the fact that this is -- this is a deep dive, according to the A.G. and the Wall Street Journal this morning.</p><p>KNUTSSON: We'll see the -- we'll see the effects of that. But you look at even the $5 billion fine proposed from the FTC and now $100 billion proposed fine from the SEC We're talking about a little tiny bump in the road for Facebook. This is meaningless to a company generating the kind of revenues that they're doing and the stock price now sitting right at I think 210, $200.10.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Kurt, thank you so much. Kurt Knutsson joining us there, cyber guy</p><p>KNUTSSON: Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Still ahead, all eyes on Mueller, all hands on deck here, the former special counsel going before lawmakers in about 30 minutes. We've got live coverage in the next hour, right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, stay with us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019072402cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN1-BR61-JB20-G096-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8220\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 24, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

It is state-of- the-art and we are launching it right now, right here, joining the conversation this morning, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Rosecliff CEO, managing partner, Mike Murphy, and former U.S. attorney, Bud Cummins.</p><p>Also on deck this morning, we got former federal prosecutor and FOX News contributor, Andrew McCarthy, for a preview of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's testimony later this morning, S4 Capital executive chairman and former WPP CEO, Sir Martin Sorrell is here, to talk about Britain's new prime minister.</p><p>Arizona congressman and member of the House Judiciary Committee, Andy Biggs, joining us this morning, also to discuss Mueller, and my exclusive interview with the CEO of Six Flags chairman Jim Reid-Anderson.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it, big show ahead in the brand new studio, Dagen, congratulations to us.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: This is one of my favorite views, well, one of you -- but, of radio city --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's right, good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- looking up six (INAUDIBLE) so that's behind us, and we have a brand new desk, and I'm wearing sweatpants.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, you are not.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, no, no. I even have my -- I even have proper shoes on. Again, it's like the old Bugs Bunny cartoon with Elmer Fudd, you have to have your proper outfit on or attire, or your personality changes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, there's a camera over there, so we're still be able to check out your hot shoes that --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I didn't --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- you have on all of the time.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What row? I didn't know that. I'm glad I did not make that mistake.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO &amp; MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF: This is amazing and you deserve it. I was out with friends last night in New York City at Elio's, on the Upper East Side, five finance-type people all say hello, all big fans of you, big fans of the show and you deserve this. It's awesome.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great. Thank you so much.</p><p>MURPHY: Congratulations.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. No, it feels good.</p><p>BUD CUMMINS, FORMER ATTORNEY OF THE UNITED STATES: And for -- and for the bigger guys, I kind of like having the counter. The last time I was here, you're exposed all the way down. You have to kind of make sure your suits fit just right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we are glad you're here. We've got a focus on Mueller this morning, and we want to get your take on what to expect. The former special counsel going before lawmakers in about two hours, 8:30 a.m. Eastern is when it starts. He'll be accompanied by a key aid, Aaron Zebley, who worked with Mueller during his nearly two-year investigation.</p><p>This will be the first time Mr. Mueller is answering questions about the probe. President Trump commented on it yesterday. Here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No collusion, no obstruction. Oh, that's not good enough, let's go more, $40 million, interview 500 people, they've got nothing, 2,500 subpoenas, they did everything. They're collusion, no collusion. They have no collusion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We've been talking about this for a long time. Bud, what are you expecting?</p><p>CUMMINS: Theater, political theater, I don't think there'll be any new information that comes up, Robert Mueller is a smart guy, and I think the Democrats are going to just try and cut some campaign ads. That they're going to --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but what about --</p><p>CUMMINS: -- try to get him to read from the report and make clips out of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about the Republicans? I mean, the Republicans will want to know if Mueller focused, at all, on the origins of the Russia investigation, why we've been having our heads on fire for three years about collusion, when we knew from the get-go, certainly this group did, that there was no collusion and it was a setup.</p><p>CUMMINS: Sure there's a series of questions that he'll be asked and I don't expect -- I think he'll dodge them, but I hope he answers them, the questions --</p><p>You know, frankly, I was on your show for the first time, talking about this, around the time he was appointed, and we were already seeing that the basis for the allegations seemed to be falling apart, but yet within a month of his appointment, he already had 13 lawyers appointed on -- he was gearing up for something big.</p><p>And I'd like to know what he thought he was gearing up for, because it seemed pretty apparent that the Russian collusion story was falling apart within weeks of his appointment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thirteen lawyers, which is one of the questions, I think --</p><p>CUMMINS: Which become 19 --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- that the Republicans want to ask. How did you come -- how did you come to this group? Given the fact that so many of them were either Clinton donors, Clinton fans, they worked with the Clinton global initiative, I mean, it was pretty extraordinary, his group, that was so bipartisan.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That might be one of the only --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Part bipartisan rather.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- questions from the Republicans that he might be willing to answer, but if he gets grilled about the predicate of the counterintelligence probe within the FBI, about the evidentiary basis of it, about the use of the Steele dossier.</p><p>Again, how it wound up being used to spy -- funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and used to spy on her opponent. I doubt he will answer any of those questions. And the Republicans need to be careful, as well, that they don't overplay their hand.</p><p>Again, if they try to turn it into theater and Mueller says nothing in his answer, then that can reflect badly upon them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you're absolutely right.</p><p>MURPHY: It's amazing that we're at this point now from where it started and you've been calling it the whole way that it's kind of a hoax. And now that we're here, and now coming at them from both sides, I mean, it is -- you couldn't have scripted a better Hollywood story.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's unbelievable.</p><p>MURPHY: It's amazing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: it's not Hollywood. The Wall Street Journal editorial page calls it a summer rerun, that basically, the -- it's a flagging T.V. show and they're bringing in a celebrity guest, the Democrats are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I like the way that piece started. There's nothing better for ratings than a celebrity -- a celebrity guest --</p><p>MCDOWELL: But he's Charo, I mean, he's not going to really boost the ratings, I'd date myself by saying that.</p><p>CUMMINS: But what's critical, and I hope that people try to understand this, is the special counsel -- I was a United States attorney, special counsel is basically United States attorney that wasn't appointed by the president, he's being asked to investigate. And he had the same job, the same powers.</p><p>There's nothing about that job that says you go out and investigate somebody, don't find a crime, and then write a lengthy unflattering report and release into the public. If I'd have done that to anybody, I'd have been fired in 20 seconds.</p><p>And so, there's -- this is not a criminal investigation, at that point, it becomes political, and it's very obvious that that report was written for political purposes, to me, I don't think there's any real explanation, especially for volume two, the obstruction stuff to me, ludicrous.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the inappropriate claim that he didn't -- the report did not exonerate President Trump. That was highly inappropriate. The Democrats are going to try and play off of that. But I read the entire Mueller report, and you have --</p><p>And I've said this before, you have an FBI investigation, a Mueller investigation that went ahead, that were not obstructed. You have no witnesses interfered with, 500 search warrants, and the Mueller team interviewed anybody they wanted to, even people within the White House.</p><p>That's not obstruction. And 21 percent of Americans, only 21 percent, want impeachment hearings started. The Democrats to try to move the needle on that, good luck, not happening.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's a new reporting this morning from John Solomon about Mifsud. And in the -- in the Mueller report, Joseph Mifsud is referred to as a Russian operative. We knew that was questionable.</p><p>We've known that was questionable for a long time, we have George Papadopoulos on my \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" program earlier this year, who told us the whole story about Joseph Mifsud and how he dropped the bomb in his lap and said oh, the Russians have e-mails from Hillary Clinton. We're going to get to that, that's coming up in the program.</p><p>But even as this -- Mueller testifies today, there's new information coming up about the origins of the Russia investigation, and why the left just basically inserted Donald Trump into Russia meddling in the -- in the west. We want to look at that this morning.</p><p>We're also looking at big tech, big technologies under fire, the Department of Justice, opening an antitrust review into certain technology companies likely affecting Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple, Mike, your reaction to this?</p><p>MURPHY: All trading down a little bit this morning, but if you remember, Google went through something very similar a few years ago. I don't think there's too much here, really. It's important that they look into them. It's important that we understand that it's a fair business environment.</p><p>But when you look at them, I mean, think about Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, there's enough competition amongst these four, and then there's other new technology companies that we talk about often that are coming into the frame now.</p><p>So, I don't think there's too much there. There may be something for the government needs to look, I think, but I don't think it's going to have too much of an impact, and remember, Microsoft was the first big tech company to go through this, made it through unscathed, then look at them now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Even though -- even though Google does control 90 percent of search, that's the market share, and I know this is about privacy, this is about censoring conservatives, but the market share on Google, it's, I mean, 90 percent.</p><p>MURPHY: It is, and then you can go to Google not working with the U.S. government, and working with the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>MURPHY: -- Chinese government, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's that.</p><p>MURPHY: -- there's -- Google has more exposure than anyone else there, but I think, again, they've been down this road before and they were able to come out of it without any issues and I think the same will happen here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Bud might be able to weigh in on this, but I think that, in terms of, it might not be legal action by the justice department, but ultimately, the Federal Trade Commission, I think, is going to prevent a lot.</p><p>It is going to take a closer look at any acquisition that these large companies make, because what they've been doing, not just say, Facebook buying Instagram or WhatsApp, but they go out and buy small companies, small companies, small companies, just to gobble up the talent, and basic - -</p><p>A lot of times, they'll buy the company and then not do anything with the technology, so that does inhibit growth in this country in terms of innovation and even exploration.</p><p>One other story that was in the Journal, and this is, again, the regulatory pressure on these companies, Bill Barr, the attorney general, is reopening the debate over whether tech companies Apple and Facebook, should be required to provide law enforcement agencies with a way to break encryption on devices and apps used by terrorists, drug cartels and other criminal suspects.</p><p>Barr said yesterday, warrant proof encryption was enabling dangerous criminals to cloak their communications and activities behind an essentially impenetrable digital shield. This is the San Bernardino terrorism case where Apple basically went to court to fight the FBI from having to rewrite code and open the device. This is a huge, huge issue for tech companies going forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it sure is, and the privacy issues and the breaches happen every day. We continue to get more evidence of these breaches and how they're handling our information.</p><p>CUMMINS: But if they open it up for terrorist investigations, pretty soon they'll be also investigating financial people and bankers, and lawyers, so you know, it's a --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Slippery slope.</p><p>CUMMINS: -- slippery slope.</p><p>MURPHY: Ad if they do that, I think the criminals are ones who are going to figure out a way around it or the next way to do it without being tracked.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is what Apple said from the get-go, we don't want to have a back door because once there's a back door, there's a back door.</p><p>CUMMINS: There's a -- and they want to use it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: For others to get in.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I was just going to say, but you go into -- investigate a pedophile, and if their phone is locked, their computer is locked, there is nothing you can do about it.</p><p>And I know the Manhattan district attorney, Cy Vance, has talked to you about that very thing, about they have cases where they can't really pursue these criminals, even these pedophiles, because they can't get access to the information on their devices.</p><p>CUMMINS: But we've got FISA warrants to chase terrorists, not Carter Page, but we chase Carter Page with one, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>CUMMINS: -- that's the problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good point, because the team -- the FBI and the DOJ were using our terrorism tools, informants, you know, spying and wiretapping, these are things we use for terrorists. They were using it on Donald Trump.</p><p>CUMMINS: How do you not use a tool that's on the table --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Just incredible.</p><p>CUMMINS: -- if you think you're doing something you should be --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Real quick on Boeing, we got to get to Boeing earnings. It's going to be a market mover. The aerospace giant expected to release the second quarter numbers in the hour, investors are watching closely. Given the company's problems with the 737 Max jet, the potential impact it could have on Friday's GDP numbers, as well.</p><p>And Mike, I want to get your comment here, but also, on Caterpillar. Caterpillar is basically giving you an indication of the global economy, particularly China as well.</p><p>MURPHY: Exactly, more of a (INAUDIBLE) on Caterpillar, Boeing, I think, is specific to the 737s and how they're going talk about their orders going forward. But remember, Boeing stock has rallied a little bit more than 10 percent, leading into these earnings announcement, although, its traded off since the news it has rallied.</p><p>Caterpillar is going to be interesting because they should give us a good read on China, what's going on over in China. And, again, I think the U.S. will carry Caterpillar, but the international markets, I don't expect much from.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll keep watching that. We've got a lot on the show this morning. We'll take a quick break.</p><p>When we come back, extreme weather, the incredible moment a tornado rips the roof off of a motel, we've got the pictures, wait until you see this mayhem, and then earnings on tap, Boeing, Caterpillar, AT&amp;T, among the heavy hitters reporting this morning, all of the numbers and the impact, coming up. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Puerto Rico's governor, reportedly resigning today, Cheryl Casone on headlines right now, Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. Well, massive cheers in Puerto Rico, on news that Governor Ricardo Rossello is stepping down.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well, a Puerto Rican newspaper, the main one there, has reported that the embattled governor is going to resign today, after a week of massive protests there. Leaked messages from within Rossello's inner circle revealed insensitive comments.</p><p>On Sunday, he announced he will not seek re-election next year, but he vowed, at the time, to stay in office. We're waiting for the developments out of there.</p><p>Back here, in the U.S., the northeast is cleaning up this morning after severe storms slammed the region. Cape Cod, Massachusetts hit with two very rare tornadoes. And then, take a look at this, a tornado completely ripped off a hotel roof, terrifying the guests that were -- yes, on vacation there. Luckily, nobody was hurt.</p><p>Well, investors are liking what they're seeing in Chipotle's latest earnings, the stock rallied in overnight trading after the company's second quarter profit and same-store sales topped expectations. Chipotle, which you're seeing, certainly share problems with food safety, also raised guidance for the year. So, a little bit of a turnaround there.</p><p>Shares of Snap, by the way, sharply higher in premarket trading, we should add. After the bell, the Snapchat parent reported a smaller than expected loss on revenue that beat the street's forecast. There's the stock in the premarket, 10 and a quarter percent to the upside. User growth, by the way, hit a record. That was one of the concerns from investors, so they're gaining new users.</p><p>UPS is soon going to begin Sunday pickup and delivery, keeping up with their rival, FedEx. UPS is going to start working seven days a week in January. The two largest carriers are under pressure to speed up deliveries as, of course, long-time customer, Amazon, is building out its own transportation systems with its own planes.</p><p>UPS is set to report earnings at 7:00 a.m. We're going to bring you those numbers as soon as they come in, Maria, and those are your headlines this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Cheryl, great. All right, we'll take a short break. When we come back, Tech Rec, shares of big technology tumbling this morning, after the Department of Justice announces a massive antitrust investigation into whether or not these companies are actually too big.</p><p>Then, caught on camera, the heart-stopping moment, a bison charges at a little girl and launches her into the air. Look at this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. AT&amp;T is reporting earnings that are in line with expectations right now. You'll see it on the tape in a moment. Meanwhile, we're looking at a big crack down on big technology.</p><p>Shares of Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google, parent company, Alphabet, all under pressure this morning, after the Department of Justice announced a broad antitrust review aimed at investigating whether these companies stifle competition.</p><p>This comes as several of these big tech companies will be reporting earnings this week and next, joining us right now, to talk more about that, is Payne Capital Management president, Ryan Payne, and Applico CEO, Alex Moazed, and it's great to see both gentlemen, thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>RYAN PAYNE, PRESIDENT, PAYNE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, I guess, let me start with you Ryan, because the stocks are under pressure this morning, as an investor, what do you want to do when you come in and the top story in the Journal this morning is this major antitrust inquiry into tech?</p><p>PAYNE: I mean, down 1-1/2 percent isn't exactly major pressure, Maria.</p><p>So, I think it also tells you the market is not overly concerned about it. But I'm just hard-pressed to think any of these stocks or companies or monopoly, I mean, for instance, Amazon is literally half the revenue of Wal-Mart, so it's hard to justify that they have a monopoly on e-commerce sales or, you know, any sort of retail sales in general.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You wonder -- you wonder, Alex, if you know, this antitrust investigation trips over other things, I mean, as we speak, Congressmen Devin Nunes is suing Twitter for censoring his conversation for taking his posts down and leaving others up, which are similar in nature, you've got the president saying that he doesn't get fair -- treated fairly.</p><p>So, I know that the antitrust app -- the antitrust investigation, when you look at, you know, dominance, Amazon may not be dominant. What about tripping into other things?</p><p>ALEX MOAZED, CEO, APPLICO: Well, I think that's exactly what this antitrust review is looking at is, how do these tech platform monopolies, they absolutely are monopolies, how do they compete or thwart the producers, the suppliers, the content creators on a Twitter, on a YouTube, on a Facebook. The websites on a Google search, the sellers on an Amazon.</p><p>And that absolutely is where they get in trouble. That's what basically what Microsoft got in trouble within the 90s.</p><p>MURPHY: So much of Apple's revenue and their whole business is built around iPhone, yet there's so many smartphones out there from Google to Samsung, so would you call Apple a monopoly, or is it because the Apple store, how do you look at that?</p><p>MOAZED: Basically, all of these platform industries have a winner take all dynamic, which means there's one or two given winners, so there's iOS and Android, and they absolutely control 95 percent of all of the actual operating systems in mobile.</p><p>And then you look at, there's an article in the Wall Street Journal, this morning, about Apple get favoring its own apps, versus other third party app developers in the app store, which is the same thing as Google, favoring its own content over Yelp and TripAdvisor and many other sites.</p><p>And this is where they get in trouble, when they vertically integrate or they compete unfairly with the producers that are supposed to be contributing value or content or apps into the platform's ecosystem. That's kind of what you would call, maybe, being greedy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And it would be in previous years, unthinkable, maybe, that a Republican administration at a Republican White House would have its justice department reviewing companies in this way, but not with this president. Because, again, he has a view --</p><p>He has talked about these large tech companies in the same way that Elizabeth Warren has talked about them, in terms of their overriding power and that they've got too much power and too few hands, so --</p><p>CUMMINS: Well, their signal, not only in the attorney general's comments, but if you read it, you know, the FTC and DOJ, they haven't just had one meeting about this. Apparently, there's been a series of meetings and negotiations.</p><p>You know, it's not just the -- well, let's have a meeting about antitrust so we can check that box and say we -- this is something they're working on, and they -- and they -- and they put a lot of energy into. So, I think something will come out of it.</p><p>I don't know. I'm not an antitrust guy, and I'm certainly not a big tech guy, so I don't know what the potential remedies might be if they found problems. I'd be interested -- you know, what do you think is worse case for them, what might happen?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because when the president joined us about two weeks ago or so, I said to him, Mr. President, you would rather see competition, right, or do you want to -- because you would think as Republicans want competition to come into the market place before any regulation.</p><p>And the president was very clear, he said, you know what? We might need legislation that will lead to competition.</p><p>MOAZED: Yes. I think, so, I mean, look, there's a spectrum and Warren isn't even on the spectrum, OK? So, the prospect of breaking these up, I don't think is realistic, what is realistic is regulation that says Zuckerberg just calls for this in June.</p><p>We don't know where the line is between taking abusive or hateful speech off of our platform versus violating free speech. Literally, wants to be regulated and this is the role of government to lay out those lines about what's appropriate versus what is then violating free speech, and no one has done that yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ryan, jump in here, talk about the investor case for these stocks here, when you put a portfolio together, how much of it wants to -- do you want focused on tech?</p><p>PAYNE: Well, first off, I mean, all of these companies are going to literally double the revenue or they have, over the last 12 months, so, obviously, they're still growing rapidly. I think it's definitely the momentum trade right now. I mean, even if you own the S&amp;P 500 right now, it's kind of like a tech fund and drag, 30 percent tech right now.</p><p>So, I think, you know, there's a lot of money pouring into the S&amp;P 500, managers have to keep up with the index, so I think a lot of money is going to keep pouring into these stocks. I don't think they're the best value on the overall market, but I think there's momentum trade absolutely, and these stocks have room to run here, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we might join --</p><p>MURPHY: Just -- yes, as an investor, you know, all due respect to President Trump, but I would rather, these companies police themselves and I don't want government --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really, though?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dagen, you've been saying it for three years.</p><p>MOAZED: Good luck with that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do something about it. Don't let people murder their children - -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- on Facebook live video streaming because the government's going to come after you because they've been so reckless with people's information. This was not about Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>This was about a business scheme designed by the management, for years, to basically grow the user base, it's like oh, these app developers will give you access not just to friends, people's information, but the information of their friends, and we'll kind of -- and not really tell people that that's going on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It went on for years. That's how they got as big as they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a good point. I mean, they're going to have to start policing themselves at some point. Alex, thank you so much --</p><p>MOAZED: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- for joining us, Ryan, great to have you as well.</p><p>PAYNE: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We showed you AT&amp;T earnings on the screen, a few minutes ago. Quarterly numbers are pretty much in line or better on the revenue side, Lauren Simonetti with all of the numbers and analysis, Lauren, good morning.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, Maria, AT&amp;T just crossing in line, EPS, $0.89 a share, a slight beat on revenue, coming in at $44.95 billion versus the estimate of $44.85 billion. AT&amp;T CEO says that company is on track to deliver on all priorities this year.</p><p>Free cash flow, that's important, $8.8 billion, of course, they have to pay down some debt from that Time Warner acquisition and put that money towards the streaming service. HBO Max, which is set to come out at some point, possibly this spring of 2020, so listening on the call which is in two hours from now, for anything that the company has to say about that, specifically.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, the stock is down about a third of the percent. Thank you so much, Lauren. We'll take a break. When we come back, Robert Mueller is taking the stand today. We are previewing the former special counsel's highly anticipated hearing all morning this morning, what you need to know, how President Trump is reacting, all of that coming up.</p><p>And then a hero's victory, the Senate approves extending the 9/11 victims fund. The moment between Jon Stewart and Senator Mitch McConnell goes viral. Check this out, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, July 24th.</p><p>Your top stories right now. 6:33 a.m. on East Coast. Mueller on hot seat this morning. His highly anticipated testimony on Capitol Hill, now just hours away. We're taking a look at what to expect this morning.</p><p>And who could be disappointed when it all said and done. Another big day for earnings this morning. We got two big ones. Dow Component's Boeing and Caterpillar set to report the usually are market movers. Of course, for Boeing, we're taking a look at the effect of the grounding of the 737 MAX jet. We'll bring you the numbers and full analysis.</p><p>Caterpillar does move markets. That's a good indicator of China in global economy. Ahead of earnings and Mueller testimony, Futures this morning are indicating a lower opening for the broader averages. Dow Futures down 63, S&amp;P down eight, and the Nasdaq Futures lower by 45.</p><p>Stocks rally ending the day near session highs yesterday. Meanwhile, pretty good day. Take a look, Dow Industrials up 177 points yesterday, two-thirds of one percent. The S&amp;P was up 20 points, and the Nasdaq was higher by 47 at the closed on wall street yesterday.</p><p>In Europe this morning, take a look at the momentum and it is mixed. They've got the FT-100 following Wall Street lower down 65 points, almost one percent. The CAC Quarante in Paris down 29, but the DAX Index in Germany is higher up about 30 points. We have a round of weak PMI data out of France and Germany. That's the Purchasing Managers Index's indicates manufacturing slowing down.</p><p>In the U.K., of course, Boris Johnson will become prime minister later today. In Asia overnight, most of the markets saw gains on renewed U.S.- China trade talks except South Korea as you can see there.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour is the testimony of Robert Mueller. Former special counsel Bob Mueller set to appear before the House Judiciary Committee in two hours' time. Later, he will be appearing before the House Intelligence Committee after speaking with the Judiciary.</p><p>President Trump and House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler spoke out before the testimony.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: How about this whole witch hunt that's going on, shall I talk about it for a second? First of all, it's very bad for our country, makes it very hard to deal with Russia, and we should be able, they are nuclear power, they have a big country. And we should be able to deal with them without having this artificial stuff.</p><p>They interviewed 500 people. Listen to this, 2,500 subpoenas. They did everything. The collusion, no collusion. They have no collusion.</p><p>REP. JERROLD NADLER (D-NY): Mueller investigation revealed a lot of conduct by the president which the American people should be aware of. The president and the attorney general have systematically lied to the American people that what was in that report.</p><p>I know, they have said no obstruction, no collusion, he was totally exonerated, although those three statements are not true. It's important that the American people understand what was in that report, and then we'll go from there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, Robert Mueller's longtime aide Aaron Zebley, will also appear beside the former special counsel. He will not be able to answer questions but can advise Mueller.</p><p>Joining us right now is former federal prosecutor, Fox News contributor Andrew McCarthy. And Andrew, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>ANDREW MCCARTHY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Morning Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we've talked a lot about this over the last 2-1/2 years. First, your thoughts on his aide being there with him, Zebley?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, you know, I think it's a bad look for Mueller, because the wrap on the investigation, at least, one of the wraps on it was that he was very staff directed, and that he was more or less a hands-off detached figurehead, while all these staffers who -- you know, are known for or notorious for being pretty aggressive Democratic activists, or at least, a lot of them did the laboring more on the investigation.</p><p>So, having this happen, I'm curious about why he would allow it to look that way. In terms of the substance of it, I don't know, Maria that it makes a lot of difference because he's been directed to do what he really wants to do, which is confine himself to the four corners of the report.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY: So, in that sense, it shouldn't matter whether it's one guy, two guys, 10 guys doing the testifying. If all he can talk about is the report, the report says what it says.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about you Bud Cummins, former U.S. attorney, how do you see it?</p><p>CUMMINS: You know, the first thing is there's nothing prosecutorial about this whole exercise. I'd like to hear what Andrew if he agrees with me, but there is no -- there is nothing in the job that he did or the job that I did that involves providing Congress with all this data that you derived in a confidential criminal investigation using all the intrusive tools.</p><p>We used the special counsel in my view is kind of turned himself into almost a fourth branch of government, a truth commission and Congress is being allowed to grab all that information for political purposes.</p><p>So, you know, I think -- I think the whole process is flawed and it's wrong, but we're going to do it. And I think, the fact that he's going to have an aide there is really just going to be the difference between a mad man to turnaround behind him and ask people what page am I supposed to be on and ask the guy sitting next to him.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're saying because the report was written so many levels below him.</p><p>CUMMINS: Right. And Andrew raised a good question. How much -- how much did the staff thrive this, and how much maybe was even played? Because you know, I really questioned the correctness of including volume to at all. And I wonder if Mueller was completely behind that or if he -- if he -- you know arbitrator to dispute on his staff and gave in? It'd be interesting to know that but he's not going to tell anybody that today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Andrew?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes, well, I think the reason volume two is there is because the staff which ran this investigation did the probe under a different understanding of obstruction law than what the Justice Department traditionally would follow, particularly in connection with the president of the United States.</p><p>And when Attorney General Barr was confirmed and took over at the Justice Department.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: I think it became clear that they were going -- the Justice Department was going to insist on a traditional understanding of obstruction which means there has to be tampering with witnesses or tampering with evidence.</p><p>You can't go after the president on obstruction for the exercise of his constitutional prerogatives.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: And I think for Mueller's purposes, that's where it broke down. That's why you get this equivocation about, \"Well I didn't charge him but I'm not exonerating him.\" They investigated on a bogus theory, I think.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Andy touched on this -- Hey, Andy its Dagen. A little bit.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Hi, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But this is why Mueller's performance today is so important. Does he seem to have a good grasp of the facts? Does he come across clear- minded that statement that he made was a little off and awkward? And it will raise the issue if he doesn't have -- if he's not in charge of information.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And can give a clear reason to explanation about what's in the report and why the team made the decisions that they did? Then, he's going to run into some problems and it's going to open a lot of doors for the Republicans that they might not expect.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's going to be real transparent. In fact, one thing that is becoming more and more transparent is something John Solomon reported yesterday from The Hill, and that is the John Durham's team. This is the person in charge of the origins of the investigation, investigation.</p><p>He is looking to interview Joseph Mifsud. Now, Mifsud reportedly was tasked with giving former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos access to Russian Intel, dealing with Hillary Clinton's e-mails. Back in May, George Papadopoulos joined me on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\". And I asked him about his meeting with Mifsud back in Rome. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, he tells you Russia has e-mails of Hillary Clinton's and this is the bomb that you feel was the whole reason that they wanted you to go to Rome to meet him because he -- they wanted him to tell you about these e-mails that Russia had of Hillary Clinton. Is that right?</p><p>GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS, FORMER CAMPAIGN ADVISER TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: That's absolutely correct. I think this person was some sort of plans for years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They wanted you to go back and tell Trump about Russia having Hillary Clinton e-mails.</p><p>PAPADOPOULOS: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Did you do that?</p><p>PAPADOPOULOS: Absolutely not. That wasn't my job.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you told the FBI you believe you met him in March when, in fact, you met him in April. And that was the perjury, so you went to jail for what? How many nights?</p><p>PAPADOPOULOS: I went to jail for 11 nights because of this, after I had honey pots, money thrown my way, wiretaps, surveillance by foreign countries, and then, I finally get caught in some perjury trap, and I go to jail for 11 nights. It was ridiculous. BARTIROMO: And you feel that this was entrapment.</p><p>PAPADOPOULOS: Absolutely. I feel it was entrapment. And I'm very happy to see Congressman Devin Nunes and the letter that he sent to Secretary Pompeo and Gina Haspel to get more information on this person, Mifsud.</p><p>Because if it's indeed proven that this person was really entrapping me, not even spying on me, and then there was a coordinated effort between these other various intelligence agencies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>PAPADOPOULOS: Including the DIA and Australians, to extract this fake information, and then spy on me with another honey pot in London with Halper.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>PAPADOPOULOS: This thing reeks of spying, entrapment and illegal and illicit behavior.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Andrew, this is really what we're talking about the origins of the investigation. Here is a guy, George Papadopoulos. He was working for Ben Carson. Ben Carson pulls out of the race. He then -- he gets an outreach on LinkedIn from this international center of law practice. I've never heard of it, but they reach out.</p><p>MCCARTHY: That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We love your work, we want you to come to work here. He takes the job, he's got nothing else to do. He just pulled out of the Ben Carson campaign. He works at him a month into it, and he realized this is not for me, I don't want to work here. He gives them his two-week notice. Says, I'm quitting, I want to go work for Donald Trump, I'm going to go who join his campaign. They say, wait, before you quit, we want to send you to Rome, we have a lot of important people for you to meet.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: One of those people was Joseph Mifsud.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes, I'm really glad that you're homed in on him because I think Mifsud is the unexplored, very interesting character in this whole narrative. You know, another very interesting thing, Maria, is Mueller's team or, at least, the FBI, I should say because this was before Mueller was involved.</p><p>The FBI actually interviewed Mifsud after they interviewed Papadopoulos. He denies having told Papadopoulos about e-mails. And I mention this only because if there's one thing that we learned during this investigation, it's that Mueller knows how to bring a false statements case.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's incredible.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yet, no one brought a false statement case against this guy --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: -- whose story is what Papadopoulos's narrative is base on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And it's important because if we do find out that he actually worked with Western intelligence, then we know that it was entrapment. He's not some Russian oligarch, he's a guy who was hired by the FBI.</p><p>It's good to see you, Andrew. Thank you.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Andrew McCarthy. Special coverage of this highly anticipated hearing, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The Senate overwhelmingly voting in favor of extending the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. Cheryl Casone on headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: That's right Maria, the bill guarantees ongoing funding for 9/11 first responders. This photo we're going to show you now captured, we should say, kind of awkward moment when Senate Majority Mitch McConnell passed Jon Stewart before that vote happened. McConnell did not stop to talk to Stewart who, of course, has been a very outspoken advocate for 9/11 First Responders. The (INAUDIBLE) Stewart is embracing John (INAUDIBLE) who was a worker at the World Trade Center site, and also long-time activist. That was after the vote's emotional pictures there.</p><p>Well offices (INAUDIBLE) company, WeWork, is looking to go public sooner than expected. They are aiming for September now, according to the Wall Street Journal. WeWork was recently valued at $47 billion in a private fund-raising round. It was reported last week that cofounder, Adam Newman, took in at least 700 million from selling some of his interest in the company and taking out loans against his remaining shares, we shall see.</p><p>And then, this is video, that I'm not sure how to describe this guy -- it's gone viral. It's just -- a 9-year-old girl was launched in the air by a charging bison; this happened at Yellowstone on Monday afternoon. Caught on camera. There was a big group of people that were on a trail that were walking probably a little too close to the bison, we can assume here. She was not seriously injured; she was checked out, she was with her parents who I think is who's running away from -- the daughter and the bison. It takes my breath away. Anyway.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Where are the parents?</p><p>CASONE: I think those were the parents that were running away.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.</p><p>CASONE: That's the point here. And that also, they were on a trail with about 50 people. You're supposed to stay a minimum of 25 yards away from any wildlife -- any wildlife in Yellowstone, so why were they that close?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You say they stand around during docile? You were there --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They did. I'm in there. And -- you know, I've got my picture made in front of me -- most of the time you can approach him and they just kind of stand there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: God how scary.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The elk are dangerous too. I mean, they're real live animals; it's not Disneyland.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks, Cheryl. Coming up, the big business of fun. My exclusive interview with the Six Flags CEO on company earnings and how to keep excitement fresh for whole family -- good indicator of whether or not people are spending money on these kinds of things. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. It's the season for theme parks. Six Flags facing some new competition but not slowing down. The company reporting its eighth consecutive year of record financial performance last year, helped in part by a growing membership program. The company reported earnings earlier today. A miss in earnings, but a beat on revenue. Joining me right now in an exclusive Fox Business Interview with Six Flags President, Chairman and CEO Jim Reid Anderson. And Jim, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>JIM REID ANDERSON, CEO, SIX FLAGS: Great to be back, Maria. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us. So first, characterize the quarter for us. What did you see?</p><p>ANDERSON: It's a record quarter. We saw improvements across every metric from attendance, revenue -- and EPS all growing between six and eight percent. It's the best second quarter in the company's history, and I want to point out that we just finished our ninth record year. So, our goal is to head for number 10 and that's what we're working towards.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's terrific. Congratulations!</p><p>ANDERSON: Yes, very strong quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, we've got a pretty good back drop in terms of the economy so that's part of it, but you think it's also partly because of the membership program that you've put in place.</p><p>ANDERSON: We have made a lot of changes to our programming and in essence membership allows people to get this value offering, pay monthly, and we don't have to have them renew seasons passes every year; they just stay with us. So, membership now represents about 25 percent -- not reoccurring revenue about 25 percent of the total guest revenue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a big number.</p><p>ANDERSON: And it's grown, you know, from 20 percent last quarter. So, rapidly improving and that brings stability, and consistency and you know that's really important to us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now, the analyst reports this morning there are -- a lot of them are focusing on international business, the stock was down, after you reported. Because of that, I think partly people are wondering what's going to happen with China, given this China fight between the U.S. and China, and you're getting the necessary approvals for the theme park there. Tell us about it.</p><p>ANDERSON: So, we have multiple parks across the world. So, in total 12, that we're working on, 11 of them are in China. And we are making progress in getting those approvals very nicely, so it takes while as you know with the macroeconomic issues there and the trade fight that's going on and just getting government approvals as government -- local governments change. But we're making progress and we've seen improvement there. So, we saw growth everywhere. We saw growth domestically; we saw it internationally. It was a good quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you pointed out to me during the commercial break that even the international revenue portion is just a small portion of overall revenue.</p><p>ANDERSON: Yes, it's three percent of our total revenue. And when you look at nine record years, and very strong growth in the second quarter, I think we're set up for another record year. That's our goal certainly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, have you been impacted at all by China-U.S. fight? Do you think that --</p><p>ANDERSON: Yes, I think that's part of why, you know, we saw that impact towards the end of last year. But you know, when you look at our business, Maria, we have five initiatives, international is the fifth of the initiatives and we're seeing growth in all of those initiatives. Very, very strong growth. And innovation is in our DNA and we bring news in every park, every year, and we've done that again this year in our North American parks where we've seen fantastic performance.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know you got to keep innovating. Freshening it up.</p><p>ANDERSON: Yes, you have to do it regularly. And I would add one more thing, which I think you know: we've got a dividend yield. So, we're getting growth. We saw revenue growth of eight percent, right? Think about this seven, eight percent consistently.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good number.</p><p>ANDERSON: And then on top of that, we've got a dividend yield of 6.2 percent. Think about that combo: growth and yield fantastic.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is a nice good yield. Jim, it's great to have you.</p><p>ANDERSON: Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much.</p><p>ANDERSON: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll be watching the story. Jim Reid Anderson from Six Flags there. Still ahead, big day for earnings. Boeing and Caterpillar among the Dow components reporting their quarterly numbers today. UPS also on deck. All of the numbers plus everything you need to know ahead of Robert Mueller's testimony. It's all right here next hour in MORNINGS WITH MARIA. back in a moment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

And no business person carries more heft in India - known for its complicated bureaucracy and red tape - than Ambani.<br/> Better to cooperate \"I suspect the government somewhere is signalling that it's better for multinational companies to come in with some Indian partner,\" said Arun Kumar, an economist and the Malcolm Adiseshiah Chair at the Institute of Social Sciences. \"So Amazon might decide it is better to cooperate with Reliance than compete against it.\"<br/> The 63-year-old Indian tycoon has identified technology and retail as future growth areas in a pivot away from the energy businesses he inherited from his father, who died in 2002. Retail is the next frontier for Ambani, whose ambitions include creating a home-grown e-commerce giant like China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.<br/> Silicon Valley's ambitions in the country represent a threat to Ambani's ability to achieve such dominance in his home market, but winning their cooperation, with all the know-how and global reach it brings, could help him achieve it faster. That aligns with the emphasis Modi has been placing on developing India's local economy.<br/><br/> More With its attention to retail, Reliance bolsters its Future prospects \u00a0Life's Mantra In one 33-minute address to the nation recently, Modi used the word self-reliance 17 times.<br/> \"The corona crisis has taught us the value of local manufacturing, local markets and local supply chains,\" Modi went on to say. \"Local is not only our need it is also our responsibility. Time has taught us that we will simply have to make local our life's mantra.\"<br/> Even so, India is increasingly important to Silicon Valley because it is a one billion-plus person market that's still largely untapped. China is dominated by homegrown e-commerce players and largely shuts out global tech companies, while established markets in the West offer limited growth opportunities.<br/> Though Amazon is already India's largest e-commerce player, its ability to compete with domestic firms was hamstrung by an abrupt rule change in 2018 that limited foreign players to operating as e-Bay style marketplaces, rather than selling their own stock.<br/> Entering e-commerce Not long after, Ambani announced that his own sprawling conglomerate, Reliance Industries, would make an entry into e-commerce, leveraging its control of both India's largest mobile carrier and biggest network of brick-and-mortar stores.<br/> In response, Amazon tried to bolster its presence on the ground with an investment in India's second biggest physical retailer, cash-strapped Future Group. But the rules restricting foreign ownership in that sector meant its investment was too little to halt Future Group's slide into financial distress.<br/> Last month, it was Ambani who was waiting to snap up the majority of the company's operations for $3.4 billion. Faced with a regulatory disadvantage and a competitor only seeming to grow stronger, it's not hard to see why Amazon might be tempted to make a peace offering now.<br/> \"Reliance has brick and mortar, logistics, warehousing, and now online build out with its recent deals,\" said Chakri Lokapriya, chief investment officer at TCG Asset Management in Mumbai. \"It will take years of operational infrastructure for Amazon or other multinational companies to recreate that, and hence Reliance Industries is the preferred partner choice for their entry into India.\"<br/> Regulatory limbo Facebook may have made a similar calculation. The company plans to turn its wildly popular WhatsApp messaging platform into a nationwide payments system have been stuck in Indian regulatory limbo for more than two years now.<br/> Meanwhile, Reliance is pushing ahead with its own payment system, with its almost 400 million mobile subscribers as a built-in user base. But since their deal, Facebook and Reliance have announced that WhatsApp will at least be the main platform for Ambani's online grocery store, his flagship e-commerce offering, ensuring the social networking giant has a toehold in the Indian e-commerce market it covets.<br/>Google, meanwhile, has announced plans to roll out a low-cost phone with Ambani which will run on its Android operating system. Previously Ambani had been selling his own low cost phones, which ran on a different operating system. Google, like Facebook, may have decided it was better to work with Ambani than against him. Amazon may wind up doing the same.<br/> \"Business in India is taking the monopolistic approach,\" said Mathew Antony, managing partner of Aditya Consulting, a boutique legal advisory firm in Mumbai. \"It is increasingly becoming evident with the Facebook and similar investment deals that the large foreign business investments into the country is by default having a first right of refusal at the Reliance doors.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSLIN-A525443</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSLIN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60V2-X011-DYDW-704V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402751</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"994\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Line</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 14, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0003NV7</classCode><className>RELIANCE INDUSTRIES LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC000D7G3</classCode><className>ALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS325110 PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS324110 PETROLEUM REFINERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS313110 FIBER, YARN &amp;

India\u2019s most valuable company is in talks with domestic assemblers to make a version of its Jio phone that would run on Google\u2019s Android and cost about 4,000 rupees ($54), said the people, asking not to be identified since the plans are private. The inexpensive phones will be marketed with low-cost wireless plans from Reliance Jio, the parent company\u2019s carrier, they said.    Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani is aiming to remake the country\u2019s smartphone industry much like he did in wireless services, where his aggressive prices and simple plans quickly made him the dominant force. The billionaire is also aligning himself with the Indian government\u2019s plans to build more domestic manufacturing, a possible boost for local assemblers like Dixon Technologies India, Lava International and Karbonn Mobiles.    \u201cWe are of course trying to build our domestic companies. We have a sweet spot in entry level phones,\u201d said Pankaj Mohindroo, chairman of the India Cellular &amp; Electronic Association, during an interview on Bloomberg Television. \u201cThe world has realized that India is a great place to do business and a great place to do manufacturing also.\u201d    ALSO READ: Mukesh Ambani's $2 chutzpah unlocks another fortune for Reliance Industries    Reliance\u2019s target of selling 150 million to 200 million phones over two years would represent a massive boost for local factories. India assembled an estimated 165 million smartphones in the year ended March, and about an equal number of basic feature phones, according to Mohindroo\u2019s association. About a fifth of the smartphones cost less than 7,000 rupees, or about $100.    Reliance rival Bharti Airtel is also in talks with assemblers to build its own 4G device, local media has reported. The Business Standard reported earlier that Ambani was considering outsourcing phone-making.    Reliance in July struck a broad alliance with Google, in which the Alphabet Inc. unit would invest $4.5 billion and cooperate on technology initiatives. The partnership is still under regulatory review so Reliance is proceeding with the mobile phone initiative on its own for now.    Ambani has drawn more than $20 billion in investments from U.S. giants like Facebook Inc. for Jio Platforms Pvt, whose subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. is placing the order. It\u2019s worked with assemblers on prototypes for at least two years in secret and can bring a phone rapidly to market, though it\u2019s likely to miss the November Diwali shopping season, the people said.    If Reliance succeeds in popularizing the new gadget, it could lift the prospects for Jio Platforms, accelerating Ambani\u2019s efforts to build an empire spanning e-commerce, social media and games. Many of Jio\u2019s nearly 400 million users use no-frills second-generation devices, paying $2 monthly for voice and data -- a large potential market for the new device. It could eventually erode the market share of Chinese phonemakers such as Xiaomi.    \u201cJio has an opportunity to target more than half billion Indians who don\u2019t own a smartphone and trigger a blue ocean market opportunity,\u201d said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Research. \u201cWith Reliance expected to work with Indian vendors, Chinese brands will lose out on a potential opportunity and market share.\u201d         ALSO READ: For big tech, all roads to India's digital space seem to go through Ambani    Reliance\u2019s own requirements could hover around 5 million gadgets per month initially, but no single Indian company currently has that kind of capacity so the order will get split between multiple assemblers, the people said. At least two domestic smartphone makers are in discussions with the telecom giant, the people added.    Phones have become essential for accessing lite versions of apps from WhatsApp to YouTube in a country with an average GDP per capita of around $2,000. That\u2019s why basic devices costing between $100 and $250 accounted for three-quarters of sales in the second quarter of 2020, according to Counterpoint.    Reliance\u2019s fourth-generation wireless gadgets -- one tier below 5G -- are aimed at the estimated 350 million users of basic or feature phones that now dominate India\u2019s industry. Speaking at an industry event a few weeks ago, Ambani said millions were \u201ctrapped in the 2G era.\u201d    \u201cTheir feature phones keep them excluded, even from the basic uses of internet at a time where both India and the rest of the world are standing at the doorsteps of 5G telephony,\u201d he said.    The pandemic is spurring people to upgrade and creating new market opportunities. For example, parents are anxious to put a device in the hands of their kids so they can keep up with online lessons. There\u2019re an estimated 250 million children between the ages of 6 and 16, according to UNICEF.    \u201cIf they\u2019re successful in getting even 10% of this base to upgrade, Jio can become one of the leading smartphone brands of 2021,\u201d Shah said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Multi-billion dollar companies in Silicon Valley are waging, in effect, a war on your privacy, your culture, your freedom of speech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They are the portal through which all human information flows and they have their thumb on the scale. The results of the searches you conduct online they control those. Your phone, they own it, in effect. They track you everywhere you go. Even when the phone is off, they collect intimate information on you. They sell it to advertisers for a profit. They give you no details about this.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These companies are politically radical. They are funding the activism that's changing our country right now. There's nothing that you can do to check their power. Congress should be doing that but they're not.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Increasingly, these countries are using their power and influence to shape the world around us. Some of these companies are bigger than the economies of entire nations. This show is an examination of those companies and the effects they have on our lives, our country, and our politics. The scale of their reach is enormous. And it is finally drawing the attention of policymakers including the President.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think that Google and Facebook and Twitter, I think they treat conservatives and Republicans very unfairly. And I think it's a very serious problem because they're really trying to silence a very large part of this country. And those people don't want to be silenced. It's not right. It's not fair. It may not be legal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: FOX News Headlines Anchor Brett Larson has been on the tech beat for us for quite some time. And he's going to set the table for us tonight. Brett?</p><p>BRETT LARSON, ANCHOR, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7: All right Tucker, yes. Earlier this week, the President sent out a tweet in which he said in part \"Google Search results for Trump News shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake News Media. In other words, they have it rigged for me and others so that almost all stories and news is bad.\"</p><p>Now Google was quick to respond to the claim in a statement saying in part \"Search is not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology.\"</p><p>As for how Google Search works that is a closely guarded secret. Algorithms used by online sites including Google, Twitter and Facebook are protected like the recipe for Coca-Cola. Why? Well if sites knew exactly how the search site worked, it would be easier to rig their web content to reach a larger audience.</p><p>But a few things are known about how Google Search works. Google is scanning the web for new pages around the clock and they're looking for a variety of things to ensure that the right pages are delivered to the right people.</p><p>They check to see that a site is mobile-friendly, so it renders properly on your smartphone if you're on the go. They also check to make sure the content is original and not just some plagiarized information with a bunch of ads slapped around it.</p><p>But where you go online also affects your search results. As we know, and we have reported here before, Google keeps track of virtually everything you do mainly to ensure they show you the right ads. We'll have more on our investigation later this hour.</p><p>But, in this case, it's also to ensure you're getting the right search results. As for news search, it's a little different. As we know, news is happening 24 hours a day. But a reliable source is needed for a news story.</p><p>A site that creates more content that is optimized for search will likely get a higher ranking but also a site that gets click-through from the results. So if, for example, you search for California wildfires and in the results more people are going to our FOX affiliate, KTVU, their site, they will move higher in the rankings.</p><p>Now this is where the mainstream media has an advantage. Though as they present more middle-of-the-road news without leaning to the left or to the right, so they'll have a larger reach within those results. Tucker?</p><p>CARLSON: Depending upon who defines what middle-of-the-road is.</p><p>LARSON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Brett, thank you very much.</p><p>LARSON: Thanks Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: We're going to see you later this hour.</p><p>LARSON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: So you just heard what Google says it does. The question is can we trust them? That is the central question. Here's some background on the company.</p><p>Google just removed its famous catchphrase \"Don't be evil\" from its corporate code of conduct earlier this year. It was a symbolic change but also maybe ominous for the most powerful company in human history.</p><p>Google's market cap is now about $860 billion. That's more than the gross domestic product of almost every country in the world. 170 countries have smaller GDPs than Google. The Federal Trade Commission prepared an anti- trust case against the tech giant a few years ago but the Obama Justice Department didn't take it.</p><p>Google now controls roughly 90 percent of the search engine market, 65 percent of the internet browser market. It controls 85 percent of the mobile operating systems on the phones in our pockets right now.</p><p>Google controls an outsized portion of the online ad market which means they also control the companies that rely on online advertising that is every single digital news company in the United States.</p><p>Google has an army of lobbyists in Washington. It bankrolls politicians in both parties. It contributes to virtually every major think tank in Washington regardless of ideologies including, hilariously, a think tank dedicated to fighting monopolies.</p><p>At least one of those think tanks has fired a staff for being critical of Google. So the question is, and it may be rhetorical, is Google too powerful to regulate?</p><p>Scott Cleland is the author of Search &amp; Destroy: Why You Can't Trust Google Inc. He joins us now.</p><p>So Scott, very quickly on the search question that seems like one of the most basic questions, all of our information comes through this tiny little portal, Google says \"Trust us. We're not putting our thumb on the scale.\" Can we?</p><p>SCOTT CLELAND, PRESIDENT, PRECURSOR LLC, INTERNETIZATION STRATEGIST: No, we can't because it's blanket trust. It's blind trust because no one does really know what goes on there.</p><p>The problem is when you put all of access of supply and demand to access all the world's information through one black box, one thing that we have no transparency to, we don't understand. And let's not forget, the whole purpose of it is to rank, so it is to choose--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>CLELAND: --what is best. They said for years it's algorithmic. So if it's algorithmic it must be OK. Well an algorithm is just a computer program that - that people decided what the biases would be.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>CLELAND: Their purposeful biases. But the problem of Google is the fact that we have concentrated all that power in one company because if it's - it's the most harmful monopoly you can imagine. Information is power. Power corrupts - absolute - power corrupts absolutely.</p><p>In a constitutional republic, in a free market, the free flow of information and the competition of ideas are paramount and central. And when you go through one black box and say that is all occurring only here and there's one person that basically sets what the ideology and the approach is going to be, and it's Larry Page, and then that filters through, you have a - it's a very scary situation.</p><p>You want a competition for ideas. You want a competition for sources. He has created an unbelievably innovative and great search engine. No criticism there in the sense of its capability. But how the government - and I, for 10 years, been trying to prevent this monopoly and the government screwed up over time and time again in allowing Google to become this monopoly.</p><p>CARLSON: That's for sure. So - so quickly, news reports have reported that Google is working to devise a search engine that would help the Fascist Government of China repress its own people. So given that we know we believe we know that they are willing to suppress information on behalf of a government to achieve repressive political ends, why should we trust them not to do that to us?</p><p>CLELAND: Well we shouldn't. And my goodness, this is always Orwellian as it comes because when that was brought up and when somebody, you know, on who we know criticized Google for bias in its search, the President of the United States, they had their answer that says \"We never make our search results based on a political ideology.\" Well they are committing to do it for China, for the entire country, soup-to-nuts for everything they're going to bow down to the Chinese ideology, so--</p><p>CARLSON: You're (ph) not a big deal. A country that executes political prisoners and sells their organs, seems like just the kind of people you'd want, you know, to help remain in power.</p><p>CLELAND: But how they can say that with straight face and then saying that they're not bending it - their will to ideology. They do it all around the world.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, they're lying. Scott, you have been fighting a lonely crusade on behalf of this idea and we're obviously rooting for you. Thank you.</p><p>CLELAND: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: So European regulators fined Google billions after they accused the company of abusing its power in engaging in anti-competitive practices. American regulators meanwhile are nowhere to be found. Why is that exactly?</p><p>Luther Lowe is the Senior Vice President of Public Policy for Yelp. And he joins us now. Luther thanks for coming.</p><p>LUTHER LOWE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF PUBLIC POLICY, YELP: It's good to be here (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: And I'm always particularly happy to talk to you since you're right in the middle of this world. You work for a big tech company. It's a really simple question. Google has a monopoly. Nobody debates that. Monopolies are supposed to be banned by U.S. law. We have a whole Congress with 535 people designed to protect us from monopolies but they're not. Why?</p><p>LOWE: Well I think there are - there's political capture going on. And I think if you have a - a search engine that is clearly guilty of self- serving bias, and I'm not talking about the type of self-serving bias that President Trump tweeted about earlier this week, I'm talking about demonstrable, easy-to-prove bias in the most common area of what we do on Google, which is local search.</p><p>This should be a slam dunk. You - we should be able to show consumer harm. And in fact, we have done so. You know, when a mom does a search for a pediatrician in Salt Lake City, she is basically trusting Google to match her with the best information from across the web.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, absolutely (ph).</p><p>LOWE: That has been the implicit promise to Google's users throughout its growth. But what's happened is that Google has swapped out that information and put their own inferior information there. And so, this creates consumer harm and it gets back to your question about monopoly.</p><p>If you can show that consumer harm then you can easily prosecute an anti- trust case. And this is why, I think, we should focus on the business conduct of Google as it relates to search bias.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I agree completely. But it - the - the monopoly is prima facie, and so is the harm.</p><p>LOWE: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: You work in Washington on this issue. Doubtless, you've spoken to Members of Congress and you've told them what they already know. This is - company's too powerful. It has a monopoly. It's hurting consumers. How did they respond?</p><p>LOWE: I mean I think we are starting to see the tide turn. And I was really heartened to see, for example, Senator Hatch's letter yesterday to the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission where he basically said listen, you know, we closed the last investigation in 2013.</p><p>One expects that when you close an anti-trust investigation the market is going to be less calcified that there are going to be, you know, the company in question is going to be less entrenched. There's got to be more start-up and so forth but we're seeing the opposite. And so, maybe we should take another look at this. And so, I think we're beginning to see the tide turn--</p><p>CARLSON: Good, good for Senator Hatch. But I think there are 99 other guys in the same chamber. Where are they? What would be the justification quickly for not acting? I don't understand.</p><p>LOWE: Well the FTC, we have a completely new slate of FTC commissioners. They're running public hearing - hearings now to collect information. And I'm cautiously optimistic that we're going to re-examine a lot of these questions as we should.</p><p>CARLSON: Google is not an American company. It's a multinational. This is a foreign threat to our country. That's my view. It's a national security threat. Thank you for the work you've done.</p><p>LOWE: Thank you, Tucker (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Free online services aren't actually free. You may have known that. They come at a cost. You're paying that cost in privacy. We've got details ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: Welcome back to our special TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT, Tech Tyranny. And tyranny is not an overstatement in this case. The man behind the book and the movie Clinton Cash that exposed the Clinton Foundation's pay-for- play relationship with various foreign governments is coming out with a new film and the target is big tech. Here's a preview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They can suppress certain types of results based on what they think you should be seeing, based on what your followers are presenting.</p><p>PETER FRANZ SCHWEIZER, AMERICAN INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST, NOVELIST, AUTHOR, POLITICAL CONSULTANT: It's what Google and Facebook are doing on regular basis by suppressing stories like steering us towards other stories rather than the stories we're actually seeking.</p><p>ROBERT EPSTEIN, SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST, AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY: It will always favor one online music service over another and one candidate over another.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Google crosses the creepy line every day.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Film comes out September 17th. Peter Schweizer, of course, is the man behind the project. And he joins us tonight. Peter, first, congratulations on this film, remarkably prescient. And I'm sure it'll be as smart as your last project was.</p><p>As you did it, you spent all those time looking into this subject, tell us what are (ph) the salient things you learned? What - what blew your mind in researching this?</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Well what blew my mind is a couple of things, Tucker. First of all, the dominance that Google has in the marketplace. But second of all, Google is unlike pretty much almost any other company in the world.</p><p>What do I mean by that? Sure, they're motivated by profit. They have shareholders. They have owners. But this is a company that in its core is utopian or, at least, the founders have a utopian vision.</p><p>They don't view themselves as another company. So, when people say \"Oh, Google would never manipulate the algorithm, they would never engage in this kind of behavior because they don't want to hurt their market share,\" they don't think in those terms.</p><p>They make decisions all the time that are based on their vision of what is good and right rather than what consumers want. And with the power they have, combined with this sort of idealism, I think creates the problems that we have today with censorship and with manipulation.</p><p>CARLSON: So give us a sense. I mean I think you just got right to the heart of it. They have a vision.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Is their vision, would you say, in sync with the views of your average American? What is their vision?</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Well I think their vision, you know, certainly is partly epitomized by Burning Man, sort of this festival that they go to. In fact, when they hired Eric Schmidt to be the CEO, you know, 15 or so years ago, one of the reasons they picked him is because he went to Burning Man.</p><p>And this is sort of a - a, you know, secularist sort of religious gathering in the Nevada desert. There's a lot of things about traditional values they don't like. There are lot of views about sort of conservative free-market capitalism they don't like.</p><p>And they have a vision that they want to be transformative. And that's fine except they want to be transformative to, I think, an American public that isn't interested in being transformed by them.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: And the problem is, Tucker that we don't know what they're doing. We don't know what we don't know. We know the end results. We know that there's provable evidence of manipulation but we don't know how it's being done. That's what makes it, I think, so troubling and difficult to get underneath.</p><p>CARLSON: They're not an American company, obviously. They're a multinational company despite the fact Al Gore owns a lot of the stock. Do they see themselves as a company that has an obligation to America, American society, American culture, our economy, or no?</p><p>SCHWEIZER: No. No, they don't. They don't. I think they view themselves as a transformative country. And look, you know, when they - they read that statement to say that we don't manipulate the algorithm, you know, for a political benefit I mean that rings hollow, you know.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Go back five to 10 years ago, they were charged with manipulating the algorithm for commercial purposes. Luther Lowe was talking about that on the show.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: What was Google's position? It was the same absolute denial. The problem is, the European Union, the Federal Trade Commission, scholars at Harvard, and elsewhere have looked at this, and says that Google is lying. So why should we believe them now? The evidence is overwhelming. They're engaging in political manipulation as well.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course they are. And our Congress does nothing. Peter Schweizer. Again, the movie comes out September 17th and you just know it's going to be worth watching. Thank you for that.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Well what would happen if the social media companies started to pick winners and losers in elections? It's not a small question. It could invalidate our democracy instantly. We'll investigate that coming up on this special edition of TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Live from America's News Headquarters, I'm Trace Gallagher in Los Angeles. Congress gave John McCain its highest honor today. Members assembled under the Capitol rotunda to pay their final respects to the man known as the maverick.</p><p>One by one, Democrats and Republicans paid tribute to his flag-draped casket. Among those attending the service was McCain's mother, Roberta, a 106 years old. House Speaker Paul Ryan called McCain one of the bravest souls our nation has produced. He died last Saturday, four days before his 82nd birthday.</p><p>In Detroit, mourners paid an emotional farewell to another American icon, the Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin. Performers at her eight-hour ceremony included Stevie Wonder, Faith Hill, Ariana Grande and Chaka Khan. Former President, Bill Clinton, spoke at the service. Franklin died earlier this month from pancreatic cancer. She was 76 years old.</p><p>I'm Trace Gallagher. Now back to Tucker Carlson.</p><p>CARLSON: So, here's the central question for all of us who live in this country, how much power do the tech companies have over our democratic elections? American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology Senior Research Psychologist, Robert Epstein, weighed in on that question on this show. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EPSTEIN: We should be extremely concerned because I can tell you the bottom line here is content no longer matters. All that matters is the filtering and ordering of content. And that is completely in the hands of Google and Facebook. I think the problems can be solved at some point. But at the moment, I think, democracy is in trouble.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well that probably woke you up. Dan Bongino is a contributor at NRATV and a frequent guest on this show. He joins us tonight. So Dan, why is this not a much graver threat than Russia? Why is this not a foreign threat from a foreign country to the heart of our democracy?</p><p>DANIEL JOHN BONGINO, FORMER AGENT OF THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE, NRATV CONTRIBUTOR: Well - well it is, Tucker. I think that's obvious to rational people but that assumes we're dealing with rational people. We're not. We're dealing with politicians and a media swamp that's interested simply in combating Donald Trump.</p><p>And they believe, I believe, wrongly that the Russian narrative works for them. But this targeting of conservative content is very real. Any one on these social media platforms has experienced it.</p><p>I've experienced it myself. I actually have the trifecta for you. I was banned from running ads on Twitter for what they cited as inappropriate content, which is odd because all I post is conservative content. That's all I do.</p><p>They never explained what the inappropriate content was. On YouTube, our videos for our - our podcast get flagged all the time. They have a little yellow button. And when it turns yellow you can't earn any money on it.</p><p>Now, that doesn't happen as often to Liberal friends who might (ph) do the same thing. And on Instagram, we have a tough time getting a blue checkmark despite, you know, 60,000 followers.</p><p>So, this is very real. And when it happens to candidates running for office, which we've seen, it's even worse.</p><p>CARLSON: But it doesn't even need to happen to candidates to threaten the rest of us because it shuts down part of the conversation and that inevitably is--</p><p>BONGINO: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --got to have an effect on how people vote. If you don't hear ideas, obviously, you can't internalize them. So why isn't that right there a threat to our elections?</p><p>BONGINO: No, it is. And - and they want - what they want is they want their, you know, they want to have it both ways. What they want, Tucker, these social media platforms, let's be clear on this, they want the protections of being an open platform. In other words, in plain English, \"Hey we're not responsible for what people post. Don't screw (ph) us.\"</p><p>CARLSON: Right, exactly.</p><p>BONGINO: But then on the other hand they treat themselves like publishers. They have these - they call them - the new - the new catchphrase is the algorithm, Tucker. That's really a selective process of weeding out conservative content and giving--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>BONGINO: --favor to liberal content in the new public space. You can't have it both ways guys.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly. An algorithm is editing. That's exact - that's what we used to call it in journalism. Dan Bongino, thank you for that.</p><p>BONGINO: OK. Yes, sir (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: So impressed (ph) as always. The tech giants are obviously politically biased against conservatives. No one really disputes that. But Exhibit A is special hostility to people with pro-life views. They're hated above all.</p><p>Lila Rose would know. She's Founder and President of Live Action that's a pro-life group. And she joins us tonight. Lila Rose, thank you for coming on. Tell us your experience with social media.</p><p>LILA ROSE, FOUNDER &amp; PRESIDENT, LIVE ACTION ADVOCATE: Sure. So, Live Action is the large - has a largest following online for the pro-life movement, over 3 million people. Our videos have hundreds of millions of views online.</p><p>And for the last three years, we have been totally banned from doing any advertising on Twitter. Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood and other pro- abortion groups are advertising and they're even advertising petitions to further suppress and censor Live Action and other pro-life groups. So, this is what we've been facing now for three years.</p><p>CARLSON: Look, and can I (ph) stand three steps back and make an obvious point. If the advocates for abortion really believed it was such a good thing they wouldn't be so hysterically intent on shutting you down or letting another voice in. They - they know they're wrong and that's why they suppress speech.</p><p>But let me just ask sort of practical question, how can that be? Do you have any recourse? I mean these are, in effect, public utilities. Is there anything you can do about it?</p><p>ROSE: Well we've - we've looked at it. I mean we are - we're ultimately going on other platforms and then making sure that we can reach people directly through our own website and finding other ways to reach people because ultimately Twitter has sided with the abortion industry.</p><p>I mean that's what's clear, despite their claims, despite Jack Dorsey, their CEO, going on the news in the last several weeks and saying \"Look, we do not discriminate based on viewpoint. That's what we do not do at Twitter,\" he's flat-out lying. He's lying to people.</p><p>And we are, as you say, Exhibit A. Look, the other part of this, like you just said, Tucker, is the fact that when people learn the truth, especially about this human rights issue of abortion, when they learn about what abortion is, what it does to it to the child in the womb, we have an abortion procedure series of videos that have been viewed over a 100 million times.</p><p>We survey people and they change their minds on abortion. People are having Aha moments saying \"Wait a minute. This is - this is violence against a child. This is harmful to women. We don't want this anymore.\"</p><p>That's what Twitter, I believe, is afraid of because they know when the truth gets out there about the humanity of the child in the womb, about what abortion is, the abortionists lose every time.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>ROSE: And that's why Twitter is so interested in defending abortion interest because that's their ideology despite the lies of their own CEO about them not having a viewpoint.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, the last thing they want is a conversation about it. They want to squelch anything they don't agree with.</p><p>ROSE: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: Lila Rose, thank you. Good to see you.</p><p>ROSE: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: If you have an Android phone and you should check then Google is collecting information on you right now whether you know it or not, and you probably don't. If you've got a Google app on your iPhone you could also be exposed to surveillance from Google. Our exclusive investigation into this, the new surveillance state, is next.</p><p>CARLSON: Welcome back to our special tonight on Tech Tyranny because tyranny is what it has become. Google, by far, the biggest corporate threat to the privacy of your personal life, the company recently submitted patent applications that reveal Google's willingness to put cameras in your bedroom and spy on your children, then use that information to sell things.</p><p>Currently, Google does not have a camera in every home but it does have a phone in millions of pockets. So, the question is how much information does Google get from those phones, information about you?</p><p>FOX News Headlines 24/7 anchor Brett Larson went out to investigate this exclusively for our show. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARSON: We wanted to figure out what exactly Google is learning about us throughout the day. So here's what we're going to do. We have two identical phones.</p><p>The only difference between these two phones is this one is in airplane mode. Both of the phones lack a SIM card and they haven't been set up to access any Wi-Fi networks. So for all intents and purposes these phones have no connection to a data network.</p><p>We're going to keep them with us throughout the day. And while I travel around D.C., we're going to figure out just what Google is finding out about me.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Our first stop, Sim's (ph) Convenience Store just outside our FOX Bureau for a quick coffee. From there, we took a walk to the Capitol and took a quick walk around the Senate office buildings and then decided to hop in a car and head around town.</p><p>LARSON: Hello.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey.</p><p>LARSON: We're going to the Children's Hospital please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To run our test we had to do more than walk the block, so we took a tour around our nation's capital. First, due north, to the Children's National Medical Center hospital, then west to St. Albans School, and the National Cathedral. Our tour around town was a 14-mile journey that lasted more than an hour. The entire time the phones had no access to the internet.</p><p>LARSON: Oh my goodness.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not a Wi-Fi connection and not any cellular data service. It almost seemed quaint to assume that Google wouldn't even be able to collect data on me.</p><p>LARSON: That's it. Back to the Bureau, my friend.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sure.</p><p>LARSON: That church is beautiful.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Google's business model is simple. Collect data on its users and then use that data to sell targeted ads. It's a business model called Surveillance Capitalism. But does that critical data collection work even when your phones aren't connected?</p><p>LARSON: So, we're back here at our FOX Bureau in D.C. And we've got both of our phones exactly how we left with them. The only difference really, I snapped a couple of bad selfies at the National Cathedral.</p><p>Uh-ho.</p><p>But otherwise they have stayed in my pocket for the entire day. So let's find out what they know. This is our man-in-the-middle device. It's basically a Wi-Fi network that these phones are going to connect to once we turn their Wi-Fi on.</p><p>It's going to pass data through it on the way to Google. But on the way we're actually going to get a copy of the same data that Google's going to get. We'll be able to decrypt it and then find out where we've been throughout the day.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Within minutes the numbers rolled in. The phone that wasn't on airplane mode registered more than 100 locations, 130 activities, and even a 152 barometric readings. As soon as it hooked up to our Wi-Fi, it transmitted 300 kilobytes of data straight to Google. The phone even logged our exact locations tracking us all around town, the Capitol, the hospital, the school, and the Cathedral.</p><p>LARSON: Now, you may notice what's missing here is the exact route that we took but it got that data too. It knows when I got out of the car.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The metadata has a time log down to the very second, tracking everything when they think that you're walking, riding, and yes, even getting out of the car.</p><p>LARSON: OK. So, you're thinking \"This isn't a big deal. I'll just put my phone in airplane mode.\" Yes, we thought of that too. This is the other phone that we had with us that no SIM card, also remained in airplane mode the entire time. Let's see what kind of data it captured.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The phone with airplane mode activated actually logged more locations and activities than the other phone. And it also transferred hundreds of kilobytes of data to Google as soon as it was activated.</p><p>LARSON: The only thing that's missing from this map is our stop at the Children's Hospital. But it still knows we were there. There it is, exiting vehicle, a 100 percent accuracy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Through complicated user agreements and free software, Google gets users to sign away their privacy for nothing. They're even following you in the places that most people would expect total privacy, government buildings, a children's hospital, a private school, a church, every move you make, every step you take, Google is watching you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARSON: It is a - a scary conclusion to come to if you are using an Android device. Tucker, we should also, we should point out, as - as we mentioned in the piece there, that when you are using Gmail, if you're using Google Drive, any of their services, you're actually not using a - you're not using a product, you are the actual products.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>LARSON: You are what Google is selling to advertisers. And that data that they collect about you is then turned around and sold to advertisers to more - to give you that very specific level of advertising.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't think people fully appreciate that. So, I mean this is a remarkable report because it reveals--</p><p>LARSON: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --you don't have control of the surveillance.</p><p>LARSON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: They, in effect, lie to you and say that you do but you don't.</p><p>LARSON: Right, all the time (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: But what about iPhone users?</p><p>LARSON: This is an interesting twist here. With iPhone users, Apple is capturing a lot of information about you but they're not using it to sell you advertising. They're using it to better the services that they offer. But if you are using Google applications on your iPhone, it, in many instances, is actually capturing all of that same data.</p><p>CARLSON: So, any Google app, so if you have Google Maps, for example--</p><p>LARSON: If you're using Google Maps it can take (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --which I think every living human being with an iPhone does.</p><p>LARSON: Yes, you do because Apple Maps, I'm sorry, Apple Maps is as - an inferior product.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>LARSON: But yes, if you are using Google Maps, which most of us are, it is constantly tracking your data. Also, as we learned earlier in the month, if you're using Google Search and said \"Stop tracking me\" but you're using Google Search on your mobile device, be that on an iPhone or an Android device, they are again capturing your location information.</p><p>CARLSON: It's unbelievable. It wouldn't be such a big deal if you could trust the company if they weren't working on behalf of the Fascist Government of China. It might (ph) make us feel better. Brett thank you for that reporting.</p><p>LARSON: Yes. Tucker, thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: I thought it was groundbreaking.</p><p>Well when it's not spying on you, Google is cracking down on ideological dissent within its own ranks just as the former Google Engineer, James Damore, who was fired in the name of inclusion and diversity for writing a memo that called for inclusion and diversity. That's next.</p><p>CARLSON: Last summer, James Damore learned what happens when you question the groupthink of Silicon Valley. While working for Google as an Engineer, Damore privately circulated a paper he wrote that asked why isn't a company so committed to diversity more ideologically diverse?</p><p>He didn't attack anyone. He just questioned the internal logic of what he was being told. For that, the company fired him and then attacked him and tried to prevent him from working anywhere else. They tried to destroy his life.</p><p>Damore came on this show, a safe space for dissent, to discuss what happened to him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: What did they say to you when they canned you? They - when they called you in, how did the conversation go? What was the justification for ending your career at Google?</p><p>JAMES DAMORE, FORMER GOOGLE ENGINEER: So, the official justification was perpetuating gender stereotypes.</p><p>CARLSON: Of all places, you wouldn't think Google would have a culture where emotional outrage drives decision-making. I mean I thought the whole point of Google was they're rational but they don't sound rational at all</p><p>DAMORE: Yes, there's certain dogmas that you really can't dissent against at Google and one of them being that there's any difference between people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: The Orwellian future is increasingly the Orwellian present. Tech barons are our new commissars. Liberals, who for generations, stood up for free expression and an opposition to corporate power have been so thoroughly co-opted they're now against speech and for Google. Why? Because they're getting rich from it.</p><p>Harmeet Dhillon is a lawyer who represents James Damore. And she joins us tonight. Harmeet, thanks very much for coming on. We followed the saga since the very beginning. I know obviously you've been intricately involved from the very beginning. Google, when last we checked with you, was basically trying to destroy his life for this memo. Is that still the case?</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, AMERICAN LAWYER, REPUBLICAN PARTY OFFICIAL: Well they have certainly attempted to destroy his career. They started out after firing him by smearing him in the international media and then, you know, continuing this narrative and - and hunting down people in the company who had supported him internally as well. So, full-blown purge going on there at Google.</p><p>They also, we believe, helped interfere with James' job search. A prominent company in Silicon Valley called Hire.com that helps people at the high tech industry find jobs mysteriously, you know, suddenly dis - disappeared James from its website within one day and has, you know, belligerently told us that, you know, they can pick and choose who they help, which is actually not California law. You cannot do that.</p><p>So, you know, we feel like there's a coordinated effort to make sure that not just James but people who espouse those types of views are hounded out of employment in Silicon Valley, and it's really scary.</p><p>CARLSON: Has he not found a job?</p><p>DHILLON: He is employed, you know, because of the fact that - recently by the way, but because of the fact that, you know, people are being harassed for supporting him, he's, you know, keeping the location of his workplace confidential.</p><p>CARLSON: That's - that's - it's unbelievable. And by the way, for our viewers who may not be fully read into this story if you think that we're putting a thumb on the scale, go read his memo. It's available online and see if there's anything, even one sentence in it that is offensive. No, there isn't. It's the whole thing is bewildering.</p><p>DHILLON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Are there - is there any movement within Google to diversify? Is there any dissent within Google? Is there anyone who agrees with James who can speak out or has?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, those people who agreed with James are leaving the company voluntarily or involuntarily one by one, so it's hard to find out. And what Google has done, as reported in the media, it is in the wake of the whole controversy with James has actually tried to revamp its internal message board policies to, you know, appoint employees of the company to be basically narcs to spy on each other and then report back to - back to the management.</p><p>And, you know, I - I wouldn't have thought a year ago if you told me this was happening in an American company that it would be true.</p><p>But I guess it kind of fits with Google's new move into China where, of course, and you know, China, they assign social media scores or media scores or, you know, scores to people that loud that then follow them throughout their lives, so, you know, the government can control where you - whether you get to travel and all of that based on this information.</p><p>And in Silicon Valley, it's almost the same thing. If you're assigned a socially undesirable label by big media or big tech then all of a sudden you are now out. You're persona non grata.</p><p>CARLSON: So, this is the company who's trying to destroy a young man's life because it didn't agree with a memo he wrote. This is the company we trust to hold all human information and sort it for us?</p><p>DHILLON: I mean I don't trust it anymore. A lot of people use, you know, their services. But I think people should be very careful. And again, you know, not to, you know, sort of bring in this other issue but when - when they have all this information about you and they're openly agreeing to censorship in foreign countries at the demand of foreign countries, how long is it before you can expect to see that more openly done here? We - we know--</p><p>CARLSON: It's exactly right.</p><p>DHILLON: --it already happens here with search results and so forth but, you know, in - in a couple of years when they're doing business in China, are you going to be able to search for the Dalai Lama in America and get accurate search results?</p><p>I think that's a huge question that we should be asking and the government should be asking that because, you know, these companies all operate with tremendous market power and they meet regularly. Just, I think, last week--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DHILLON: There was a meeting of the top tech companies to talk about election interference and, you know, what does that really mean and are they--</p><p>CARLSON: That's a great question.</p><p>DHILLON: --operating as a cartel (ph) in certain ways?</p><p>CARLSON: Of course they are.</p><p>DHILLON: Sure (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: And Congress should act immediately. But they're too afraid. Harmeet Dhillon, thank you for this. Good to see you.</p><p>DHILLON: My pleasure.</p><p>CARLSON: So once you decide that it's OK to censor opinions you disagree with, where does that wind up? That's next.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, the tech giants see themselves as gatekeepers of the internet and, as such, routinely engage in censorship of political speech, speech they disagree with. In most cases, that affects conservatives.</p><p>But non-mainstream liberals have been targeted too, especially those who express opposition to the democratic establishment or to endless war. What are the boundaries of censorship once a company starts making decisions about what speech is permissible and which speech is not?</p><p>Jesse Kelly is a Marine Corps combat veteran who has fought for free speech abroad. He is the host of the Jesse Kelly Radio Show in Houston and he joins us tonight. Jesse, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>So, you wrote this piece that I thought was really compelling about Alex Jones. And you said \"Look, I don't agree with Alex Jones, his views but that's not the point.\" The point, as you articulated, was if you can silence this guy because you don't like what he says why can't they silence you or me?</p><p>JESSE KELLY, UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS COMBAT VETERAN: That's - that is the point, Tucker. And they're coming for you and me next.</p><p>Alex Jones was the weak member of the herd because of his insane views on certain things. They knew they could pick him off, and what he was, was a test-run. If we can pick off this nutjob then maybe sooner or later we can come for the more mainstream voices on the right.</p><p>This is not - the social media, Facebook, Twitter, that's 2.5 billion people they reach. People have to understand it's no longer a couple of nerds sitting in a college dorm room swapping stories about a made-up girlfriend. It's real and it's powerful.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I watched feeling nauseous as almost no figures on that as you just said mainstream right rose to the defense of Alex Jones, not defending what he said but defending his right to say it, the most basic American principle. Why did they sit silently as this happened?</p><p>KELLY: Because everybody wants to be the one that's eaten last, Tucker. They convince themselves--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, exactly.</p><p>KELLY: --in the interest of never having to have a fight that if the lion will just gorge himself on enough of those antelope eventually he'll never come eat me. But that's not how it works. It is - it is we're really whistling past the graveyard.</p><p>We gave them Hollywood. We gave them the education system. And to rely on Google Now or Facebook for your news is like pouring a cup of coffee and then filtering it through a jockstrap before you drink it.</p><p>CARLSON: Which doesn't work, I've checked. Yes, I mean social media very quickly really is the last place where dissent is allowed. It's not allowed in the workplace. It's not allowed in public parks. If they take that away people with different views are silenced, correct?</p><p>KELLY: It is - it is - correct. It is the final frontier. It's no longer just a random thing. It is how you break news. It's how you make news.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KELLY: Social media makes careers. It's - it's how things are done. It's what's used by law enforcement to track people. It is the information age and if we--</p><p>CARLSON: That's exactly right.</p><p>KELLY: --let Left to censor that that's modern book-burning is what that is.</p><p>CARLSON: Jesse Kelly, so nicely put. God bless you for standing up for speech especially against the backdrop of all the cowardice around us. It's distressing. Thank you.</p><p>KELLY: Appreciate you.</p><p>CARLSON: That's it for the special edition of TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT, investigation into big tech topic. We're going to keep up with every night at 8:00, so join us there. We'll see you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Multi-billion  dollar companies in Silicon Valley are waging, in effect, a war on your  privacy, your culture, your freedom of speech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They are the portal through which all human information flows and they have  their thumb on the scale. The results of the searches you conduct online  they control those. Your phone, they own it, in effect. They track you  everywhere you go. Even when the phone is off, they collect intimate  information on you. They sell it to advertisers for a profit. They give you  no details about this.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These companies are politically radical. They are funding the activism  that's changing our country right now. There's nothing that you can do to  check their power. Congress should be doing that but they're not.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Increasingly, these countries are using their power and influence to shape  the world around us. Some of these companies are bigger than the economies  of entire nations. This show is an examination of those companies and the  effects they have on our lives, our country, and our politics. The scale of  their reach is enormous. And it is finally drawing the attention of  policymakers including the President.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think that Google and  Facebook and Twitter, I think they treat conservatives and Republicans very  unfairly. And I think it's a very serious problem because they're really  trying to silence a very large part of this country. And those people don't  want to be silenced. It's not right. It's not fair. It may not be legal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARLSON: FOX News Headlines Anchor Brett Larson has been on the tech beat  for us for quite some time. And he's going to set the table for us tonight.  Brett?</p><p>BRETT LARSON, ANCHOR, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7: All right Tucker, yes.  Earlier this week, the President sent out a tweet in which he said in part  \"Google Search results for Trump News shows only the viewing/reporting of  Fake News Media. In other words, they have it rigged for me and others so  that almost all stories and news is bad.\"</p><p>Now Google was quick to respond to the claim in a statement saying in part  \"Search is not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our results  toward any political ideology.\" </p><p>As for how Google Search works that is a closely guarded secret. Algorithms  used by online sites including Google, Twitter and Facebook are protected  like the recipe for Coca-Cola. Why? Well if sites knew exactly how the  search site worked, it would be easier to rig their web content to reach a  larger audience.</p><p>But a few things are known about how Google Search works. Google is  scanning the web for new pages around the clock and they're looking for a  variety of things to ensure that the right pages are delivered to the right  people.</p><p>They check to see that a site is mobile-friendly, so it renders properly on  your smartphone if you're on the go. They also check to make sure the  content is original and not just some plagiarized information with a bunch  of ads slapped around it.</p><p>But where you go online also affects your search results. As we know, and  we have reported here before, Google keeps track of virtually everything  you do mainly to ensure they show you the right ads. We'll have more on our  investigation later this hour.</p><p>But, in this case, it's also to ensure you're getting the right search  results. As for news search, it's a little different. As we know, news is  happening 24 hours a day. But a reliable source is needed for a news story. </p><p>A site that creates more content that is optimized for search will likely  get a higher ranking but also a site that gets click-through from the  results. So if, for example, you search for California wildfires and in the  results more people are going to our FOX affiliate, KTVU, their site, they  will move higher in the rankings. </p><p>Now this is where the mainstream media has an advantage. Though as they  present more middle-of-the-road news without leaning to the left or to the  right, so they'll have a larger reach within those results. Tucker?</p><p>CARLSON: Depending upon who defines what middle-of-the-road is.</p><p>LARSON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Brett, thank you very much.</p><p>LARSON: Thanks Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: We're going to see you later this hour.</p><p>LARSON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: So you just heard what Google says it does. The question is can we  trust them? That is the central question. Here's some background on the  company. </p><p>Google just removed its famous catchphrase \"Don't be evil\" from its  corporate code of conduct earlier this year. It was a symbolic change but  also maybe ominous for the most powerful company in human history.</p><p>Google's market cap is now about $860 billion. That's more than the gross  domestic product of almost every country in the world. 170 countries have  smaller GDPs than Google. The Federal Trade Commission prepared an anti- trust case against the tech giant a few years ago but the Obama Justice  Department didn't take it.</p><p>Google now controls roughly 90 percent of the search engine market, 65  percent of the internet browser market. It controls 85 percent of the  mobile operating systems on the phones in our pockets right now.</p><p>Google controls an outsized portion of the online ad market which means  they also control the companies that rely on online advertising that is  every single digital news company in the United States.</p><p>Google has an army of lobbyists in Washington. It bankrolls politicians in  both parties. It contributes to virtually every major think tank in  Washington regardless of ideologies including, hilariously, a think tank  dedicated to fighting monopolies.</p><p>At least one of those think tanks has fired a staff for being critical of  Google. So the question is, and it may be rhetorical, is Google too  powerful to regulate?</p><p>Scott Cleland is the author of Search &amp; Destroy: Why You Can't Trust Google  Inc. He joins us now. </p><p>So Scott, very quickly on the search question that seems like one of the  most basic questions, all of our information comes through this tiny little  portal, Google says \"Trust us. We're not putting our thumb on the scale.\"  Can we?</p><p>SCOTT CLELAND, PRESIDENT, PRECURSOR LLC, INTERNETIZATION STRATEGIST: No, we  can't because it's blanket trust. It's blind trust because no one does  really know what goes on there. </p><p>The problem is when you put all of access of supply and demand to access  all the world's information through one black box, one thing that we have  no transparency to, we don't understand. And let's not forget, the whole  purpose of it is to rank, so it is to choose--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>CLELAND: --what is best. They said for years it's algorithmic. So if it's  algorithmic it must be OK. Well an algorithm is just a computer program  that - that people decided what the biases would be.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>CLELAND: Their purposeful biases. But the problem of Google is the fact  that we have concentrated all that power in one company because if it's -  it's the most harmful monopoly you can imagine. Information is power. Power  corrupts - absolute - power corrupts absolutely.</p><p>In a constitutional republic, in a free market, the free flow of  information and the competition of ideas are paramount and central. And  when you go through one black box and say that is all occurring only here  and there's one person that basically sets what the ideology and the  approach is going to be, and it's Larry Page, and then that filters  through, you have a - it's a very scary situation.</p><p>You want a competition for ideas. You want a competition for sources. He  has created an unbelievably innovative and great search engine. No  criticism there in the sense of its capability. But how the government -  and I, for 10 years, been trying to prevent this monopoly and the  government screwed up over time and time again in allowing Google to become  this monopoly.</p><p>CARLSON: That's for sure. So - so quickly, news reports have reported that  Google is working to devise a search engine that would help the Fascist  Government of China repress its own people. So given that we know we  believe we know that they are willing to suppress information on behalf of  a government to achieve repressive political ends, why should we trust them  not to do that to us?</p><p>CLELAND: Well we shouldn't. And my goodness, this is always Orwellian as it  comes because when that was brought up and when somebody, you know, on who  we know criticized Google for bias in its search, the President of the  United States, they had their answer that says \"We never make our search  results based on a political ideology.\" Well they are committing to do it  for China, for the entire country, soup-to-nuts for everything they're  going to bow down to the Chinese ideology, so--</p><p>CARLSON: You're (ph) not a big deal. A country that executes political  prisoners and sells their organs, seems like just the kind of people you'd  want, you know, to help remain in power.</p><p>CLELAND: But how they can say that with straight face and then saying that  they're not bending it - their will to ideology. They do it all around the  world.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, they're lying. Scott, you have been fighting a lonely  crusade on behalf of this idea and we're obviously rooting for you. Thank  you.</p><p>CLELAND: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: So European regulators fined Google billions after they accused  the company of abusing its power in engaging in anti-competitive practices.  American regulators meanwhile are nowhere to be found. Why is that exactly? </p><p>Luther Lowe is the Senior Vice President of Public Policy for Yelp. And he  joins us now. Luther thanks for coming.</p><p>LUTHER LOWE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF PUBLIC POLICY, YELP: It's good to be  here (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: And I'm always particularly happy to talk to you since you're  right in the middle of this world. You work for a big tech company. It's a  really simple question. Google has a monopoly. Nobody debates that.  Monopolies are supposed to be banned by U.S. law. We have a whole Congress  with 535 people designed to protect us from monopolies but they're not.  Why?</p><p>LOWE: Well I think there are - there's political capture going on. And I  think if you have a - a search engine that is clearly guilty of self- serving bias, and I'm not talking about the type of self-serving bias that  President Trump tweeted about earlier this week, I'm talking about  demonstrable, easy-to-prove bias in the most common area of what we do on  Google, which is local search.</p><p>This should be a slam dunk. You - we should be able to show consumer harm.  And in fact, we have done so. You know, when a mom does a search for a  pediatrician in Salt Lake City, she is basically trusting Google to match  her with the best information from across the web.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, absolutely (ph).</p><p>LOWE: That has been the implicit promise to Google's users throughout its  growth. But what's happened is that Google has swapped out that information  and put their own inferior information there. And so, this creates consumer  harm and it gets back to your question about monopoly.</p><p>If you can show that consumer harm then you can easily prosecute an anti- trust case. And this is why, I think, we should focus on the business  conduct of Google as it relates to search bias.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I agree completely. But it - the - the monopoly is prima  facie, and so is the harm.</p><p>LOWE: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: You work in Washington on this issue. Doubtless, you've spoken to  Members of Congress and you've told them what they already know. This is -  company's too powerful. It has a monopoly. It's hurting consumers. How did  they respond?</p><p>LOWE: I mean I think we are starting to see the tide turn. And I was really  heartened to see, for example, Senator Hatch's letter yesterday to the  Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission where he basically said listen,  you know, we closed the last investigation in 2013. </p><p>One expects that when you close an anti-trust investigation the market is  going to be less calcified that there are going to be, you know, the  company in question is going to be less entrenched. There's got to be more  start-up and so forth but we're seeing the opposite. And so, maybe we  should take another look at this. And so, I think we're beginning to see  the tide turn--</p><p>CARLSON: Good, good for Senator Hatch. But I think there are 99 other guys  in the same chamber. Where are they? What would be the justification  quickly for not acting? I don't understand.</p><p>LOWE: Well the FTC, we have a completely new slate of FTC commissioners.  They're running public hearing - hearings now to collect information. And  I'm cautiously optimistic that we're going to re-examine a lot of these  questions as we should.</p><p>CARLSON: Google is not an American company. It's a multinational. This is a  foreign threat to our country. That's my view. It's a national security  threat. Thank you for the work you've done.</p><p>LOWE: Thank you, Tucker (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Free online services aren't actually free. You may have known  that. They come at a cost. You're paying that cost in privacy. We've got  details ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Welcome back to our special TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT, Tech Tyranny.  And tyranny is not an overstatement in this case. The man behind the book  and the movie Clinton Cash that exposed the Clinton Foundation's pay-for- play relationship with various foreign governments is coming out with a new  film and the target is big tech. Here's a preview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They can suppress certain types of results based on  what they think you should be seeing, based on what your followers are  presenting.</p><p>PETER FRANZ SCHWEIZER, AMERICAN INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST, NOVELIST, AUTHOR,  POLITICAL CONSULTANT: It's what Google and Facebook are doing on regular  basis by suppressing stories like steering us towards other stories rather  than the stories we're actually seeking.</p><p>ROBERT EPSTEIN, SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST, AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR  BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY: It will always favor one online music  service over another and one candidate over another.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Google crosses the creepy line every day.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Film comes out September 17th. Peter Schweizer, of course, is the  man behind the project. And he joins us tonight. Peter, first,  congratulations on this film, remarkably prescient. And I'm sure it'll be  as smart as your last project was. </p><p>As you did it, you spent all those time looking into this subject, tell us  what are (ph) the salient things you learned? What - what blew your mind in  researching this?</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Well what blew my mind is a couple of things, Tucker. First of  all, the dominance that Google has in the marketplace. But second of all,  Google is unlike pretty much almost any other company in the world.</p><p>What do I mean by that? Sure, they're motivated by profit. They have  shareholders. They have owners. But this is a company that in its core is  utopian or, at least, the founders have a utopian vision.</p><p>They don't view themselves as another company. So, when people say \"Oh,  Google would never manipulate the algorithm, they would never engage in  this kind of behavior because they don't want to hurt their market share,\"  they don't think in those terms.</p><p>They make decisions all the time that are based on their vision of what is  good and right rather than what consumers want. And with the power they  have, combined with this sort of idealism, I think creates the problems  that we have today with censorship and with manipulation.</p><p>CARLSON: So give us a sense. I mean I think you just got right to the heart  of it. They have a vision.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Is their vision, would you say, in sync with the views of your  average American? What is their vision?</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Well I think their vision, you know, certainly is partly  epitomized by Burning Man, sort of this festival that they go to. In fact,  when they hired Eric Schmidt to be the CEO, you know, 15 or so years ago,  one of the reasons they picked him is because he went to Burning Man.</p><p>And this is sort of a - a, you know, secularist sort of religious gathering  in the Nevada desert. There's a lot of things about traditional values they  don't like. There are lot of views about sort of conservative free-market  capitalism they don't like.</p><p>And they have a vision that they want to be transformative. And that's fine  except they want to be transformative to, I think, an American public that  isn't interested in being transformed by them.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: And the problem is, Tucker that we don't know what they're  doing. We don't know what we don't know. We know the end results. We know  that there's provable evidence of manipulation but we don't know how it's  being done. That's what makes it, I think, so troubling and difficult to  get underneath.</p><p>CARLSON: They're not an American company, obviously. They're a  multinational company despite the fact Al Gore owns a lot of the stock. Do  they see themselves as a company that has an obligation to America,  American society, American culture, our economy, or no?</p><p>SCHWEIZER: No. No, they don't. They don't. I think they view themselves as  a transformative country. And look, you know, when they - they read that  statement to say that we don't manipulate the algorithm, you know, for a  political benefit I mean that rings hollow, you know.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Go back five to 10 years ago, they were charged with  manipulating the algorithm for commercial purposes. Luther Lowe was talking  about that on the show.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: What was Google's position? It was the same absolute denial. The  problem is, the European Union, the Federal Trade Commission, scholars at  Harvard, and elsewhere have looked at this, and says that Google is lying.  So why should we believe them now? The evidence is overwhelming. They're  engaging in political manipulation as well.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course they are. And our Congress does nothing. Peter  Schweizer. Again, the movie comes out September 17th and you just know it's  going to be worth watching. Thank you for that.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Well what would happen if the social media companies started to  pick winners and losers in elections? It's not a small question. It could  invalidate our democracy instantly. We'll investigate that coming up on  this special edition of TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Live from America's News  Headquarters, I'm Trace Gallagher in Los Angeles. Congress gave John McCain  its highest honor today. Members assembled under the Capitol rotunda to pay  their final respects to the man known as the maverick.</p><p>One by one, Democrats and Republicans paid tribute to his flag-draped  casket. Among those attending the service was McCain's mother, Roberta, a  106 years old. House Speaker Paul Ryan called McCain one of the bravest  souls our nation has produced. He died last Saturday, four days before his  82nd birthday. </p><p>In Detroit, mourners paid an emotional farewell to another American icon,  the Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin. Performers at her eight-hour ceremony  included Stevie Wonder, Faith Hill, Ariana Grande and Chaka Khan. Former  President, Bill Clinton, spoke at the service. Franklin died earlier this  month from pancreatic cancer. She was 76 years old. </p><p>I'm Trace Gallagher. Now back to Tucker Carlson.</p><p>CARLSON: So, here's the central question for all of us who live in this  country, how much power do the tech companies have over our democratic  elections? American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology Senior  Research Psychologist, Robert Epstein, weighed in on that question on this  show. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EPSTEIN: We should be extremely concerned because I can tell you the bottom  line here is content no longer matters. All that matters is the filtering  and ordering of content. And that is completely in the hands of Google and  Facebook. I think the problems can be solved at some point. But at the  moment, I think, democracy is in trouble.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well that probably woke you up. Dan Bongino is a contributor at  NRATV and a frequent guest on this show. He joins us tonight. So Dan, why  is this not a much graver threat than Russia? Why is this not a foreign  threat from a foreign country to the heart of our democracy?</p><p>DANIEL JOHN BONGINO, FORMER AGENT OF THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE,  NRATV CONTRIBUTOR: Well - well it is, Tucker. I think that's obvious to  rational people but that assumes we're dealing with rational people. We're  not. We're dealing with politicians and a media swamp that's interested  simply in combating Donald Trump. </p><p>And they believe, I believe, wrongly that the Russian narrative works for  them. But this targeting of conservative content is very real. Any one on  these social media platforms has experienced it.</p><p>I've experienced it myself. I actually have the trifecta for you. I was  banned from running ads on Twitter for what they cited as inappropriate  content, which is odd because all I post is conservative content. That's  all I do.</p><p>They never explained what the inappropriate content was. On YouTube, our  videos for our - our podcast get flagged all the time. They have a little  yellow button. And when it turns yellow you can't earn any money on it.</p><p>Now, that doesn't happen as often to Liberal friends who might (ph) do the  same thing. And on Instagram, we have a tough time getting a blue checkmark  despite, you know, 60,000 followers.</p><p>So, this is very real. And when it happens to candidates running for  office, which we've seen, it's even worse.</p><p>CARLSON: But it doesn't even need to happen to candidates to threaten the  rest of us because it shuts down part of the conversation and that  inevitably is--</p><p>BONGINO: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --got to have an effect on how people vote. If you don't hear  ideas, obviously, you can't internalize them. So why isn't that right there  a threat to our elections?</p><p>BONGINO: No, it is. And - and they want - what they want is they want  their, you know, they want to have it both ways. What they want, Tucker,  these social media platforms, let's be clear on this, they want the  protections of being an open platform. In other words, in plain English,  \"Hey we're not responsible for what people post. Don't screw (ph) us.\"</p><p>CARLSON: Right, exactly.</p><p>BONGINO: But then on the other hand they treat themselves like publishers.  They have these - they call them - the new - the new catchphrase is the  algorithm, Tucker. That's really a selective process of weeding out  conservative content and giving--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>BONGINO: --favor to liberal content in the new public space. You can't have  it both ways guys.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly. An algorithm is editing. That's exact - that's what we  used to call it in journalism. Dan Bongino, thank you for that.</p><p>BONGINO: OK. Yes, sir (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: So impressed (ph) as always. The tech giants are obviously  politically biased against conservatives. No one really disputes that. But  Exhibit A is special hostility to people with pro-life views. They're hated  above all. </p><p>Lila Rose would know. She's Founder and President of Live Action that's a  pro-life group. And she joins us tonight. Lila Rose, thank you for coming  on. Tell us your experience with social media.</p><p>LILA ROSE, FOUNDER &amp; PRESIDENT, LIVE ACTION ADVOCATE: Sure. So, Live Action  is the large - has a largest following online for the pro-life movement,  over 3 million people. Our videos have hundreds of millions of views  online. </p><p>And for the last three years, we have been totally banned from doing any  advertising on Twitter. Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood and other pro- abortion groups are advertising and they're even advertising petitions to  further suppress and censor Live Action and other pro-life groups. So, this  is what we've been facing now for three years.</p><p>CARLSON: Look, and can I (ph) stand three steps back and make an obvious  point. If the advocates for abortion really believed it was such a good  thing they wouldn't be so hysterically intent on shutting you down or  letting another voice in. They - they know they're wrong and that's why  they suppress speech.</p><p>But let me just ask sort of practical question, how can that be? Do you  have any recourse? I mean these are, in effect, public utilities. Is there  anything you can do about it?</p><p>ROSE: Well we've - we've looked at it. I mean we are - we're ultimately  going on other platforms and then making sure that we can reach people  directly through our own website and finding other ways to reach people  because ultimately Twitter has sided with the abortion industry. </p><p>I mean that's what's clear, despite their claims, despite Jack Dorsey,  their CEO, going on the news in the last several weeks and saying \"Look, we  do not discriminate based on viewpoint. That's what we do not do at  Twitter,\" he's flat-out lying. He's lying to people.</p><p>And we are, as you say, Exhibit A. Look, the other part of this, like you  just said, Tucker, is the fact that when people learn the truth, especially  about this human rights issue of abortion, when they learn about what  abortion is, what it does to it to the child in the womb, we have an  abortion procedure series of videos that have been viewed over a 100  million times.</p><p>We survey people and they change their minds on abortion. People are having  Aha moments saying \"Wait a minute. This is - this is violence against a  child. This is harmful to women. We don't want this anymore.\" </p><p>That's what Twitter, I believe, is afraid of because they know when the  truth gets out there about the humanity of the child in the womb, about  what abortion is, the abortionists lose every time.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>ROSE: And that's why Twitter is so interested in defending abortion  interest because that's their ideology despite the lies of their own CEO  about them not having a viewpoint.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, the last thing they want is a conversation about it. They  want to squelch anything they don't agree with.</p><p>ROSE: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: Lila Rose, thank you. Good to see you. </p><p>ROSE: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: If you have an Android phone and you should check then Google is  collecting information on you right now whether you know it or not, and you  probably don't. If you've got a Google app on your iPhone you could also be  exposed to surveillance from Google. Our exclusive investigation into this,  the new surveillance state, is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Welcome back to our special tonight on Tech Tyranny because  tyranny is what it has become. Google, by far, the biggest corporate threat  to the privacy of your personal life, the company recently submitted patent  applications that reveal Google's willingness to put cameras in your  bedroom and spy on your children, then use that information to sell things.</p><p>Currently, Google does not have a camera in every home but it does have a  phone in millions of pockets. So, the question is how much information does  Google get from those phones, information about you?</p><p>FOX News Headlines 24/7 anchor Brett Larson went out to investigate this  exclusively for our show. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARSON: We wanted to figure out what exactly Google is learning about us  throughout the day. So here's what we're going to do. We have two identical  phones. </p><p>The only difference between these two phones is this one is in airplane  mode. Both of the phones lack a SIM card and they haven't been set up to  access any Wi-Fi networks. So for all intents and purposes these phones  have no connection to a data network.</p><p>We're going to keep them with us throughout the day. And while I travel  around D.C., we're going to figure out just what Google is finding out  about me.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Our first stop, Sim's (ph) Convenience Store just  outside our FOX Bureau for a quick coffee. From there, we took a walk to  the Capitol and took a quick walk around the Senate office buildings and  then decided to hop in a car and head around town.</p><p>LARSON: Hello.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey.</p><p>LARSON: We're going to the Children's Hospital please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To run our test we had to do more than walk the block,  so we took a tour around our nation's capital. First, due north, to the  Children's National Medical Center hospital, then west to St. Albans  School, and the National Cathedral. Our tour around town was a 14-mile  journey that lasted more than an hour. The entire time the phones had no  access to the internet.</p><p>LARSON: Oh my goodness.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not a Wi-Fi connection and not any cellular data  service. It almost seemed quaint to assume that Google wouldn't even be  able to collect data on me.</p><p>LARSON: That's it. Back to the Bureau, my friend.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sure.</p><p>LARSON: That church is beautiful.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Google's business model is simple. Collect data on its  users and then use that data to sell targeted ads. It's a business model  called Surveillance Capitalism. But does that critical data collection work  even when your phones aren't connected?</p><p>LARSON: So, we're back here at our FOX Bureau in D.C. And we've got both of  our phones exactly how we left with them. The only difference really, I  snapped a couple of bad selfies at the National Cathedral.</p><p>Uh-ho. </p><p>But otherwise they have stayed in my pocket for the entire day. So let's  find out what they know. This is our man-in-the-middle device. It's  basically a Wi-Fi network that these phones are going to connect to once we  turn their Wi-Fi on.</p><p>It's going to pass data through it on the way to Google. But on the way  we're actually going to get a copy of the same data that Google's going to  get. We'll be able to decrypt it and then find out where we've been  throughout the day.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Within minutes the numbers rolled in. The phone that  wasn't on airplane mode registered more than 100 locations, 130 activities,  and even a 152 barometric readings. As soon as it hooked up to our Wi-Fi,  it transmitted 300 kilobytes of data straight to Google. The phone even  logged our exact locations tracking us all around town, the Capitol, the  hospital, the school, and the Cathedral.</p><p>LARSON: Now, you may notice what's missing here is the exact route that we  took but it got that data too. It knows when I got out of the car.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The metadata has a time log down to the very second,  tracking everything when they think that you're walking, riding, and yes,  even getting out of the car.</p><p>LARSON: OK. So, you're thinking \"This isn't a big deal. I'll just put my  phone in airplane mode.\" Yes, we thought of that too. This is the other  phone that we had with us that no SIM card, also remained in airplane mode  the entire time. Let's see what kind of data it captured.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The phone with airplane mode activated actually logged  more locations and activities than the other phone. And it also transferred  hundreds of kilobytes of data to Google as soon as it was activated.</p><p>LARSON: The only thing that's missing from this map is our stop at the  Children's Hospital. But it still knows we were there. There it is, exiting  vehicle, a 100 percent accuracy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Through complicated user agreements and free software,  Google gets users to sign away their privacy for nothing. They're even  following you in the places that most people would expect total privacy,  government buildings, a children's hospital, a private school, a church,  every move you make, every step you take, Google is watching you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARSON: It is a - a scary conclusion to come to if you are using an Android  device. Tucker, we should also, we should point out, as - as we mentioned  in the piece there, that when you are using Gmail, if you're using Google  Drive, any of their services, you're actually not using a - you're not  using a product, you are the actual products.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>LARSON: You are what Google is selling to advertisers. And that data that  they collect about you is then turned around and sold to advertisers to  more - to give you that very specific level of advertising.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't think people fully appreciate that. So, I mean this is a  remarkable report because it reveals--</p><p>LARSON: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --you don't have control of the surveillance.</p><p>LARSON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: They, in effect, lie to you and say that you do but you don't.</p><p>LARSON: Right, all the time (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: But what about iPhone users?</p><p>LARSON: This is an interesting twist here. With iPhone users, Apple is  capturing a lot of information about you but they're not using it to sell  you advertising. They're using it to better the services that they offer.  But if you are using Google applications on your iPhone, it, in many  instances, is actually capturing all of that same data.</p><p>CARLSON: So, any Google app, so if you have Google Maps, for example--</p><p>LARSON: If you're using Google Maps it can take (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --which I think every living human being with an iPhone does.</p><p>LARSON: Yes, you do because Apple Maps, I'm sorry, Apple Maps is as - an  inferior product.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>LARSON: But yes, if you are using Google Maps, which most of us are, it is  constantly tracking your data. Also, as we learned earlier in the month, if  you're using Google Search and said \"Stop tracking me\" but you're using  Google Search on your mobile device, be that on an iPhone or an Android  device, they are again capturing your location information.</p><p>CARLSON: It's unbelievable. It wouldn't be such a big deal if you could  trust the company if they weren't working on behalf of the Fascist  Government of China. It might (ph) make us feel better. Brett thank you for  that reporting.</p><p>LARSON: Yes. Tucker, thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: I thought it was groundbreaking.</p><p>Well when it's not spying on you, Google is cracking down on ideological  dissent within its own ranks just as the former Google Engineer, James  Damore, who was fired in the name of inclusion and diversity for writing a  memo that called for inclusion and diversity. That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Last summer, James Damore learned what happens when you question  the groupthink of Silicon Valley. While working for Google as an Engineer,  Damore privately circulated a paper he wrote that asked why isn't a company  so committed to diversity more ideologically diverse?</p><p>He didn't attack anyone. He just questioned the internal logic of what he  was being told. For that, the company fired him and then attacked him and  tried to prevent him from working anywhere else. They tried to destroy his  life.</p><p>Damore came on this show, a safe space for dissent, to discuss what  happened to him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: What did they say to you when they canned you? They - when they  called you in, how did the conversation go? What was the justification for  ending your career at Google?</p><p>JAMES DAMORE, FORMER GOOGLE ENGINEER: So, the official justification was  perpetuating gender stereotypes.</p><p>CARLSON: Of all places, you wouldn't think Google would have a culture  where emotional outrage drives decision-making. I mean I thought the whole  point of Google was they're rational but they don't sound rational at all</p><p>DAMORE: Yes, there's certain dogmas that you really can't dissent against  at Google and one of them being that there's any difference between people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: The Orwellian future is increasingly the Orwellian present. Tech  barons are our new commissars. Liberals, who for generations, stood up for  free expression and an opposition to corporate power have been so  thoroughly co-opted they're now against speech and for Google. Why? Because  they're getting rich from it.</p><p>Harmeet Dhillon is a lawyer who represents James Damore. And she joins us  tonight. Harmeet, thanks very much for coming on. We followed the saga  since the very beginning. I know obviously you've been intricately involved  from the very beginning. Google, when last we checked with you, was  basically trying to destroy his life for this memo. Is that still the case?</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, AMERICAN LAWYER, REPUBLICAN PARTY OFFICIAL: Well they have  certainly attempted to destroy his career. They started out after firing  him by smearing him in the international media and then, you know,  continuing this narrative and - and hunting down people in the company who  had supported him internally as well. So, full-blown purge going on there  at Google.</p><p>They also, we believe, helped interfere with James' job search. A prominent  company in Silicon Valley called Hire.com that helps people at the high  tech industry find jobs mysteriously, you know, suddenly dis - disappeared  James from its website within one day and has, you know, belligerently told  us that, you know, they can pick and choose who they help, which is  actually not California law. You cannot do that. </p><p>So, you know, we feel like there's a coordinated effort to make sure that  not just James but people who espouse those types of views are hounded out  of employment in Silicon Valley, and it's really scary.</p><p>CARLSON: Has he not found a job?</p><p>DHILLON: He is employed, you know, because of the fact that - recently by  the way, but because of the fact that, you know, people are being harassed  for supporting him, he's, you know, keeping the location of his workplace  confidential.</p><p>CARLSON: That's - that's - it's unbelievable. And by the way, for our  viewers who may not be fully read into this story if you think that we're  putting a thumb on the scale, go read his memo. It's available online and  see if there's anything, even one sentence in it that is offensive. No,  there isn't. It's the whole thing is bewildering.</p><p>DHILLON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Are there - is there any movement within Google to diversify? Is  there any dissent within Google? Is there anyone who agrees with James who  can speak out or has?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, those people who agreed with James are leaving the company  voluntarily or involuntarily one by one, so it's hard to find out. And what  Google has done, as reported in the media, it is in the wake of the whole  controversy with James has actually tried to revamp its internal message  board policies to, you know, appoint employees of the company to be  basically narcs to spy on each other and then report back to - back to the  management.</p><p>And, you know, I - I wouldn't have thought a year ago if you told me this  was happening in an American company that it would be true. </p><p>But I guess it kind of fits with Google's new move into China where, of  course, and you know, China, they assign social media scores or media  scores or, you know, scores to people that loud that then follow them  throughout their lives, so, you know, the government can control where you  - whether you get to travel and all of that based on this information.</p><p>And in Silicon Valley, it's almost the same thing. If you're assigned a  socially undesirable label by big media or big tech then all of a sudden  you are now out. You're persona non grata.</p><p>CARLSON: So, this is the company who's trying to destroy a young man's life  because it didn't agree with a memo he wrote. This is the company we trust  to hold all human information and sort it for us?</p><p>DHILLON: I mean I don't trust it anymore. A lot of people use, you know,  their services. But I think people should be very careful. And again, you  know, not to, you know, sort of bring in this other issue but when - when  they have all this information about you and they're openly agreeing to  censorship in foreign countries at the demand of foreign countries, how  long is it before you can expect to see that more openly done here? We - we  know--</p><p>CARLSON: It's exactly right.</p><p>DHILLON: --it already happens here with search results and so forth but,  you know, in - in a couple of years when they're doing business in China,  are you going to be able to search for the Dalai Lama in America and get  accurate search results? </p><p>I think that's a huge question that we should be asking and the government  should be asking that because, you know, these companies all operate with  tremendous market power and they meet regularly. Just, I think, last week--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DHILLON: There was a meeting of the top tech companies to talk about  election interference and, you know, what does that really mean and are  they--</p><p>CARLSON: That's a great question.</p><p>DHILLON: --operating as a cartel (ph) in certain ways?</p><p>CARLSON: Of course they are.</p><p>DHILLON: Sure (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: And Congress should act immediately. But they're too afraid.  Harmeet Dhillon, thank you for this. Good to see you.</p><p>DHILLON: My pleasure.</p><p>CARLSON: So once you decide that it's OK to censor opinions you disagree  with, where does that wind up? That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, the tech giants see themselves as gatekeepers of the  internet and, as such, routinely engage in censorship of political speech,  speech they disagree with. In most cases, that affects conservatives. </p><p>But non-mainstream liberals have been targeted too, especially those who  express opposition to the democratic establishment or to endless war. What  are the boundaries of censorship once a company starts making decisions  about what speech is permissible and which speech is not? </p><p>Jesse Kelly is a Marine Corps combat veteran who has fought for free speech  abroad. He is the host of the Jesse Kelly Radio Show in Houston and he  joins us tonight. Jesse, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>So, you wrote this piece that I thought was really compelling about Alex  Jones. And you said \"Look, I don't agree with Alex Jones, his views but  that's not the point.\" The point, as you articulated, was if you can  silence this guy because you don't like what he says why can't they silence  you or me?</p><p>JESSE KELLY, UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS COMBAT VETERAN: That's - that is  the point, Tucker. And they're coming for you and me next. </p><p>Alex Jones was the weak member of the herd because of his insane views on  certain things. They knew they could pick him off, and what he was, was a  test-run. If we can pick off this nutjob then maybe sooner or later we can  come for the more mainstream voices on the right. </p><p>This is not - the social media, Facebook, Twitter, that's 2.5 billion  people they reach. People have to understand it's no longer a couple of  nerds sitting in a college dorm room swapping stories about a made-up  girlfriend. It's real and it's powerful.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I watched feeling nauseous as almost no figures on that as you  just said mainstream right rose to the defense of Alex Jones, not defending  what he said but defending his right to say it, the most basic American  principle. Why did they sit silently as this happened?</p><p>KELLY: Because everybody wants to be the one that's eaten last, Tucker.  They convince themselves--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, exactly.</p><p>KELLY: --in the interest of never having to have a fight that if the lion  will just gorge himself on enough of those antelope eventually he'll never  come eat me. But that's not how it works. It is - it is we're really  whistling past the graveyard. </p><p>We gave them Hollywood. We gave them the education system. And to rely on  Google Now or Facebook for your news is like pouring a cup of coffee and  then filtering it through a jockstrap before you drink it.</p><p>CARLSON: Which doesn't work, I've checked. Yes, I mean social media very  quickly really is the last place where dissent is allowed. It's not allowed  in the workplace. It's not allowed in public parks. If they take that away  people with different views are silenced, correct?</p><p>KELLY: It is - it is - correct. It is the final frontier. It's no longer  just a random thing. It is how you break news. It's how you make news.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KELLY: Social media makes careers. It's - it's how things are done. It's  what's used by law enforcement to track people. It is the information age  and if we--</p><p>CARLSON: That's exactly right.</p><p>KELLY: --let Left to censor that that's modern book-burning is what that  is.</p><p>CARLSON: Jesse Kelly, so nicely put. God bless you for standing up for  speech especially against the backdrop of all the cowardice around us. It's  distressing. Thank you.</p><p>KELLY: Appreciate you.</p><p>CARLSON: That's it for the special edition of TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT,  investigation into big tech topic. We're going to keep up with every night  at 8:00, so join us there. We'll see you.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Multi-billion  dollar companies in Silicon Valley are waging, in effect, a war on your  privacy, your culture, your freedom of speech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They are the portal through which all human information flows and they have  their thumb on the scale. The results of the searches you conduct online  they control those. Your phone, they own it, in effect. They track you  everywhere you go. Even when the phone is off, they collect intimate  information on you. They sell it to advertisers for a profit. They give you  no details about this.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These companies are politically radical. They are funding the activism  that's changing our country right now. There's nothing that you can do to  check their power. Congress should be doing that but they're not.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Increasingly, these countries are using their power and influence to shape  the world around us. Some of these companies are bigger than the economies  of entire nations. This show is an examination of those companies and the  effects they have on our lives, our country, and our politics. The scale of  their reach is enormous. And it is finally drawing the attention of  policymakers including the President.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think that Google and  Facebook and Twitter, I think they treat conservatives and Republicans very  unfairly. And I think it's a very serious problem because they're really  trying to silence a very large part of this country. And those people don't  want to be silenced. It's not right. It's not fair. It may not be legal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARLSON: FOX News Headlines Anchor Brett Larson has been on the tech beat  for us for quite some time. And he's going to set the table for us tonight.  Brett?</p><p>BRETT LARSON, ANCHOR, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7: All right Tucker, yes.  Earlier this week, the President sent out a tweet in which he said in part  \"Google Search results for Trump News shows only the viewing/reporting of  Fake News Media. In other words, they have it rigged for me and others so  that almost all stories and news is bad.\"</p><p>Now Google was quick to respond to the claim in a statement saying in part  \"Search is not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our results  toward any political ideology.\" </p><p>As for how Google Search works that is a closely guarded secret. Algorithms  used by online sites including Google, Twitter and Facebook are protected  like the recipe for Coca-Cola. Why? Well if sites knew exactly how the  search site worked, it would be easier to rig their web content to reach a  larger audience.</p><p>But a few things are known about how Google Search works. Google is  scanning the web for new pages around the clock and they're looking for a  variety of things to ensure that the right pages are delivered to the right  people.</p><p>They check to see that a site is mobile-friendly, so it renders properly on  your smartphone if you're on the go. They also check to make sure the  content is original and not just some plagiarized information with a bunch  of ads slapped around it.</p><p>But where you go online also affects your search results. As we know, and  we have reported here before, Google keeps track of virtually everything  you do mainly to ensure they show you the right ads. We'll have more on our  investigation later this hour.</p><p>But, in this case, it's also to ensure you're getting the right search  results. As for news search, it's a little different. As we know, news is  happening 24 hours a day. But a reliable source is needed for a news story. </p><p>A site that creates more content that is optimized for search will likely  get a higher ranking but also a site that gets click-through from the  results. So if, for example, you search for California wildfires and in the  results more people are going to our FOX affiliate, KTVU, their site, they  will move higher in the rankings. </p><p>Now this is where the mainstream media has an advantage. Though as they  present more middle-of-the-road news without leaning to the left or to the  right, so they'll have a larger reach within those results. Tucker?</p><p>CARLSON: Depending upon who defines what middle-of-the-road is.</p><p>LARSON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Brett, thank you very much.</p><p>LARSON: Thanks Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: We're going to see you later this hour.</p><p>LARSON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: So you just heard what Google says it does. The question is can we  trust them? That is the central question. Here's some background on the  company. </p><p>Google just removed its famous catchphrase \"Don't be evil\" from its  corporate code of conduct earlier this year. It was a symbolic change but  also maybe ominous for the most powerful company in human history.</p><p>Google's market cap is now about $860 billion. That's more than the gross  domestic product of almost every country in the world. 170 countries have  smaller GDPs than Google. The Federal Trade Commission prepared an anti- trust case against the tech giant a few years ago but the Obama Justice  Department didn't take it.</p><p>Google now controls roughly 90 percent of the search engine market, 65  percent of the internet browser market. It controls 85 percent of the  mobile operating systems on the phones in our pockets right now.</p><p>Google controls an outsized portion of the online ad market which means  they also control the companies that rely on online advertising that is  every single digital news company in the United States.</p><p>Google has an army of lobbyists in Washington. It bankrolls politicians in  both parties. It contributes to virtually every major think tank in  Washington regardless of ideologies including, hilariously, a think tank  dedicated to fighting monopolies.</p><p>At least one of those think tanks has fired a staff for being critical of  Google. So the question is, and it may be rhetorical, is Google too  powerful to regulate?</p><p>Scott Cleland is the author of Search &amp; Destroy: Why You Can't Trust Google  Inc. He joins us now. </p><p>So Scott, very quickly on the search question that seems like one of the  most basic questions, all of our information comes through this tiny little  portal, Google says \"Trust us. We're not putting our thumb on the scale.\"  Can we?</p><p>SCOTT CLELAND, PRESIDENT, PRECURSOR LLC, INTERNETIZATION STRATEGIST: No, we  can't because it's blanket trust. It's blind trust because no one does  really know what goes on there. </p><p>The problem is when you put all of access of supply and demand to access  all the world's information through one black box, one thing that we have  no transparency to, we don't understand. And let's not forget, the whole  purpose of it is to rank, so it is to choose--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>CLELAND: --what is best. They said for years it's algorithmic. So if it's  algorithmic it must be OK. Well an algorithm is just a computer program  that - that people decided what the biases would be.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>CLELAND: Their purposeful biases. But the problem of Google is the fact  that we have concentrated all that power in one company because if it's -  it's the most harmful monopoly you can imagine. Information is power. Power  corrupts - absolute - power corrupts absolutely.</p><p>In a constitutional republic, in a free market, the free flow of  information and the competition of ideas are paramount and central. And  when you go through one black box and say that is all occurring only here  and there's one person that basically sets what the ideology and the  approach is going to be, and it's Larry Page, and then that filters  through, you have a - it's a very scary situation.</p><p>You want a competition for ideas. You want a competition for sources. He  has created an unbelievably innovative and great search engine. No  criticism there in the sense of its capability. But how the government -  and I, for 10 years, been trying to prevent this monopoly and the  government screwed up over time and time again in allowing Google to become  this monopoly.</p><p>CARLSON: That's for sure. So - so quickly, news reports have reported that  Google is working to devise a search engine that would help the Fascist  Government of China repress its own people. So given that we know we  believe we know that they are willing to suppress information on behalf of  a government to achieve repressive political ends, why should we trust them  not to do that to us?</p><p>CLELAND: Well we shouldn't. And my goodness, this is always Orwellian as it  comes because when that was brought up and when somebody, you know, on who  we know criticized Google for bias in its search, the President of the  United States, they had their answer that says \"We never make our search  results based on a political ideology.\" Well they are committing to do it  for China, for the entire country, soup-to-nuts for everything they're  going to bow down to the Chinese ideology, so--</p><p>CARLSON: You're (ph) not a big deal. A country that executes political  prisoners and sells their organs, seems like just the kind of people you'd  want, you know, to help remain in power.</p><p>CLELAND: But how they can say that with straight face and then saying that  they're not bending it - their will to ideology. They do it all around the  world.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, they're lying. Scott, you have been fighting a lonely  crusade on behalf of this idea and we're obviously rooting for you. Thank  you.</p><p>CLELAND: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: So European regulators fined Google billions after they accused  the company of abusing its power in engaging in anti-competitive practices.  American regulators meanwhile are nowhere to be found. Why is that exactly? </p><p>Luther Lowe is the Senior Vice President of Public Policy for Yelp. And he  joins us now. Luther thanks for coming.</p><p>LUTHER LOWE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF PUBLIC POLICY, YELP: It's good to be  here (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: And I'm always particularly happy to talk to you since you're  right in the middle of this world. You work for a big tech company. It's a  really simple question. Google has a monopoly. Nobody debates that.  Monopolies are supposed to be banned by U.S. law. We have a whole Congress  with 535 people designed to protect us from monopolies but they're not.  Why?</p><p>LOWE: Well I think there are - there's political capture going on. And I  think if you have a - a search engine that is clearly guilty of self- serving bias, and I'm not talking about the type of self-serving bias that  President Trump tweeted about earlier this week, I'm talking about  demonstrable, easy-to-prove bias in the most common area of what we do on  Google, which is local search.</p><p>This should be a slam dunk. You - we should be able to show consumer harm.  And in fact, we have done so. You know, when a mom does a search for a  pediatrician in Salt Lake City, she is basically trusting Google to match  her with the best information from across the web.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, absolutely (ph).</p><p>LOWE: That has been the implicit promise to Google's users throughout its  growth. But what's happened is that Google has swapped out that information  and put their own inferior information there. And so, this creates consumer  harm and it gets back to your question about monopoly.</p><p>If you can show that consumer harm then you can easily prosecute an anti- trust case. And this is why, I think, we should focus on the business  conduct of Google as it relates to search bias.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I agree completely. But it - the - the monopoly is prima  facie, and so is the harm.</p><p>LOWE: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: You work in Washington on this issue. Doubtless, you've spoken to  Members of Congress and you've told them what they already know. This is -  company's too powerful. It has a monopoly. It's hurting consumers. How did  they respond?</p><p>LOWE: I mean I think we are starting to see the tide turn. And I was really  heartened to see, for example, Senator Hatch's letter yesterday to the  Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission where he basically said listen,  you know, we closed the last investigation in 2013. </p><p>One expects that when you close an anti-trust investigation the market is  going to be less calcified that there are going to be, you know, the  company in question is going to be less entrenched. There's got to be more  start-up and so forth but we're seeing the opposite. And so, maybe we  should take another look at this. And so, I think we're beginning to see  the tide turn--</p><p>CARLSON: Good, good for Senator Hatch. But I think there are 99 other guys  in the same chamber. Where are they? What would be the justification  quickly for not acting? I don't understand.</p><p>LOWE: Well the FTC, we have a completely new slate of FTC commissioners.  They're running public hearing - hearings now to collect information. And  I'm cautiously optimistic that we're going to re-examine a lot of these  questions as we should.</p><p>CARLSON: Google is not an American company. It's a multinational. This is a  foreign threat to our country. That's my view. It's a national security  threat. Thank you for the work you've done.</p><p>LOWE: Thank you, Tucker (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Free online services aren't actually free. You may have known  that. They come at a cost. You're paying that cost in privacy. We've got  details ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Welcome back to our special TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT, Tech Tyranny.  And tyranny is not an overstatement in this case. The man behind the book  and the movie Clinton Cash that exposed the Clinton Foundation's pay-for- play relationship with various foreign governments is coming out with a new  film and the target is big tech. Here's a preview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They can suppress certain types of results based on  what they think you should be seeing, based on what your followers are  presenting.</p><p>PETER FRANZ SCHWEIZER, AMERICAN INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST, NOVELIST, AUTHOR,  POLITICAL CONSULTANT: It's what Google and Facebook are doing on regular  basis by suppressing stories like steering us towards other stories rather  than the stories we're actually seeking.</p><p>ROBERT EPSTEIN, SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST, AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR  BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY: It will always favor one online music  service over another and one candidate over another.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Google crosses the creepy line every day.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Film comes out September 17th. Peter Schweizer, of course, is the  man behind the project. And he joins us tonight. Peter, first,  congratulations on this film, remarkably prescient. And I'm sure it'll be  as smart as your last project was. </p><p>As you did it, you spent all those time looking into this subject, tell us  what are (ph) the salient things you learned? What - what blew your mind in  researching this?</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Well what blew my mind is a couple of things, Tucker. First of  all, the dominance that Google has in the marketplace. But second of all,  Google is unlike pretty much almost any other company in the world.</p><p>What do I mean by that? Sure, they're motivated by profit. They have  shareholders. They have owners. But this is a company that in its core is  utopian or, at least, the founders have a utopian vision.</p><p>They don't view themselves as another company. So, when people say \"Oh,  Google would never manipulate the algorithm, they would never engage in  this kind of behavior because they don't want to hurt their market share,\"  they don't think in those terms.</p><p>They make decisions all the time that are based on their vision of what is  good and right rather than what consumers want. And with the power they  have, combined with this sort of idealism, I think creates the problems  that we have today with censorship and with manipulation.</p><p>CARLSON: So give us a sense. I mean I think you just got right to the heart  of it. They have a vision.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Is their vision, would you say, in sync with the views of your  average American? What is their vision?</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Well I think their vision, you know, certainly is partly  epitomized by Burning Man, sort of this festival that they go to. In fact,  when they hired Eric Schmidt to be the CEO, you know, 15 or so years ago,  one of the reasons they picked him is because he went to Burning Man.</p><p>And this is sort of a - a, you know, secularist sort of religious gathering  in the Nevada desert. There's a lot of things about traditional values they  don't like. There are lot of views about sort of conservative free-market  capitalism they don't like.</p><p>And they have a vision that they want to be transformative. And that's fine  except they want to be transformative to, I think, an American public that  isn't interested in being transformed by them.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: And the problem is, Tucker that we don't know what they're  doing. We don't know what we don't know. We know the end results. We know  that there's provable evidence of manipulation but we don't know how it's  being done. That's what makes it, I think, so troubling and difficult to  get underneath.</p><p>CARLSON: They're not an American company, obviously. They're a  multinational company despite the fact Al Gore owns a lot of the stock. Do  they see themselves as a company that has an obligation to America,  American society, American culture, our economy, or no?</p><p>SCHWEIZER: No. No, they don't. They don't. I think they view themselves as  a transformative country. And look, you know, when they - they read that  statement to say that we don't manipulate the algorithm, you know, for a  political benefit I mean that rings hollow, you know.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Go back five to 10 years ago, they were charged with  manipulating the algorithm for commercial purposes. Luther Lowe was talking  about that on the show.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: What was Google's position? It was the same absolute denial. The  problem is, the European Union, the Federal Trade Commission, scholars at  Harvard, and elsewhere have looked at this, and says that Google is lying.  So why should we believe them now? The evidence is overwhelming. They're  engaging in political manipulation as well.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course they are. And our Congress does nothing. Peter  Schweizer. Again, the movie comes out September 17th and you just know it's  going to be worth watching. Thank you for that.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Well what would happen if the social media companies started to  pick winners and losers in elections? It's not a small question. It could  invalidate our democracy instantly. We'll investigate that coming up on  this special edition of TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Live from America's News  Headquarters, I'm Trace Gallagher in Los Angeles. Congress gave John McCain  its highest honor today. Members assembled under the Capitol rotunda to pay  their final respects to the man known as the maverick.</p><p>One by one, Democrats and Republicans paid tribute to his flag-draped  casket. Among those attending the service was McCain's mother, Roberta, a  106 years old. House Speaker Paul Ryan called McCain one of the bravest  souls our nation has produced. He died last Saturday, four days before his  82nd birthday. </p><p>In Detroit, mourners paid an emotional farewell to another American icon,  the Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin. Performers at her eight-hour ceremony  included Stevie Wonder, Faith Hill, Ariana Grande and Chaka Khan. Former  President, Bill Clinton, spoke at the service. Franklin died earlier this  month from pancreatic cancer. She was 76 years old. </p><p>I'm Trace Gallagher. Now back to Tucker Carlson.</p><p>CARLSON: So, here's the central question for all of us who live in this  country, how much power do the tech companies have over our democratic  elections? American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology Senior  Research Psychologist, Robert Epstein, weighed in on that question on this  show. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EPSTEIN: We should be extremely concerned because I can tell you the bottom  line here is content no longer matters. All that matters is the filtering  and ordering of content. And that is completely in the hands of Google and  Facebook. I think the problems can be solved at some point. But at the  moment, I think, democracy is in trouble.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well that probably woke you up. Dan Bongino is a contributor at  NRATV and a frequent guest on this show. He joins us tonight. So Dan, why  is this not a much graver threat than Russia? Why is this not a foreign  threat from a foreign country to the heart of our democracy?</p><p>DANIEL JOHN BONGINO, FORMER AGENT OF THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE,  NRATV CONTRIBUTOR: Well - well it is, Tucker. I think that's obvious to  rational people but that assumes we're dealing with rational people. We're  not. We're dealing with politicians and a media swamp that's interested  simply in combating Donald Trump. </p><p>And they believe, I believe, wrongly that the Russian narrative works for  them. But this targeting of conservative content is very real. Any one on  these social media platforms has experienced it.</p><p>I've experienced it myself. I actually have the trifecta for you. I was  banned from running ads on Twitter for what they cited as inappropriate  content, which is odd because all I post is conservative content. That's  all I do.</p><p>They never explained what the inappropriate content was. On YouTube, our  videos for our - our podcast get flagged all the time. They have a little  yellow button. And when it turns yellow you can't earn any money on it.</p><p>Now, that doesn't happen as often to Liberal friends who might (ph) do the  same thing. And on Instagram, we have a tough time getting a blue checkmark  despite, you know, 60,000 followers.</p><p>So, this is very real. And when it happens to candidates running for  office, which we've seen, it's even worse.</p><p>CARLSON: But it doesn't even need to happen to candidates to threaten the  rest of us because it shuts down part of the conversation and that  inevitably is--</p><p>BONGINO: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --got to have an effect on how people vote. If you don't hear  ideas, obviously, you can't internalize them. So why isn't that right there  a threat to our elections?</p><p>BONGINO: No, it is. And - and they want - what they want is they want  their, you know, they want to have it both ways. What they want, Tucker,  these social media platforms, let's be clear on this, they want the  protections of being an open platform. In other words, in plain English,  \"Hey we're not responsible for what people post. Don't screw (ph) us.\"</p><p>CARLSON: Right, exactly.</p><p>BONGINO: But then on the other hand they treat themselves like publishers.  They have these - they call them - the new - the new catchphrase is the  algorithm, Tucker. That's really a selective process of weeding out  conservative content and giving--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>BONGINO: --favor to liberal content in the new public space. You can't have  it both ways guys.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly. An algorithm is editing. That's exact - that's what we  used to call it in journalism. Dan Bongino, thank you for that.</p><p>BONGINO: OK. Yes, sir (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: So impressed (ph) as always. The tech giants are obviously  politically biased against conservatives. No one really disputes that. But  Exhibit A is special hostility to people with pro-life views. They're hated  above all. </p><p>Lila Rose would know. She's Founder and President of Live Action that's a  pro-life group. And she joins us tonight. Lila Rose, thank you for coming  on. Tell us your experience with social media.</p><p>LILA ROSE, FOUNDER &amp; PRESIDENT, LIVE ACTION ADVOCATE: Sure. So, Live Action  is the large - has a largest following online for the pro-life movement,  over 3 million people. Our videos have hundreds of millions of views  online. </p><p>And for the last three years, we have been totally banned from doing any  advertising on Twitter. Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood and other pro- abortion groups are advertising and they're even advertising petitions to  further suppress and censor Live Action and other pro-life groups. So, this  is what we've been facing now for three years.</p><p>CARLSON: Look, and can I (ph) stand three steps back and make an obvious  point. If the advocates for abortion really believed it was such a good  thing they wouldn't be so hysterically intent on shutting you down or  letting another voice in. They - they know they're wrong and that's why  they suppress speech.</p><p>But let me just ask sort of practical question, how can that be? Do you  have any recourse? I mean these are, in effect, public utilities. Is there  anything you can do about it?</p><p>ROSE: Well we've - we've looked at it. I mean we are - we're ultimately  going on other platforms and then making sure that we can reach people  directly through our own website and finding other ways to reach people  because ultimately Twitter has sided with the abortion industry. </p><p>I mean that's what's clear, despite their claims, despite Jack Dorsey,  their CEO, going on the news in the last several weeks and saying \"Look, we  do not discriminate based on viewpoint. That's what we do not do at  Twitter,\" he's flat-out lying. He's lying to people.</p><p>And we are, as you say, Exhibit A. Look, the other part of this, like you  just said, Tucker, is the fact that when people learn the truth, especially  about this human rights issue of abortion, when they learn about what  abortion is, what it does to it to the child in the womb, we have an  abortion procedure series of videos that have been viewed over a 100  million times.</p><p>We survey people and they change their minds on abortion. People are having  Aha moments saying \"Wait a minute. This is - this is violence against a  child. This is harmful to women. We don't want this anymore.\" </p><p>That's what Twitter, I believe, is afraid of because they know when the  truth gets out there about the humanity of the child in the womb, about  what abortion is, the abortionists lose every time.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>ROSE: And that's why Twitter is so interested in defending abortion  interest because that's their ideology despite the lies of their own CEO  about them not having a viewpoint.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, the last thing they want is a conversation about it. They  want to squelch anything they don't agree with.</p><p>ROSE: Exactly.</p><p>CARLSON: Lila Rose, thank you. Good to see you. </p><p>ROSE: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: If you have an Android phone and you should check then Google is  collecting information on you right now whether you know it or not, and you  probably don't. If you've got a Google app on your iPhone you could also be  exposed to surveillance from Google. Our exclusive investigation into this,  the new surveillance state, is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Welcome back to our special tonight on Tech Tyranny because  tyranny is what it has become. Google, by far, the biggest corporate threat  to the privacy of your personal life, the company recently submitted patent  applications that reveal Google's willingness to put cameras in your  bedroom and spy on your children, then use that information to sell things.</p><p>Currently, Google does not have a camera in every home but it does have a  phone in millions of pockets. So, the question is how much information does  Google get from those phones, information about you?</p><p>FOX News Headlines 24/7 anchor Brett Larson went out to investigate this  exclusively for our show. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARSON: We wanted to figure out what exactly Google is learning about us  throughout the day. So here's what we're going to do. We have two identical  phones. </p><p>The only difference between these two phones is this one is in airplane  mode. Both of the phones lack a SIM card and they haven't been set up to  access any Wi-Fi networks. So for all intents and purposes these phones  have no connection to a data network.</p><p>We're going to keep them with us throughout the day. And while I travel  around D.C., we're going to figure out just what Google is finding out  about me.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Our first stop, Sim's (ph) Convenience Store just  outside our FOX Bureau for a quick coffee. From there, we took a walk to  the Capitol and took a quick walk around the Senate office buildings and  then decided to hop in a car and head around town.</p><p>LARSON: Hello.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey.</p><p>LARSON: We're going to the Children's Hospital please.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: To run our test we had to do more than walk the block,  so we took a tour around our nation's capital. First, due north, to the  Children's National Medical Center hospital, then west to St. Albans  School, and the National Cathedral. Our tour around town was a 14-mile  journey that lasted more than an hour. The entire time the phones had no  access to the internet.</p><p>LARSON: Oh my goodness.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not a Wi-Fi connection and not any cellular data  service. It almost seemed quaint to assume that Google wouldn't even be  able to collect data on me.</p><p>LARSON: That's it. Back to the Bureau, my friend.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sure.</p><p>LARSON: That church is beautiful.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Google's business model is simple. Collect data on its  users and then use that data to sell targeted ads. It's a business model  called Surveillance Capitalism. But does that critical data collection work  even when your phones aren't connected?</p><p>LARSON: So, we're back here at our FOX Bureau in D.C. And we've got both of  our phones exactly how we left with them. The only difference really, I  snapped a couple of bad selfies at the National Cathedral.</p><p>Uh-ho. </p><p>But otherwise they have stayed in my pocket for the entire day. So let's  find out what they know. This is our man-in-the-middle device. It's  basically a Wi-Fi network that these phones are going to connect to once we  turn their Wi-Fi on.</p><p>It's going to pass data through it on the way to Google. But on the way  we're actually going to get a copy of the same data that Google's going to  get. We'll be able to decrypt it and then find out where we've been  throughout the day.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Within minutes the numbers rolled in. The phone that  wasn't on airplane mode registered more than 100 locations, 130 activities,  and even a 152 barometric readings. As soon as it hooked up to our Wi-Fi,  it transmitted 300 kilobytes of data straight to Google. The phone even  logged our exact locations tracking us all around town, the Capitol, the  hospital, the school, and the Cathedral.</p><p>LARSON: Now, you may notice what's missing here is the exact route that we  took but it got that data too. It knows when I got out of the car.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The metadata has a time log down to the very second,  tracking everything when they think that you're walking, riding, and yes,  even getting out of the car.</p><p>LARSON: OK. So, you're thinking \"This isn't a big deal. I'll just put my  phone in airplane mode.\" Yes, we thought of that too. This is the other  phone that we had with us that no SIM card, also remained in airplane mode  the entire time. Let's see what kind of data it captured.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The phone with airplane mode activated actually logged  more locations and activities than the other phone. And it also transferred  hundreds of kilobytes of data to Google as soon as it was activated.</p><p>LARSON: The only thing that's missing from this map is our stop at the  Children's Hospital. But it still knows we were there. There it is, exiting  vehicle, a 100 percent accuracy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Through complicated user agreements and free software,  Google gets users to sign away their privacy for nothing. They're even  following you in the places that most people would expect total privacy,  government buildings, a children's hospital, a private school, a church,  every move you make, every step you take, Google is watching you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARSON: It is a - a scary conclusion to come to if you are using an Android  device. Tucker, we should also, we should point out, as - as we mentioned  in the piece there, that when you are using Gmail, if you're using Google  Drive, any of their services, you're actually not using a - you're not  using a product, you are the actual products.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>LARSON: You are what Google is selling to advertisers. And that data that  they collect about you is then turned around and sold to advertisers to  more - to give you that very specific level of advertising.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't think people fully appreciate that. So, I mean this is a  remarkable report because it reveals--</p><p>LARSON: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --you don't have control of the surveillance.</p><p>LARSON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: They, in effect, lie to you and say that you do but you don't.</p><p>LARSON: Right, all the time (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: But what about iPhone users?</p><p>LARSON: This is an interesting twist here. With iPhone users, Apple is  capturing a lot of information about you but they're not using it to sell  you advertising. They're using it to better the services that they offer.  But if you are using Google applications on your iPhone, it, in many  instances, is actually capturing all of that same data.</p><p>CARLSON: So, any Google app, so if you have Google Maps, for example--</p><p>LARSON: If you're using Google Maps it can take (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --which I think every living human being with an iPhone does.</p><p>LARSON: Yes, you do because Apple Maps, I'm sorry, Apple Maps is as - an  inferior product.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>LARSON: But yes, if you are using Google Maps, which most of us are, it is  constantly tracking your data. Also, as we learned earlier in the month, if  you're using Google Search and said \"Stop tracking me\" but you're using  Google Search on your mobile device, be that on an iPhone or an Android  device, they are again capturing your location information.</p><p>CARLSON: It's unbelievable. It wouldn't be such a big deal if you could  trust the company if they weren't working on behalf of the Fascist  Government of China. It might (ph) make us feel better. Brett thank you for  that reporting.</p><p>LARSON: Yes. Tucker, thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: I thought it was groundbreaking.</p><p>Well when it's not spying on you, Google is cracking down on ideological  dissent within its own ranks just as the former Google Engineer, James  Damore, who was fired in the name of inclusion and diversity for writing a  memo that called for inclusion and diversity. That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Last summer, James Damore learned what happens when you question  the groupthink of Silicon Valley. While working for Google as an Engineer,  Damore privately circulated a paper he wrote that asked why isn't a company  so committed to diversity more ideologically diverse?</p><p>He didn't attack anyone. He just questioned the internal logic of what he  was being told. For that, the company fired him and then attacked him and  tried to prevent him from working anywhere else. They tried to destroy his  life.</p><p>Damore came on this show, a safe space for dissent, to discuss what  happened to him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: What did they say to you when they canned you? They - when they  called you in, how did the conversation go? What was the justification for  ending your career at Google?</p><p>JAMES DAMORE, FORMER GOOGLE ENGINEER: So, the official justification was  perpetuating gender stereotypes.</p><p>CARLSON: Of all places, you wouldn't think Google would have a culture  where emotional outrage drives decision-making. I mean I thought the whole  point of Google was they're rational but they don't sound rational at all</p><p>DAMORE: Yes, there's certain dogmas that you really can't dissent against  at Google and one of them being that there's any difference between people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: The Orwellian future is increasingly the Orwellian present. Tech  barons are our new commissars. Liberals, who for generations, stood up for  free expression and an opposition to corporate power have been so  thoroughly co-opted they're now against speech and for Google. Why? Because  they're getting rich from it.</p><p>Harmeet Dhillon is a lawyer who represents James Damore. And she joins us  tonight. Harmeet, thanks very much for coming on. We followed the saga  since the very beginning. I know obviously you've been intricately involved  from the very beginning. Google, when last we checked with you, was  basically trying to destroy his life for this memo. Is that still the case?</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, AMERICAN LAWYER, REPUBLICAN PARTY OFFICIAL: Well they have  certainly attempted to destroy his career. They started out after firing  him by smearing him in the international media and then, you know,  continuing this narrative and - and hunting down people in the company who  had supported him internally as well. So, full-blown purge going on there  at Google.</p><p>They also, we believe, helped interfere with James' job search. A prominent  company in Silicon Valley called Hire.com that helps people at the high  tech industry find jobs mysteriously, you know, suddenly dis - disappeared  James from its website within one day and has, you know, belligerently told  us that, you know, they can pick and choose who they help, which is  actually not California law. You cannot do that. </p><p>So, you know, we feel like there's a coordinated effort to make sure that  not just James but people who espouse those types of views are hounded out  of employment in Silicon Valley, and it's really scary.</p><p>CARLSON: Has he not found a job?</p><p>DHILLON: He is employed, you know, because of the fact that - recently by  the way, but because of the fact that, you know, people are being harassed  for supporting him, he's, you know, keeping the location of his workplace  confidential.</p><p>CARLSON: That's - that's - it's unbelievable. And by the way, for our  viewers who may not be fully read into this story if you think that we're  putting a thumb on the scale, go read his memo. It's available online and  see if there's anything, even one sentence in it that is offensive. No,  there isn't. It's the whole thing is bewildering.</p><p>DHILLON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Are there - is there any movement within Google to diversify? Is  there any dissent within Google? Is there anyone who agrees with James who  can speak out or has?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, those people who agreed with James are leaving the company  voluntarily or involuntarily one by one, so it's hard to find out. And what  Google has done, as reported in the media, it is in the wake of the whole  controversy with James has actually tried to revamp its internal message  board policies to, you know, appoint employees of the company to be  basically narcs to spy on each other and then report back to - back to the  management.</p><p>And, you know, I - I wouldn't have thought a year ago if you told me this  was happening in an American company that it would be true. </p><p>But I guess it kind of fits with Google's new move into China where, of  course, and you know, China, they assign social media scores or media  scores or, you know, scores to people that loud that then follow them  throughout their lives, so, you know, the government can control where you  - whether you get to travel and all of that based on this information.</p><p>And in Silicon Valley, it's almost the same thing. If you're assigned a  socially undesirable label by big media or big tech then all of a sudden  you are now out. You're persona non grata.</p><p>CARLSON: So, this is the company who's trying to destroy a young man's life  because it didn't agree with a memo he wrote. This is the company we trust  to hold all human information and sort it for us?</p><p>DHILLON: I mean I don't trust it anymore. A lot of people use, you know,  their services. But I think people should be very careful. And again, you  know, not to, you know, sort of bring in this other issue but when - when  they have all this information about you and they're openly agreeing to  censorship in foreign countries at the demand of foreign countries, how  long is it before you can expect to see that more openly done here? We - we  know--</p><p>CARLSON: It's exactly right.</p><p>DHILLON: --it already happens here with search results and so forth but,  you know, in - in a couple of years when they're doing business in China,  are you going to be able to search for the Dalai Lama in America and get  accurate search results? </p><p>I think that's a huge question that we should be asking and the government  should be asking that because, you know, these companies all operate with  tremendous market power and they meet regularly. Just, I think, last week--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DHILLON: There was a meeting of the top tech companies to talk about  election interference and, you know, what does that really mean and are  they--</p><p>CARLSON: That's a great question.</p><p>DHILLON: --operating as a cartel (ph) in certain ways?</p><p>CARLSON: Of course they are.</p><p>DHILLON: Sure (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: And Congress should act immediately. But they're too afraid.  Harmeet Dhillon, thank you for this. Good to see you.</p><p>DHILLON: My pleasure.</p><p>CARLSON: So once you decide that it's OK to censor opinions you disagree  with, where does that wind up? That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, the tech giants see themselves as gatekeepers of the  internet and, as such, routinely engage in censorship of political speech,  speech they disagree with. In most cases, that affects conservatives. </p><p>But non-mainstream liberals have been targeted too, especially those who  express opposition to the democratic establishment or to endless war. What  are the boundaries of censorship once a company starts making decisions  about what speech is permissible and which speech is not? </p><p>Jesse Kelly is a Marine Corps combat veteran who has fought for free speech  abroad. He is the host of the Jesse Kelly Radio Show in Houston and he  joins us tonight. Jesse, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>So, you wrote this piece that I thought was really compelling about Alex  Jones. And you said \"Look, I don't agree with Alex Jones, his views but  that's not the point.\" The point, as you articulated, was if you can  silence this guy because you don't like what he says why can't they silence  you or me?</p><p>JESSE KELLY, UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS COMBAT VETERAN: That's - that is  the point, Tucker. And they're coming for you and me next. </p><p>Alex Jones was the weak member of the herd because of his insane views on  certain things. They knew they could pick him off, and what he was, was a  test-run. If we can pick off this nutjob then maybe sooner or later we can  come for the more mainstream voices on the right. </p><p>This is not - the social media, Facebook, Twitter, that's 2.5 billion  people they reach. People have to understand it's no longer a couple of  nerds sitting in a college dorm room swapping stories about a made-up  girlfriend. It's real and it's powerful.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I watched feeling nauseous as almost no figures on that as you  just said mainstream right rose to the defense of Alex Jones, not defending  what he said but defending his right to say it, the most basic American  principle. Why did they sit silently as this happened?</p><p>KELLY: Because everybody wants to be the one that's eaten last, Tucker.  They convince themselves--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, exactly.</p><p>KELLY: --in the interest of never having to have a fight that if the lion  will just gorge himself on enough of those antelope eventually he'll never  come eat me. But that's not how it works. It is - it is we're really  whistling past the graveyard. </p><p>We gave them Hollywood. We gave them the education system. And to rely on  Google Now or Facebook for your news is like pouring a cup of coffee and  then filtering it through a jockstrap before you drink it.</p><p>CARLSON: Which doesn't work, I've checked. Yes, I mean social media very  quickly really is the last place where dissent is allowed. It's not allowed  in the workplace. It's not allowed in public parks. If they take that away  people with different views are silenced, correct?</p><p>KELLY: It is - it is - correct. It is the final frontier. It's no longer  just a random thing. It is how you break news. It's how you make news.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KELLY: Social media makes careers. It's - it's how things are done. It's  what's used by law enforcement to track people. It is the information age  and if we--</p><p>CARLSON: That's exactly right.</p><p>KELLY: --let Left to censor that that's modern book-burning is what that  is.</p><p>CARLSON: Jesse Kelly, so nicely put. God bless you for standing up for  speech especially against the backdrop of all the cowardice around us. It's  distressing. Thank you.</p><p>KELLY: Appreciate you.</p><p>CARLSON: That's it for the special edition of TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT,  investigation into big tech topic. We're going to keep up with every night  at 8:00, so join us there. We'll see you.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Increase in geriatric population and rise in number of patients suffering from chronic disorders, such as spine disorders, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, are expected to drive the market growth. In terms of application, the cardiovascular segment is expected to register the highest CAGR. The medical device sector as a whole has long been one of the more lucrative markets in the overall healthcare industry, as technology and research have propelled the market to new heights. With the rising influence of technology, the players in the medical device market are constantly diversifying and include some big tech names as of late. Active healthcare companies today with current developments include: Lexington Biosciences, Inc. (CSE: LNB) (OTC: LXGTF), Immunomedics Inc.(NASDAQ: IMMU), Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: MDGL), BioTelemetry Inc.(NASDAQ: BEAT), VistaGen Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: VTGN).</p><p>Lexington Biosciences, Inc.(CSE: LNB) (OTCQB: LXGTF) (the \"Company\" or \"Lexington\"), a development-stage medical device company, is pleased to announce entry into a strategic business relationship with a San Francisco arm of Navigant Consulting Inc., formerly Quorum Consulting. The intent of the relationship is to work with the relevant authorities towards developing a coverage policy in support of the planned commercial rollout of Lexington's HeartSentry endothelial function measurement product.

The company has nearly 50 offices across the United States, Canada, Europe, Middle East and Asia. Navigant recently acquiredQuorum Consulting, a San Francisco based specialist service provider with extensive experience in the field of medical device reimbursement and health economics. Services include a proven ability to define strategic business opportunities and of influencing global coverage and payment policies.

As we plan for market entry, we know that a key element to commercial success will come from fielding a product that meets the threshold for medical insurance coverage. Regulatory approval rarely guarantees payment coverage for new devices, so we are undertaking what we believe is the prudent strategy of beginning that process today. We are delighted to have the opportunity to work with the Navigant team and feel certain the advice and direction we receive will prove invaluable towards providing HeartSentry the best strategy for market introduction.\"<br/><br/>In otherhealthcareindustry news andmarket performance of note:<br/><br/>Immunomedics Inc.(NASDAQ: IMMU) closed up 13% on Wednesday at $10.21 on over 13.7 million shares traded by the market close and was also up in afterhours trading. The company announced that a blinded, independent review by an adjudication team of radiologists has determined an ORR of 31%, including six complete responses (CRs) and 28 partial responses (PRs), in 110 patients with mTNBC after receiving treatment with sacituzumab govitecan, the Company's lead investigational antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), in a Phase 2 study. The independent centrally-reviewed (ICR) median DOR was 9.1 months.</p><p>Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.(NASDAQ: MDGL) closed up over 88% on Wednesday trading over 3.2 Million shares by the market close as was further up in afterhours trading. Madrigal Pharmaceuticals announced positive top-line results from a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with biopsy-proven non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In this trial, MGL-3196, a first-in-class, oral, once-daily, liver-directed, thyroid hormone receptor (THR) \u03b2 -selective agonist, demonstrated statistically significant results for the primary endpoint, the percent change in hepatic fat versus placebo as measured by MRI-PDFF, a non-invasive imaging test. Recent published data have shown a high correlation of the reduction of liver fat of 30% or more as measured by MRI-PDFF to improvement in NASH on liver biopsy.</p><p>BioTelemetry Inc.(NASDAQ: BEAT) closed up on Wednesday at $26.80 by the market close and was also up slightly in afterhours trading. Last week, the company announced its Telcare division recently signed a partnership agreement with Onduo - a joint venture by Verily (an Alphabet company) and Sanofi. Per the agreement, Telcare will act as an authorized provider of remote blood glucose systems along with the resulting data for patients enrolled in diabetes management program of Onduo. We believe this deal will boost the top line significantly. Targeting Type 2 diabetes patients, Onduo will utilize Telcare's ability to deliver real-time blood glucose results to develop care management programs. Interestingly, BioTelemetry acquired Telcare in December 2016. Notably, Telcare is the first company to receive FDA clearance for a cellular-enabled Blood Glucose Monitoring (BGM) system. Per management, this acquisition will enable BioTelemetryto apply its expertise in remote monitoring to the diabetes market and also increase its presence in the digital population health management market.

Increase in geriatric population and rise in number of patients suffering from chronic disorders, such as spine disorders, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, are expected to drive the market growth. In terms of application, the cardiovascular segment is expected to register the highest CAGR. The medical device sector as a whole has long been one of the more lucrative markets in the overall healthcare industry, as technology and research have propelled the market to new heights. With the rising influence of technology, the players in the medical device market are constantly diversifying and include some big tech names as of late. Active healthcare companies today with current developments include: Lexington Biosciences, Inc. (CSE: LNB) (OTC: LXGTF), Immunomedics Inc.(NASDAQ: IMMU), Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: MDGL), BioTelemetry Inc.(NASDAQ: BEAT), VistaGen Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: VTGN).</p><p>Lexington Biosciences, Inc.(CSE: LNB) (OTCQB: LXGTF) (the \"Company\" or \"Lexington\"), a development-stage medical device company, is pleased to announce entry into a strategic business relationship with a San Francisco arm of Navigant Consulting Inc., formerly Quorum Consulting. The intent of the relationship is to work with the relevant authorities towards developing a coverage policy in support of the planned commercial rollout of Lexington's HeartSentry endothelial function measurement product.

The company has nearly 50 offices across the United States, Canada, Europe, Middle East and Asia. Navigant recently acquiredQuorum Consulting, a San Francisco based specialist service provider with extensive experience in the field of medical device reimbursement and health economics. Services include a proven ability to define strategic business opportunities and of influencing global coverage and payment policies.

As we plan for market entry, we know that a key element to commercial success will come from fielding a product that meets the threshold for medical insurance coverage. Regulatory approval rarely guarantees payment coverage for new devices, so we are undertaking what we believe is the prudent strategy of beginning that process today. We are delighted to have the opportunity to work with the Navigant team and feel certain the advice and direction we receive will prove invaluable towards providing HeartSentry the best strategy for market introduction.\"<br/><br/>In otherhealthcareindustry news andmarket performance of note:<br/><br/>Immunomedics Inc.(NASDAQ: IMMU) closed up 13% on Wednesday at $10.21 on over 13.7 million shares traded by the market close and was also up in afterhours trading.

This week, Snap joined Google, Twitter and Facebook as the latest tech giant to make their political advertising data available to the public.U.S. political ad spending on Snapchat totaled $594,324 in 2018 and $612,043 so far this year.The newly-released database provides political ad figures that previously weren't available. The data also provides previously unknown details of political ad buys in countries across the world, with the total spending since mid-2018 exceeding $2.5 million.Presidential candidates in the 2020 election made up $72,591 of political ad spending reported by Snap. President Donald Trump[1] spent the largest sum on digital advertising among 2020 presidential candidates and also comes out on top of Snapchat spending. </p><p>Trump has spent more than $26.6 million on digital ads overall, roughly $40,000 of which went to Snapchat.A number of candidates have yet to make their Snapchat debut. Some candidates, however, have seen Snapchat support from outside groups.A super PAC[2] supporting Jay Inslee[3]'s now-folded 2020 bid spent six figures on Snapchat. Billionaire megadonor-turned-candidate Tom Steyer[4]'s NextGen America spent nearly $100,000 in 2018, before he announced a presidential run. Both super PACs are among the top political ad spenders in Snap's data, along with Everytown for Gun Safety[5] and Planned Parenthood[6].Infogram[7] The biggest political ad spender on Snapchat is ACRONYM[8], a 'dark money' 501(c)(4) nonprofit[9] that also owns[10] a major digital firm. While many of ACRONYM's ads are innocuous, simply encouraging voter participation, others reveal more of an agenda.One video ad[11] pans to a tranquil forest displaying text that 'everything is going to be okay' then suddenly flashes to the word 'nightmare' and Trump's face transposed with a filter to make him look like a monster, urging users to vote to make the nightmare end. Others direct users to the Game of Elections[12], a website inviting users to choose who will 'take the throne' in 2020. One ACRONYM ad[13] transforms an image of Trump into a White Walker, zombie-like creatures in the Game of Thrones TV series, another[14] shows an array of Democratic presidential contenders on the Iron Throne.In 2018, the political ad reaching the most Snapchat users in the U.S. was an ad[15] from now-Rep Josh Harder[16] (D-Calif.) attacking his opponent Jeff Denham's financial ties to 'Big Pharma,' which racked up 8.7 million impressions for less than $10,000.More than $1.8 million went toward political advertising on Snapchat across the world in 2019 alone, generating more than 96.5 million impressions, according to Snap's data.The political ads take a variety of forms ranging from videos displayed to users between snaps or stories, functioning more like traditional political advertising, to geofilters that allow users in targeted locations to add an illustration or filter to their snaps.In addition to spending totals for each ad buy, Snap's new data reveals previously unreleased details about everything from what gender and age is targeted by each ad to addresses and links to the ads themselves.The organization name listed in Snap's political ad data corresponds to who is responsible for creating each political ad while the advertiser name listed in the data and on the 'paid for' disclosure is supposed to be the entity funding the ad, according to Snap's documentation.A representative from Snap told OpenSecrets the company will update its database daily. Lawmakers push for mandated disclosure standards ahead of 2020Digital ads are becoming an increasingly important tool for federal candidates to find donors and turn out voters, with 2020 presidential candidates already spending nearly $74 million to advertise on the biggest social media platforms.Infogram[17] But digital ads are still not subject to disclosure regulations that apply to TV and radio ads. The loophole helped allow Russian actors to buy and distribute roughly $100,000 worth of political ads[18] under fake accounts without disclosing even basic information about who was behind them.The Federal Election Commission has held several discussions[19] on the subject but has been unable to come to a consensus[20] about what the regulations would look like   and now the commission cannot even hold official meetings due to a lack of quorum[21]. At a symposium[22] hosted at the FEC Tuesday, representatives from social media giants touted their work to enforcing disclosure rules and create databases of political ads   but election security experts said mandatory disclosure would require government action.'Some of the companies have taken their own steps to ensure transparency and disclosure around those kinds of ads, that's welcome, but they're using different kinds of standards,' said Laura Rosenberger, director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan transatlantic national security advocacy group formed to counter Russian efforts to undermine Western democracies.Each of the social media giants and other big online platforms has its own requirements for how 'paid for' disclaimers should appear and what information must be displayed. Rosenberger argued that the widely varying disclosure standards set by the various social media companies in some ways serve to confuse the general public.Speaking at the event Tuesday, Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner[23] (D-Va.) plugged the Honest Ads Act[24], a bipartisan bill that would mandate disclosure of those paying for online political ads. The bill has not received a vote in the Mitch McConnell[25]-led Senate.Rep. Stephanie Murphy[26] (D-Fla.), who also supports the Honest Ads Act, called on big tech companies Tuesday to exhibit 'corporate patriotism' and do more on their own to fight online disinformation.Experts agree that while creating uniform disclosure standards for online political ads won't stop foreign actors from influencing Americans on social media, it is a change that is relatively easy to implement right away.'There is no silver bullet to address disinformation in a manner that is true to freedom of expression,' said Susan Ness, a former FCC commissioner who now works for the Annenberg Policy Center. 'The consensus, however, is that transparency with regards to political advertising is something that needs to be pursued, and it's best to address behaviors and actors as opposed to the content itself.'Since Snapchat has only made the data available through bulk download in zip files, OpenSecrets broke down the top spenders and more.

This week, Snap joined Google, Twitter and Facebook as the latest tech giant to make their political advertising data available to the public.U.S. political ad spending on Snapchat totaled $594,324 in 2018 and $612,043 so far this year.The newly-released database provides political ad figures that previously weren't available. The data also provides previously unknown details of political ad buys in countries across the world, with the total spending since mid-2018 exceeding $2.5 million.Presidential candidates in the 2020 election made up $72,591 of political ad spending reported by Snap. President Donald Trump[1] spent the largest sum on digital advertising among 2020 presidential candidates and also comes out on top of Snapchat spending. </p><p>Trump has spent more than $26.6 million on digital ads overall, roughly $40,000 of which went to Snapchat.A number of candidates have yet to make their Snapchat debut. Some candidates, however, have seen Snapchat support from outside groups.A super PAC[2] supporting Jay Inslee[3]'s now-folded 2020 bid spent six figures on Snapchat. Billionaire megadonor-turned-candidate Tom Steyer[4]'s NextGen America spent nearly $100,000 in 2018, before he announced a presidential run. Both super PACs are among the top political ad spenders in Snap's data, along with Everytown for Gun Safety[5] and Planned Parenthood[6].Infogram[7] The biggest political ad spender on Snapchat is ACRONYM[8], a 'dark money' 501(c)(4) nonprofit[9] that also owns[10] a major digital firm. While many of ACRONYM's ads are innocuous, simply encouraging voter participation, others reveal more of an agenda.One video ad[11] pans to a tranquil forest displaying text that 'everything is going to be okay' then suddenly flashes to the word 'nightmare' and Trump's face transposed with a filter to make him look like a monster, urging users to vote to make the nightmare end. Others direct users to the Game of Elections[12], a website inviting users to choose who will 'take the throne' in 2020. One ACRONYM ad[13] transforms an image of Trump into a White Walker, zombie-like creatures in the Game of Thrones TV series, another[14] shows an array of Democratic presidential contenders on the Iron Throne.In 2018, the political ad reaching the most Snapchat users in the U.S. was an ad[15] from now-Rep Josh Harder[16] (D-Calif.) attacking his opponent Jeff Denham's financial ties to 'Big Pharma,' which racked up 8.7 million impressions for less than $10,000.More than $1.8 million went toward political advertising on Snapchat across the world in 2019 alone, generating more than 96.5 million impressions, according to Snap's data.The political ads take a variety of forms ranging from videos displayed to users between snaps or stories, functioning more like traditional political advertising, to geofilters that allow users in targeted locations to add an illustration or filter to their snaps.In addition to spending totals for each ad buy, Snap's new data reveals previously unreleased details about everything from what gender and age is targeted by each ad to addresses and links to the ads themselves.The organization name listed in Snap's political ad data corresponds to who is responsible for creating each political ad while the advertiser name listed in the data and on the 'paid for' disclosure is supposed to be the entity funding the ad, according to Snap's documentation.A representative from Snap told OpenSecrets the company will update its database daily. Lawmakers push for mandated disclosure standards ahead of 2020Digital ads are becoming an increasingly important tool for federal candidates to find donors and turn out voters, with 2020 presidential candidates already spending nearly $74 million to advertise on the biggest social media platforms.Infogram[17] But digital ads are still not subject to disclosure regulations that apply to TV and radio ads. The loophole helped allow Russian actors to buy and distribute roughly $100,000 worth of political ads[18] under fake accounts without disclosing even basic information about who was behind them.The Federal Election Commission has held several discussions[19] on the subject but has been unable to come to a consensus[20] about what the regulations would look like \u2014 and now the commission cannot even hold official meetings due to a lack of quorum[21]. At a symposium[22] hosted at the FEC Tuesday, representatives from social media giants touted their work to enforcing disclosure rules and create databases of political ads \u2014 but election security experts said mandatory disclosure would require government action.'Some of the companies have taken their own steps to ensure transparency and disclosure around those kinds of ads, that's welcome, but they're using different kinds of standards,' said Laura Rosenberger, director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan transatlantic national security advocacy group formed to counter Russian efforts to undermine Western democracies.Each of the social media giants and other big online platforms has its own requirements for how 'paid for' disclaimers should appear and what information must be displayed. Rosenberger argued that the widely varying disclosure standards set by the various social media companies in some ways serve to confuse the general public.Speaking at the event Tuesday, Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner[23] (D-Va.) plugged the Honest Ads Act[24], a bipartisan bill that would mandate disclosure of those paying for online political ads. The bill has not received a vote in the Mitch McConnell[25]-led Senate.Rep. Stephanie Murphy[26] (D-Fla.), who also supports the Honest Ads Act, called on big tech companies Tuesday to exhibit 'corporate patriotism' and do more on their own to fight online disinformation.Experts agree that while creating uniform disclosure standards for online political ads won't stop foreign actors from influencing Americans on social media, it is a change that is relatively easy to implement right away.'There is no silver bullet to address disinformation in a manner that is true to freedom of expression,' said Susan Ness, a former FCC commissioner who now works for the Annenberg Policy Center. 'The consensus, however, is that transparency with regards to political advertising is something that needs to be pursued, and it's best to address behaviors and actors as opposed to the content itself.'Since Snapchat has only made the data available through bulk download in zip files, OpenSecrets broke down the top spenders and more.

This week, Snap joined Google, Twitter and Facebook as the latest tech giant to make their political advertising data available to the public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S. political ad spending on Snapchat totaled $594,324 in 2018 and $612,043 so far this year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The newly-released database provides political ad figures that previously weren't available. The data also provides previously unknown details of political ad buys in countries across the world, with the total spending since mid-2018 exceeding $2.5 million.</p><p>Presidential candidates in the 2020 election made up $72,591 of political ad spending reported by Snap. President Donald Trump spent the largest sum on digital advertising among 2020 presidential candidates and also comes out on top of Snapchat spending. Trump has spent more than $26.6 million on digital ads overall, roughly $40,000 of which went to Snapchat.</p><p>A number of candidates have yet to make their Snapchat debut. Some candidates, however, have seen Snapchat support from outside groups.</p><p>A super PAC supporting Jay Inslee's now-folded 2020 bid spent six figures on Snapchat. Billionaire megadonor-turned-candidate Tom Steyer's NextGen America spent nearly $100,000 in 2018, before he announced a presidential run. Both super PACs are among the top political ad spenders in Snap's data, along with Everytown for Gun Safety and Planned Parenthood.</p><p>Infogram</p><p>The biggest political ad spender on Snapchat is ACRONYM, a \"dark money\" 501(c)(4) nonprofit that also owns a major digital firm. While many of ACRONYM's ads are innocuous, simply encouraging voter participation, others reveal more of an agenda.</p><p>One video ad pans to a tranquil forest displaying text that \"everything is going to be okay\" then suddenly flashes to the word \"nightmare\" and Trump's face transposed with a filter to make him look like a monster, urging users to vote to make the nightmare end. Others direct users to the Game of Elections, a website inviting users to choose who will \"take the throne\" in 2020. One ACRONYM ad transforms an image of Trump into a White Walker, zombie-like creatures in the Game of Thrones TV series, another shows an array of Democratic presidential contenders on the Iron Throne.</p><p>In 2018, the political ad reaching the most Snapchat users in the U.S. was an ad from now-Rep Josh Harder (D-Calif.) attacking his opponent Jeff Denham's financial ties to Big Pharma,\" which racked up 8.7 million impressions for less than $10,000.</p><p>More than $1.8 million went toward political advertising on Snapchat across the world in 2019 alone, generating more than 96.5 million impressions, according to Snap's data.</p><p>The political ads take a variety of forms ranging from videos displayed to users between snaps or stories, functioning more like traditional political advertising, to geofilters that allow users in targeted locations to add an illustration or filter to their snaps.</p><p>In addition to spending totals for each ad buy, Snap's new data reveals previously unreleased details about everything from what gender and age is targeted by each ad to addresses and links to the ads themselves.</p><p>The organization name listed in Snap's political ad data corresponds to who is responsible for creating each political ad while the advertiser name listed in the data and on the \"paid for\" disclosure is supposed to be the entity funding the ad, according to Snap's documentation.</p><p>Help us count cash and make change by making a donation today.</p><p>Help us keep government accountable by making a donation today.</p><p>A representative from Snap told OpenSecrets the company will update its database daily.</p><p>Lawmakers push for mandated disclosure standards ahead of 2020</p><p>Digital ads are becoming an increasingly important tool for federal candidates to find donors and turn out voters, with 2020 presidential candidates already spending nearly $74 million to advertise on the biggest social media platforms.</p><p>Infogram</p><p>But digital ads are still not subject to disclosure regulations that apply to TV and radio ads. The loophole helped allow Russian actors to buy and distribute roughly $100,000 worth of political ads under fake accounts without disclosing even basic information about who was behind them.</p><p>The Federal Election Commission has held several discussions on the subject but has been unable to come to a consensus about what the regulations would look like and now the commission cannot even hold official meetings due to a lack of quorum.</p><p>At a symposium hosted at the FEC Tuesday, representatives from social media giants touted their work to enforcing disclosure rules and create databases of political ads but election security experts said mandatory disclosure would require government action.</p><p>\"Some of the companies have taken their own steps to ensure transparency and disclosure around those kinds of ads, that's welcome, but they're using different kinds of standards,\" said Laura Rosenberger, director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan transatlantic national security advocacy group formed to counter Russian efforts to undermine Western democracies.</p><p>Each of the social media giants and other big online platforms has its own requirements for how \"paid for\" disclaimers should appear and what information must be displayed. Rosenberger argued that the widely varying disclosure standards set by the various social media companies in some ways serve to confuse the general public.</p><p>Speaking at the event Tuesday, Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner (D-Va.) plugged the Honest Ads Act, a bipartisan bill that would mandate disclosure of those paying for online political ads. The bill has not received a vote in the Mitch McConnell-led Senate.</p><p>Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.), who also supports the Honest Ads Act, called on big tech companies Tuesday to exhibit \"corporate patriotism\" and do more on their own to fight online disinformation.</p><p>Experts agree that while creating uniform disclosure standards for online political ads won't stop foreign actors from influencing Americans on social media, it is a change that is relatively easy to implement right away.</p><p>\"There is no silver bullet to address disinformation in a manner that is true to freedom of expression,\" said Susan Ness, a former FCC commissioner who now works for the Annenberg Policy Center. \"The consensus, however, is that transparency with regards to political advertising is something that needs to be pursued, and it's best to address behaviors and actors as opposed to the content itself.\"</p><p>Since Snapchat has only made the data available through bulk download in zip files, OpenSecrets broke down the top spenders and more.

Thanks, Maria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Happy Friday, everybody.</p><p>We've got a big story this morning in terms of Syria.</p><p>A potential ceasefire in Syria in doubt. Turkey agreed to a five-day suspension of military activities in northern Syria, but that deal is now being questioned this morning after reports of fighting in a Syrian-Turkish border town. President Trump weighed in on this last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We've all agreed on a pause or a ceasefire in the border region of Syria. And it was unconventional what I did.</p><p>So now we're doing a -- during a five-day period, we're going to see if we can get it all finalized. And I think it will be. I think it will be. So Turkey's going to be happy. The Kurds are going to be happy. ISIS is going to be unhappy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, a lot of pushback on this move.</p><p>James, your reaction?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, I think -- obviously it doesn't seem to have held very long. Maybe the peace will be restored. But there was kind of a problem where the Turks wanted more in terms of weapons and the -- and Kurdish positions being moved further away from their border than seemed like was part of announced agreement.</p><p>This is really -- we're seeing the difficulty of the president trying to fulfill that 2016 promise to extricate the U.S. from some of the foreign interventions that he opposed. He really stood out in terms of challenging Republican orthodoxy on that. And you're now seeing, not just Republicans, Democrats, really bipartisan pushback on this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's true. In fact, last night I was at the Al Smith Dinner and James Mattis -- General Mattis was the speaker. And I saw him as he approaches the dinner and I talked to him a bit about this and he said, this is why I left 10 months ago. This has been talked about that long in terms of the president wanting to do this. And this is exactly why General Mattis said he could not say because the president was adamant about taking the troops out of Syria.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the -- one of the issues that I brought up here is that it was abrupt, this phone call, and it was, again, based on Jennifer Griffin's reporting, that the president went off script and didn't say to Erdogan initially in that Sunday night phone call, I think it was October the sixth, what was -- say stay north of the border or -- and if Erdogan said, well, I'm coming into northern Syria, then, well, we will give the Kurds air cover.</p><p>So this was abrupt move out of northern Syria and a betrayal of our Kurdish allies. And to James' point, and his editorial page has a great piece on it today, the Republicans, not just the Democrats, but the Republicans are pushing back against this move by the president with a 354-60 vote to oppose the move. That was in the House. And the sanctions that Lindsey Graham introduced in the Senate yesterday are a great deal tougher than what President Trump even proposed. \"The journal\" calls it, makes President Trump sanctions look like a love tap.</p><p>So this is -- these are Republicans who are standing against the president's foreign policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I will say this. There's a Rasmussen poll that says that the majority of likely voters tend to agree with President Trump. And they say that the U.S. is too involved in middle east conflicts, a plurality of 37 percent say so. Less than 20 percent said that the U.S. should be more involved.</p><p>So I don't -- I don't think this becomes an issue for the election because I don't think most Americans understand what's happening in terms of ISIS perhaps getting back in business. I mean we'll see how bad things get. But certainly he's facing a fair amount of pushback on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But in -- but in terms of troops coming home, I think it was just about three or four days ago that the president said those troops that are being moved aren't coming home and we are sending an additional 1,800 troops to Saudi Arabia. So in terms of getting out of the Middle East, that's just not happening.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, that is true. He said he's going to be sending help to Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Want to look at futures this morning because, once again, markets are following this bouncing ball of what happens out of the trade deal with China. Sluggish economic growth came out of China overnight. The country's third quarter GDP was the slowest in more than 25 years. President Trump commented on the tariffs and the potential trade deal last night at that rally.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Hopefully the agreement gets signed sometime prior to a big summit that we have with President Xi and others in Chile. So that's in about four weeks.</p><p>In the meantime, we've taken in tens of billions of dollars of tariffs and China's eaten the cost because they devalued their currency and they're putting money out. Tens of billions of dollars. It's cost us nothing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we'll see about that. We've got tariffs that are going to go into effect in the Eurozone this weekend.</p><p>What's your reaction in terms of the China story, John?</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S CAPITAL MARKETS: Well, you know, China's economy now growing at the slowest pace since 1992. I mean, if China is going to take a policy action to try to rejuvenate its economy, the best policy action is to get a trade deal done as soon as possible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>LONSKI: Forget about fiscal stimulus, monetary stimulus. Focus on trade. And I think both parties have to realize, and they have to perhaps sunder some of their pride, some of their egos in order to get this issue out of the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now, earlier this week Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said that there was a mechanism in place to insure that the intellectual property is not stolen. We'll see. We're going to speak to Peter Navarro coming up. I don't know how hard those rules or mechanisms to enforce it are within this -- within this deal, but we'll hear what Navarro has to say.</p><p>Your reaction?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, well, it is a question of how much pain is enough to motivate a communist regime, which does not want to compromise on these issues, to finally get a deal. And this is -- yes the worst economy they've had in decades. But we'll see whether it's enough to change their behavior.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What's hard to quantify, though, is -- and just -- when you talk to people, as you do all day long every day behind the scenes, people in the technology industry, for example, will tell you that President Trump now gives them the strength to push back. So it's not just the U.S. government, it is also every CEO who's been spied on by China.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Every CEO who has had their intellectual property stolen, or the company's intellectual property stolen because, well, China could get away with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Every CEO whose wanted to do business in China but basically hand -- had to hand over the keys to the business in order to do that. So it's not just the president, it is literally behind the scenes CEO's, technology and other industries pushing back or moving their manufacturing out of China. And China knows once -- as the president has said, once that supply chain moves it ain't coming back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and they're not going back. And, yes, I've said many times, I feel like this president changed the conversation on China. And it was a really important move that he made.</p><p>I want to turn to the draft Brexit deal as well that was struck between the U.K. and the EU yesterday. The agreement still has to be ratified. We're expecting that tomorrow from parliament from the U.K.</p><p>Ashley Webster is live this morning in London with more on that.</p><p>Ashley, good morning to you.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning to you, Maria.</p><p>Well, this new deal from Boris Johnson agreed with the EU is essentially Theresa May's plan, but it has removed the Irish backstop that lawmakers were worried would keep northern Ireland within the EU for many years. So Boris Johnson did something the EU said it wouldn't do and got them to eliminate that backstop.</p><p>But the question is, is it enough to get it through parliament? Boris Johnson needs 320 votes tomorrow. There are 287 conservatives. If you assume they all vote for it, he still has to find 33 votes from somewhere else. So right now, as we speak, he's on a charm offensive, trying to persuade lawmakers it is time to get this thing done.</p><p>In fact, yesterday in Brussels, when this deal was announced, he said, look, it's time to get Brexit done. It's time to come together. Time to move on. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: This is a great deal for our country, for the U.K. I also believe it's a very good deal for our friends in the EU.</p><p>I'm very confident that when my colleagues in parliament study this agreement, that they will want to vote for it.</p><p>It's been long, it's been painful, it's been divisive. And now is the moment for us, as a country, to come together.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEBSTER: Well, now is the time for the country. It has been long. It has been painful and extremely divisive. The question is, can he get it over the line? This is only the fourth time, by the way, since the start of World War II that parliament has actually sat in session on a Saturday.</p><p>If they vote it down, Boris Johnson is required to ask for an extension from the October 31st deadline. He says if there's a deal, great. If there's no deal, the U.K. will still leave on October the 31st. No one can quite figure that out. Maybe Boris has something up his sleeve.</p><p>We'll wait and see, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ashley, what about Nigel Farage's pushback yesterday? He basically said that there are still too many things that bind the EU and the U.K. within this deal.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your reaction to Nigel Farage's pushback?</p><p>WEBSTER: Well, I mean, if you're a pure Brexiteer (ph), as Nigel Farage is, and there are many others, they do say that this keeps the U.K. far to tied to the EU in other ways. What they really want is a clean break. A, thank you very much, good-bye, we'll figure it out on ourselves. We'll be able to do free trade agreements. A big one could be done with the United States. And he says this deal just is not enough. This is not in the spirit of what people voted for three and a half years ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Ashley, we'll be watching. Thanks so much.</p><p>Ashley Webster on the ground this morning in London.</p><p>We are just getting started this morning.</p><p>Also on deck, \"The Daily Caller\" editor-in-chief Christopher Bedford with us this morning on the impeachment inquiry, what happens now that Carolyn Maloney will take over for Elijah Cummings? Hermitage Capital CEO Bill Browder is here on the Brexit deal. Assistant to the president for trade for manufacturing policy, Peter Navarro joining us on China trade. And the co-founders of Warby Parker in the house, Neil Blumenthal and David Gilboa are here to talk frame fitting and augment -- with augmented reality, as well as going public. We'll talk about all that coming up.</p><p>First, though, the vaping crisis. Juul suspending online sales amid reports of even more illnesses being linked to e-cigarettes.</p><p>Then, history in space. NASA trying again to get its all-female spacewalk in the books.</p><p>We're back right after this short break.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Two sheriff's deputy shot in Iowa.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with headlines right now.</p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Maria, good morning.</p><p>These deputies were shot while trying to serve a search warrant early this morning in Stewart, Iowa. At least one suspect taken into custody following a standoff. The deputies had to be air-lifted to a local hospital, but they are said to be, luckily, in stable condition.</p><p>Well, Juul is now haunting online -- halting, excuse me, online sales of all flavored e-cigarettes, except for tobacco, mint and menthol. The company pulled those flavors from retail stories last year. Juul is under scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers over its marketing practice as the teen vaping rate continues to rise. And, of course, we reported on those deaths across the country.</p><p>Well, history taking place in outer space. Today astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch, yes, the ladies are going to be stepping out of the International Space Station for the first all-female spacewalk in NASA's 61-year history. The pair is going to replace, Maria, a faulty battery charge discharge unit. And we're going to be rooting for them right here in New York City.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We sure are.</p><p>CASONE: I love it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we want to take a short break.</p><p>When we come back, Brexit is on the line. The newly reached deal hangs in the balance this morning as parliament gets ready to vote on it tomorrow. How it's moving markets coming up next.</p><p>And then NBA backlash. China reportedly going after Daryl Morey for his pro-Hong Kong tweet. Now the league is really feeling the heat. We've got all the details on that. Wait till you hear this one.</p><p>Stay with us</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>There is Brexit drama playing out overseas. The draft Brexit deal drafted between British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the EU now has to get the go ahead from parliament. That's expected to happen -- well, it could be difficult, but the vote is happening this Saturday, tomorrow. The Democratic Unionist Party is opposing the deal. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbin, says it's even worse than the one negotiated by former Prime Minister Theresa May. Things are expected to heat up in parliament tomorrow during a super Saturday vote, as you heard from Ashley in London.</p><p>John, is this going to take away some uncertainty for these markets or we're still sort of in that holding patter?</p><p>LONSKI: Well, it would be -- obviously it's going to be of more help to the U.K. and the EU than for the United States. It really hasn't been on the radar when you're looking at the performance of U.S. financial markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK, because I know that it is an uncertainty there for managers and CEO's who have businesses in the U.K. --</p><p>LONSKI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And weren't sure if they should move people in Germany, move people elsewhere in the EU.</p><p>LONSKI: Yes, listen, I -- we do have many U.S. financial service and banks that have big operations in U.K. and perhaps other companies and this may be entering into their planning, where they're going to be locating people, whether it be on the continent or do they stay in England.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, obviously, Boris Johnson has to get the votes. So that's a big maybe.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: I'm not going to make a prediction. But if he can work it out to where they have zero tariffs with the EU, and then he can do a deal with the U.S. where they have a better tariff deal than the rest of the EU with the United States, this could be pretty groovy for the U.K. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: And, obviously, you've talked about people considering moving, but they -- financial services companies, all companies love that British legal system.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: They love contracts being enforced in London courts. So I -- I would be very blush about the U.K. going forward if this --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: Especially if this vote goes through.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And especially if the U.K. does a deal, like almost immediately, with the U.S.</p><p>Meanwhile, we were talking about tariffs. Tariffs go into effect on about $7.5 billion in goods from Europe. That includes wine, cheese, whiskey, olive oil. The World Trade Organization authorized measures against the EU due to decades of illegal subsidies to Airbus. A big win for the Trump administration when they were able to put these -- these tariffs into effect, which happened today.</p><p>Any impact? What do you think?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, I -- I mean this is just more cost. So you -- you can't -- you can't argue with the method in this case. Obviously this is not a unilateral play. This was a WTO decision. But I would hope this is motivation to get a lower tariff's deal across the board with the EU.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And see if there's any retaliation coming from Europe down the road. That would -- that would, again, have to go back to the WTO. But that's been the problem for -- with the initial fight because of the steel tariffs. You had the retaliation and that hurt like everybody from Jack Daniel's to Harley Davidson.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Let's talk about that right now and bring in Craig Erlam, market analyst from Oanda, senior market analyst from Oanda.</p><p>Craig, good to see you. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>CRAIG ERLAM, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, OANDA: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you expect in terms of the Brexit situation and -- and its impact on markets and the U.K. economy?</p><p>ERLAM: Well, we've already seen a very positive impact on the markets, really building up over the last week, ever since Boris' meeting with Leo Varca (ph) in the northwest of England a week ago. The idea that we were on a pathway towards a possible deal got people excited and that really carried through into the end of this week when the deal was actually announced.</p><p>The next hurdle, of course, is parliament on Saturday. Are they going to approve the deal? My gut says no. I feel like the extension is probably still the most out -- likely scenario at this point an election and then I think the deal gets through later on this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So do you think markets trade down on Monday if you -- if they get a no-vote tomorrow? I mean will there be a real market reaction?</p><p>ERLAM: I think they maybe will come off a little bit. We already saw it come off a little bit yesterday when the DUP confirmed that they wouldn't back the deal. So that made the arithmetic really difficult in parliament. And we saw the pound pull off a little bit. Now maybe a little bit of profit taking following a week of very substantial gains. So we may see it pull off a little bit, but I don't think it necessarily alters the longer term -- the longer term goal, which is to get this Brexit deal over the line.</p><p>And, of course, we've got to remember as well that an election doesn't' just give -- potentially give Boris the numbers in parliament for a deal. If Boris, with the conservatives and the Brexit party as well don't get a majority between them, then all of a sudden you've got this -- a situation whereby the opposition parties could have a majority between them, that we see another coalition government and all of a sudden remain (ph) becomes a possibility because the second referendum impact as well. So that could, in the longer term, provide lift to their currency. But, like you say, we're talking longer term in the -- in the near term you do get a lot of volatility and a lot of knee-jerk reaction, and that's exactly what we've seen really over the last 48 hours.</p><p>FREEMAN: Craig, James Freeman here at \"The Wall Street Journal.\"</p><p>I -- obviously a lot of possibilities. You just went through some of them. But you're sort of base case, it sounds like you're expecting a Brexit deal, not this weekend, but later in the year. And I'm wondering what -- what changes in that deal as far as businesses are concerned to get it over the finish line to what you see as a majority bill or Brexit?</p><p>ERLAM: So, like you say, it's the parliamentary arithmetic which really works against Boris at the moment. Not only did he not hold the majority when he came into -- came into the job after that 2017 election, they were already relying on the DUP votes, which they've lost as part of this deal. But there was about 24, I think, conservative (INAUDIBLE) effectively kicked out of the party for voting against the government on the extension bill in the first place. So the arithmetic is terrible for Boris Johnson, ultimately. So if we can -- if we can improve those numbers in the election, then suddenly the ability to get the deal through parliament, it becomes a lot more realistic.</p><p>From a business perspective, I think businesses, at this point, are really just relieved that there is a deal on the table and a deal that they think could get the numbers in a -- in an ideal scenario. One that doesn't contain the backstop for the entire really U.K. One that provides certainty. One that includes a transition deal for the next two years, rather than this cliff edge, no-deal Brexit.</p><p>So I think businesses are going to be very, very relieved right now. Of course, like I say, there is this still -- this tinny possibility of a no- deal Brexit. But that's so much reduced from where it was even a week ago and, therefore, businesses are going to be breathing a big sigh of relief right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Craig, any other things driving market this morning. We're right here at the start of third quarter earnings. We've got the potential of a China deal. Are those things driving markets as well and what kind of sentiment are you seeing out there from investors?</p><p>ERLAM: Yes, it's hard to see outside of Brexit when (INAUDIBLE) stocks here in London.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>ERLAM: But, obviously, there are bigger -- there are bigger things happening in the world. The trade deal, of course, is a (INAUDIBLE) thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ERLAM: U.S. corp (ph) earnings season is a huge thing. So, yes, there are many other things that are driving things right now. The China GDP figure this morning as well. But Brexit here is such a key topic.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Craig, it's good to see you this morning. Thank you so much.</p><p>ERLAM: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You got it.</p><p>Craig Erlam joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, Mark Zuckerberg on free speech. his new comments concerning social media platforms. That's coming up.</p><p>Then Yankees struggling. The Houston Astros besting the Bronx Bombers on the road to the World Series. All the highlights of the big game.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>TGIF. Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Friday, October 18th.</p><p>Your top stories right now just before 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Markets are flat this morning. Take a look. Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading, fractionally moving, down 12 points on the Dow, 10 points lower on the Nasdaq. This after solid earnings and news of a Brexit deal helped push the major indices higher yesterday. At the close, the Dow, the Nasdaq, the S&amp;P 500 all on track for their second straight week of gains. The Dow and the S&amp;P about 1 percent away from a record high close, up 23 points at 4:00 on Wall Street for the Dow and 32 points higher on the Nasdaq yesterday.</p><p>Global markets this morning. Take a look. European indices right now all mixed. The FT 100 down 13, the CAC quarante in Paris down 24 and the DAX index in Germany up 10.</p><p>Investors are watching the crucial parliament vote tomorrow as Prime Minister Boris Johnson seeks approval for his Brexit deal. We will be covering that certainly Monday morning for any impact.</p><p>Then in Asia overnight, take a look, China's economy is the big story this morning. The Chinese economy grew at the slowest pace since 1992, 26-year low. GDP up just 6 percent. That was lower than expected. Shanghai composite down one and a third percent overnight.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg defending political speech. The FaceBook CEO rejects calls for President Trump's social media to be shut down.</p><p>And then the financial fallout for the NBA. Commissioner Adam Silver says the league is facing substantial losses following the Hong Kong controversy. He says China called for the firing of the Houston Rockets general manager. He wouldn't do it.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.</p><p>But, first, our top story this half an hour, fallout over Ukraine. President Trump slamming House Democrats and the impeachment hearing during his rally in Texas last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: That crazy Nancy, she is crazy.</p><p>And shifty Schiff. How about this guy?</p><p>He makes up my conversation, which was perfect. He makes up my conversation. He sees what I said. It doesn't play well because it was perfect, so he made up a totally false conversation with the Ukrainian president.</p><p>I want to get him before Congress and I want to see what he has to say. You know they say he has immunity. Why would you have immunity for outright fraud? What do you have immunity? Why? He's a fraud.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, this came as Energy Secretary Rick Perry faces a deadline today to submit subpoenaed documents to Congress related to the impeachment inquiry. Perry also announced his resignation as energy secretary. He did that yesterday.</p><p>During a news conference yesterday, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney seemed to contradict the president, saying that the U.S. did, in fact, withhold $400 million of aid to Ukraine. Mulvaney then reversed his position later in the day.</p><p>Joining us right now is \"The Daily Caller\" editor-in-chief Christopher Bedford.</p><p>And, Chris, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, \"THE DAILY CALLER\": Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: First, your reaction to Mick Mulvaney. What do you think went on there?</p><p>BEDFORD: I think that some of it's being misread. He was -- he got a little bit in the weeds, as he often does. I was watching it with some folks who have worked with him over the years and have worked closely with him and he was trying to explain that this was part of the president's broader push on the southern triangle, as well as with Ukraine, to pull back on foreign aid. He got pretty deep into the weeds, and that's not a great place to go, because as one person I was watching said, if you're explaining, then you're losing, and that's -- he really got stuck in that -- in that line.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So that's sort of what you -- what you were saying earlier.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, I --</p><p>DAGAN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, but let's be clear, the line that he said was, did the president also mention to me in the past the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that. That's it and that's why we held up the money. That was the quote.</p><p>And then Mulvaney issues a statement later yesterday say -- essentially blaming the press and the media for misconstruing his comments. No, you misspoke. But people heard what they heard. And this doesn't -- Bret Baier said last night on \"SPECIAL REPORT,\" he said, we much -- much discussion, and I'm paraphrasing, much discussion about what's going on behind closed doors in this impeachment proceeding by the Democrats.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But a lot of what's happening out in the open is not good for the president. Namely that.</p><p>BEDFORD: And he said -- he later clarified -- or claimed that he was talking about 2016. But, to your point, yes, that's misspeaking. It does not play well. And you -- we -- you could tell right away that it would be a part of a sound bite against the president.</p><p>FREEMAN: OK, so -- so he walked it back and he's now saying that there was no quid pro quo, but I guess the point he was making is, the United States often does withhold aid while demanding changes, for example, to address corruption in foreign countries, correct?</p><p>BEDFORD: It does. And this is a frequent complaint I hear from political and some career staffers at the Department of State is that a lot of folks that I deal with who are dealing for -- with foreign countries in the United States, every single one of their concerns are, well, how do we get more money, how do we help more people over there, how can we make the people in Congo or Ukraine or Poland happy, as opposed to, what serves the just interests of the United States --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BEDFORD: Which is what you'd -- they would imagine a Department of State employee would be asking. Mick Mulvaney was making the case that asking that question, in regards to aid, is completely normal and in line with any kind of historic precedent and also legal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, another thing he talked about was the G summit and where they're going to do it. The Trump administration facing backlash after announcing that the 2020 G-7 summit will be held at President Trump's resort in Doral, Florida. The White House says the decision will likely save millions of dollars.</p><p>Chris, your reaction?</p><p>BEDFORD: I'm going to want to see some receipts to back that up, for one thing, because, as Judge Napolitano pointed out, it seems to fly in the face of the actual emoluments clause, not like everyone has been saying, but in receiving gifts from foreign states. However, I was also shocked, and I wondered if this is just a classic President Trump tactic here, where he likes to send the press down a rabbit hole. I could not believe that the first half of this press conference, where members of the media finally had the chief of staff on the stage answering questions, and all they wanted to do was talk about Doral Resorts in Florida. We know that the Doral Resort in Florida and the Trump resorts in general have not been performing well because of the -- because of how divisive the name has been since he's become president. This seemed like a rabbit hole they chased him down. The left is certainly going to call it, and some on the right, an unforced error by the president. But if it turns out he's not making money, then it'll be hard -- much harder to pin it on.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>BEDFORD: And I actually thinking he might be hoping the Democrats tack this onto their impeachment push to broaden it out and to muddy the waters further.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, I think, just to clarify, I believe it's not the foreign governments, it's the U.S. government, as the host country, typically pays for the event.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: Now, I believe, in another moment, Mulvaney moment yesterday, I think he said it would be a cost. So if the --</p><p>BEDFORD: He did.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But that's why Chris wants to see receipts.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. OK. So -- so if the --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, Chris?</p><p>BEDFORD: You're right. Exactly.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>BEDFORD: If the U.S. government is paying for these hundreds hangers on and hundred -- and dozens of world leaders to be at a place the president chose to do this business and that money is going to go to the Trump Organization, and they say that they're doing it at cost, as they have before, then I would like to see some evidence of that. And I know that means pulling back their books a little.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, and that would be hard to tell. But I think if the -- if the cost is below market for similar resort properties in Florida, that would be the question, right?</p><p>BEDFORD: Then it's the perfect trap. Yes, that is the perfect distraction.</p><p>FREEMAN: Then -- then it's a -- it's a gift to U.S. taxpayers, I suppose you could say, although huge promotional value for the Doral Resort if Mr. Trump is hosting his G-7 colleagues there, so --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Well, Florida's --</p><p>FREEMAN: I guess that would go into the calculation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's incredibly abusive to send anybody to Florida in August. So I don't know what that -- and so -- and you do get rock bottom cut rates to go to that state in the month of August.</p><p>FREEMAN: No, but -- but it -- you do fly right into Miami. That was part of the problem with I think it's Britz (ph), where the French president hosted is there was no major airport nearby. So, for example, Air Force One, the normal plane, couldn't go there. They had to take a flight and then fly from Boudreaux (ph). So I think, all right -- and some of the G-7 attendees may be golfers. So --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let --</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's not --</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, you get -- there are like three hours of the day that you can golf in Florida in the month of August, just letting you know.</p><p>FREEMAN: Oh, good point.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Chris, what about big tech? FaceBook CEO Mark Zuckerberg out with an op-ed this morning in \"The Journal\" titled \"FaceBook stand for free expression.\" He addresses the call to ban political ads on FaceBook. He writes this, banning political ads gives an unfair advantage to incumbents and media favorites. It's also unclear where the line should be drawn. Many ads are about issues, not elections. Would we ban ads about immigration or women's empowerment? If not, would it really make sense to give everyone but candidates a voice in political debates. We should err on the side of allowing greater expression.</p><p>He also sat down with \"THE DAILY BRIEFING\" host Dana Perino yesterday. She asked him about bias against conservatives in Silicon Valley. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST, \"THE DAILY BRIEFING\": Do you believe that there is a bias against conservatives in Silicon Valley?</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: I don't think that the services themselves, I haven't seen a lot of data that suggest that there's a negative impact. In fact, a lot of conservative media does quite well on social media, not just FaceBook.</p><p>I mean California is an overwhelmingly left-leaning place. You know, if you look at the political donations from the tech companies, it's, you know, 90 plus percent of them go towards Democrat candidates.</p><p>So, you know, I understand why people would ask the question of, are my ideas getting a fair shake. And all that I can say on this is, this is something I care deeply about. I mean I want -- I want to make sure that -- that we can be a platform for -- for all ideas.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think, Chris? I mean I don't think there's any questioning that there's censoring of conservative ideas on social media.</p><p>BEDFORD: None at all.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, you know, there's a reason Devin Nunes is suing Twitter and Tulsi Gabbard is suing Google. And during the 2016 election, the searches for -- on Google were totally positive for Hillary Clinton and negative for Donald Trump.</p><p>BEDFORD: Yes, there's no question at all that they -- that they sensor conservative media. Whether or not it's Google deciding how trustworthy an outlet is or FaceBook in the past allowing human -- human control to decide what's right and what's wrong.</p><p>And I actually think that Mark Zuckerberg deserves a lot of credit for what he's been working on over the last few weeks. He's made some mistakes in the past, but pushing back on the left wing and the activists who really want to sensor what speech is allowed in the public domain is great.</p><p>And he gave an interview just recently in \"The Washington Post\" last week where he said, I don't think people want to live in a world where you can only say things that tech companies decide are 100 percent true. \"The Washington Post\" said he came out in favor of liars because of that. That's extremely unfair. To allow this, to allow politicians, to allow opinion and to allow satire on your -- on your public pages, I mean that's just essential to any kind of a free speech -- free speech regime.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there.</p><p>Chris, it's great to see you. Thank you so much.</p><p>BEDFORD: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Chris Bedford from \"The Daily Caller.\"</p><p>Tune in to \"VARNEY AND COMPANY\" after this program. Dana will be joining Stuart at 1:15 a.m. Eastern. We'll hear more about that great interview she did later on.</p><p>First, though, new NBA backlash this morning. China reportedly going after Daryl Morey for that pro-Hong Kong tweet. Now the league is really feeling the heat. We're going to tell you what went down.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>The Houston Astros one win away from the World Series.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with all the details now.</p><p>Chery.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Not a great night for the Yankees, Maria. The Houston bats were on fire last night. A pair of three run homers powered the team to an 8-3 victory in game four of the American League championship series. New York is facing elimination tonight. You can catch game five on Fox Sports One.</p><p>Now to football. Patrick Mahomes, the MVP quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs, injured his knee during a game against the Broncos last night. Struggling to straighten his right knee, Mahomes tossed his helmet to the side. He covered his face with both hands. Despite the injury, the Chiefs actually beat the Broncos 30-6.</p><p>And now to basketball. Some new developments following that controversial tweet from the Houston Rockets general manager in support of the Hong Kong protesters. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver says the Chinese government is calling for Morey to be fired. Silver speaking publicly in the United States for the first time following that trip to Asia. He said that there is no chance of that firing happening.</p><p>And, Maria, that is all your sports news.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, a lot of sports today.</p><p>CASONE: You got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>We'll take a break, but before that we want to show you the week that was. It was a busy on here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Take a look at some of the top moments from the program.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Promised the president he would not invade and then went against, broke the promise and did so anyway.</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: There isn't to break the relationship with Turkey. They're a member of NATO. We have important security interests connected to Turkey. Our goal isn't to break the relationship. It is to deny Turkey the capacity to continue to engage in this behavior. We -- the president said this was a bad deal, it was a bad thing. We're working to stop it.</p><p>JOE LIEBERMAN, FORMER DEMOCRATIC VP CANDIDATE: What happens is that there's a vacuum. And who fills that vacuum? ISIS, terrorist, Iran, Russia, and, as I said, Erdogan, who's not our ally. And we turn our backs on the Kurds, who, at our encouragement, have been our major fighting force against ISIS in that region.</p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY): You know, I think the real irony here is, is that our relocating our troops, Turkey's incursion actually may allow an alliance to develop between the Kurds and Assad, which actually may allow the Kurds to have some sort of autonomous region within Syria. It happened in Iraq that way. The Iraqi Kurds have a semi-autonomous region because they're no longer a threat to Turkey.</p><p>EHUD BARAK, FORMER ISRAELI PRIME AND DEFENSE MINISTER: This is a weaker and less influential America because once you withdraw from such a fight, you use high -- or strong rhetoric and then the big stick of Teddy Roosevelt is replaced by what looks like chopsticks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What is WeWork?</p><p>BARRY DILLER, CHAIRMAN, IAC AND EXPEDIA: WeWork's a sound idea, but, of course, they ran so far ahead of themselves and got so wildly aggressive and so grandiose and all of those things that they pushed it, you know, it's like -- it's like pushing anything beyond its limits.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You write a book. It's called \"Trailblazer: The Power of Business as the Greatest Platform for Change.\" Why did you write this book?</p><p>MARC BENIOFF, FOUNDER AND CO-CEO, SALESFORCE: We all need a new capitalism. And that is a capitalism that is more fair, more equitable and more sustainable. And that's a capitalism that includes all stakeholders, not just shareholders, this concept that the business of business is business is over.</p><p>KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": People like to say Donald Trump is destroying institutions and democracy, but look at the loss of faith in the FBI and the DOJ. That is a result of folks who abuse their power and Americans say, because they didn't like this president and it scares Americans.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We are focused on our heroes. Our next guests run a veteran- owned fashion company making its name repurposing surplus military items.</p><p>EMILY NUNEZ CAVNESS, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, SWORD AND PLOUGH: We're super excited about this week because of the -- the Navy's 244th birthday. And so we're doing $5 from every single order on swordandplough.com to the Navy SEAL Foundation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Fantastic.</p><p>CAVNESS: And I'm super passionate about this because when I served in 10 Special Forces Group, I had the opportunity to serve alongside Navy SEALs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We are toasting America's oldest brewery this morning. You know, we love family businesses here and we want to hear your story in terms of being of -- your generations of being founders. And we also love made in America. How is it, Debbie, to run -- being women in this male-dominated industry and running the family business?</p><p>DEBBIE YUENGLING, EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT AND CULTURE MANAGER, YUENGLING: It's very special for us, getting to work alongside your family, but I think also knowing the history that our generations have worked there before us, our grandfather, we're still there with my dad. The beer industry is typically male dominated, but it's something that we're persevering through.</p><p>CASONE: The Jim Beam distillery in Clermont, Kentucky, is offering visitors the chance to sleep over. The house accommodates six people. The cost, just $23 a night on Airbnb.</p><p>BARTIROMO: $23 a night?</p><p>CASONE: That's cheap.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>CASONE: You get the pour (ph) and everything.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you.</p><p>CASONE: A little bourbon, Dagen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's amazing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I can drink my weight in bourbon.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>The big business of subscription services. Em and Liz is a subscription box for children delivering high-quality products and goodies that little girls adore. The company recently launched a new play cosmetics line that's all natural and made in America.</p><p>Joining us right now are Em and Liz co-founders Riki Meris-Koulouroudis and Effie Sakellis.</p><p>Great to see you, girls. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>EFFIE SAKELLIS, CO-FOUNDER, EM AND LIZ: Thank you.</p><p>RIKI MERIS-KOULOUROUDIS, CO-FOUNDER, EM AND LIZ: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Did I -- did I get that right?</p><p>MERIS-KOULOUROUDIS: Koulouroudis.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Koulouroudis.</p><p>MERIS-KOULOUROUDIS: It's OK. It happens all the time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: My apologies, Ricky. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>We've been talking about your company during the commercial break, and this is one of the -- one of the boxes for kids.</p><p>Tell us about the company.</p><p>MERIS-KOULOUROUDIS: So we founded Em and Liz in July of 2017. Effie had already had a little girl, Em, and I was pregnant with Liz. So we decided to explore the subscription box world and kind of curate these little boxes for young girls. Who doesn't love receiving a package in the mail? So we thought there was a gap in the market. And we went with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How smart.</p><p>MERIS-KOULOUROUDIS: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you're all self-funded, right? This is your money that you used.</p><p>SAKELLIS: Yes.</p><p>MERIS-KOULOUROUDIS: Just like 61 percent of female-founded companies, we went the self-funded route. When you can, we feel like you should.</p><p>SAKELLIS: It let's us maintain control of every aspect.</p><p>MERIS-KOULOUROUDIS: Right.</p><p>SAKELLIS: The curation, to the next business decisions, being able to launch our line without just speaking to each other and saying, you know what, this is our next move, this is what we feel comfortable with. So we hope to stay that way.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, talk about what was the trigger that get -- got you to launch the cosmetics for little girls.</p><p>SAKELLIS: So --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I say cosmetics. It's lip balm and nail polish.</p><p>SAKELLIS: It's, well, so essentially what we launched as a play cosmetic line. And what we mean by that is, it's -- we design product that we felt were going to foster creativity and imagination in play. You know, little girls love to dress up and play with their friends. So we -- what we did was --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Every princess needs some glitter.</p><p>SAKELLIS: You know what, that's it. We did --</p><p>MERIS-KOULOUROUDIS: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. We've got to have some glitter.</p><p>SAKELLIS: We kept our colors -- absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love it.</p><p>SAKELLIS: We kept our colors fun, bright. There's tons of shimmer. But the best part is, they're all natural. They're mineral based. No talc, no parabens, no synthetic fragrances. It's really safe and healthy for young, sensitive skin. So you kind of, as a mother, as us being both female -- girl moms, we felt like, you know what, we get it, you want to explore the world of makeup, here's a safe way to do so. And we feel good about it. They feel -- they love it. And it's just -- it's all -- it's really fun.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Are you going to be selling the cosmetics? Are you doing nail polish yet?</p><p>SAKELLIS: We are.</p><p>MCDOWELL: OK.</p><p>MERIS-KOULOUROUDIS: Yes.</p><p>SAKELLIS: We just started to develop our nail polish line. It's going to be the same concept, free of chemicals.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Are you going to sell it in separately from -- or is it only in the box?</p><p>MERIS-KOULOUROUDIS: No, it's available to our subscribers on a month to month basis.</p><p>MCDOWELL: OK.</p><p>MERIS-KOULOUROUDIS: So our subscribers get the first sneak peeks of our new colors, our new brushes, now the nail polishes. But we do have it, if you sign up on our website, you would be able to purchase the cosmetics separately.</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S CAPITAL MARKETS: You -- do you have any competitors right now?</p><p>SAKELLIS: You know, not -- surprisingly, not many. We often found when we were looking for cosmetics to include in our box, before we started our line, they were international based. There was Canada companies. There was a lot in Paris that we were sourcing.</p><p>MERIS-KOULOUROUDIS: Yes.</p><p>SAKELLIS: And the price point was too high. So we said, why don't we bring it to the states. Why don't we have control over it and cut that whole process out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And they're different ages, right? This seems like it's for a baby.</p><p>MERIS-KOULOUROUDIS: For a younger girl, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Younger girl.</p><p>SAKELLIS: So that -- actually, the squishy is a little -- older girls love them too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I like those. I mean, well, yes.</p><p>SAKELLIS: I mean it's like a sunshine face.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Stress relief, Maria Bartiromo.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Feel it. Feel it. Feel it.</p><p>MERIS-KOULOUROUDIS: But, yes, our age groups are three to six and seven to 10. And you can select that at checkout on our website. So it's geared towards a certain age group. Yes, that would have been for the young girls. But it was actually a hit with older sisters.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Look, it's a ring.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ladies, have tariffs affected your business at all?</p><p>SAKELLIS: Yes. As a small business, absolutely. Our prices from our wholesalers have gone up anywhere from 10 to 20 percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Wow.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SAKELLIS: So it does make it a bit harder for us to control the costs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Riki and Effie, great to see you both. Thank you so much.</p><p>MERIS-KOULOUROUDIS: Thank you.</p><p>SAKELLIS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll be right back.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019101801cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X9B-VJ71-JB20-G0JF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7809\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 18, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Mick Mulvaney</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>G-7</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Doral Resort</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>President Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Em and Liz</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>President Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Turkey</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Syria</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Kurds</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Violence</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trade</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Brexit</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>U.K.</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>EU</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp;
