Persimmon, the country's largest housebuilder, has a strong claim to be Britain's <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.Google.No\">www.Google.No</url>, Persimmon has not developed a world-changing algorithm. It is not experimenting with new technologies. Its business ethic is not to solve problems first and work out how to monetise them later. Persimmon lays bricks and runs copper pipes under floors, just as housebuilders have done for ever.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So what does it have in common with the world's digital pioneer? The answer is in the accounts. Last year Persimmon reported an operating profit margin of 28.2 per cent and had \u00a31.3 billion of cash. Alphabet, Google's parent company, managed a margin of 24 per cent and had $100 billion of cash. The similarities go on. Jeff Fairburn, chief executive of Persimmon, pocketed \u00a375 million while Sundar Pichai, Google's boss, made roughly \u00a3270 million.</p><p>It doesn't take a software engineer to see something is wrong with that picture. Housebuilding is not complicated. Builders buy land, secure planning permissions, put up a few boxes and flog them. It's been done for hundreds of years. There should be zero barriers to entry. Instead, the accounts resemble those of the oligopolistic tech giants - complete with offensive bonuses.</p><p>With a cost of capital starting around 5 per cent and margins around 20 per cent, builders today are money-printing machines. Choosing to invest in Google or Persimmon, on these metrics, would be tough. Or perhaps not.</p><p>Competition regulators are going after big tech but no one gives two hoots about the builders.</p><p>Last week they were let off the hook again. Sir Oliver Letwin's \"review of build out\" rejected claims that they were causing \"intentional delay\" to prop up prices, despite its finding that build rates are just 6.5 per cent of a site a year. Development is slow, the former Tory minister concluded, due to the \"homogeneity of the tenures on offer\". In other words, builders choose to build expensive homes and develop them no faster than the demand for that limited product can absorb. It may not technically be land-banking, but it is rationing by price selection.</p><p>Sir Oliver's remedy is to require a mix of build-to-rent, shared ownership and affordable housing. Broader appeal would generate more demand and thereby speed up supply, he argued. To ensure diversity, and prevent builders erecting premium houses where smaller homes are needed, local authorities should cap the development value of big sites at ten times \"existing use value\".</p><p>It's a clever proposal but the bureaucracy may play into big builders' hands. Small firms don't have the pockets to absorb the costs of our arcane planning system. So much so, they have been dying off. In the 1980s, 10,000 small builders produced 57 per cent of new homes. Today, 2,800 produce 27 per cent.</p><p>A more frank assessment than Sir Oliver's would be that the housebuilding market has been stitched up since the consolidation of the early 2000s. Mergers concentrated power with the big nine, who used land acquisition efficiencies to lift profits while cutting supply. As planning grew more complicated, and big builders trapped sites under option in their \"strategic\" land banks, smaller developers found it harder to compete.</p><p>Today the big builders are the only game in town and, as Sir Oliver acknowledged, the only way to increase supply is to play their game and raise demand. Hence Help-to-Buy, a subsidised mortgage scheme to attract buyers. Yet, as the Googletype returns attest, the ultimate beneficiaries have been the builders. There is nothing sophisticated going on here. Housebuilding is a plain old oligopoly protected by a backwards planning system that raises barriers to entry, and needs to be shaken up.</p><p>Philip Aldrick is Economics Editor of The Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-143313146</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TNG-BGK1-DYTY-C127-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"634\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 6, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Its stated aim is to ensure the highest standards of rigour towards research ethics and integrity, and to deal robustly with research misconduct when it arises. Signatories to the Concordat include, among others, UK Research &amp; Innovation and the Wellcome Trust.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This blog focuses on what has changed in the revised Concordat, regarding the obligations of all employers of researchers, irrespective of the type and size of their organisation. As before, the Concordat contains five commitments on various aspects of research ethics; the changes in the revised Concordat mean employers of researchers now need to take a more proactive approach to research integrity, to remain compliant.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What should employers of researchers do immediately?</p><p>We explain some of the key changes in the revised Concordat below, but the key action steps for all employers of researchers are:</p><p> Review, in preparation for the first annual report, your policies and procedures with regard to promoting research integrity and, crucially, dealing with issues of misconduct.Prepare the first annual report on research ethics for your governing body, website and to be sent to Universities UK and UK Research &amp; Innovation. Make sure it includes details of the steps you have taken to improve research integrity, details of how you comply with the Concordat in dealing with misconduct and any investigations undertaken (even if none).Put processes in place to ensure that policies and procedures are continually reviewed and that you are fully prepared to report, each year, to the relevant bodies.Assign responsibility for research ethics and integrity to a senior individual within your organisation and put their details on your website.Develop and promote training programmes for all staff on research integrity and promote this within your organisation.</p><p>A changing world</p><p>As we enter a new decade of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, one thing is clear: we are on the cusp of profound changes to our society. The rise of China - with its markedly different attitudes to personal liberty, privacy and democracy - and the intelligent machine age will force us to interrogate, organise and support our existing ethical values and explore new ones for areas such as automation, gene editing and the surveillance capitalism of big tech companies.</p><p>It's in this context that the updated Concordat has been published, following a 2018 report by the Science and Technology Select Committee of the House of Commons. The report made various recommendations, including that the language of the Concordat should be tightened and that it should be easier to assess compliance with it. It stressed the role that employers of researchers (in universities, research institutes or more widely in charitable bodies or commercial organisations) should play in overseeing how research is being conducted.</p><p>The timing of the updated Concordat is particularly apposite in light of the 2019 Foreign Affairs Select Committee report which suggests foreign autocracies, particularly China, could pose a risk to academic freedom in the UK (see our earlier blog on the evidence presented to that Committee, which was substantively upheld). It is apparent from this report that there is a clash of approaches to research ethics between China and the UK. The clear thinking on the UK's industry standard approach, as set out in the Concordat, is therefore timely and welcome.</p><p>Collective responsibility for upholding research ethics</p><p>The first commitment is that researchers, employers and funders must maintain the highest standards of research integrity. The core definition of what research integrity means for the purposes of the Concordat has been amended to give additional emphasis to the notion of collective responsibility for upholding the standards, and for ensuring individuals are properly held to account when their behaviour falls short of those standards.</p><p>Dealing with research misconduct</p><p>This is picked up more specifically in the fourth commitment: \"dealing with research misconduct using transparent, timely, robust and fair processes. The primary responsibility for investigating such incidents falls on the employers of researchers\". The revised Concordat includes a number of additional considerations concerning the procedures employers should have in place to conduct these investigations into research misconduct:</p><p> The use of independent, external investigators should be considered and clear routes for appeal should be made available. These are important tenets of natural justice, particularly if a researcher's career or reputation is on the line, but they also reinforce the perception of fairness for parties concerned in the dispute, and external parties more generally.Additional protection for whistle-blowers who have brought allegations in good faith and/or the public interest. This includes reasonable steps to safeguard their reputation, including avoiding the inappropriate use of confidentiality agreements.</p><p>This would include taking care both with the terms of any agreement the whistle-blower is asked to sign, and also the terms of any settlement agreement of the accused researcher. For example, if the employer cannot publicly defend the whistle-blower from rumours or untruths because of its confidentiality obligations to the researcher, then the whistle-blower may be perceived as a troublemaker.</p><p> Similarly, reasonable steps should be taken to safeguard the reputation of researchers who are exonerated. For example, this may include a public press release in a prominent place on the employer's website if there has been negative (and potentially misleading) publicity about the researcher concerned.Once the investigation has concluded, employers must take steps to resolve any issues which have been uncovered. This should include robust action, up to and including dismissal, against a researcher found to have crossed the line. It should also include steps to correct any failings in the organisation itself which has allowed (inadvertently or not) the misconduct to arise, e.g. increasing supervision or mentoring for researchers or reviewing recruitment procedures. This can also include correcting the research record and making appropriate disclosures to regulators and funders.Processes and procedures concerning investigations (and research integrity more generally) should be subject to regular reviews to ensure compliance.</p><p>The Science and Technology Select Committee Report emphasised that research misconduct allegations should be investigated and dealt with properly and openly. In other words, employers should not resort to ending employment with settlement agreements (containing confidentiality clauses) simply to remove an individual and avoid a potentially troublesome process and/or unwelcome outcome.</p><p>The revised Concordat doesn't go so far as to adopt that recommendation, but employers of researchers should be aware that this is the direction of travel. This is particularly true for commercial organisations, as they generally have more scope to make settlement agreements than charities, which may be prevented from using charitable funds to 'pay off' individuals who have committed research misconduct, as their ability to use these agreements may be further curtailed in the future.</p><p>Training and accountability</p><p>The third commitment concerns creating \"a research environment that is underpinned by a culture of integrity and based on good governance, best practice and support for the development of researchers\". Promoting training on research ethics for all staff is an important component of this, and employers are strongly advised to review the training opportunities they currently provide .</p><p>The Concordat also requires employers to ensure a senior member of staff has responsibility for research ethics and integrity, and that their contact details are publicly available and up to date on the institution's website.</p><p>Annual statement on research integrity</p><p>The fifth commitment now includes enhanced obligations for regularly and openly reviewing the strength of research integrity within institutions. In particular, employers are now required to produce an annual statement on research integrity which must be presented to their own governing body, put on their public website and sent to the signatories of the Concordat (which of course includes UK Research &amp; Innovation).</p><p>The statement must include:</p><p> \"a summary of actions and activities that have been undertaken to support and strengthen understanding and the application of research integrity issues (for example postgraduate and researcher training, or process reviews);a statement to provide assurance that the processes the institution has in place for dealing with allegations of misconduct are transparent, timely, robust and fair, and that they continue to be appropriate to the needs of the organisation;a high-level statement on any formal investigations of research misconduct that have been undertaken, which will include data on the number of investigations. If no formal investigation has been undertaken, this should also be noted;a statement on what the institution has learned from any formal investigations of research misconduct that have been undertaken, including what lessons have been learned to prevent the same type of incident re-occurring; anda statement on how the institution creates and embeds a research environment in which all staff, researchers and students feel comfortable to report instances of misconduct\".</p><p>The virtues of compliance</p><p>These obligations clearly place a more onerous burden on the employers of researchers and, at the very least, institutions should be reviewing their existing policies and procedures in light of the revised Concordat, and taking steps to produce the annual statement that is now required.</p><p>However, there is a significant advantage to compliance with the Concordat from an employment law perspective. If an institution does get into a difficult research misconduct issue with an employee, then reliance on its adherence to the Concordat could assist its defence, if any disciplinary action and/or dismissal is later challenged.</p><p>For instance, if an investigation followed the high standards of the Concordat and the researcher was found to have fallen short of the required standards of research ethics, compliance with the Concordat could help demonstrate that any dismissal was reasonable and non-discriminatory.</p><p>Could the Concordat be improved?</p><p>Nevertheless, we do have one important criticism of the revised Concordat. As obligations of the type described above become more robust and demanding for employers of researchers, there may be an understandable tendency to be overcautious in their response to compliance and dealing with misconduct. This tendency needs to be resisted in one key regard: academic freedom must be protected. A weakness of the revised Concordat is that it does not emphasise this enough.</p><p>While it does make some reference to its importance and the wider legal framework, our experience of assisting with investigations in this area suggests that the issue of academic freedom is so intrinsic to their proper conduct, that it must be given greater prominence in the Concordat. To do otherwise could lead employers of researchers down a dangerous path and expose them to legal liabilities under employment and human rights legislation. In turn, this can lead to serious financial and reputational consequences.</p><p>If there is indeed a significant risk to academic freedom in UK universities (as highlighted by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee) and the high quality research which they conduct, then to give insufficient emphasis to the importance of academic freedom seems a remarkable omission - particularly if Chinese investment becomes more important for British universities in a post-Brexit environment.</p><p>Further, the report produced by the Committee could foreshadow action taken by a future Parliament to strengthen protection around academic freedom - indeed, the Conservative manifesto for the upcoming election makes just such a promise. If universities do not promote and protect academic freedom at the heart of their research integrity policies - particularly those covering HR investigations around misconduct - then they could fall behind the curve, and as it develops the unwary may quickly find themselves on the wrong side of the law.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

There are likely to be many reasons for this, though the pursuit of profitability is likely to be sitting at the top of the list.</p><p>Security is a growing concern for the general public in an increasingly digital society, though the risks are still greatly undervalued. It would be safe to assume only a small number of consumers would genuinely veto a purchase due to digital security concerns, and in the absence of consumer pressure for greater security, the Government is seemingly forcing the hand of the IoT ecosystem.</p><p>We want to make the UK the safest place to be online with pro-innovation regulation that breeds confidence in modern technology, said Digital Minister Matt Warman.</p><p>Our new law will hold firms manufacturing and selling internet-connected devices to account and stop hackers threatening peoples privacy and safety. It will mean robust security standards are built in from the design stage and not bolted on as an afterthought.</p><p>The industry on the whole has been gradually moving towards the concept of Secure by Design though the question is whether this progress is fast enough to prevent serious consequences. And to be fair, consumers are becoming more aware of the risks of a digitally orientated society. However, the fact that data breaches and leaks still occur validates the argument that security attitudes are not evolving fast enough.</p><p>Smart technology is increasingly central to the way we live our lives, so the development of this legislation to ensure that we are better protected is hugely welcomed, said Nicola Hudson, Policy and Communications Director at the National Cyber Security Centre.</p><p>It will give shoppers increased peace of mind that the technology they are bringing into their homes is safe, and that issues such as pre-set passwords and sudden discontinuation of security updates are a thing of the past.</p><p>This is perhaps the risk which is being faced today. As these devices are just making their way into mass market purchases, new customers are being engaged, and perhaps these new customers are not technology-enthusiasts. Some might consider purchasing a TV today as no different from a decade ago, therefore not appreciated the risk which a gateway to the internet creates.</p><p>The question is whether this is the best approach to ensure security?</p><p>The consumer IoT space is an incredibly fragmented and embryonic ecosystem. There are a huge number of inventors attempting to create the next big thing and companies attempting to embed connectivity into everything or anything. It is a lot of moving parts and plenty of opportunity for something to go wrong.</p><p>Some companies might go out of business, and therefore stop offering security updates. In the mad rush to get products to market, some elements might be overlooked. And of course, there are those who will simply ignore the rules.</p><p>This might sound negative, but it is reality. The Government is not doing anything wrong by suggesting this new law, it is certainly progress to force more security conscious products onto the market, but there are of course challenges to be aware of also. But as with every challenge, there is an opportunity to be the good guy.</p><p>Security solutions for digital products are nothing, anti-virus software has been around for decades after all, but security platforms to manage all connected objects inside the home are not common. This is not to say products should not be Secure by Design but added layers of security, and a proposition which helps manage the complexities might well be a product more digitally aware consumers would buy into.</p><p>In creating these new rules, the ecosystem is being forced down the right path, while it promotes the concept of cybersecurity in the minds of the consumer also. The more aware, and afraid, the consumer is of the dangers of a digital society, the more likely they are to spend money. The question is, who could create a platform to address this area? The telcos are in a strong position, but you can bet Big Tech is already investigating. 2020 Global Data Point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICTMOW-165679634</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICTMOW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y32-JV71-JDJN-6046-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417299</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"797\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Global Data Point Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ICT Monitor Worldwide</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35460\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000037</classCode><className>AGENCY RULEMAKING</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkRFNDkwODkxNDVGNDI1NDg0RUU3RjREMTgwNEJEQzA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjMxMjc0MUIzQjkzNEM4MEI4NkZGQjVCREJCRDk4OUM</classCode><className>Agency Rulemaking</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>ST0008ZGX</classCode><className>CYBERCRIME</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DN1X</classCode><className>DATA BREACHES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DM3E</classCode><className>DATA THEFT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008X7D</classCode><className>MANUFACTURING FACILITIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000350</classCode><className>COMPUTER CRIME</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUZBMUY1NEJCRTYyNEU2NDgwMzk4QzhBOTBEMTk1MDU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REE3RUI5RUNDMTgyNDU3Rjk2QUMwOTVBOUI1NDNFOTY</classCode><className>Computer Crimes</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002014</classCode><className>MANUFACTURING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>ST0008ZGX</classCode><className>CYBERCRIME</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DN1X</classCode><className>DATA BREACHES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D4VG</classCode><className>DATA SECURITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DM3E</classCode><className>DATA THEFT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D7DY</classCode><className>INFORMATION SECURITY &amp;

No 10 has not given an official explanation for the boycott, but, as my Guardian colleague Rowena Mason reported this week, the tactic is one that Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson's chief policy adviser, first proposed around 15 years ago, when he was developing a strategy to sabotage the BBC, which he described as the \"mortal enemy\" of the Conservative party.

He told MPs:</p><p>Something quite momentous has taken place with this royal assent. This is absolutely unprecedented and I say to the house that this is a constitutional crisis.</p><p>We are faced with a situation which is completely unprecedented, when the government in Edinburgh, in Belfast and in Cardiff has not given consent to this act of parliament. And this completely contravenes the devolution settlement that made it clear that the consent of the devolved administrations had to be given in bills of parliament to become acts of parliament that involve the devolved administrations.</p><p>I full respect that those that voted for the Conservative party in England have got what they wanted. But the fact remains that the people of Scotland were told in 2014 that, if we stayed in the UK, our rights as EU citizens would be respected. And moreover we were told that we were to lead the United Kingdom, that this was a family of nations, our rights would be respected. And we find today that our parliament has been ignored, our government has been ignored, and against the express wishes of the people of Scotland that voted in the referendum, and reaffirmed the right of the people of Scotland to determine their own destiny, that that has been ignored.</p><p>Blackford was referring to the fact that, under <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/23/boris-johnsons-brexit-bill-becomes-law\">the so-called Sewel convention</url>, the UK government is not supposed to legislate on matters covered by the devolved administrations without the devolved legislatures granting legislative consent. The EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Act does contain provisions affecting devolved matters. Yet the Scottish parliament, the Welsh assembly and the Northern Ireland assembly have       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/23/boris-johnsons-brexit-bill-becomes-law\">all recently voted to refuse it legislative consent.</url></p><p>In the article 50 case the supreme court ruled that the Sewel convention was a political convention, and not one that could be enforced by law. The wording includes an opt-out - it says Westminster will \"not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters without the consent\" of the devolved legislatures - and there is precedent for Westminster passing legislation after one of the devolved administrations refused consent. The votes in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff cannot stop Brexit.</p><p>But there is no precedent for a major piece of legislation being passed after all three devolved legislatures refused to grant it legislative consent.</p><p>Blackford's reference to a \"constitutional crisis\" may sound a touch hyperbolic. If there is a crisis, most MPs in London this afternoon don't seem to have noticed. But a crisis does not always have to be immediate, and Blackford is right to say that Brexit has unleashed forces that could have a profound impact on the union.</p><p>    Ian Blackford.

Here's an extract.</p><p>In the US view, widely supported by intelligence assessments, Huawei's accountability to political masters is so great that any network that the company builds is going to be in effect a portal for the Chinese government to spy on the activities of anyone using it. So the US has banned Huawei from doing business in the US and blocked American companies from working with it. But the larger struggle is unfolding over Huawei's business with other countries, in particular US allies.</p><p>A senior American official told me that one of the Trump administration's main priorities for 2020 is to persuade countries around the world not to use Huawei in building their 5G networks. Critics say this is, in essence, a form of barely disguised protectionism, that the Huawei threat is overstated and that the US is simply trying to impede the commercial success of a rival Chinese company.</p><p>To counter that criticism, officials told me, their ideal outcome would be a US-European joint venture that could produce networks just as well as Huawei. But for now that alternative does not exist.</p><p>Britain, of course, is in America's sights, with Boris Johnson's government set to approve a contract with the Chinese company any day now. Last week there was an explosive meeting in London between senior American and British officials. A top US official said that Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, \"erupted\" at a senior policymaker from the White House during a heated exchange over Huawei, as No 10 stood firm in defending its pending decision.</p><p>Baker says the key question is whether Washington would use talks on a UK-US trade deal to try to influence Britain's policy on Huawei. He quotes an adviser to President Trump as saying that the US is not planning to link the two issues \"at this point\".</p><p>block-time published-time 11.38am GMT </p><p>A Welsh Conservative candidate accused of deliberately sabotaging a rape trial has been deselected by his party, PA Media reports.

He said the protocol was \"very clear\" that the UK authorities would have to implement the checks and ensure that products going from GB to NI complied with the EU's single market standards for food and agrifood. He said:</p><p>There are clear commitments on the UK which are legally binding and have to be implemented.</p><p>He warned that the next stage of negotiations would be tough and that there could be no sector by sector cherry-picking.

This was a foregone conclusion ever since Boris Johnson  won the general election with a near-landslide majority and, in a curious paradox, the Brexit deal that paralysed parliament for more than two years, and brought down a PM, barely made the news as it finally got over its last parliamentary hurdle. In response, Johnson put out this statement:</p><p>Parliament has passed the withdrawal agreement bill, meaning we will leave the EU on 31 January and move forwards as one United Kingdom.</p><p>At times it felt like we would never cross the Brexit finish line, but we've done it.</p><p>Now we can put the rancour and division of the past three years behind us and focus on delivering a bright, exciting future - with better hospitals and schools, safer streets and opportunity spread to every corner of our country.</p><p>But 'crossing the finishing line' may be a tad optimistic, given that the government still has not resolved what its final trade relationship with the EU will look like, and last night a senior EU official used a speech in London to make this very point. Stefaan De Rynck, the senior adviser to Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, said what came next would be \"more complicated\" and that a \"dose of realism\" was needed. As Jack Blanchard reports <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/23/boris-johnsons-brexit-bill-becomes-law\">in his London Playbook briefing</url> for Politico Europe, De Rynck said:</p><p>There should be no misunderstanding of the fact that the next phase will be more complicated to negotiate than the withdrawal agreement.</p><p>The construction of the text for the withdrawal agreement wasn't always easy - but compared to the construction of the text for the future relationship agreement, we are talking about two different kinds of exercises.

Shortly after this was announced Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, told MPs that the country was facing a \"constitutional crisis\" because the legislation had been passed despite devolved legislatures in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales all voting to withhold consent for it. (See 3.37pm.) The government has hinted strongly that it will allow the Chinese firm Huawei some role in the UK's 5G mobile network, despite warnings from the US that doing so could compromise security. Sajid Javid has sought to reassure business that there will be no wholesale dumping of EU regulations as he pledged there would be no divergence after Brexit for the sake of it. John Bercow has accused Downing Street of trying to scupper his chances of being made a peer, and dismissed accusations of bullying made by his former most senior official. Richard Ratcliffe emerged from a 40-minute meeting with Boris Johnson in Downing Street admitting there had been no breakthrough in his efforts to persuade the government to do more to secure the release of his wife from a Tehran jail. The police watchdog is facing accusations that it is dragging its feet on a decision about whether to investigate Boris Johnson for possible criminal misconduct over his friendship with the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri when he was London mayor. The proportion of recorded crimes in England and Wales that resulted in a suspect being charged or summonsed to court has fallen again, figures reveal, as knife crime surges to a record high. Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, has implicitly criticised No 10's decision not to allow ministers to appear on the Radio 4's Today programme. Downing Street has been refusing to put up ministers for interview on the programme in recent weeks, despite the fact that it is seen as one of the BBC's flagship current affairs programmes. No 10 has not given an official explanation for the boycott, but, as my Guardian colleague Rowena Mason reported this week, the tactic is one that Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson's chief policy adviser, first proposed around 15 years ago, when he was developing a strategy to sabotage the BBC, which he described as the \"mortal enemy\" of the Conservative party. Morgan was speaking in an interview for the Political Thinking podcast, hosted by Nick Robinson, a Today presenter. Asked if she was comfortable with the ban on ministers appearing on Today, she replied: My personal view is I think it's good to engage with all programmes on all channels. When Robinson told Morgan she would be welcome to appear on the programme if Cummings allowed that, she just laughed. That's all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. This is from Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Brexiter leader of the Commons. But other Gibbon quotes are available. The great historian also said: History... is indeed little more than the register of the crimes, follies, and misfortunes of mankind. The European parliament's constitutional affairs committee has voted to recommend that MEPs should vote for the withdrawal agreement when they debate it on Wednesday afternoon next week. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, has told Sky News that he thinks the chances of the UK and the EU agreeing a trade deal in 2020 are just 50/50. In a short interview in Davos, when asked if he was confident about there being a deal this year, he replied: 50/50. Because a year is not very long, and if the UK is really not willing to ask for an extension, then we run a risk that we might get to a cliff edge again. By \"cliff edge\", he means what would effectively be a no-deal Brexit at the end of 2020 (although a 2020 no deal would be different from a 2019 no deal, because the withdrawal agreement would be passed, which means the rights of EU nationals would be guaranteed, and the arrangement for Northern Ireland to remain effectively in the single market would be in place). This is from Sky's economics editor, Ed Conway. Boris Johnson insists he is almost certain to get a trade deal, but the EU is more open about the risk of what it calls a \"cliff edge\" at the end of this year. It has recently published a whole series of briefing slides about the forthcoming trade talks, and this is from one set of slides (pdf) covering trade. Here is some niche research from a reader which might interest people following the Labour leadership contest. Shortly after the granting of royal assent to the Brexit bill was announced, the SNP leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, used a point of order to say that the country was now facing a \"constitutional crisis\". He told MPs: Something quite momentous has taken place with this royal assent. This is absolutely unprecedented and I say to the house that this is a constitutional crisis. We are faced with a situation which is completely unprecedented, when the government in Edinburgh, in Belfast and in Cardiff has not given consent to this act of parliament. And this completely contravenes the devolution settlement that made it clear that the consent of the devolved administrations had to be given in bills of parliament to become acts of parliament that involve the devolved administrations. I full respect that those that voted for the Conservative party in England have got what they wanted. But the fact remains that the people of Scotland were told in 2014 that, if we stayed in the UK, our rights as EU citizens would be respected. And moreover we were told that we were to lead the United Kingdom, that this was a family of nations, our rights would be respected. And we find today that our parliament has been ignored, our government has been ignored, and against the express wishes of the people of Scotland that voted in the referendum, and reaffirmed the right of the people of Scotland to determine their own destiny, that that has been ignored. Blackford was referring to the fact that, under the so-called Sewel convention, the UK government is not supposed to legislate on matters covered by the devolved administrations without the devolved legislatures granting legislative consent. The EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Act does contain provisions affecting devolved matters. Yet the Scottish parliament, the Welsh assembly and the Northern Ireland assembly have all recently voted to refuse it legislative consent. In the article 50 case the supreme court ruled that the Sewel convention was a political convention, and not one that could be enforced by law. The wording includes an opt-out - it says Westminster will \"not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters without the consent\" of the devolved legislatures - and there is precedent for Westminster passing legislation after one of the devolved administrations refused consent. The votes in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff cannot stop Brexit. But there is no precedent for a major piece of legislation being passed after all three devolved legislatures refused to grant it legislative consent. Blackford's reference to a \"constitutional crisis\" may sound a touch hyperbolic. If there is a crisis, most MPs in London this afternoon don't seem to have noticed. But a crisis does not always have to be immediate, and Blackford is right to say that Brexit has unleashed forces that could have a profound impact on the union. From the Brexit department John Bercow, the former Commons Speaker, has issued a fresh statement in response to the report that Lord Lisvane, the former clerk of the Commons, has submitted a formal complaint about him alleging bullying. (See 9.39am.) In it he categorically denies ever bullying anyone. He says: I have seen in the media that Lord Lisvane is formally complaining that I bullied staff. For the record, I categorically deny that I have ever bullied anyone, anywhere at any time. According to the Press Association, in the statement Bercow says Lisvane had \"ample opportunity\" to raise concerns about Bercow's conduct with him and that Lisvane had \"a duty of care to all House staff\". Therefore, he had not merely a right but a responsibility to act if he thought that he witnessed misconduct. The simple fact is that he did not at any time do so. Even though he frequently disagreed with me on a wide range of issues, he did not once complain to me and neither did any other official on his behalf. In the statement Bercow argues that he is entitled to a peerage, because it is conventional for retiring Speakers to go to the Lords, and he criticises No 10 for not giving him one. He says: [Since retiring it has] become increasingly obvious that the government has no intention of honouring the centuries-old convention that a departing speaker is promptly elevated to the House of Lords. Indeed, it has been suggested to me that the government actively seeks to block any other attempt to nominate me for membership of the upper House. The Brexit bill has received royal assent. It is now an act of parliament, the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Act. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons (and arch-Brexiter), announced it on Twitter. And here are the latest nomination tallies for the Labour leadership posted by @CLPNominations. This tables, showing nominations by affiliates, is not up to date, because it does not include Chinese for Labour nominating Lisa Nandy. That means that she and Sir Keir Starmer are both now guaranteed a place on the final ballot. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has released a video message backing his fellow leftwinger Richard Burgon for the Labour deputy leadership. McDonnell is also urging constituency Labour parties (CLPs) to nominate Burgon. There are five candidates still in the contest for deputy leader but, as in the contest for the leadership, candidates will only make it onto the final ballot if they can get nominations from either 33 CLPs (5% of the total), or three affiliates (unions or socialist societies), comprising at least 5% of the affiliates vote. At the moment Burgon is struggling, but if he were to get nominated by Unite or CWU (the two big unions yet to decide), he would be close to guaranteeing his place on the ballot. Here are recent nomination tallies for the deputy leadership from @CLPNominations, a reliable guide. Angela Rayner is the only candidate so far guaranteed a place on the final ballot. The likely battle lines between SNP and Scotish Tories in advance of next year's Holyrood election are becoming clearer every week. At this lunchtime's FMQs (first minister's questions), interim Tory leader Jackson Carlaw - who launched his leadership campaign last week with proposals to reverse SNP tax rises for high earners - raised a pretty shocking story that was highlighted by the Courier this morning: the roof of a police station in Broughty Ferry collapsing just hours after the justice secretary dismissed concerns about the crumbling police estate as \"hyperbole\". Carlaw condemned \"years of missed opportunities from a distracted government\", noting that the FM would be returning to \"her favourite topic\" next week when she has promised to update parliament on her next steps after Boris Johnson ruled out granting her the legal powers to hold a second independence referendum. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, shot back that it was Carlaw himself who was planning to strip public services, quoting an analysis of his tax proposals which she said proved they would \"take \u00a3270m out of public services and give it back to the richest\". With the Scottish draft budget due on February 6, we can expect plenty more of this. Emily Thornberry has also tweeted a message of support to her fellow Labour leadership candidate Keir Starmer. (See 1.19pm.) Zac Goldsmith, the environment minister, came up with a particularly unflattering description of himself in his maiden speech in the House of Lords a few minutes ago, Sky's Aubrey Allegretti reports. Sir Keir Starmer, the favourite in the Labour leadership contest, has been forced to cancel campaign events as his mother-in-law is critically ill in hospital. A spokesman for Starmer said: Following an accident, Keir Starmer's mother-in-law is critically ill and has been admitted to hospital in intensive care. In order to support his family at this difficult time, Keir will be cancelling all campaign events today and tomorrow. We ask that his family's privacy is respected at this time. In response, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Starmer's main rival in the contest, posted this on Twitter. The police watchdog is facing accusations that it is dragging its feet on a decision about whether to investigate Boris Johnson for possible criminal misconduct over his friendship with the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri when he was London mayor, my colleague Matthew Weaver reports. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, is speaking at a CBI lunch in Davos. He has just sought to reassure business that the UK won't abandon all EU regulations after Brexit, saying: We won't diverge just for the sake of it. There is full coverage of the speech on my colleague Graeme Wearden's Davos live blog. From Bloomberg's Ian Wishart Ratcliffe says the recent weeks, since the killing of Qassem Suleimani, have been terrifying. Q: Did Johnson apologise for his own comments about Nazanin (about her being in Iran to teach journalism - a false statement that was used by Iran to justify her ongoing detention.) Ratcliffe says they did not talk about the past. But he says he was satisfied that Johnson was committed to getting this case resolved. He says he presented Johnson with a wallet made by Nazanin in prison. He says Johnson offered five-year-old Gabriella apple juice. And she was given a toy cat. During the meeting, she did some colouring, he says. Richard Ratcliffe is speaking to journalists now after his meeting with Boris Johnson. He says he did not come away thinking that his wife, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, will be released very soon. He says he still thinks the government should be tougher on Iran. But it was a gracious visit, he says. Q: How could the government be tougher? He says in his opinion Nazanin is being held hostage by Iran. He says he spoke to Johnson about Magnitsky-style sanctions on Iran. He says after the UK leaves the EU it would be easier to impose those. He says hostage taking should not be allowed. That should be a universal value that should be upheld. He says it is important for their to be progress in the court case. (See 11.12am.) But he was told the government was doing all it could, he says. Richard Ratcliffe has arrived at Downing Street for his talks with Boris Johnson about his wife, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is detained in Iran. (See 11.12am.) He has brought their daughter, Gabriella, and his own mother Barbara (to help look after Gabriella if she gets distracted during the meeting, he explained on the Today programme this morning). Turning back to Huawei, Gerard Baker has an interesting column on this topic here in the Times (paywall) today. Here's an extract. In the US view, widely supported by intelligence assessments, Huawei's accountability to political masters is so great that any network that the company builds is going to be in effect a portal for the Chinese government to spy on the activities of anyone using it. So the US has banned Huawei from doing business in the US and blocked American companies from working with it. But the larger struggle is unfolding over Huawei's business with other countries, in particular US allies. A senior American official told me that one of the Trump administration's main priorities for 2020 is to persuade countries around the world not to use Huawei in building their 5G networks. Critics say this is, in essence, a form of barely disguised protectionism, that the Huawei threat is overstated and that the US is simply trying to impede the commercial success of a rival Chinese company. To counter that criticism, officials told me, their ideal outcome would be a US-European joint venture that could produce networks just as well as Huawei. But for now that alternative does not exist. Britain, of course, is in America's sights, with Boris Johnson's government set to approve a contract with the Chinese company any day now. Last week there was an explosive meeting in London between senior American and British officials. A top US official said that Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, \"erupted\" at a senior policymaker from the White House during a heated exchange over Huawei, as No 10 stood firm in defending its pending decision. Baker says the key question is whether Washington would use talks on a UK-US trade deal to try to influence Britain's policy on Huawei. He quotes an adviser to President Trump as saying that the US is not planning to link the two issues \"at this point\". A Welsh Conservative candidate accused of deliberately sabotaging a rape trial has been deselected by his party, PA Media reports. Ross England was giving evidence as a witness in the trial of a male friend when it was halted after he referred to the female victim's previous sexual history against the directions of the judge. Today the Conservative party said England's nomination to contest the Vale of Glamorgan seat in the 2021 Welsh assembly election had been withdrawn. The proportion of recorded crimes in England and Wales that resulted in a suspect being charged or summonsed to court has fallen again, fresh figures reveal, as knife crime surges to a record high, my colleague Jamie Grierson reports. Sharon Hodgson, the shadow health secretary, is responding to Matt Hancock's statement. She has some questions. Will flights from other Chinese cities be monitored? What advice is being given to other people flying to China? Are contingency plans in place in case the disease does reach the UK? Hancock is replying now. He says it is important to get enhanced monitoring right. He says symptoms from coronavirus take five to seven days to appear, and can take up to 14 days. So monitoring people on aircraft is of limited value, he suggests. But he says there will be no further flights out of Wuhan anyway. In the Commons Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is making a statement about the coronavirus outbreak. He says there have been 571 cases, and 17 reported fatalities. Most cases of this new virus have been non-fatal, he says. But some cases have been fatal. There are no cases of this new infection in the UK so far, he says. He says the government is closely monitoring the situation. Since yesterday health officials have been monitoring people on flights from Wuhan. And people on flights from China are receiving information about this, he says. He says the chief medical officer has changed the risk level to the UK from very low to low. But the UK is prepared to deal with any outbreak, he says. He says travel advice has been updated, and the government is now advising against all but essential travel to Wuhan. In her Sky News interview this morning Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, hinted that the government is minded to allow the Chinese firm Huawei to play a role in constructing the UK's 5G network. The US government has been strongly urging London not to use Huawei, claiming that it poses a security risk and threatening to limit intelligence cooperation if Huawei does get the go-ahead. Leadsom said the government would take a decision on this soon. But, as Reuters reports, she highlighted difficulties with not using Huawei. She said: There are other providers but they are limited. Ideally there would be more providers of infrastructure similar to the work that Huawei does but the UK is looking very carefully at this issue and we will be making a final decision soon. It is an ongoing process and there are all sorts of factors to take into consideration, like the availability of other providers, like the work that Huawei has already done in the United Kingdom, so these discussions are ongoing. But she also said she shared concerns about protecting national security. Speaking ahead of his meeting with Boris Johnson later, Richard Ratcliffe said that he hoped the PM would \"take responsibility\" for the detention of his wife Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe in Iran. Ratcliffe told the Today programme: [Johnson] needs to take responsibility for Nazanin's case, for upholding the promise he made to us to leave no stone unturned. Ratcliffe also urged Johnson to be \"brave\" in resolving a long-running trade dispute with Iran over the settlement of a \u00a3400m debt. He said: Nazanin was told way back in 2016 she was being held over it. It has long been in the shadows of our case. [Johnson's] obligation is to protect British citizens. He needs to be brave in doing positive gestures in relation to the debt and other issues that will calm relations down, but also being brave in calling out Iran on hostage-taking. It is not an acceptable way to conduct diplomacy. My colleague Patrick Wintour has more on this in his overnight story previewing the meeting. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, has launched a hunt for someone to replace longstanding Office for Budget Responsibility chairman Robert Chote when his term at the fiscal watchdog comes to an end in October. As PA Media reports, Chote has headed up the independent economic forecaster since it was launched in 2010, having served the maximum two five-year terms. The chancellor said Chote had led the OBR with \"intelligence, independence and integrity\". In a statement Javid said: Finding the right candidate to lead the OBR and build on the significant progress of the last 10 years is vital for maintaining the credibility of the UK's fiscal framework and our status as a world leader in fiscal transparency. I look forward to working with Robert Chote to deliver my budget on March 11 before he finishes his second term as chair. The Treasury said the recruitment process would look at the \"broadest possible pool of applicants\" and is open to applications until 20 February. Michel Barner's senior adviser Stefaan De Rynck has warned that the EU will not tolerate any \"backsliding\" on the commitment to introduce checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea as part of the controversial Brexit deal on Northern Ireland. At an event at University College London last night, De Rynck was clear that checks were part of the Northern Ireland protocol and warned that if the deal was not complied with there could be sanctions. We will not tolerate any backsliding or half measures on this. It is clear what needs to be done by both sides. His remarks put him at odds with Boris Johnson, who on Wednesday gave yet another assurance to the DUP's Westminster leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, that there would be no checks on goods going from Northern Ireland to GB or from GB to Northern Ireland under the deal. De Rynck refused to comment on what Johnson said, but confirmed checks were part of the special NI arrangements. He said the protocol was \"very clear\" that the UK authorities would have to implement the checks and ensure that products going from GB to NI complied with the EU's single market standards for food and agrifood. He said: There are clear commitments on the UK which are legally binding and have to be implemented. He warned that the next stage of negotiations would be tough and that there could be no sector by sector cherry-picking. And he said it needed to be better understood in British media that a zero-tariff and zero-quota offer to the single market was a big offer to the UK. That is a pretty generous offer for the EU to consider. Because this is a market of 450m people at the doorstep of the UK. In terms of some of the stories I read this morning in the media, I think we need to stress that this is not something that any other country has, across the board zero tariffs, zero quota access to the market. Touching on recent comments by Sajid Javid, the chancellor, that the UK would not be seeking alignment with the EU on trade rules, De Rynck warned there were \"consequences\" for that. Asked if the EU would agree to a \"salami slice\" deal involving a \"bare bones\" pact on trade by the end of the year with other issues to follow in the months and years beyond, De Rynck quipped: I prefer ... this kind of pasta where everything is integrated as a main course. An over-arching institutional framework with linked chapters and agreements is certainly part of the political declaration and certainly one the UK has also agreed to. We will want now to see how that pans out in practice. This is from my colleague John Crace on Liz Truss's comments about trade and the US. Here is the full reply from Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, when she was asked in the Commons a few minutes ago by the Labour MP Jonathan Reynolds if the government would back down in the face of American pressure over its plans for a digital services tax. (See 9.55am.) She told him: Let me be absolutely clear. UK tax policy is a matter for the UK chancellor. It's not a matter for the US, it's not a matter for the EU, it's not a matter for anybody else, and we will make the decisions that are right for Britain, whether it is on our regulatory standards, whether it's on our tax policy, or whether it is on anything else. In the Commons Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, is taking questions. She has just suggested that the government will not back down over its plans for a digital services tax despite opposition from Washington, which is worried about the impact on US tech giants. This is from Politico's Emilio Casalicchio. Truss's comments reflect what Sajid Javid, the chancellor, said at Davos yesterday, although her tone was more confrontational than his. She was effectively telling the US not to interfere. Yesterday the US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said the US might respond with retaliatory tariffs if the UK went ahead with the digital sales tax. The shadow Treasury minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said he found her comment interesting. Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, was giving interviews this morning to promote the announcement that the government is ensuring that parents who suffer the loss of a child under the age of 18 will be entitled to two weeks of statutory paid leave from work. Our story on the announcement is here. According to the Times (paywall), Lord Lisvane, the former clerk of the Commons, has submitted a complaint to the parliamentary commissioner standards about alleged bullying by John Bercow when he was Speaker. Other officials have complained about Bercow's treatment of staff in the past, but Lisvane is the most senior official to have submitted a formal complaint, the paper says. In a statement to the Times Bercow, who has repeatedly denied claims that he bullied officials, said: During the five years that we worked together, Lord Lisvane had ample opportunity to raise any accusations of bullying with me. At no stage did he do so, even though he became clerk of the House - the most senior official. The timing of this intervention is curious. The last sentence is a reference to reports that Bercow is being nominated for a peerage. It is normal for a former Speaker to be offered a peerage, but there have been reports that Bercow's nomination for one comes from Jeremy Corbyn, in the dissolution honours list, because Boris Johnson is reluctant to make the nomination himself. In an interview on Sky News this morning the business secretary Andrea Leadsom, who had an acrimonious relationship with Bercow herself when she was leader of the Commons (she says he once called her a \"stupid woman\" in the chamber), suggested that a bullying complaint could stop Bercow getting a peerage. She said: In the event that there are genuine, upheld complaints about any persons that should have an impact on whether they are found suitable for the House of Lords. In Davos Steven Mnuchin, the US treasury secretary, has said Washington expects to conclude a trade deal with the UK by the end of this year, Faisal Islam, the BBC's economics editor, reports. My colleague Graeme Wearden has more on his Davos live blog. He will be covering Sajid Javid, the chancellor, who will be giving a speech at the conference at lunchtime. There will be an oral statement in the Commons after 10.30am from Matt Hancock, the health secretary, on the coronavirus crisis. Yesterday the government's EU (withdrawal agreement) bill, the legislation that will take the UK out of the EU next week, cleared parliament. This was a foregone conclusion ever since Boris Johnson won the general election with a near-landslide majority and, in a curious paradox, the Brexit deal that paralysed parliament for more than two years, and brought down a PM, barely made the news as it finally got over its last parliamentary hurdle. In response, Johnson put out this statement: Parliament has passed the withdrawal agreement bill, meaning we will leave the EU on 31 January and move forwards as one United Kingdom. At times it felt like we would never cross the Brexit finish line, but we've done it. Now we can put the rancour and division of the past three years behind us and focus on delivering a bright, exciting future - with better hospitals and schools, safer streets and opportunity spread to every corner of our country. But 'crossing the finishing line' may be a tad optimistic, given that the government still has not resolved what its final trade relationship with the EU will look like, and last night a senior EU official used a speech in London to make this very point. Stefaan De Rynck, the senior adviser to Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, said what came next would be \"more complicated\" and that a \"dose of realism\" was needed. As Jack Blanchard reports in his London Playbook briefing for Politico Europe, De Rynck said: There should be no misunderstanding of the fact that the next phase will be more complicated to negotiate than the withdrawal agreement. The construction of the text for the withdrawal agreement wasn't always easy - but compared to the construction of the text for the future relationship agreement, we are talking about two different kinds of exercises. The limitation of time must lead to some dose of realism on what can be achieved. I will be filing more on De Rynck's speech shortly. We will hear more on Brexit in the Commons later, because Liz Truss and Jacob Rees-Mogg are both taking questions. Otherwise it looks like a quiet day. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 10.30am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, takes questions in the Commons on next week's business. Lunchtime: Boris Johnson meets Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's husband, Richard Ratcliffe, in Downing Street. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up.

But it can help</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MEET the British Bill Gates. He studied computer science at Cambridge--dropping out to start his career in nearby \"Silicon Fen\". Then he launched his own start-up, based at \"Silicon Roundabout\", a new hub of tech firms in east London. Bolstered by finance from the City, he resisted the lure of a foreign takeover, ultimately listing on the London Stock Exchange.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is a plausible biography--given the necessary addition of animal spirits--but an imaginary one. Britain has no digital equivalent of the 18th-century industrial innovators who turned technology into commercial leadership. Its more recent prowess in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology has not been emulated in the digital sphere. David Cameron's government should ponder this failure and address the reasons for it. Luck is one of them, but so are national and European regulations and a tepid climate for entrepreneurs.</p><h>A nation of digital shopkeepers</h><p>Britain has one of the biggest online economies. Its researchers invented both the web and the computer. It has the English language--which helps to link it with California's Silicon Valley and Indian high-tech--and great universities. There are thriving tech clusters in Bristol, London and elsewhere (see \"The high-tech industry: Start me up\"). More so than other European countries, Britain should be competing with America as a tech leader.</p><p>Yet it has nurtured relatively few big tech companies and no huge ones. In particular, Britain has vanishingly few \"platform\" firms--ie, the sort that, like Microsoft, Google or Facebook, have built and marketed a service or piece of software on which other businesses and applications rely. That is where the real money is: platforms tend to yield lots of jobs in spin-offs and ancillary enterprises. Britain has Autonomy, which makes specialised search software, and ARM, which designs the microchips for Apple's iPhones. Both are leaders in their fields, but neither is a giant. More damningly, they are the only two innovative tech outfits in the FTSE index of leading shares.</p><p>There should surely be more. Individual ideas and people are the key, obviously, but there are three problems with Britain's tech ecology that its government could ameliorate. One is the absence of a market as big and homogeneous as American tech firms enjoy. Another is a relative shortage of capital for start-ups and growing firms. The third is the lack of entrepreneurs who combine technological expertise, business acumen and the sort of balls that, in 2006, reputedly let Mark Zuckerberg turn down Yahoo!'s offer of $1 billion for Facebook.</p><p>Begin with the market. You might think that distance and geography would be marginal considerations for tech firms. You would be wrong. For American firms, a domestic market of 300m interconnected English-speaking consumers is a big advantage. Easy transatlantic communications should help British firms conquer that market; but they also encourage American firms to snap up promising British companies. Europe is fragmented not only by multiple languages but also by the lack of a properly common market in services, including digital ones, so tech firms must still overcome assorted legal and bureaucratic barriers to trade across the EU. Digital firms should be able to benefit from the single market just as mobile-phone companies such as Nokia and Vodafone have. Proper implementation across the union of the directive on liberalising the services market, passed in 2006, would be a start.</p><p>When it comes to finance, Britain lags not only Silicon Valley, where many entrepreneurs see investing in the next generation as a sort of moral responsibility. In 2010 high-tech firms in Israel attracted $1.3 billion in venture capital, nearly twice as much as in Britain, whose economy is ten times as big. George Osborne, the chancellor of the exchequer, made some progress in his most recent budget by increasing the tax relief available for investors in start-ups. He should now look at the capital-gains tax regime: investors who make speculative bets and hit the jackpot should be able to keep and reinvest more of their winnings. Designing a system that rewards such risks but does not allow people to shelter their income from tax is tricky, but not impossible. It would help British businesspeople to think bigger, too: the absence of funding for growth is one reason some sell up at a relatively early stage. The 50% top income-tax rate creates further problems, by making it harder for entrepreneurs to recruit and retain the best people.</p><p>The gripe about Britain being poor at gestating bold entrepreneurs is an old one: the stereotype is of boffins who are good at generating ideas, but lose out to thrusting Americans when it comes to monetising them. There would be less truth in that caricature if British graduates in disciplines such as science and engineering gained some familiarity with business as part of their studies (it is noteworthy that the best British universities discourage students from earning money while they learn, while at American ones most are obliged to).</p><h>How do you know who will be the entrepreneurs?</h><p>The government should be more relaxed about bolstering the supply of indigenous entrepreneurs with foreigners, as well as about admitting more workers with technical and commercial skills that are in short supply. Beneath its wrongheaded, headline goal to slash net immigration, the government has sensibly made sure that a route remains open for entrepreneurs. The trouble is, it is not always obvious which would-be newcomer will end up striking gold: when a six-year-old Sergey Brin emigrated from Russia to America with his family, it was not yet clear that he would one day co-found Google. By cutting the numbers of foreign students it allows in, current immigration policy is shrinking the commercial pool as well as the academic one. London is a magnet for creative types everywhere; capitalise on that--and let more of them in.</p><p>Mr Cameron is keen on the tech industry, seeing it as a source of growth in lean times, and a way of weaning the economy off its dependence on flighty finance. Should our imaginary tech superstar materialise, it would be a shame if Britain's Bill Gates were turned away at the border, or left Britain of his own accord for another country where his talents would be more generously nurtured and rewarded.</p><p>SOURCE: The Economist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EIUVWS-vwvwmain20110806t1620000008xmlxml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EIUVWS2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FJ0-17S1-JCDS-34HB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253486</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1081\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2011 The Economist Intelligence Unit Ltd.

The consumer prices index fell to 2.7% in February, down from 3% in January, and closer to wage growth. The Office for National Statistics reported that food and fuel inflation slowed, pulling down the benchmark cost of living. But, prices are still rising ahead of earnings - although tomorrow's labour market statistics may show the gap narrowing. The impact of the pound's fall after the EU referendum is starting to fade, after driving import prices sharply higher in 2017. Economists are split over whether the Bank of England will raise interest rates in May, as it tries to get inflation back down to 2% without driving up unemployment. Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, has warned that inflation could get an Easter bump, which would hurt households. In the markets, European stock markets are clawing back some ground after Monday's selloff. But Facebook is being shunned again; its shares down another 3% as politicians and regulators probe how users' personal data has been used. Despite Facebook's deepening problems, the US stock market is recovering from Monday's losses. The Dow Jones industrial average, which shed 335 points yesterday, is up 180 today. The tech-focused Nasdaq is flattish, with software firm Adobe up 2.8% and chipmaker NVIDIA up 1.1%. Facebook, though, is still down 3%. Back on inflation, our economics editor Larry Elliott has warned that the Bank of England could raise interest rates in May - if wages rise over the next couple of months. He writes: Earnings growth has been creeping up and before too long earnings will be increasing more quickly than prices. The sharper than expected fall in inflation means the return to rising real incomes will occur sooner and that will mean stronger growth and - from the MPC's perspective - the threat of higher wage inflation. While there has been little in recent economic data to justify a May increase in rates, earnings data will be crucial. If the annual increase edges closer to 3%, a spring rise will be a real possibility. No sign of a bounceback for Facebook yet: Over in New York, shares in Facebook have fallen by another 3% at the start of trading. That's on top of yesterday's 6.7% rout, and knocks another $15bn off its market capitalisation. The selloff comes as the data scandal that hit the company last weekend deepens, with several new developments today: A former Facebook executive has told the Guardian that numerous companies harvested the personal data of its users America's Federal Trade Commission is reportedly probing whether Facebook violated the terms of a 2011 consent decree over its use of personal data A parliamentary committee has asked Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to answer questions European stock markets have recovered a little ground this morning, after yesterday's selloff. In London the FTSE 100 has gained 22 points, having slumped to a 15-month low on Monday. However, worries over global trade spats, the Facebook data crisis and uncertainty over the pace of US interest rate rises are all keeping traders edgy. Elsewhere in the markets, legendary motor racing star-turned-airline manager Niki Lauda has landed a deal with Ryanair. The Irish budget airline has agreed to buy a 25% stake in Laudamotion - the Vienna-based operator which was created out of Laudi's previous airline, Niki (formerly part of Air Berlin, which went bust last year). Ryanair intends to boost its state to 75% as soon as EU regulators have given their approval. It will lend Laudamotion six planes, which will boost its fleet to 21 -- helping it to challenge rival Lufthansa. Jane Foley, head of foreign exchange strategy at Rabobank, believes the Bank of England's monetary policy committee will raise interest rates at least once this year. And despite today's inflation figures, she believes they will hike Bank Rate from 0.5% to 0.75% in May. \"Our expectation is of no change to rates at this week's BoE meeting] but of a rise at the May meeting. In our view, though, the market is still focusing too much on the committee's voting patterns. It is possible for every member to hold steady this time while also planning to vote for a hike in May. \"The markets are better served by reading the Bank's minutes closely and observing Mark Carney's comments. It was clear at Davos, for example, that he was readying the markets for a potential rate increase during the first half of the year. \"In terms of a November hike, there remain two core issues at play. The first is Brexit. If the process runs smoothly, the environment will be much more conducive to a rate rise. Secondly, the Bank will monitor UK wage growth closely. If this increases, pushing up inflation, it will be a lot easier to justify a rate hike. \"These are significant factors, though, and so it is possible to envisage a rate rise in May but none later in the year if Brexit negotiations hit a snag and wages are flat.\" The pound has dipped slightly, following the news that Britain's consumer prices index has dropped to a seven-month low. Traders are calculating that the inflation slowdown makes a UK interest rate rise a little less likely in the next few months. But sterling is only down 0.1% against the US dollar today, to just over $1.40 (this tweet from Bloomberg makes it look more dramatic though!) The muted reaction suggests the City believes a May rate hike is still possible. Obviously the Bank of England will be pleased to see inflation falling towards its target of 2%. But if wages do pick up, policymakers might conclude that labour market slack has been eroded, so the economy can handle higher borrowing costs. Thursday's meeting is an opportunity for the BoE to drop some hints... Households won't be popping champagne bottles open when wages finally start rising faster than inflation. Economist Rupert Seggins has shown how workers' earnings power has been badly eroded since the financial crisis, meaning people are poorer in real terms: In other news, the threat of a global trade war has hit investor confidence in Germany: House price inflation also fell last month, but is still rising faster than wages. The average house price rose by 4.9% in the 12 months to January, down from 5% a month earlier. Prices rose slowest in the North East (0.7%) and London (2.1%), but jumped fastest in the East Midlands (7.3). It's possible that wages will catch up with inflation this month, predicts Stephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation. \"Import-driven inflation is clearly slowing. Food and beverage prices are rising at a slower rate than last month and further falls are likely. We can also see a slowdown in transport inflation, contributing just 0.35 ppts to annual inflation down from 0.8ppts a year ago, and the price of utilities is rising at a slower rate than before. Both are underpinned by a fall in the price of energy from its New Year highs. \"The sharp fall in inflation means we could be seeing an earlier end to the pay squeeze than previously expected, perhaps as early as this month\" We get the latest UK earnings figures tomorrow, in the unemployment data for November-January. Economists predict that wages rose by 2.6% per year in that quarter, which would almost eliminate the gap. Mel Stride, financial secretary to the Treasury, insists that the government is helping families cope with inflation. He says: \"We know families feel the cost of living at the end of every working week. From next month a typical taxpayer will pay 1,000 less income tax than in 2010. \"And we are increasing the National Living Wage, which is already helping the lowest earners see their pay rise by almost 7% above inflation. This is part of our plan to build an economy that works for everyone.\" Stride also suggests that real wages should start rising again soon, as inflation is expected to keep dropping: Unions aren't impressed, though. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady warns that workers desperately need a proper pay rise after years of struggles: She says: \"Britain's living standards crisis is far from over. Today's fall in prices may ease the pressure a bit. But working people will still be worse off at the end of this parliament than before the crash. \"The government must up its game. Millions of workers haven't had a proper pay rise in years. \"Unless ministers invest in the infrastructure and public services needed for better-paid jobs, the UK will remain at the bottom of the league for real wage growth.\" It's now 14 months since the pound hit a 31-year low against the US dollar at $1.20, driving import prices higher. Sterling has since recovered to around $1,40. Phil Gooding, head of CPI at the Office for National Statistics, believes the impact of the pound's slide is now fading: \"A small fall in petrol prices alongside food prices rising more slowly than last year helped pull down inflation, as many of the early 2017 price increases due to the previous depreciation of the pound have started to work through the system. \"Hotel prices also fell and the cost of ferry tickets rose more slowly than last year, when prices were collected on Valentine's Day when many people could have been taking mini-breaks.\" The battle against inflation isn't over, warns Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC. He predicts that consumer prices could push higher this month, as retailers and transport firms prepare for Easter: \"It is not a surprise to see UK inflations tarting to fall back - from 3% in January to 2.7% in February. Forecasters were expecting price increases to ease back this year. But the rate of reduction is likely to remain slow and volatile. The fact that Easter is early this year could push inflation back up again in March. Sentance (a former Bank of England policymaker) also argues that UK interest rates could soon rise - even though inflationary pressures are easing. The UK recovery is now nearly nine years old, and yet our official interest rate is exactly where it was nine years ago. A further interest rate rise would be justified this Spring - which would show that the UK is following the lead of the US Federal Reserve in embarking on a policy of gradual and careful interest rate rises.\" This slowdown in inflation should bring some relief to poorer families, says Richard Lim of Retail Economics: \"Key areas driving the decline included transport and food which comprise a large chunk of expenditure, especially for the least affluent households. \"While real earnings remain in negative territory, the financial pinch will continue to ease and we expect growth to resurface by mid-2018.\" Jeremy Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst, predicts that UK pay rises could overtake inflation soon: \"Following the decision by the ONS to exclude pork pies and nightclub bottled lagers from the inflation basket, we will soon get to a point wherein the declines the pound suffered following the EU referendum go a similar way. CPI at 2.7% is the lowest since July of last year and while wages are hardly setting the world alight, we could be within a few months of real wages turning positive for the first time since the beginning of last year.\" British inflation seems to be falling back from its recent peak, says Suren Thiru of the British Chambers of Commerce: Economist Simon French of Panmure Gordon agrees that import price inflation is cooling. The BBC's Kamal Ahmed is optimistic that real wages will start rising soon. More detail: Petrol prices fell by 0.2 pence per litre between January and February, to 120.8 pence per litre in February. Food and non-alcoholic beverages prices rose by 0.1% between January and February this year compared with a rise of 0.8% a year ago. This drop in inflation suggests that the impact of the Brexit vote is finally fading. Transport and food has the biggest downward impact on inflation, according to the Office for National Statistics. It says: The largest downward contributions to the change in the rate came from transport and food prices, which rose by less than a year ago. Falling prices for accommodation services also had a downward effect. Rising prices for footwear produced the largest, partially offsetting, upward contribution. In recent months, import costs had been pushed by drop in sterling after the EU referendum in June 2016. That impact may now be easing. Breaking! UK inflation has fallen to its lowest since last July. The consumer prices index has fallen to 2.7% in February, from 3% in January, taking some pressure off hard-pressed households. It suggests that the squeeze in earnings is coming to an end, as wages rose by 2.8% per year in December (although by 2.5% in the October-December quarter). More to follow! Real wages in the UK have been falling since last spring, so the end of the cost of living squeeze can't come soon enough. New data from Barclaycard shows that 39% of people feel poorer than a year ago, due to rising inflation. Food and fuel prices are a key factor. Here's some details: two-thirds (67 per cent) say it is because their weekly shop seems more expensive than it used to be 41 per cent say filling up the car seems more expensive than it used to A fifth (21 per cent) say the cost of a night out or meal in a restaurant seems more expensive than it used to One in five (20 per cent) say that the cost of travelling on public transport has gone up Economist Sam Tombs predicts that today's inflation data will cut the chances that the Bank of England raises interest rates this spring. Just in: Europe's trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, is jetting to America to insist that the EU is excluded from the new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Malmstr\u00f6m, who has already threatened retaliatory action on American products, will meet with commerce secretary Wilbur Ross. However, US officials have already warned that president Trump will make the final decision, with a rather broad-brush approach: Economist Rupert Seggins is tweeting some handy charts about inflation: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain's inflation is in the spotlight today, and for the first time in months we might get some good news. Economists predict that the consumer prices index fell in February, from January's 3% to around 2.8% last month. If so, that would ease some of the pressure suffered by households since the pound slumped after the Brexit vote. The data is released at 9.30am - here's the situation last month: A fall in inflation would offer hopes that the cost of living squeeze might be ending. Wages rose by 2.5% per year in the last quarter, and by 2.8% in December alone. If that trend continues, it's possible that real wages might actually turn positive soon. Weaker inflation also takes some pressure off the Bank of England to raise interest rates, so today's report could move sterling. Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADS Securities, says: The British pound will be front and centre this morning in light of the release of the UK inflation report. The Consumer Price Index is the number one concern for the Bank of England as the rallying inflation has forced the British central bank to grow more hawkish and signal three rate hikes over the next three years. Today's report will be important in assessing when the first hike for this year will come. The Bank of England will set interest rates on Thursday (we're not expecting a hike, though). The ONS will also release its latest UK house price data (for January). Also coming up today.... The technology sector is reeling after Facebook was engulfed in the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Last night, around $36bn was wiped off Facebook's value, knocking $5.5bn off Mark Zuckerberg's personal wealth, as politicians demanded to know how the personal details of 50m Facebook users were harvested. As public anger mounts, Zuckerberg has been keeping a remarkably low profile. Parliament, though, wants answers. Conservative MP Damian Collins, chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee declared: \"It's time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page.\" Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets says investors have serious concerns: This is not the first time that Facebook have been caught being lax over their controls; both users and regulators are going to want this to be the last or at least see the firm go to extraordinary lengths to prevent incidences like this happening again. The next few weeks will be crucial as to how Facebook responds to the allegation. With Uber suspending its driverless-car testing after one of its vehicles hit and killed a woman in Arizona, big tech is under more scrutiny than ever. City traders will also be watching for the latest economic confidence figures from Germany, and consumer confidence across the eurozone. And in parliament, MPs will be quizzing top officials from Office of Budget Responsibility over last week's spring statement. including chairman Robert Chote.

Amazon wants to get any product to the customer fast and to `own' the customer for everything they possibly want to buy in their life and every way they want it delivered.''The investigation also comes as American authorities likewise are taking steps to reign in the growing power of large tech firms. </p><p>The U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are moving to investigate Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple over their aggressive business practices. In the U.S. Congress, the House Judiciary Committee has announced an antitrust probe, promising ``a top-to-bottom review of the market power held by giant tech platforms.''In Britain, authorities on Wednesday launched a ``digital markets strategy,'' to respond to online platforms and to make the U.K. competition rules fit for the modern age. It says it will cooperate with authorities in other countries to ``consider the need for new approaches.''In the case of Amazon's deal, British authorities will be looking into whether Deliveroo's partnerships with grocers like the Co-Op might signal an intention to build food delivery services beyond the core Deliveroo model at the moment, which is the delivery of food-to-go from restaurants and cafes. Kar added that the watchdog would be looking at whether the investment Amazon made into Deliveroo would give the tech titan the right to determine strategy and investment.The exact amount of money Amazon spent on the stake is unclear, but Deliveroo's last fundraising round brought in 450 million pounds ($564 million) from multiple investors, with Amazon becoming the largest.The CMA could block any deal, as it did recently by halting the attempted supermarket merger of Sainsbury's and Walmart's Asda unit. The watchdog concluded that the creation of the country's biggest supermarket would push up prices and reduce quality for shoppers.Both Amazon and Deliveroo pledged Friday to work closely with regulators.``There are a number of major companies within the restaurant food delivery sector and this investment will enable Deliveroo to expand, innovate and, we believe, will enhance competition,'' Deliveroo said in a statement.Amazon says the expansion will benefit consumers by increasing choice and by ``creating new jobs as more restaurants gain access to the service.'' </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDBLG-USGFDAGFDAG10AS1309121562339398127251764100177</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FDAG10AS-130912</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WGY-K5X1-JB5Y-N41F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">405244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"611\"/><timeReceived>3:09 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Federal NewsFeed <br/>Voice of America</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 5, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0008DC5</classCode><className>LINKLATERS LLP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS541110 OFFICES OF LAWYERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC8111 LEGAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Continue reading U.K. investigates multi-billion dollar deal between Apple and Google</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Apple is being looked at closely by U.S. and European regulators for possibly violating antitrust laws concerning the App Store. Apple doesn t allow iOS and iPadOS users to sideload apps from    a third-party app store, but by taking a 30% cut of in-app purchases, Apple is forcing some developers to raise their pricing in order to keep their margins up. A good example of this is Spotify    which competes against Apple Music. Online, both charge the same $9.99 per month for an individual subscription and $14.99 for a family subscription of up to six members.</p><h>Google s payments to Apple are being investigated as anti-competitive</h><p>If you look at Spotify s pricing in the iOS App Storefront, you ll see that the prices have been hiked by 30% to make up for Apple s cut. But new Spotify subscribers cannot sign up for the    service via the App Store. The higher pricing only comes into play for renewals that go through Apple s in-app payment system. Spotify subscribers have to cancel their automatic renewals through    Apple and sign up with Spotify and that gives Apple Music an unfair advantage over its main rival.Apple could be forced by the U.K. to include screens like this one so that users can select an alternative search engine Wednesday, Reuters reported    that the U.K. markets regulator is investigating the payments made to Apple by Google that keep the latter s Search app the default on iOS. In a report released yesterday, the U.K. markets    regulator said that these payments create a significant barrier to entry and expansion.  Last year, Google reportedly paid out the equivalent of $1.5 billion to be the default search engine on    various devices with Apple receiving the bulk of that money. The final report of the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority, which was investigating online platforms and digital advertising,    found that Google s search rivals such as Microsoft s Bing, Verizon s Yahoo, and independent search engine Duck Duck Go are being harmed by Google s payments to Apple. However, those three search    engines also pay Apple to be listed as search engine options for the iPhone (just not close to the amount paid by Google). Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein, said earlier this year that    Apple receives about $9 billion per year in licensing deals with gross margins above 90%. Over $7 billion of that figure comes from payments made by Google. These payments are reported as    Services revenue by Apple; the company had previously set a target of $50 billion in such revenue for this year, double the $25 billion in Services revenue it took in back in fiscal year 2016.    Other businesses in this segment include Apple Pay, the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, AppleCare+, iCloud, and more. In the report, the Competition and Markets Authority said that it would    pass along a range of options to the enforcement authorities. One of these options would require Apple to include a  choice screen  when a new iPhone is being setup. This is something that Google    offered users last year after the European Commission (EC) found that the company was being anti-competitive by requiring phone manufacturers to install Chrome and Search as the default browser    and search engine on Android phones. The report also suggested that Apple s ability to monetize its default apps be restricted. This would be  very costly  Apple told the regulators. Apple    decided to focus on its Services business just as iPhone sales had peaked in fiscal year 2015. During the first half of fiscal year 2020, Apple generated Services revenue of $26 billion which    puts the company slightly ahead of its target for the Services business. The fiscal third quarter of 2020 covers the period from April through June and should be announced in late July or early    August. Fiscal-fourth quarter earnings, which includes the three months between July through September, could be released in late October or early November. Big Tech is under the microscope in    the U.S. and Europe with anti-competitive behavior at the top of investigators  lists.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Campaign:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.phonearena.com/news/google-pays-apple-huge-sums-for-placement-of-search_id125685\">https://www.phonearena.com/news/google-pays-apple-huge-sums-for-placement-of-search_id125685</url><br/>Contact Information:<br/>Alan Friedman<br/><br/>Tags:<br/>, Wire, United States, English<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpsicrowdnewswirecomp2635539</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JV-M8P1-F08D-54YF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"781\"/><timeReceived>2:08 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 4, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Besides Britain, it also operates in several countries in Europe and Asia, including Germany, France, Italy and Australia.</p><p>The investigation comes as the regulator is taking a more activist role in seeking to protect consumers in an evolving marketplace.</p><p>\"This type of deal is right in the CMA's area of interest at the moment - large tech incumbents like Amazon investing in smaller rivals - so called 'killer acquisitions,'\" said Nicole Kar, head of the London Competition Practice at law firm Linklaters.</p><p>\"You might not think there is much competition between Deliveroo and Amazon right at present given Deliveroo is very focused on food delivery but that's too simplistic. Amazon wants to get any product to the customer fast and to 'own' the customer for everything they possibly want to buy in their life and every way they want it delivered.\"</p><p>American authorities are likewise taking steps to reign in the growing power of large tech firms. The U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are moving to investigate Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple over their aggressive business practices. In the U.S. Congress, the House Judiciary Committee has announced an antitrust probe, promising \"a top-to-bottom review of the market power held by giant tech platforms.\"</p><p>In the U.K., observers have noted a change of direction at the CMA since Chair Andrew Tyrie took over last year. From the moment he started Tyrie has promised to play a crucial role in Britain's global competitiveness.</p><p>But even so, the decisions this week marked a change of tone, if not direction.</p><p>\"The CMA's move comes as a surprise and suggests that the new regime is much more interventionalist than in the past,\" said Clive Black, the head of research at financial firm Shore Capital. \"As well as the focus upon an investment as opposed to a total take-over, this move by the regulator may also spell a change of view around mega-tech and their expansion in the U.K.\"</p><p>British authorities on Wednesday launched a \"digital markets strategy,\" to respond to online platforms and to make the U.K. competition rules fit for the modern age.</p><p>In the case of Amazon's deal, British authorities will be looking into whether Deliveroo's partnerships with grocers like the Co-Op might signal an intention to build food delivery services beyond the core Deliveroo model at the moment, which is the delivery of food-to-go from restaurants and cafes. Kar added that the watchdog would be looking at whether the investment Amazon made into Deliveroo would give the tech titan the right to determine strategy and investment.</p><p>The exact amount of money Amazon spent on the stake is unclear, but Deliveroo's last fundraising round brought in 450 million pounds ($564 million) from multiple investors, with Amazon becoming the largest.</p><p>The CMA could block any deal, as it did recently by halting the attempted supermarket merger of Sainsbury's and Walmart's Asda unit. The watchdog concluded that the creation of the country's biggest supermarket would push up prices and reduce quality for shoppers.</p><p>Both Amazon and Deliveroo pledged Friday to work closely with regulators.</p><p>\"There are a number of major companies within the restaurant food delivery sector and this investment will enable Deliveroo to expand, innovate and, we believe, will enhance competition,\" Deliveroo said in a statement.</p><p>Amazon says the expansion will benefit consumers by increasing choice and by \"creating new jobs as more restaurants gain access to the service.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-e6056001201d4939a95489c874cba764</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WH2-XT91-JC65-50R7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"686\"/><timeReceived>2:50 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 5, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Besides Britain, it also operates in several countries in Europe and Asia, including Germany, France, Italy and Australia.</p><p>The investigation comes as the regulator is taking a more activist role in seeking to protect consumers in an evolving marketplace.</p><p>\"This type of deal is right in the CMA's area of interest at the moment - large tech incumbents like Amazon investing in smaller rivals - so called 'killer acquisitions,'\" said Nicole Kar, head of the London Competition Practice at law firm Linklaters.</p><p>\"You might not think there is much competition between Deliveroo and Amazon right at present given Deliveroo is very focused on food delivery but that's too simplistic. Amazon wants to get any product to the customer fast and to 'own' the customer for everything they possibly want to buy in their life and every way they want it delivered.\"</p><p>American authorities are likewise taking steps to reign in the growing power of large tech firms. The U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are moving to investigate Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple over their aggressive business practices. In the U.S. Congress, the House Judiciary Committee has announced an antitrust probe, promising \"a top-to-bottom review of the market power held by giant tech platforms.\"</p><p>In the U.K., observers have noted a change of direction at the CMA since Chair Andrew Tyrie took over last year. From the moment he started Tyrie has promised to play a crucial role in Britain's global competitiveness.</p><p>But even so, the decisions this week marked a change of tone, if not direction.</p><p>\"The CMA's move comes as a surprise and suggests that the new regime is much more interventionalist than in the past,\" said Clive Black, the head of research at financial firm Shore Capital. \"As well as the focus upon an investment as opposed to a total take-over, this move by the regulator may also spell a change of view around mega-tech and their expansion in the U.K.\"</p><p>British authorities on Wednesday launched a \"digital markets strategy,\" to respond to online platforms and to make the U.K. competition rules fit for the modern age.</p><p>In the case of Amazon's deal, British authorities will be looking into whether Deliveroo's partnerships with grocers like the Co-Op might signal an intention to build food delivery services beyond the core Deliveroo model at the moment, which is the delivery of food-to-go from restaurants and cafes. Kar added that the watchdog would be looking at whether the investment Amazon made into Deliveroo would give the tech titan the right to determine strategy and investment.</p><p>The exact amount of money Amazon spent on the stake is unclear, but Deliveroo's last fundraising round brought in 450 million pounds ($564 million) from multiple investors, with Amazon becoming the largest.</p><p>The CMA could block any deal, as it did recently by halting the attempted supermarket merger of Sainsbury's and Walmart's Asda unit. The watchdog concluded that the creation of the country's biggest supermarket would push up prices and reduce quality for shoppers.</p><p>Both Amazon and Deliveroo pledged Friday to work closely with regulators.</p><p>\"There are a number of major companies within the restaurant food delivery sector and this investment will enable Deliveroo to expand, innovate and, we believe, will enhance competition,\" Deliveroo said in a statement.</p><p>Amazon says the expansion will benefit consumers by increasing choice and by \"creating new jobs as more restaurants gain access to the service.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-e6056001201d4939a95489c874cba764</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WH2-XX21-DYN6-W2S3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"686\"/><timeReceived>2:50 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 5, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Kar added that the watchdog would be looking at whether the investment Amazon made into Deliveroo would give the tech titan the right to determine strategy and investment.</p><p>The exact amount of money Amazon spent on the stake is unclear, but Deliveroo's last fundraising round brought in 450 million pounds ($564 million) from multiple investors, with Amazon becoming the largest.</p><p>The CMA could block any deal, as it did recently by halting the attempted supermarket merger of Sainsbury's and Walmart's Asda unit.

From the moment he started Tyrie has promised to play a crucial role in Britain's global competitiveness.</p><p>But even so, the decisions this week marked a change of tone, if not direction.</p><p>\"The CMA's move comes as a surprise and suggests that the new regime is much more interventionalist than in the past,\" said Clive Black, the head of research at financial firm Shore Capital. \"As well as the focus upon an investment as opposed to a total take-over, this move by the regulator may also spell a change of view around mega-tech and their expansion in the U.K.\"</p><p>British authorities on Wednesday launched a \"digital markets strategy,\" to respond to online platforms and to make the U.K. competition rules fit for the modern age.</p><p>In the case of Amazon's deal, British authorities will be looking into whether Deliveroo's partnerships with grocers like the Co-Op might signal an intention to build food delivery services beyond the core Deliveroo model at the moment, which is the delivery of food-to-go from restaurants and cafes. Kar added that the watchdog would be looking at whether the investment Amazon made into Deliveroo would give the tech titan the right to determine strategy and investment.</p><p>The exact amount of money Amazon spent on the stake is unclear, but Deliveroo's last fundraising round brought in 450 million pounds ($564 million) from multiple investors, with Amazon becoming the largest.</p><p>The CMA could block any deal, as it did recently by halting the attempted supermarket merger of Sainsbury's and Walmart's Asda unit. The watchdog concluded that the creation of the country's biggest supermarket would push up prices and reduce quality for shoppers.</p><p>Both Amazon and Deliveroo pledged Friday to work closely with regulators.</p><p>\"There are a number of major companies within the restaurant food delivery sector and this investment will enable Deliveroo to expand, innovate and, we believe, will enhance competition,\" Deliveroo said in a statement.</p><p>Amazon says the expansion will benefit consumers by increasing choice and by \"creating new jobs as more restaurants gain access to the service.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-e6056001201d4939a95489c874cba764</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WGX-9661-JBVR-301G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"685\"/><timeReceived>10:50 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 5, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The committee obtained the documents late last year from a small app company called Six4Three that is behind the suit.</p><p>According to the committee, the documents show that Facebook was \"willing to override its users' privacy settings in order to transfer data\" to app developers. The lawmakers also claim the documents show the social network was able to \"starve\" some developers of data and force them out of business. </p><p>\"Companies like Facebook should not be allowed to behave like 'digital gangsters' in the online world, considering themselves to be ahead of and beyond the law,\" the report said.</p><p>In response to the report, Facebook said it had not breached data protection or competition laws. Karim Palant, Facebook's UK public policy manager, said in a statement that the company \"supports effective privacy legislation\" and is also open to \"meaningful regulation.\"</p><p>Facebook said in December that the documents from the Six4Three lawsuit had been \"selectively leaked\" to tell \"only one side of the story.\" CNN and other news outlets had asked the California court to make the documents public.</p><p>The allegations are the latest headache for the social media giant, which has come under intense scrutiny from policymakers in the United States and around the world following a series of data scandals including Cambridge Analytica. </p><p>Overhaul needed</p><p>While Facebook was a major focus of the report, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee made several recommendations on how to combat fake news and disinformation.</p><p>The committee said:</p><p>Social media platforms should be subject to a compulsory code of ethics. An independent UK regulator should monitor tech companies, and be able to launch legal proceedings against them. UK antitrust regulators should conduct a \"comprehensive audit\" of the advertising market on social media. UK regulators should investigate whether Facebook has been involved in anti-competitive practices. The government should examine recent elections for evidence of voter manipulation.</p><p>The committee's investigation lasted 18 months and featured nearly two dozen oral evidence sessions, including a special hearing in Washington, D.C. and an \"international grand committee\" attended by representatives of nine countries. The final report ran to over 100 pages. </p><p>\"The big tech companies must not be allowed to expand exponentially, without constraint or proper regulatory oversight,\" the report stated. \"Only governments and the law are powerful enough to contain them.\"</p><p>Target: Facebook</p><p>The report harshly criticized Facebook and Zuckerberg, who repeatedly refused to appear before the committee last year despite numerous requests. </p><p>\"The management structure of Facebook is opaque to those outside the business and this seemed to be designed to conceal knowledge of and responsibility for specific decisions,\" the report said. \"Facebook used the strategy of sending witnesses who they said were the most appropriate representatives, yet had not been properly briefed on crucial issues, and could not or chose not to answer many of our questions.\"</p><p>The report's authors said they had \"no doubt that this strategy was deliberate.\"</p><p>Damian Collins, the committee's chair, said in a statement that Zuckerberg \"continually fails to show the levels of leadership and personal responsibility that should be expected from someone who sits at the top of one of the world's biggest companies.\"</p><p>British authorities ruled last year that Facebook broke UK law by failing to safeguard user data, and by not telling tens of millions of people how Cambridge Analytica harvested their information for use in political campaigns.</p><p>Facebook's response</p><p>Palant, the Facebook public policy manager, said that the company shares the committee's \"concerns about false news and election integrity\" and that it had made \"a significant contribution to their investigation\" by answering more than 700 questions.</p><p>Palant also highlighted the \"substantial changes\" to political advertising standards the company has undertaken. </p><p>\"No other channel for political advertising is as transparent and offers the tools that we do,\" said Palant. \"We have tripled the size of the team working to detect and protect users from bad content to 30,000 people and invested heavily in machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision technology to help prevent this type of abuse.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

They concluded that the United Kingdom should adopt new regulations so lawmakers can hold Facebook and its tech peers in Silicon Valley accountable for digital misdeeds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Companies like Facebook should not be allowed to behave like 'digital gangsters' in the online world,\" U.K. lawmakers said in their report, \"considering themselves to be ahead of and beyond the law.\"</p><p>Citing once-secret documents obtained during the investigation, U.K. leaders alleged that Facebook for years was willing to \"override its users' privacy settings\" as part of a broader campaign to maximize revenue derived from such sensitive information.</p><p>In the process, members of Parliament said, Facebook deliberately put its competitors at a disadvantage by limiting access to the site and users' valuable data. Lawmakers resolved that the U.K. government should investigate whether \"Facebook is unfairly using its dominant market position in social media to decide which businesses should succeed or fail,\" the report said.</p><p>In a statement, Facebook said it had made considerable changes to its business practices and supported privacy regulation - but the company denied that it had broken laws in the country.</p><p>\"While we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago,\" said Karim Palant, public policy manager for Facebook in the United Kingdom.</p><p>The call from Parliament for further scrutiny of Facebook adds to the tech giant's mounting legal and political woes globally, escalating the potential for fines and other penalties. There have been demands for additional probes throughout Europe, where regulators have new rules at their disposal promising strict punishments for companies that violate citizens' privacy. In the United States, Facebook is under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, which is weighing whether the firm ran afoul of a 2011 agreement it brokered with the U.S. government to improve its privacy practices. Both sides are in early talks about a new settlement that may require the tech giant to pay a multibillion-dollar fine.</p><p>\"These last 12 months really have been a period of investigation and discovery,\" said Damian Collins, the U.K. lawmaker who leads the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee in the House of Commons. \"But I think the year ahead has to be a year of action.\"</p><p>In 2017, Collins' panel set out to study social media broadly - including data that companies, including Facebook, collect online and their approach to handling the rise of misinformation across the web. British lawmakers were particularly unnerved that Russian agents had weaponized Facebook and other online platforms to spread falsehoods during the U.S. election in 2016 and the U.K. referendum on EU membership that same year. And many in Britain expressed horror after later reports about Facebook's entanglement with Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that improperly accessed data on 87 million users.</p><p>In response, Collins and his committee stressed Sunday the need for new regulations targeting social media, including rules that would require Facebook and other tech companies to take swift action to remove harmful or illegal content online. A similar law has been implemented in Germany and has been proposed elsewhere in Europe; in Britain, lawmakers used their report to endorse the idea of an independent regulator with powers to probe tech giants and issue \"large fines\" for those that don't comply.</p><p>\"The big tech companies must not be allowed to expand exponentially, without constraint or proper regulatory oversight. But only governments and the law are powerful enough to contain them,\" U.K. lawmakers said.</p><p>Even under existing laws, however, British parliamentarians said, they believed Facebook repeatedly broke the rules.</p><p>U.K. lawmakers faulted Facebook for granting major companies - including Airbnb, Lyft and Netflix - special access to data about Facebook's users and their friends in a way that may have been unclear to them. Facebook's leaders previously have said they were transparent about such practices, which date back to 2013. U.K. leaders learned about the arrangement through once-secret documents obtained from Six4Three, an app developer that has sued Facebook in the United States.</p><p>Those documents also reveal the thinking at Facebook as executives changed rules, beginning in 2014, to cut off developers' access to users' posts, photos and other profile information. Early communications - from a period when Facebook sought to leverage the rise of smartphones - showed company officials discussing whether they should force some outside developers to purchase a certain amount in ads each year to access Facebook data.</p><p>U.K. lawmakers said the arrangement warrants a new probe by the country's top data-protection regulator, focused on \"the practices of the Facebook platform, its use of users' and users' friends' data, and the use of 'reciprocity' of the sharing of data.\" Previously, Facebook has said it never sold users' information and that the documents don't fully reflect the company's deliberations.</p><p>Other records show how Facebook monitored its competitors, including Vine, the since-shuttered video-streaming app. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg endorsed cutting off Vine's access to Facebook data, according to an email released by U.K. leaders. A newer set of documents, made public Sunday, evinces that Facebook executives had been concerned as early as 2011 about the company's approach to handling third-party apps, U.K. officials said.</p><p>In calling for privacy and antitrust investigations, Collins said in an interview Sunday that Britain planned to continue probing Facebook and other tech companies. He reiterated his threat to force Zuckerberg to testify before Parliament if he ever travels to Britain, a statement Collins first made after the Facebook executive repeatedly declined to appear at hearings last year.</p><p>Collins also pledged that he and his counterparts from nine countries - which signed an international pact to cooperate on social media regulation in 2018 - would gather again in May amid rising international frustrations with Facebook and other tech giants in Silicon Valley.</p><p>\"We'll seek to look more widely at some of these ethical issues affecting technology companies,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AUGCHR-19021819313433</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AUGCHR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VFP-KCC1-JBM5-M368-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156942</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1113\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gatehouse Media LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Augusta Chronicle (Georgia)</publicationName><edition>ALL EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 18, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Facebook and call for more regulation</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook intentionally breached data privacy and competition law and should, along with other big tech firms, be subject to a new regulator to protect democracy and citizens' rights, British lawmakers said on Monday.</p><p>In a damning report that singled out Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for what it said was a failure of leadership and personal responsibility, the British parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee said tech giants had proved ineffective in stopping harmful content on their platforms, Reuters reports.</p><p>This included disinformation, attempts by foreign countries to influence elections, and risks to personal data.</p><p>\"We need a radical shift in the balance of power between the platforms and the people,\" committee chairman Damian Collins was quoted as saying.</p><p>The age of inadequate self-regulation must end, Collins said, following an 18-month investigation that concluded Facebook had \"intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws.\"</p><p>\"The rights of the citizen need to be established in statute, by requiring the tech companies to adhere to a code of conduct written into law by Parliament, and overseen by an independent regulator,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook rejected the suggestion it had breached data protection and competition laws, and said it shared the committee's concerns about false news and election integrity.</p><p>\"We are open to meaningful regulation and support the committee's recommendation for electoral law reform,\" Facebook's UK public policy manager Karim Palant said.</p><p>\"We also support effective privacy legislation that holds companies to high standards in their use of data and transparency for users.\"</p><p>Lawmakers in Europe and the United States are scrambling to get to grips with the risks posed by big tech companies regulating the platforms used by billions of people.</p><p>US senator Marco Rubio introduced a bill last month aimed at giving Americans more control over data collected by online companies like Facebook and Google.</p><p>The British committee does not propose legislation, but does have the power to summon witnesses for its investigations.</p><p>Facebook became the focus of its inquiry after whistleblower Christopher Wylie alleged that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica had obtained the data of millions of users of the social network.</p><p>Zuckerberg apologized last year for a \"breach of trust\" over the scandal.</p><p>But he refused to appear three times before British lawmakers, a stance that showed \"contempt\" toward parliament and the members of nine legislatures from around the world, the committee said.</p><p>\"We believe that in its evidence to the committee Facebook has often deliberately sought to frustrate our work, by giving incomplete, disingenuous and at times misleading answers to our questions,\" Collins said.</p><p>\"Mark Zuckerberg continually fails to show the levels of leadership and personal responsibility that should be expected from someone who sits at the top of one of the world's biggest companies.\"</p><p>Facebook, however, said it had cooperated with the investigation by answering more than 700 questions and putting forward four senior executives to give evidence.</p><p>It said it had made substantial changes, including the authorization of every political advert, and that it is investing heavily in identifying abusive content.</p><p>\"While we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago,\" Palant said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Earlier this month, it ordered Facebook to curb its data collection practices in the country.<br/><br/>US senator Marco Rubio introduced a bill last month aimed at giving Americans more control over data collected by online companies like Facebook and Alphabet\u2019s Google.<br/><br/>The British committee does not propose legislation, but does have the power to summon witnesses for its investigations.<br/><br/>Facebook became the focus of its inquiry after whistleblower Christopher Wylie alleged that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica had obtained the data of millions of users of the social network.<br/><br/>Zuckerberg apologized last year for a \u201cbreach of trust\u201d over the scandal.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The cap could also cover popular online games, such as Fortnite.</p><p>It is understood the length of any limit would be decided following a public consultation this month, but it is likely to be no more than three hours a day, and could be as little as two.</p><p>One alternative to this would be to simply offer guidance to parents on daily usage. But the UK Culture Secretary Matt Hancock appears to favour an altogether tougher line, saying: 'My instinct is that parental controls don't work unless they have a strong backstop behind them.' He said ministers were also looking at ways to enforce the age limits that firms such as Facebook and Twitter claim to use.</p><p>Mr Hancock said existing age restrictions had 'no credibility whatsoever'.</p><p>A new code of conduct for social media firms, covering issues such as bullying and online abuse, is also going to be put into law in the UK. Firms including Facebook and YouTube will be required to take down offensive material immediately.</p><p>The proposals will be backed by the threat of fines of up to \u00a31billion ((EURO)1.14billion).</p><p>Mr Hancock said: 'People increasingly live their lives through online platforms, so it's more important than ever that people are safe and parents have confidence they can keep their children from harm.' His deputy, Margot James, said big tech firms were failing to deal with abusive material online and added that this was 'highly irresponsible'.</p><p>The Children's Charities Coalition of Internet Safety in the UK is also demanding a mandatory online safety code backed by an independent regulator.</p><p>In a momentous vote in Ireland earlier this month, Opposition TDs threw out Fine Gael plans to let tech firms exploit our children from the age of just 13.</p><p>A Fianna F\u00e1il and Labour amendment - backed by Sinn F\u00e9in and some Independent TDs - dealt a fatal blow to the Government plan as the D\u00e1il set the digital age of consent at 16.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Education Minister Richard Bruton has told schools they must consult students and parents about a smartphone policy as soon as possible. Mr Bruton's department issued a circular yesterday to every primary and secondary school, ordering them to decide policy for smartphones and tablets.</p><p>The policy will be written into an upcoming Education Bill.</p><p>See Comment, Page 14</p><p>michelle.o'<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:keeffe@dailymail.ie\">keeffe@dailymail.ie</email></p><p>Charities: It won't work</p><p>THE UK Government is planning to make technology companies verify online users ages - despite children's charities here claiming it could not be done.</p><p>Yesterday the Irish Society of the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and the Children's Rights Alliance claimed the digital age of consent of 16 was 'unworkable' as children lie about their age online and tech companies age verification technologies are too weak. Ministers in the UK are proposing tech giants will have to enforce the age limits that firms such as Facebook and Twitter claim to use.</p><p>They said the tech firms could have to verify the users ages with parents before they can open an account with firms such as Facebook and Twitter.</p><p>Meanwhile, the children's organisations here have argued that raising the digital age of consent to 16 would remove the burden off companies to implement more robust verification - and place the onus back on children and their parents.</p><p>The ISPCC's chief executive Gr\u00e1inne Long previously described the plan to protect children up to the age of 16 as 'unworkable'.</p><p>The ISPCC campaigned to have the digital age of consent set at 13.</p><p>Facebook's head of public policy Niamh Sweeney previously defended the company saying that verifying the ages of children online was 'technologically difficult'.</p><p>Prominent cyberpsychologist Dr Mary Aiken has backed the digital age of consent being set at 16 saying that a digital age of consent of 13 'leaves children very vulnerable' . The major crackdown in the UK was announced yesterday by culture secretary Matt Hancock.</p><p>Data Bill debated in Seanad</p><p>THE Seanad was the scene of a lively discussion yesterday evening on the amendments made to the Data Protection Bill, as the proposed legislation enters its final stages.</p><p>This includes the amendment made in the D\u00e1il last Wednesday to set the digital age of consent at 16.</p><p>The senators tabled a motion for the 'earlier signature of the Data Protection Bill' by President Michael D Higgins.</p><p>A spokesman for Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan said last week that no further amendments are likely from the Government.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Worries: Mary AikenCrackdown: UK minister Matt Hancock favours tougher stance on child safety</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ISHDLY-137810604</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ISHDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SCN-D531-DY9P-N1MD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">396797</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"954\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Irish Daily Mail - Associated Newspapers Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Daily Mail</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18035\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 22, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Ireland</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at foreign exchange firm Monex Europe, says:</p><p>Enhanced forward guidance and tweaks to asset purchases will be the two main tools the FOMC are likely to consider ahead of tonight's meeting. The FOMC took a somewhat passive stance in June, discussing the enhancement of forward guidance but not taking the plunge. </p><p>Meeting minutes revealed that \"most participants\" were on board with the idea of more explicit forward guidance for the future path of policy, and there were signs that a consensus is beginning to emerge about its nature. Inflation outcomes were supported by a number of participants and are the natural starting point. In our view, enhanced forward guidance is likely at this meeting, with more aggressive measures such as yield curve control likely to be deployed later in the year.</p><p>block-time published-time 2.55pm BST </p><p>Britain's second-biggest pharmaceutical company GSK also reported second-quarter results at lunchtime. The firm, one of the biggest vaccine makers in the world, missed profit forecasts as sales of vaccines declined because fewer people went to the doctor's during the pandemic for fear of catching coronavirus.  </p><p> Also,  people had been stockpiling painkillers and respiratory drugs in the previous quarter, at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, but this tailed off between April and June. </p><p>Vaccine sales fell 29% to \u00a31.1bn in the three months to June, with sales of GSK's Shingrix shingles vaccine, a recent blockbuster, down to \u00a3323m. Overall turnover dropped 3% to \u00a37.6bn, while adjusted earnings fell 38% to 19.2p a share. GSK stuck to its 2020 forecast.</p><p>Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says:</p><p>Lockdowns and a focus on addressing immediate coronavirus needs have kept patients away from doctors surgeries, and that's had repercussions for GSK's vaccines business in particular. We hope vaccines will have been delayed rather than cancelled altogether, in which case revenues should eventually appear.</p><p>However, that's less true of consumer health division - which has also struggled. We worry a bit about the consumer business. It's got some good brands, but the tail is long and in recent years the division has lent heavily on a few standout performers - most notably Sensodyne. The recent Pfizer deal provides extra scale, and the vitamins portfolio looks like a strong performer, but we've yet to be convinced the division will be an attractive standalone option when it gets spun-off from GSK in a few years' time.</p><p>It would be remiss not to mention the work GSK's vaccines business is doing directly on Covid-19. It's not got a candidate of its own, but its vaccine technology is finding its way into several other candidates. Given the increased focus on vaccine preparedness that's likely to come out of this crisis, we suspect GSK's impressive vaccines operations will attract increased investor attention in the years ahead.</p><p>Earlier today, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jul/29/stocks-struggle-ahead-of-us-federal-reserve-decision-covid-19-business-live?page=with:block-5f214b218f080d953ea86b50#block-5f214b218f080d953ea86b50\">the UK government signed a deal with GSK and France's Sanofi-Pasteur for 60m doses of the potential Covid-19 vaccine</url> they are developing together. If the vaccine proves successful, the UK could begin to vaccinate priority groups, such as frontline health and social care workers and those at increased risk from coronavirus, as early as the first half of next year, the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said.</p><p>GSK has also made its adjuvant technology available to other organisations that are working on Covid-19 vaccines. It can help reduce the amount of antigen needed and so enable more vaccine doses to be made.</p><p>Emma Walmsley, GSK's chief executive, said on a media call:</p><p>We don't expect to profit from these vaccines partnerships during the pandemic phase, very specifically because we want to make sure we are investing any short-term returns back into long-term pandemic preparedness and donating to the developing world.</p><p>     A person receiving a vaccination.

Google owner Alphabet, Apple, Amazon and Facebook will report tomorrow.  </p><p>Spotify has said its back to business business as usual beating subscriber growth expectations in the second quarter as the number of hours users spent listening to music and podcasts returned to pre-Covid levels, reports our media business correspondent Mark Sweney. The company grew the total number of monthly users, those who listen for free and pay a subscription, by 29% year-on-year to (EURO)299m in the three months to the end of June. Paying subscribers, who bring in the lion's share of Spotify's income, grew 27% year-on-year to 138m. Both came in slightly above Wall Street expectations. \"We met or exceeded our guidance on almost every metric,\" said Daniel Ek, Spotify's founder. \"Usage returned to normal at the end of the quarter and we feel good about our momentum as we go into the third quarter.\" The company said that early in the quarter it had seen some \"Covid-related softness\" in some countries, with increases in payment failure from some subscribers, but that by June the business had \"rebounded\". Spotify has been impacted by advertisers freezing budgets as the world went into lockdown, with ad revenues falling 21% to (EURO)131m in the second quarter. However, the company said that they are coming back with June down just 10% year-on-year. The advertising slowdown had little impact on Spotify's overall business as it accounts for just a small fraction of its total (EURO)1.89bn revenues, which rose 13% year-on-year in the second quarter. Subscription revenues, the company's lifeblood, rose 17% to (EURO)1.76bn.</p><p>    The Spotify logo is displayed as the stock waits to begin selling as a direct listing on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, U.S., April 3, 2018.

But as the road to normal will be long, we doubt that the leap in money growth will lead to a surge in inflation.</p><p>[And] the legacy, of course, is that businesses are now lumbered with much more debt.</p><p>As the \u00a30.1bn fall in consumer credit was small relative to the average drop of \u00a35.2bn in the previous three months, it supports other evidence that  households have started to spend again.  That said, in the year before the crisis consumer credit rose by \u00a31.1bn a month, so spending remains well below normal. </p><p>Turning to lending to businesses, he notes:</p><p>As the extra \u00a3400m that firms borrowed from banks in June was much smaller than the huge \u00a333.8bn they added to their debt pile in March, the corporate sector as a whole is no longer leaning on banks as heavily. That said, small businesses were still scrambling for cash. They borrowed an additional \u00a310.7bn from banks in June, the bulk of which came through the government's loan schemes. </p><p>And while large businesses reduced their bank loans by \u00a318.2bn, they sourced an extra \u00a310.6bn of finance from the financial markets. But even the latter was smaller than the \u00a318.1bn they acquired in April. So while businesses are still taking on more debt, they are doing it at a slower pace than in March or April. </p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 12.06pm BST</p><p>block-time published-time 11.54am BST </p><p>Analysts at Barclays have released a note on potential Covid-19 vaccines, saying that they are showing promise, but they cautioned:</p><p>A working vaccine may still be 6-12 months away and getting it to enough people to make a difference may taken even longer.</p><p>Here is our latest story on efforts to develop vaccines for the deadly virus:</p><p> Related:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jul/29/stocks-struggle-ahead-of-us-federal-reserve-decision-covid-19-business-live?page=with:block-5f214b218f080d953ea86b50#block-5f214b218f080d953ea86b50\">Coronavirus: UK signs deal for 60m doses of potential vaccine</url></p><p>block-time published-time 11.47am BST </p><p> On the Covid-19 front, an attempt by Swiss pharmaceutical firm Roche to repurpose its rheumatoid arthritis drug Actemra to treat patients hospitalised with severe Covid-19-related pneumonia has failed in a late-stage trial.  </p><p>Roche launched the trial involving 330 patients in March as it joined other pharmaceutical companies seeking to repurpose existing medicines to fight the pandemic. </p><p>The company said:</p><p>The COVACTA trial did not meet its primary end-point of improved clinical status in patients with Covid-19 associated pneumonia, or the key secondary end-point of reduced patient mortality.</p><p>     A resident is taken from the Epping Hardens Aged Care Home on July 29, 2020 in Melbourne, Australia.

US policymakers will likely emphasise the lingering risks on the US economy and maintain an ultra-supportive monetary policy to provide support to its economy ravaged by the pandemic. </p><p>While investors will continue looking for clues regarding alternative policy tools, including the yield curve control, we do not expect to hear any material progress before September. While there is little room left for enhanced forward guidance, the Fed will follow a clear strategy to support lending and liquidity. The market already digested the Fed's endeavour to keep the short-term rates low for long. Combined with a solid fiscal support, the Fed won't move more dovish on its policy for now. </p><p>The US dollar has steadied somewhat after its recent slide, slipping 0.14% against a basket of currencies to 93.61. It's heading for its worst month in nine years. </p><p>There is still strong demand for precious metals, with spot gold at $1,957 an ounce, down 0.1%, and silver at $24.32, down 0.99%. Gold hit a new all-time high of $1,980 earlier this week.</p><p>On the corporate front, get ready for an earnings bonanza from the UK banks and US tech titans of Apple, Amazon, Google owner Alphabet, Facebook and Twitter in the next few days. Four of the big tech bosses - Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai - will appear in Congress today to answer questions about their power and business practices during an anti-trust grilling.</p><p>In the UK, Barclays has just released figures for the second quarter and first half. The bank has been forced to put aside another \u00a31.6bn the three months to June to cover bad debts as it prepares for an oncoming wave of customer defaults caused by the Covid-19 crisis, reports our banking correspondent Kalyeena Makortoff. The figure is higher than expected, and pushed pre-tax profits down 75% to \u00a3359m.</p><p>The economic calendar is light but this morning we'll be getting consumer credit and mortgage lending figures from the Bank of England for June, which are likely to paint a weak picture.</p><p> The Agenda </p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>9:30am BST: Bank of England lending figures for June</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>1:30pm BST: US trade for June</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>3pm BST: US Pending home sales for June</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>7pm BST: US Federal Reserve rate decision</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>7.30pm BST: US Fed chair Jerome Powell holds press conference</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 8.03am BST</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-64799326</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G2-7YJ1-JCJY-G1XX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5599\"/><timeReceived>7:43 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

His message is all too familiar to anyone who has followed the recent \"techlash\".\u00a0</p><p>These days the anti-tech rhetoric seems to come thick and fast. Recently the European Commission published its latest report on the threat of \"disinformation\", a term that encompasses everything from fake news to online manipulation.\u00a0</p><p>The UK Chancellor said last week he was consulting on taxing big tech companies more \"appropriately\" and even Sir Tim Berners-Lee, one of the founders of the web, has published a letter revealing his concern that it is being \"compressed\" by the few dominant platforms. Calls for better regulation are not going to evaporate.</p><p>Meanwhile, other nations have already moved more swiftly than the UK to regulate private internet companies. Last year Germany brought in regulation to fine technology firms for not dealing with hate speech quickly enough.\u00a0</p><p>Tough restrictions on freedom of speech on online platforms would sit uneasily in the UK, which has a proud history of free enterprise, technological innovation and open public forums. Yet without greater regulation, the current techlash is just the start.</p><p>Before people get seriously irritated by the way machines and algorithms control their lives we need to work out just what it is we want from these technologies. Regulation to both inspire innovation and protect citizens is required. \u00a0</p><p>                   What is Fintech?                   </p><p>Fortunately for the UK, this is an area in which we already excel. Our fast-growing fintech sector provides a great example of regulation that nurtures, rather than stifles.\u00a0</p><p>The UK Government has been a creative and adaptive regulator of tech in the financial services sector. It has worked with industry leaders, technology evangelists and regulatory bodies to build an accessible and evolving regulatory system.</p><p>Collaboration, investigation and partnership are the way forward. Organisations like the Financial Conduct Authority run innovation programmes and have launched a \"sandbox\", where new companies can run small tests to see whether their product has potential, while staying within consumer protections.</p><p>This proactive approach has resulted in open banking standards, a genuine step along the road to improving consumer experiences. Contrast this with the US, where outmoded regulation persists and powerful industry lobbies make innovation difficult.\u00a0</p><p>Fintech isn't the only sector where our regulation of new technology stands out. The connected and autonomous vehicles programme awards grants to joint partnerships experimenting in self-driving cars.</p><p>When it comes to an even greater challenge - artificial intelligence - the UK is also establishing the Centre for Data Ethics &amp; Innovation, which will provide insights into how the state can use this new technology to improve public services and the economy in a fair and ethical way.\u00a0</p><p>As Khan said in Texas, tech innovation is something that should serve us all. Tough regulation is not to be feared and it should help make private companies better at what they do. Now is the right time to take a tough line, before the techlash becomes an uprising.</p><p>If that happens, our opportunity to harness tech for good will slip away and we may find the rest of the world has left us behind.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-42385121</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RWN-04J1-F021-64KC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"629\"/><timeReceived>3:34 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 17, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

to prevent a handful of tech giants dominating people's lives for decades to come, a new report has said.</p><p>A study by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) claims six firms - Facebook, Google parent company Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix and Amazon - are gaining ever-increasing control over valuable information.</p><p>The IPPR's report says a new UK digital data regulator should be created to drive open access and common ownership of data.</p><p>It also urges better protection for particularly sensitive data, such as that derived from the NHS.</p><p>The report highlights that the combined value of the six mentioned tech giants has risen by more than 1.9 trillion dollars (\u00a31.4 trillion) since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, and argues that the Covid-19 outbreak has caused society to become even more dependent on data through remote working and increased medical surveillance to help fight the virus.</p><p>The report also suggests that this value increase among the biggest firms reflects the expectation that they stand to gain disproportionately from the shift to more data dependence.</p><p>James Meadway, associate fellow at IPPR and author of the report, said: ``Covid-19 risks further increasing the economic and social dominance of Big Tech, with stock market valuations skyrocketing as society becomes more dependent on data through homeworking and increased medical surveillance.</p><p>``This Covid effect means their power to affect and influence our daily lives is becoming increasingly removed from public control.</p><p>``It also represents a loss to us all, as most of the value of trillions of gigabytes of data, derived directly from us every year, is held privately by these companies instead of being available for the common good.</p><p>``We need to use the national regulation of data to develop a broader concept of a digital commons, with data derived from us held and used for the public good.</p><p>``A first step should be establishing a new Office for the Digital Commons, with the power to regulate big tech companies and enable shared and open-source use of our valuable data assets.''</p><p>The report calls for local authorities to push for data collected in their area to be made open and accessible in an anonymised form to help with other projects.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Delhi</location></nitf:dateline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> New Delhi, Mar. 19 -- Britain needs to overhaul its competition rules to tackle the dominance of tech giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon, and increase consumer choice, a government review said on Wednesday.</p><p><br/> A new competition unit with expertise in the sector should be set up, the independent review said, and innovation should be encouraged by giving people control over their own data so they could switch between rival services and platforms easily.<br/> Smaller companies should also have access to the data that social media platforms hold on their users, it recommended.<br/> Big tech has been criticised by politicians in the United States and in Europe in recent years over issues ranging from Facebook losing track of users' data to how Google ranks the results of searches.<br/>France, Italy, Britain and Spain have also proposed new digital taxes to narrow loopholes that allow large multinational firms to cut tax bills.<br/>Harvard professor Jason Furman, who chaired the British government review, said the digital sector had created substantial benefits but they had come at the cost of the increasing dominance of a few companies.<br/> \"My panel is outlining a balanced proposal to give people more control over their data, give small businesses more of a chance to enter and thrive, and create more predictability for the large digital companies,\" he said on Wednesday.<br/> \"These recommendations will deliver an economic boost driven by UK tech start-ups and innovation that will give consumers greater choice and protection.\"<br/> UK finance minister Philip Hammond, who will deliver a half-yearly update on the budget later on Wednesday, said he would set out government measures to ensure digital markets are competitive later this year.<br/>  TechUK, which represents more than 900 tech companies that collectively employ 700,000 people, said the report contained some positive suggestions, but it needed further detail on what any proposed code of conduct for big tech might look like.<br/>  It also said there had to be a full assessment of the risks and benefits of opening up data sets.<br/>  \"Bad regulation can be as big a barrier to competition and innovation as monopolistic activities,\" TechUK CEO Julian David said.<br/>  \"The UK must remain a welcoming place for digital business from around the world, and ensure that the UK competition and wider regulatory framework is not in conflict with the other leading digital economies with which we must compete.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

With the auspice of the newspaper industry's trade body, the News Media Association (NMA), local and national publishers are calling on the likes of Facebook and Google[1] to pay an annual financial levy to fund journalism. They also want a financial regulator to put the legal onus on tech companies for the content on their platforms amid social media's ongoing fake news[2] crisis (which could be implemented as soon as next year, according to The Guardian[3]).Newspapers claim the web platforms they rely upon to distribute their output in the digital era \"make no meaningful contribution to the cost of producing the original content.\" </p><p>Worse still, they claim the ad money that is their lifeblood is \"now flowing\" to those behind global search engines and News Feeds. Meanwhile, the British newspaper industry has seen its revenue almost halve from 6.8 billion ($8.9 billion) in 2007 to 3.6 billion ($4.7 billion).In addition, they seem to be throwing their support behind the EU's Article 11[4] copyright proposal (set to pass next year), which requires Facebook and Google et al. to pay a so-called \"link tax\" to publishers to share their content. The NMA also wants social media to promote \"bona fide\" news sources that meet a consistent quality of journalism (something Facebook[5], at least, is working toward). And it wants advance notice of tweaks to algorithms and terms of business that, as we've seen[6], can dramatically impact web traffic.The suggestions are in response to a government-backed review of the future of the British media industry, chaired by the economist Dame Frances Cairncross, with the aim of laying the groundwork for sustainable high-quality journalism in the UK.

Officials including Crawford Falconer, the UK's chief trade adviser, believe that implementing a US deal first would be a symbolic boost for Britain as it starts life outside the EU, according to department insiders. The UK government wants to negotiate deals with the US, EU, Australia, and New Zealand before the end of December when the Brexit transition period is due to finish. Talks with the US are set to get off to a rocky start after Washington reacted angrily to UK plans to impose a new digital services tax on big tech companies. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[1] Senior officials in the UK government are pushing for Boris Johnson to place a trade deal with Trump at the front of the line after Brexit. The UK is set to begin negotiating a new trade deal with Donald Trump's administration immediately after Britain leaves the European Union on January 31, with the aim of finalising some sort of arrangement by the end of 2020. However, the UK government also wants to secure a deal with the EU, as well as Australia and New Zealand, in that time. The UK Chancellor Sajid Javid said this week[2] that talks with the EU would come first, prompting US Trade Secretary Steve Mnuchin to say he was a \"little disappointed\" that US talks wouldn't be prioritised. However, two sources who have discussed the matter with Department for International Trade's officials said that while the department expects to wrap up deals with Australia and New Zealand first, they want a deal with the US to be the first signed into law. This, they told Business Insider, was because DIT officials, including Crawford Falconer, the UK's chief trade adviser, believe it would be a major symbolic moment for Britain as it enters a post-Brexit world, and would represent a victory for the UK government amid warnings about the difficulty of negotiating with the US. Johnson's Conservative government is keen to strike a deal with the US before the end of the Brexit transition period. UK negotiators are reportedly preparing [3]to begin trade talks with Washington before they begin talks with the EU. While the government has said it aims to secure a comprehensive trade deal with the US by the end of the year, it is thought to privately believe that a bare-bones agreement, designed to be built on in years to come, is more realistic. A Downing Street source said that the government had not yet produced a timetable for implementing prospective trade agreements. Business Insider has asked DIT for comment.US trade talks get off to a bumpy start The challenge of negotiating a deal with Trump's administration became greater in recent days after the US reacted angrily to UK government plans to introduce a digital services tax on big tech companies. Steven Mnuchin, the US treasury secretary, warned that[4] the US could retaliate by slapping tariffs on UK car exports to the US. Talks are expected to hit a flashpoint when focus turns to agriculture. The Trump administration has said it will prioritise greater access to the UK's agricultural markets, so it can sell more food and agriculture products to Britain. This has led to concerns that Johnson's government will accept US standards for food production \u2014 a well-known example of which being chlorine-washed chicken \u2014 in order to secure an agreement with Washington. Trade minister Conor Burns last week told MPs that the UK government would publish its objectives for trade talks with the US and other countries, \"at the start of new free trade agreement negotiations.\" Staunchly pro-Brexit Conservative MPs support prioritising a trade deal with the US, at least partly because doing so would probably take the UK closer to US regulations, and make it harder to negotiate close trading ties with the EU. Comments made by Chancellor Sajid Javid in a recent interview suggested that the UK government was paving the way to a closer regulatory relationship with the US once Britain departs the EU. Javid told the Financial Times that [5]there would \"not be alignment\" with the EU after Brexit.NOW WATCH: Extremists turned a frog meme into a hate symbol, but Hong Kong protesters revived it as an

Data provided by KPMG's pulse of fintech report[1] has allayed fears that Brexit would hurt the UK's startup scene, as venture capital firms have cemented the UK's position as a funding hot spot. Fintech investment across the world reached record levels over the last six months, taking in $57.9bn across 875 deals. </p><p>This was an increase of 34.2 per cent compared to the whole of 2017, which recorded just $38.1bn overall. 'The year has got off to an exceptionally strong start for the fintech sector,' said Anton Ruddenklau, KPMG Fintech's global co-lead. 'In addition to the bullish levels of investment the UK has attracted, our fintech sector has also benefitted from the government's continued support with the launch of the Fintech Sector Strategy.' UK-based firm Vantiv's acquisition of Worldpay for $12.9bn was the UK's biggest deal in the first half of the year, with Sweden leading other major buyouts in Europe including Izettle and Nordax Group. Investment in Asia surged from $2bn in the second half of 2017 to $16.8bn in the last six months, powered by Ant Financial's $14bn series C round. The US scored $14.2bn across 427 deals, losing out to the UK despite reaching a new high in quarterly venture capital investment in the last three months. In the UK, artificial intelligence and robotic process automation continued to be hot areas for investment, with regtech catching up thanks to the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation[2]. KPMG predicted that investment into European fintech will remain robust until the end of 2018, with investments increasing in regtech, wealth management and digital identification verification. Elsewhere, mature sectors like payments and lending could struggle as there is likely to be 'a significant amount of consolidation' over the next six to 12 months while larger platforms grow and others fail to scale. \u200b'The real impact of PSD2 and open banking has yet to be fully realised,' KPMG's head of technology Anna Scally added. 'In the months ahead we expect to see a rise in the number of business opportunities, with companies and big tech players more aggressively exploiting the data at their disposal. We should also see the emergence of new fintechs, leveraging a more level playing field and creating value.'

Can the latter be curbed without sacrificing the former?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Britain has an answer. A government-appointed panel of experts yesterday released a carefully calibrated proposal designed to contain big tech's threat to competition while keeping the government's hand on the industry and the internet as light as possible.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Led by Jason Furman, a Harvard University economist who previously chaired Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, the panel doesn't tackle Big Tech's effects on privacy, democracy and free speech. Instead, it sticks to the key economic test: do digital markets naturally \"tip\" to monopolists, who must therefore be broken up or regulated like utilities, as Senator Elizabeth Warren proposed last week and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon has advocated?</p><p>They conclude no. Treating them as utilities would take monopoly as a foregone conclusion. Instead, the Furman report recommends giving \"every chance for competition to succeed in digital markets, tackling the factors that lead to winner-takes-most outcomes and to that position becoming entrenched\".</p><p>Digital markets do have features that tip towards monopoly. \"Network effects\" make a platform more useful and appealing as more users are added. As they suck up growing volumes of data, they can refine and target their services in ways new entrants can't match.</p><p>Big tech's supporters point out numerous companies previously had similar advantages yet still succumbed to disruptive competition: AltaVista and Lycos in search, MySpace in social networking and Nokia in mobile phones.</p><p>The Furman report, however, notes that while AltaVista, Lycos and MySpace stayed on top for just a few years each, Google and Facebook have been there for more than a decade. Nokia was easier to topple because it didn't control an entire ecosystem of mobile apps as Apple and Google now do.</p><p>According to the report, today's leaders are more entrenched, thanks in part to strategies that enhance their dominance, such as acquiring potential future rivals in adjacent markets or investing in features designed primarily to keep out new market entrants rather than benefit consumers.</p><p>To counteract that, the Furman report recommends a new regulator, either independent or part of an existing agency, designate companies with \"strategic market status\" because of their sway over a sector or role as gatekeeper. The regulator would work with them to develop a code of conduct that, among other things, would bar them giving their products advantage over competitors' in search results, or excluding competing sellers from their platforms. It wouldn't dictate prices.</p><p>Large companies would also have to adopt open standards for user data such as their profile or purchase history, appropriately secured, to facilitate switching to competing firms. As a template, the report points to Britain's requirement that banks keep customer data in standardised format for third-party competitors to access.</p><p>The authors believe that such a code of conduct is a \"more targeted, more pro-business and pro-consumer solution\" than \"changing antitrust law to drive break-up or structural separation of dominant businesses\". And they argue Britain, like the US, should keep consumer welfare as the goal of competition policy.</p><p>Nonetheless, the report concludes antitrust enforcement has been lax. The five biggest tech companies have made more than 400 global acquisitions in the past decade, and none has been blocked in any jurisdiction; it's doubtful all were harmless.</p><p>The authors recommend antitrust authorities, when evaluating digital mergers, assign more weight to future consumer welfare. They suggest a \"balance of harms\" test: a small probability (say, 20 per cent) that the target could one day be a significant innovator and competitor to the acquirer would be enough to block the takeover.While Britain isn't home to any big tech companies, it can review mergers by any that do business there, giving it some sway beyond its borders. Britain's regulatory regimen could be a road map for others.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-0cefc70e45fd11e9a46a61f56c71df4b0a3911ed3e7daec55dff810fdf41fcef</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMV-FV71-F0JP-W50H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"704\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 15, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>HARVARD UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The effort is being watched by other countries hoping to better regulate pornographic content but has raised concerns about privacy, censorship and competition. It has run into multiple delays that reflect the confusion surrounding it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's a mess,\" said Jim Killock, of the London-based Open Rights Group, a digital civil liberties group.</p><p>Killock says the government's blueprints for its online \"porn block\" don't do enough to protect personal data. Others believe the plan amounts to economic censorship. And many fear the rules would effectively give more power to a little known company that dominates the internet porn industry.</p><p>Under the plan, which is now expected to come into force late this year, British porn site visitors will be asked to prove they are 18 or older. Options to do so would include buying a card with an access code in a shop, where they will have to show photo ID, or going online to submit a copy of a passport or driver's license or use a credit card.</p><p>The British government isn't operating the system itself. Instead, it's being outsourced to private companies, which can sell their own age verification technology to porn sites. Oversight, meanwhile, has been handed to the British Board of Film Classification, a film ratings and censorship body akin to the Motion Picture Association of America.</p><p>Privacy campaigners worry that handing over personal information to access adult sites means a person's porn viewing habits can be tracked. Those fears are compounded by the lack of privacy and security standards for age verification providers. Instead, there's a voluntary certification with vague and imprecise requirements.</p><p>One age verification provider, 18+, has said it won't apply for the certificate because its digital wallet system wouldn't be recognized.</p><p>\"There are huge privacy concerns with how the data will be held, because the sort of information that people will have to be giving up is highly personal,\" said Myles Jackman, a London-based lawyer. Also, \"there is a risk that that data will be hacked, breached, stolen or published in the public domain.\"</p><p>Critics point to data breaches at adult-oriented websites, notably a high-profile hack at infidelity site Ashley Madison that exposed personal details of millions of users.</p><p>They note that tech-savvy youngsters will figure out how to how to evade restriction by using, for example, virtual private networks. And there's a loophole exempting social media sites such as Twitter, where plenty of smutty content is now found.</p><p>The film board acknowledges that \"age-verification is not a silver bullet,\" but it will stop kids inadvertently coming across inappropriate material. \"Determined teenagers will find ways to access pornography.\"</p><p>There's also the question of how the new rules would be enforced on the many porn sites based outside the U.K. The film board says it could ask payment providers to withdraw their services and U.K. internet service providers to block them.</p><p>Jackman said the result could be \"economic censorship,\" because smaller, independent British porn producers that can't afford to comply would simply shut down.</p><p>Online porn is a huge industry, but estimates of its size are notoriously hard to come by and there's no official data. Pornhub, the world's most popular adult site, is the 16th most visited in the U.K., according to Amazon's Alexa web analytics .</p><p>Further raising concerns about the new system, one of the first age verification systems, AgeID, is owned by a multinational, MindGeek, which is widely recognized as the owner also of some of the most popular adult websites, including YouTube-like portals such as Pornhub, YouPorn and Redtube.</p><p>In response to a consultation by the film board, numerous people and groups said they were concerned that a company responsible for providing so much pornography online would also become a gatekeeper that potentially allows it access to reams of user data.</p><p>\"There's a clear conflict of interest,\" said Killock. \"The fact is they're effectively creating the Facebook login of porn,\" and will get \"vast market intelligence\" on their rivals and users on competing websites, said Killock, whose group in 2017 unearthed emails from MindGeek executives lobbying British officials to block rival porn sites.</p><p>Angie Rowntree, a director and founder of U.S. erotic site Sssh.com, said her company no longer uploads promo clips to Pornhub but many others continue to do business with MindGeek because its sites get an enormous amount of traffic.</p><p>\"There's a real risk of MindGeek monopolizing the U.K. segment of adult traffic to an even greater extent than they already do, by virtue of having some of the world's best known and most popular free porn sites,\" she said.</p><p>MindGeek spokesman Jim Clark says the company is merely responding to a market opening.</p><p>\"AgeID is not responsible for the creation of the law, nor is AgeID endorsed by the U.K. government. We have simply developed a product in response to the law,\" Clark said by email.</p><p>Clark said AgeID doesn't track users, has \"data minimization, security, and privacy at its core,\" and is designed not to see or store data, making it less tempting for hackers. And, he says, it won't be the only choice of age verification on MindGeek websites.</p><p>Other countries mulling regulation are watching Britain amid concerns that easy access to porn can warp children's view of sex.</p><p>Lawmakers in Ireland say they'll examine the British model, after two teenage boys were convicted last week of the murder of 14-year-old Ana Kriegel in a case that shocked the country. One boy was also convicted of violently sexually assaulting her and was found to have thousands of pornographic images on two mobile phones, news reports said.</p><p>Britain's porn firewall was set to take effect on July 15 but an administrative error delayed it by six months. The digital secretary, Jeremy Wright, vows it will eventually come into force.</p><p>\"There are also those who do not want those measures to be brought in at all,\" Wright told lawmakers. \"Age verification for online porn needs to happen.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-632fde45a57b4c318be323d76aea79a6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ4-STF1-JC65-5110-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1051\"/><timeReceived>9:26 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 10, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The effort is being watched by other countries hoping to better regulate pornographic content but has raised concerns about privacy, censorship and competition. It has run into multiple delays that reflect the confusion surrounding it.'It's a mess,' said Jim Killock, of the London-based Open Rights Group, a digital civil liberties group.Killock says the government's blueprints for its online 'porn block' don't do enough to protect personal data. </p><p>Others believe the plan amounts to economic censorship. And many fear the rules would effectively give more power to a little known company that dominates the internet porn industry.Under the plan, which is now expected to come into force late this year, British porn site visitors will be asked to prove they are 18 or older. Options to do so would include buying a card with an access code in a shop, where they will have to show photo ID, or going online to submit a copy of a passport or driver's license or use a credit card.The British government isn't operating the system itself. Instead, it's being outsourced to private companies, which can sell their own age verification technology to porn sites. Oversight, meanwhile, has been handed to the British Board of Film Classification, a film ratings and censorship body akin to the Motion Picture Association of America.AdvertisingPrivacy campaigners worry that handing over personal information to access adult sites means a person's porn viewing habits can be tracked. Those fears are compounded by the lack of privacy and security standards for age verification providers. Instead, there's a voluntary certification with vague and imprecise requirements.One age verification provider, 18+, has said it won't apply for the certificate because its digital wallet system wouldn't be recognized.'There are huge privacy concerns with how the data will be held, because the sort of information that people will have to be giving up is highly personal,' said Myles Jackman, a London-based lawyer. Also, 'there is a risk that that data will be hacked, breached, stolen or published in the public domain.'Critics point to data breaches at adult-oriented websites, notably a high-profile hack at infidelity site Ashley Madison that exposed personal details of millions of users.They note that tech-savvy youngsters will figure out how to how to evade restriction by using, for example, virtual private networks. And there's a loophole exempting social media sites such as Twitter, where plenty of smutty content is now found.The film board acknowledges that 'age-verification is not a silver bullet,' but it will stop kids inadvertently coming across inappropriate material. 'Determined teenagers will find ways to access pornography.'AdvertisingThere's also the question of how the new rules would be enforced on the many porn sites based outside the U.K. The film board says it could ask payment providers to withdraw their services and U.K. internet service providers to block them.Jackman said the result could be 'economic censorship,' because smaller, independent British porn producers that can't afford to comply would simply shut down.Online porn is a huge industry, but estimates of its size are notoriously hard to come by and there's no official data. Pornhub, the world's most popular adult site, is the 16th most visited in the U.K., according to Amazon's Alexa web analytics . Further raising concerns about the new system, one of the first age verification systems, AgeID, is owned by a multinational, MindGeek, which is widely recognized as the owner also of some of the most popular adult websites, including YouTube-like portals such as Pornhub, YouPorn and Redtube.In response to a consultation by the film board, numerous people and groups said they were concerned that a company responsible for providing so much pornography online would also become a gatekeeper that potentially allows it access to reams of user data.'There's a clear conflict of interest,' said Killock. 'The fact is they're effectively creating the Facebook login of porn,' and will get 'vast market intelligence' on their rivals and users on competing websites, said Killock, whose group in 2017 unearthed emails from MindGeek executives lobbying British officials to block rival porn sites. Angie Rowntree, a director and founder of U.S. erotic site Sssh.com, said her company no longer uploads promo clips to Pornhub but many others continue to do business with MindGeek because its sites get an enormous amount of traffic.'There's a real risk of MindGeek monopolizing the U.K. segment of adult traffic to an even greater extent than they already do, by virtue of having some of the world's best known and most popular free porn sites,' she said.MindGeek spokesman Jim Clark says the company is merely responding to a market opening. Most Read Business Stories 'AgeID is not responsible for the creation of the law, nor is AgeID endorsed by the U.K. government. We have simply developed a product in response to the law,' Clark said by email.Clark said AgeID doesn't track users, has 'data minimization, security, and privacy at its core,' and is designed not to see or store data, making it less tempting for hackers. And, he says, it won't be the only choice of age verification on MindGeek websites.Other countries mulling regulation are watching Britain amid concerns that easy access to porn can warp children's view of sex.AdvertisingLawmakers in Ireland say they'll examine the British model, after two teenage boys were convicted last week of the murder of 14-year-old Ana Kriegel in a case that shocked the country. One boy was also convicted of violently sexually assaulting her and was found to have thousands of pornographic images on two mobile phones, news reports said.Britain's porn firewall was set to take effect on July 15 but an administrative error delayed it by six months. The digital secretary, Jeremy Wright, vows it will eventually come into force.'There are also those who do not want those measures to be brought in at all,' Wright told lawmakers. 'Age verification for online porn needs to happen.'

The effort is being watched by other countries hoping to better regulate pornographic content but has raised concerns about privacy, censorship and competition. It has run into multiple delays that reflect the confusion surrounding it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's a mess,\" said Jim Killock, of the London-based Open Rights Group, a digital civil liberties group.</p><p>Killock says the government's blueprints for its online \"porn block\" don't do enough to protect personal data. Others believe the plan amounts to economic censorship. And many fear the rules would effectively give more power to a little known company that dominates the internet porn industry.</p><p>Under the plan, which is now expected to come into force late this year, British porn site visitors will be asked to prove they are 18 or older. Options to do so would include buying a card with an access code in a shop, where they will have to show photo ID, or going online to submit a copy of a passport or driver's license or use a credit card.</p><p>The British government isn't operating the system itself. Instead, it's being outsourced to private companies, which can sell their own age verification technology to porn sites. Oversight, meanwhile, has been handed to the British Board of Film Classification, a film ratings and censorship body akin to the Motion Picture Association of America.</p><p>Privacy campaigners worry that handing over personal information to access adult sites means a person's porn viewing habits can be tracked. Those fears are compounded by the lack of privacy and security standards for age verification providers. Instead, there's a voluntary certification with vague and imprecise requirements.</p><p>One age verification provider, 18+, has said it won't apply for the certificate because its digital wallet system wouldn't be recognized.</p><p>\"There are huge privacy concerns with how the data will be held, because the sort of information that people will have to be giving up is highly personal,\" said Myles Jackman, a London-based lawyer. Also, \"there is a risk that that data will be hacked, breached, stolen or published in the public domain.\"</p><p>Critics point to data breaches at adult-oriented websites, notably a high-profile hack at infidelity site Ashley Madison that exposed personal details of millions of users.</p><p>They note that tech-savvy youngsters will figure out how to how to evade restriction by using, for example, virtual private networks. And there's a loophole exempting social media sites such as Twitter, where plenty of smutty content is now found.</p><p>The film board acknowledges that \"age-verification is not a silver bullet,\" but it will stop kids inadvertently coming across inappropriate material. \"Determined teenagers will find ways to access pornography.\"</p><p>There's also the question of how the new rules would be enforced on the many porn sites based outside the U.K. The film board says it could ask payment providers to withdraw their services and U.K. internet service providers to block them.</p><p>Jackman said the result could be \"economic censorship,\" because smaller, independent British porn producers that can't afford to comply would simply shut down.</p><p>Online porn is a huge industry, but estimates of its size are notoriously hard to come by and there's no official data. Pornhub, the world's most popular adult site, is the 16th most visited in the U.K., according to Amazon's Alexa web analytics .</p><p>Further raising concerns about the new system, one of the first age verification systems, AgeID, is owned by a multinational, MindGeek, which is widely recognized as the owner also of some of the most popular adult websites, including YouTube-like portals such as Pornhub, YouPorn and Redtube.</p><p>In response to a consultation by the film board, numerous people and groups said they were concerned that a company responsible for providing so much pornography online would also become a gatekeeper that potentially allows it access to reams of user data.</p><p>\"There's a clear conflict of interest,\" said Killock. \"The fact is they're effectively creating the Facebook login of porn,\" and will get \"vast market intelligence\" on their rivals and users on competing websites, said Killock, whose group in 2017 unearthed emails from MindGeek executives lobbying British officials to block rival porn sites.</p><p>Angie Rowntree, a director and founder of U.S. erotic site Sssh.com, said her company no longer uploads promo clips to Pornhub but many others continue to do business with MindGeek because its sites get an enormous amount of traffic.</p><p>\"There's a real risk of MindGeek monopolizing the U.K. segment of adult traffic to an even greater extent than they already do, by virtue of having some of the world's best known and most popular free porn sites,\" she said.</p><p>MindGeek spokesman Jim Clark says the company is merely responding to a market opening.</p><p>\"AgeID is not responsible for the creation of the law, nor is AgeID endorsed by the U.K. government. We have simply developed a product in response to the law,\" Clark said by email.</p><p>Clark said AgeID doesn't track users, has \"data minimization, security, and privacy at its core,\" and is designed not to see or store data, making it less tempting for hackers. And, he says, it won't be the only choice of age verification on MindGeek websites.</p><p>Other countries mulling regulation are watching Britain amid concerns that easy access to porn can warp children's view of sex.</p><p>Lawmakers in Ireland say they'll examine the British model, after two teenage boys were convicted last week of the murder of 14-year-old Ana Kriegel in a case that shocked the country. One boy was also convicted of violently sexually assaulting her and was found to have thousands of pornographic images on two mobile phones, news reports said.</p><p>Britain's porn firewall was set to take effect on July 15 but an administrative error delayed it by six months. The digital secretary, Jeremy Wright, vows it will eventually come into force.</p><p>\"There are also those who do not want those measures to be brought in at all,\" Wright told lawmakers. \"Age verification for online porn needs to happen.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APFINL-632fde45a57b4c318be323d76aea79a6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APFINL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ4-SSN1-DYN6-W1WC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288311</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1051\"/><timeReceived>9:25 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press Financial Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 10, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Also, \"there is a risk that that data will be hacked, breached, stolen or published in the public domain.\"</p><p>Critics point to data breaches at adult-oriented websites, notably a high-profile hack at infidelity site Ashley Madison that exposed personal details of millions of users.</p><p>They note that tech-savvy youngsters will figure out how to how to evade restriction by using, for example, virtual private networks. And there's a loophole exempting social media sites such as Twitter, where plenty of smutty content is now found.</p><p>The film board acknowledges that \"age-verification is not a silver bullet,\" but it will stop kids inadvertently coming across inappropriate material. \"Determined teenagers will find ways to access pornography.\"</p><p>There's also the question of how the new rules would be enforced on the many porn sites based outside the U.K. The film board says it could ask payment providers to withdraw their services and U.K. internet service providers to block them.</p><p>Jackman said the result could be \"economic censorship,\" because smaller, independent British porn producers that can't afford to comply would simply shut down.</p><p>Online porn is a huge industry, but estimates of its size are notoriously hard to come by and there's no official data. Pornhub, the world's most popular adult site, is the 16th most visited in the U.K., according to Amazon's Alexa web analytics .</p><p>Further raising concerns about the new system, one of the first age verification systems, AgeID, is owned by a multinational, MindGeek, which is widely recognized as the owner also of some of the most popular adult websites, including YouTube-like portals such as Pornhub, YouPorn and Redtube.</p><p>In response to a consultation by the film board, numerous people and groups said they were concerned that a company responsible for providing so much pornography online would also become a gatekeeper that potentially allows it access to reams of user data.</p><p>\"There's a clear conflict of interest,\" said Killock. \"The fact is they're effectively creating the Facebook login of porn,\" and will get \"vast market intelligence\" on their rivals and users on competing websites, said Killock, whose group in 2017 unearthed emails from MindGeek executives lobbying British officials to block rival porn sites.</p><p>Angie Rowntree, a director and founder of U.S. erotic site Sssh.com, said her company no longer uploads promo clips to Pornhub but many others continue to do business with MindGeek because its sites get an enormous amount of traffic.</p><p>\"There's a real risk of MindGeek monopolizing the U.K. segment of adult traffic to an even greater extent than they already do, by virtue of having some of the world's best known and most popular free porn sites,\" she said.</p><p>MindGeek spokesman Jim Clark says the company is merely responding to a market opening.</p><p>\"AgeID is not responsible for the creation of the law, nor is AgeID endorsed by the U.K. government. We have simply developed a product in response to the law,\" Clark said by email.</p><p>Clark said AgeID doesn't track users, has \"data minimization, security, and privacy at its core,\" and is designed not to see or store data, making it less tempting for hackers. And, he says, it won't be the only choice of age verification on MindGeek websites.</p><p>Other countries mulling regulation are watching Britain amid concerns that easy access to porn can warp children's view of sex.</p><p>Lawmakers in Ireland say they'll examine the British model, after two teenage boys were convicted last week of the murder of 14-year-old Ana Kriegel in a case that shocked the country. One boy was also convicted of violently sexually assaulting her and was found to have thousands of pornographic images on two mobile phones, news reports said.</p><p>Britain's porn firewall was set to take effect on July 15 but an administrative error delayed it by six months. The digital secretary, Jeremy Wright, vows it will eventually come into force.</p><p>\"There are also those who do not want those measures to be brought in at all,\" Wright told lawmakers. \"Age verification for online porn needs to happen.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-632fde45a57b4c318be323d76aea79a6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ4-SW51-DYN6-W2C4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1051\"/><timeReceived>9:26 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 10, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

These days most consumers get most of their bulletins online. Since online publishing is cheap, a profusion of new sources have sprung up. Websites run by established newspapers compete with newer, online-only outlets and professional (or amateur) blogs, not to mention the mix of articles, digital chain-letters and comments curated by the algorithms of social-media sites such as Facebook and Twitter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Established media have struggled. Much of the advertising that used to pay journalists' salaries has gone to Facebook and Google, the two big technology firms that dominate the market for online advertising. Print circulation has collapsed. Local papers have been particularly hard hit, with many going bust. Social-media algorithms prioritise attention-grabbing clickbait over boring truth, which helps propel nonsense around the world. Collins, a dictionary-publisher, declared \"fake news\" its 2017 neologism of the year.</p><p>In 2018 the government asked Dame Frances Cairncross, an economist (and former journalist on this newspaper) to ponder what, if anything, it should do about all this. On February 12th her report was published. It mostly rejects the idea that journalism deserves a bail-out.</p><p>Mostly, but not entirely. Dame Frances argues that public-interest journalism is undersupplied by the market, and that the government should support it via tax breaks or direct funding. Two types of journalism in particular deserve support. One is that which investigates corruption and the abuse of power. Despite its cachet, such work is expensive, difficult and--from a commercial point of view--generally not worth it. The other is the sort of thing local newspapers used to provide: writing up planning meetings, trials in local courts and the like. It is hard to imagine any news less likely to go viral. Yet the report cites research suggesting that a lack of it undermines voter turnout and civic engagement.</p><p>The most eye-catching recommendation, though, is that online platforms such as Google and Facebook be given a \"news quality obligation\", backed by a regulator, requiring them to promote only news from reliable outlets. \"This is really unprecedented,\" reckons Rasmus Nielsen of the Reuters Institute at the University of Oxford (which is funded partly by the press and big tech firms). \"I can't think of another democracy in which there is a call for regulatory oversight of what constitutes 'quality' in the news.\"</p><p>But it fits with growing worries that the ability of a small number of technology firms to amplify and disseminate news may be unhealthy. Politicians have called for the likes of Google to censor everything from fake news stories to articles about suicide and self-harm.</p><p>Resistant at first, firms are trying to comply. But they are walking into a minefield. The smartphone version of Edge, Microsoft's web browser, for instance, now warns users about sites it deems untrustworthy. In January it flagged MailOnline, the widely read website of the pearl-clutching Daily Mail, for \"generally [failing] to maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability\". After the Mail complained, the warning was removed.</p><p>Having governments rate the media would be an awkward policy for a liberal democracy. But the report argues that the alternative--leaving it to the judgment of private companies--is even worse.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EIUVWS-vwvwmain20190216t1620000006xmlxml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EIUVWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VF6-C0B1-JCDS-30P7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253486</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"578\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit Ltd.

This is FIRST MOVE. And here's your need to know. Turbocharged: U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says prepare for a no deal exit in 99 days. No facing the music. Facebook earnings strong despite privacy scandals and a record fine. And an electric shock. Tesla stock tumbles premarket as the timeline to profitability extends again. It Thursday, let's make a move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome once again to FIRST MOVE I'm not a moment too soon. There is a lot going on. Let's get to this. Let me show you the markets first. We've got right now the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 kicking off the session at record highs though, we could see the NASDAQ pare back a little bit here at the open. The Dow futures though boosted by some earnings and we'll get to those, too. I'm still amazed ultimately that we're at these levels considering the news flow right now. Weakened earnings, falling survey data, trade risks, of course, and now a sweeping probe of that the tech giants that's putting a lot of pressure on Jay Powell's shoulders ahead of next week.</p><p>But let me walk you through some of my key observations over the last couple of days. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin's comments yesterday that Amazon specifically has, quote, \"destroyed the retail industry.\" Wow. Also firms that get the bulk of their sales from overseas say the conditions remain grim.</p><p>Caterpillar's earnings missing badly. They lowered their full-year guidance citing the trade wars. We saw shares falling some four percent yesterday. Motor giant, Ford posting a loss in China. Chemical giant, BASF warning profits could fall sweet zero percent this year. That's 30 percent. They are of course based in Germany, where data this week showed factory activity plunging to its lowest level in seven years.</p><p>The key question here is, what can the European Central Bank do here to help them? Well, we heard from Mario Draghi earlier today sending their strongest signal yet. The fresh rate cuts are coming here and that everything remains on the table here to help stimulate the economy, including returning to asset purchases. He says quote, \"Significant stimulus is needed.\" European stocks are mostly higher on the news. German bund though incredibly falling to fresh record lows.</p><p>The rate cuts in September of course, will be pretty timely ahead of more Brexit related fireworks potentially ala Boris Johnson and that's where we kick off the drivers.</p><p>The first full day of Boris Johnson. Well, what did it bring? The new British Prime Minister holding his first Cabinet meeting after culling 17 Ministers from Theresa May's government. A few hours ago the Prime Minister addressed the Brexit stalemate in Parliament. Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: We will throw ourselves into these negotiations with the greatest energy and determination, and in the spirit of friendship and I heard that the E.U. will be equally ready and that they will rethink their current refusal to make any changes to the withdrawal agreement.</p><p>If they do not -- if they do not -- we will of course have to leave the U.K. without an agreement under Article 50. The U.K. is better prepared for that situation than many believe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Nina dos Santos joins us now. Nina, this is Teresa May's Brexit means Brexit on steroids quite frankly. You know, when I look at the Cabinet makeup here, if you want to send a message to the E.U. that we're not messing around, this is the way that you do it.</p><p>NINA DOS SANTOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, 17 out of 22 of Teresa May's top Ministers were unceremoniously either sacked or put in a position where they had to step down knowing that they'd probably be sacked by an incoming Prime Minister, Boris Johnson. He has made it very clear by giving the top three positions -- the Home Secretary position, the Foreign Office, and other key positions to pro-Brexiteers who backed him, and in fact some of them stood next to him as he campaigned for leaving in the 2016 E.U. referendum. They have been given some of the most powerful positions in the land.</p><p>He said that they're going to be trying to turbocharge the plan to get the country ready for potentially leaving the E.U. without a deal on that next deadline, which is October 31st, which by the way is only 99 days away.</p><p>And he very -- he was very keen to make sure that he also in Parliament, when he was addressing Parliament, both sides of the House during his first session there, his maiden speech and Prime Minister's Question time that he turned around theatrically to try and get those backbenchers of his own party that he may have alienated in this vicious Cabinet reshuffle on his side. Theatrically accurately turning back and forth, not just to the opposition, but also to the backbenchers.</p><p>[09:05:20] DOS SANTOS: Well, people also are thinking what is probably going on here, Julia, is that we may well be preparing ourselves for a general election in the autumn.</p><p>Remember that Parliament actually breaks up for the summer recess tomorrow. So, there isn't a huge amount of time for these preparations to get underway. And also Brussels itself will be breaking up for summer as well. So, although Boris Johnson has talked about turbo charging Brexit, the real issues that he has got his work cut out in a very short period of time, during which a lot of people will be on their summer vacations -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Absolutely. Nothing about the conditions here of change, whether it's Parliament or the E.U., quite frankly. So it's yes, turbo charged off on holiday at this stage. We shall see. Nina dos Santos, thank you very much for that.</p><p>All right. Let's go and take a look at Facebook right now because their shares are higher premarket. They reported $17 billion worth of revenues for Q2. That was up 28 percent, I believe a quarter-on-quarter. Clare Sebastian joins us now.</p><p>Clare, I mean, I was looking at their user numbers across all their key monetizable areas right now, they're solid, and advertisers are going nowhere. It's a win-win.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely Julia. It's really interesting. If you look at those user numbers, about 10 percent of Facebook users are in the U.S. and Canada, but they get about 48 percent of their advertising revenue from this region. So, it was crucially important, looking at those charts that those numbers are remaining stable, and even slightly growing.</p><p>Although, of course, most of the growth in users comes from emerging markets. Advertisers continue to be lower just because of the dominance of Facebook's position. Facebook and Google continue to corner more than 50 cents on the dollar of every dollar spent in online advertising around the world. That is something that businesses simply can't overlook.</p><p>And I think it's worth thinking as well that Facebook isn't just tapping into this market, it is also creating it. Sheryl Sandberg said on the call, look, we taught businesses how to advertise on mobile. Now, it's teaching them how to shift into things like stories. There's more ephemeral bits of social networking.</p><p>But one thing that they did say is that they expect to see a pronounced deceleration in revenue growth going into the fourth quarter of this year and into 2020. That's because of ad targeting related headwinds. They called it things like GDPR and other regulations around the world, how that's affecting how browsers deal with privacy, how that's affecting how they deal with privacy with the own products. That caused a bit of volatility in the stock price, after hours. Although most analysts are seeing this as just management being conservative this morning.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I remember when they first warned about that margin squeezes and the higher cost in things a year ago and the stock plunged 20 percent. Now we're approaching what? Record highs again. What about antitrust? Because we did see the record FTC fine of $5 billion, a fresh FTC investigation, and of course, the antitrust issues. What did they have to say on that point?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: So, this was really the first thing they talked about on the call. Mark Zuckerberg went straight into this. He said, look, this is going to be something that means fundamental changes to the way we do business. He said, we're making some major changes to how we build our services and run this company.</p><p>He said that's going to lead to higher cost. He said it may lead to delays in how they roll out their products. Now, that doesn't tally with some of the dissent that we've seen from the FTC. We know that in coming to this decision, this $5 billion settlement, they were divided down party lines. The Democrats on the committee didn't think that it went far enough that that $5 billion was, you know, just about a third of the revenue that we saw from Facebook in this quarter, not enough of a deterrent and didn't lead to fundamental changes in the way they do business in terms of ad targeting.</p><p>But Facebook trying to make the opposite point saying that is going to lead to fundamental changes. So, although one thing I thought was interesting from Mark Zuckerberg, he said, you know that he wants regulation, he wants comprehensive regulation. Otherwise, he says that frustration with the industry will continue to grow. Perhaps, he's a little tired of all this bad publicity -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, absolutely. Well, let's just go on to say that we're going to announce a cryptocurrency or something if you really hate bad publicity. Yes, yes, skeptic here. Clare Sebastian, thank you so much for that. Talk about inviting criticism.</p><p>Oh, speaking of that, Tesla stocks down some 10 percent premarket reporting a much bigger loss than expected in the past quarter. They did deliver a record number of cars which of course we knew previously. Paul La Monica has been looking at the details that this. Paul, the path to profitability pushed back yet again, and a lot of details in here I think worrying analysts once again.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, I think the biggest problem right now, Julia is that even though sales are strong, particularly for the Model 3, which is the quote unquote, \"cheaper\" of you know, cheapest of Tesla's available models. That's bringing down profit margins, and that's leading to these continued losses more than a $400 million quarterly loss. I mean, the Model S and Model X are expensive cars.</p><p>[09:10:10] LA MONICA: So, as Tesla goes more mainstream and tries to sell these Model 3s to more average, middle class consumers and not just the affluent on the Coast that can really afford the Model S or the Model X, that's going to be I think, a big problem going forward.</p><p>So, I don't know, maybe Tesla needs its own cryptocurrency to get people to buy more of its cars.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Just change the name, don't even bother doing any of the work, just change the name. That used to help. Paul, there are so many things I could question or ask you about this. Obviously, they're trying to use all methods they can to cut costs here and that did filter through, but simply the cost of producing these cars is high.</p><p>One of the things to me was how low the R&amp;D costs are for a company that's talking about going to autonomous vehicle technology, it is promising all sorts of big things over in China as well. That was worrying for me. But one of them was what Elon Musk said on the call about actually trying to reduce service costs by telling people how to switch their cars on. Wow.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, there are a couple of things -- a lot there, Julia, Musk being a little glib talking about how some people were having trouble turning the car on. You know, I think he was obviously saying that in jest.</p><p>I mean, you'd have to think that, you know, your more affluent Tesla consumer is not sitting there really struggling that much with things of that basic of a nature.</p><p>But it is a good point that you have more of these problems with the cars, you know, Consumer Reports has noted them as well, people have to bring them into the service centers and that costs a lot of money.</p><p>So, if Tesla can do more education to consumers and more downloads of updates via you know, via Wi-Fi and what have you, that's something that will lower costs as well. And this is going to be very important because Tesla's Chief Technology Officer, JB Straubel, one of the cofounders with Musk is also stepping down, which is another big problem, because Tesla has had this well-known brain drain for some time. And I think it does speak to, you know, the question of, is Musk too difficult of a person to really deal with on a day-to-day basis?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and it's a good point. But even if you are struggling to turn your car on, it's still a phone call to the service center. It's still a wasted 30 seconds or one minute or even perhaps even more, that you could be helping someone with bigger problems.</p><p>So, I think it's right to tackle some of these issues, that the challenges remain. Paul La Monica, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right. Let me bring you up to speed now with some of the other stories that we're following around the world. Ukraine says it's detained a Russian tanker, which it claims was involved in a clash at sea last year. The incident last November led to the capture of 24 Ukrainian sailors. Fred Pleitgen is in Moscow for us.</p><p>Fred, what else do we know? Because the suggestion from the Ukrainian Security Services, that they simply recognized the ship, it's just been called something else.</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's exactly what they're saying, Julia, and we're still sort of gathering the evidence on this or the information on this. And it seemed as though what the Ukrainians are saying is that this ship was in a port in Western Ukraine, a port called Izmail, and was there in fact, under a different name.</p><p>However, they say that the local authorities there seem to have identified that ship, and that the name had been changed and through the registration number, found out that it was actually the ship that apparently had been involved in that incident in last November.</p><p>Now, what the Ukrainians are saying is that at this point in time that that ship has been detained, as they say. They say various security sources, or security services are on that ship and are searching that ship. And they say what they want to do is they want to go to a local port and have that ship as they put it be arrested, which obviously means that that ship would be impounded because the Ukrainians are saying that that ship is essentially evidence because of course, there's still several of their sailors detained. And of course, they're in a standoff with Russia about that incident that took place last November.</p><p>Now, as you can imagine, the Russians not at all happy with what was going on there, the Russian Foreign Ministry coming out and saying, if this is a case of Russians being held hostage, as they say that the Russians would say that this is of the most severe incident, and that a response would be very quick and not long and coming and would be very heavy and severe as well.</p><p>So as you can see, sort of an escalation of that standoff seems to be brewing. Of course, we need to remind our viewers that that original incident that took place was last November. I think you're seeing some of the video there right now on your screen where the Russian Coast Guard came, and essentially detained three Ukrainian warships and 24 sailors that were on board those ships, and those sailors remain in detention until today.</p><p>Now, what the Ukrainians are saying is that this tanker was involved by essentially blocking the Strait of Kerch, which is a key waterway in the Black Sea. And so therefore, they're saying that this ship is essentially evidence.</p><p>One of the things, Julia that has been going on over the past couple of months since Ukraine has had a new President, Volodymyr Zelensky, there had been talks between himself and Vladimir Putin to try and get these sailors released. There was talk that apparently these negotiations had been making headway, but of course, now it seems with this incident, it could be that all bets are off once again -- Julia.</p><p>[09:15:11] CHATTERLEY: Yes. And now, it perhaps means as well that the Ukrainians have detainees or as the Russians are calling them, hostages to exchange. Interesting. Fred, great to have you with us. Thank you so much. Fred Pleitgen there in Moscow for us.</p><p>All right, South Korean officials say two projectiles launched by Pyongyang early Thursday are a new type of short-range missile. They are calling it a military threat, one that risks undermining efforts to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula.</p><p>There were celebrations on the streets of San Juan after Puerto Rico's Governor announced he is stepping down effective one week from tomorrow.</p><p>Ricardo Rossello's homophobic and sexist messages in a group chat were made public kicking off days of mass protests. Lawmakers have said they are prepared to begin impeachment proceedings.</p><p>Europeans is suffering the summer's second extreme heat wave and the worst is yet to come. Britain and France are facing life-threatening temperatures on Thursday. Paris just hit a record 41 degrees Celsius. U.K. officials warn the heat could bring the train network to a grinding halt.</p><p>American rapper, ASAP Rocky will go on trial on Tuesday to face challenges of assault. The musician has been detained in Sweden since July the third. Swedish authorities say he will remain there until his trial.</p><p>All right, we're going to take a quick break here on FIRST MOVE, but still to come, tech titans are in the Justice Department's crosshairs, a new antitrust probe could bite into FAANG dominance or will it?</p><p>And it's a bird, it's a plane, its UPS -- how the shipping company's deliveries will soar as drone operations take flight. That's all to come. Stay with CNN.</p><p>[09:20:00] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE live from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange where it looks like we're giving back earlier premarket gains here. The market is set to open slightly lower here.</p><p>The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 of course hitting fresh record highs yesterday, some good earnings as well. But it is a mixed bag. 3M, one of the ones to watch, up some four percent premarket after strong results this morning, too.</p><p>What about Europe as well? Mario Draghi saying significant stimulus is needed right now for Europe, perhaps a rate cut here. New stimulus looking likely now in September. The European Central Bank saying everything remains on the table here including potential -- further going back, I should say, to asset purchases.</p><p>Turkey also in focus, joining the rate cutting bandwagon. No surprise there, but it was huge, four and a quarter percentage point cut here. The first move, of course for Turkey's new Central Bank Governor. Like I say, no eyebrows raised there.</p><p>Let's get some context here. Joining me now is Sam Stovall. He is a chief investment strategist at CFRA. Sam, I'm delighted to have you with us.</p><p>SAM STOVALL, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Good to be here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Let's start with the European Central Bank here. I mean, Mario Draghi saying this morning all options on the table. We're considering it, but given how low rates are right now, the unemployment picture in Europe still pretty weak, what more can stimulus do here?</p><p>STOVALL: Well, I think what it can do really is try to boost investor confidence to say that the ECB is attempting to do something, not just sitting on the sidelines, expecting the markets to act on its own.</p><p>So, as Draghi had said 10 years ago, we're going to do whatever we can to make sure that this works.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We will cut rates further into negative territory and we will buy assets. BlackRock said that they should be buying equities this time around. Do you think that's where we're going to end up where the European Central Bank is buying stocks, not just sovereign bonds?</p><p>STOVALL: Well, I think nothing is off the table. And when you think about how low international equities are, even European equities, relative to the S&amp;P 500, they're trading at levels that really have not been seen since the MSCI EAFE was created in 1969.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow. I mean, some would argue there is a reason for that, quite frankly. But I looked at your portfolio and you suggest putting 15 percent of the total portfolio in international equities. Are you recommending European stocks? Select European stocks or where around the world are you suggesting here? And is it hard to convince U.S. based investors given the headline risk here to invest outside the U.S.?</p><p>STOVALL: Yes, it's very hard to get U.S. investors to invest overseas because the international equities have underperformed domestic equities in the last 10 years. So, investors are saying \"Well, wait a minute, you know, yes, I appreciate that on a relative basis, prices look very, very attractive. Also on a relative price to earnings ratio, the profitability perspective, things also look very appealing. But I'm not going to be the first one to jump into the pool because I might -- my portfolio might end up drowning.\"</p><p>So, at CFRA, we cover about 1,500 stocks around the globe. We have equity analysts in Europe and Asia. And yes, they do believe that there are some selected opportunities, but you've got to be careful.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's cherry picking rather than just looking at an index in isolation, right? Well, I'm going to defend the rest of the world versus the United States, because there's plenty of headline risk hereto quite frankly, whether it's trade headwinds, the Mueller report yesterday was something else. I think everybody was kind of keeping an eye on earnings finally coming in kind of unexpected, but expectations were low. Why are we sitting at record highs? Is it all to do with Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve?</p><p>STOVALL: I think it has to do with the difference between headline news and bottom line news. That yes, the Mueller situation and a lot of other things that are swirling around have really more to do with headlines, politics, et cetera. But then the question comes down to how will it affect bottom line? How will it affect corporate profits?</p><p>People have been calling for very, very weak corporate earnings growth for quite some time. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me 29 times shame on me, because it's now expected that this quarter will be the 30th consecutive time in which the actual results have exceeded end of quarter estimates.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Do we just need to fire all the analysts quite frankly?</p><p>STOVALL: No, we have to congratulate the management for doing such a good job managing expectations.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Managing -- good answer. Also, I noticed in your portfolio, you have 15 percent in cash? Is that a lot relative to where you've been, say in the past two years? And just explain that to me because that's not earning any money really.</p><p>STOVALL: Well, it's not earning any money. But the feeling is, it keeps the powder dry. We are in a very challenging period time-wise of the U.S. equity market. Historically, the July through October period can be very, very volatile and also very weak.</p><p>We had this third strongest year-to-date performance since the end of -- through the end of April and 80 percent of the time of those top five, the market was down July through October. So, with equity evaluations, you know, the profitability metrics, et cetera, looking pretty expensive. I think investors are saying, you know what, maybe I'm not going to be totally invested, I will save some on the sidelines for better prices ahead.</p><p>[09:25:28] CHATTERLEY: Antitrust. Tech leadership. What do you make of the noise surrounding this? And do you think -- and are you telling investors perhaps to rotate out of technology into some of the other big enough sectors? Or are you saying hang on in there? Because if it's coming, it's not really going to have teeth and it's not coming for a long time.</p><p>STOVALL: Hang on, you've brought up a good point of saying it is just noise. This has been around for quite some time, yet why is it that tech is beating the broader market by a two to one margin over the last one month, three months, six months basis when everybody has been aware of this already? So, it's going to add to volatility, but we still believe that the growth lies with technology.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So, if we do see any pullback, it's a buying opportunity, perhaps rather than anything else.</p><p>STOVALL: Exactly. Bull markets don't die of old age, they die of fright. What they're most afraid of is recession. So, keep your eye on economic growth. We're going to be getting the U.S. GDP report fairly soon showing about a 1.8 percent rise, pressure possibly from Boeing. But then really the question is what kind of assessment about the future will come out?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And in the end too, more resolute Jay Powell and his rate cuts.</p><p>STOVALL: Exactly.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you so much for that. Sam Stovall there. Chief investment strategist at CFRA. All right, we're counting down to the market open. A softer open expected, but still lots of news to get through. Stay with FIRST MOVE. We've got you covered. You're with CNN.</p><p>[09:30:00] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE here at the New York Stock Exchange. The opening bell in Thursday's session, and as you can see, we've got the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ falling, easing back slightly here from record highs.</p><p>The tech stocks in fact, down the most. Big earnings on deck of course not only what we've been talking about with the likes of Tesla and Facebook, but Amazon, Intel and Alphabet all out later on today.</p><p>Interesting observation here as well, as we await the Q2 GDP numbers for the United States tomorrow. The Russell 2000, the smaller cap stocks now out of correction territory, thanks to a one and a half percentage point gain yesterday. That's some encouraging sign, remember because these guys have a far more significant exposure to the domestic -- the U.S. economy here.</p><p>All right. Let me walk you through some of our global movers in the session as well. Ford under a bit of pressure here. The Q2 profits missing expectations. They were hurt by efforts to restructure over in Europe and South America. The full-year outlook also missed, so easing their guidance here, and the automaker is cutting thousands of jobs this year as it plans to invest some $11 billion by 2022 in electric and hybrid vehicles, as we heard of course, when we spoke to their CEO, a week and a half ago.</p><p>All right. Southwest also in focus. The low-cost carriers says it is pulling out of Newark Liberty International Airport due to the Boeing 737 MAX delay. It says it does not plan to fly the jet now until next year. Southwest of course has more of those MAX jets than any other airline. So, that impact clearly being felt here. The Q2 revenues also missing estimates here.</p><p>Now, Tesla as we've also done talked about already on the show, the electric car maker posting a $408 million loss in the second quarter well below Wall Street's expectations here. However, it did reaffirm its full- year delivery guidance. It expects to return to profitability in the third quarter of the year. Can they make it though?</p><p>Dan Ives joins us now. He is the Managing Director and Equity Analyst at Wedbush Securities. A pleasure to have you on the show, as always.</p><p>DAN IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND EQUITY ANALYST AT WEDBUSH SECURITIES: Good to be here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You said that these numbers were the one to watch. Let's talk about that guidance. Is that guidance pie in the sky right now? Because that's looking like a real ask, given what we've seen here.</p><p>IVES: Yes, I mean, but two things first, in terms of that unit guidance, that's an ever slight uphill battle, in our opinion, and the bigger issue is really profitability because it comes down to can they get there in a profitable model? A record quarter, gross margins below 20 percent. This is a nightmare scenario for the bulls.</p><p>And this is really in many ways, I think, a fundamental question around their business model.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I feel like we are sounding a bit broken record like of it being a nightmare scenario though, for the bulls here. I mean, to your point, what we've talked about over the past weeks is stripping back costs. And we did see an eight percent quarter-on-quarter dropping cost, but producing these cars is increasingly more expensive it seems in terms of the numbers, and they're producing more Model 3s now at the expense of the higher margin cars, and you can see that drag on the margins hereto. This is a problem.</p><p>IVES: That is the underpinning of the issue, a really emotional bull-bear story here, because you had car selling $70,000 to $75,000.00; now, 35 to 40, the margins on there are not enough and now you're seeing it flow through the numbers.</p><p>You know, bulls are popping champagne when we got those delivery numbers. Now, it comes down to can they do it profitably? That was the issue, and also that unit guidance for the year, they should have ripped the Band-Aid off because I continue to believe that is going to be an extremely difficult number to hit.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Interesting. Do you think he would be rewarded now for perhaps being a bit more realistic? Because we did see those deliveries and everyone was like, \"Wow, that's brilliant.\" And the snapshot of those deliveries is great, but not if you can't afford to produce them at that rate.</p><p>IVES: That's the problem. And right now, Tesla and Musk are playing a poker game with the Street. And I think going into the next few quarters is a fork in the road situation. That's why last night, bulls are open for more. You had in the deliveries, but the profitable nature of those, that's really going to be the issue. And that's going to be the debate here and you'll get the stock that's going to get rerated lower.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And you've adjusted your price target here lower as a result of these numbers.</p><p>IVES: Yes, we've lowered it to 220, and I think, look, there could be another way down if profitability gets pushed out further, then the stock could go below $200.00.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Is there any price here where you go, you know what, this now looks like value.</p><p>IVES: I think somewhere in their call, 160 to 170 range.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow. That's a long way down.</p><p>IVES: But that's the level where it starts to become significantly attractive. Because you have factored in now 360 to 400, more of a 330 to 340 type number. That's where the model starts to kind of plateau.</p><p>[09:35:06] CHATTERLEY: You know, one of the things that worries me was the fact that their R&amp;D, their research and development costs were the lowest they've been for a year in this quarter. They've nowhere near spent what they said they were going to do in 2019. For a hugely innovative company in the bull case, the guys I speak to, the bulls here still talk about the two, three, four, five-year horizon and how innovative this company is, but right now, it can't afford to spend on the R&amp;D.</p><p>IVES: And the albatross around the neck is the debt. When you have $9 billion of net debt. That's the issue. And that's why walls start to cave in in terms of restrictions of what you can do. You've got to lower CapEx and for a company with Musk trying to balance all these initiative, robo taxis, Giga 3 in China, and all others, that is a --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: These are the growth opportunities.</p><p>IVES: Unless, he is David Copperfield, that's very difficult.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: He might just be though. Who knows? All right, we're going to stop talking about this because we could continue for the next half an hour. Never mind that. Big tech, you've been looking at this again, because you've had a lot of clients saying to you, look, what are your thoughts here?</p><p>Steven Mnuchin, Treasury Secretary yesterday saying that Amazon had destroyed retail. Are we looking at any likelihood of antitrust fire for some of these big guys because in the end, you have to prove the consumer has been hurt, and I am not sure you can do that to many of these?</p><p>IVES: That's really the issue and some that I have lived through and covered, Microsoft through the antitrust. That's a great blueprint. There's going to be a big drum roll on both sides of the aisle especially going to the 2020 election. The D.O.J. definitely has some teeth in terms of what they're looking at.</p><p>But I think, in the street, you see them stocks that are viewed as more background noise. Fundamentally, we think it's more of a finer business model tweak. And that's why despite all the skeptics and black clouds, Facebook, Amazon, these FAANG names, we think are going higher.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, you mentioned a great point. I saw Democrats and Republicans lambasting the FTC here saying, look, that $5 billion fine was peanuts effectively to Facebook. My understanding is this, Congress gives the powers to regulators like the FTC. They need to beef up those powers. Law change is required. Is that coming?</p><p>IVES: Well, we don't see that coming in Congress. And that's why right now, in the 202 area code, there's a long line of regulators waiting to sit down with Zuckerberg and Facebook, and his software peers.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. Yes. He is laughing, announcing cryptocurrencies and the like. Dan Ives. Thank you so much for that. Dan Ives, Managing Director and Equity Analyst at Wedbush Securities there.</p><p>All right, we're going to take a quick break here on FIRST MOVE, but coming up, are we in a gin-aissance? Fabulous word. Diageo is raising a glass to its profits. We will speak to the CEO for all the details including the answer to that question.</p><p>[09:40:48] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE with a look at today's \"Boardroom Brief.\" Nissan is cutting more than 12,000 jobs after reporting a stunning 99 percent fall in quarterly profits. The Japanese car maker warned last quarter that it was at quote \"rock bottom.\" It is now warning that things won't improve anytime soon despite a major cost cutting program.</p><p>The security issues surrounding Chinese firm of Huawei are giving a boost to one of its main rivals. Nokia reported better than expected earnings on the back of strong sales of 5G equipment. It says customers are reconsidering who to buy equipment from because of security concerns. Shares in Nokia soared on the news.</p><p>And the world's largest brewery has shrugged off the recent turmoil over its failed Asian IPO. Shares in AB InBev are trading higher after it reported better than expected results. Earlier this month, the company had to abandon plans to list its Asia business after weak investor demand.</p><p>We are feeling very spirited today. Diageo also posted its earnings from gin sales and boosting profits, but shares are a touch lower today. I have to make the point though, they're up some 18 percent year-to-date so far.</p><p>Ivan Menezes is the CEO of Diageo and joins us now. Ivan, always a pleasure to have you here on the show. I called it earlier a gin-aissance -- gin-aissance. If I look around all of your regions here, whether it's Asia, whether it's Africa, whether it's North America, solid growth here, you must be pleased. Talk us through it.</p><p>IVAN MENEZES, CEO, DIAGEO: Yes, I am. We've had an excellent year. Sales has grown 6.1 percent; profits, nine; EPS, 10; strong cash flow. But the quality of growth is what I'm most happy about.</p><p>As you mentioned, all our regions in growth. North America, five; Africa, seven; Asia and Latin America, nine; Europe is a strong four. And our categories, I mean, you talked about gin. Gin is growing fast. But it's still a relatively small category for us and for the overall industry.</p><p>Tequila is doing really well, growing very fast, particularly in the U.S. and Mexico. Whiskey is on trend everywhere in the world, and its premiumising nicely. So, you know, Johnnie Walker, up seven percent; but Johnnie Walker Blue Label growing double digit.</p><p>India and China doing well. Both those markets have qualities growth. So, the business is doing well because we're investing more behind marketing. And we've had a banner year on new product innovation. And those investments are paying off as we look to build a sustainable and consistent trend there.</p><p>People around the world are drinking better. And we benefit from that. People around the world are looking for better brands, better products, better experiences and that's what we're about, it is being innovative in how we provide that to consumers around the world.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Talk to me about some of those innovations in particular because your TV tie ups have created all sorts of news whether it's the White Walker of course, a play on HBO's \"Game of Thrones,\" which I know was a real highlight, but also the \"Walking Dead\" as well, your bourbon launch there, I mean, just engaging with the consumer and perhaps a younger consumer here in a very different way.</p><p>MENEZES: Yes, so part of what we like to do and how we build our brands is make them relevant in the current cultural context. And so brands living in culture is a very important part of our category and because you look at where our products play, they play in moments of socializing, of celebration of relaxing, and our brands mean a lot to people.</p><p>They choose their products based on how they feel about the brand and in what you see with \"Game of Thrones\" collaboration on Johnnie Walker and on our range of malts, it's brought new consumers into scotch whiskey and it's also helps make Johnnie Walker cool.</p><p>And so we're getting bolder and more innovative in how we do this, but at its heart, you've got to be very careful, you can't overdo it. I mean, brands need to be authentic and true to what they stand for. And we've been very pleased with the \"Game of Thrones\" collaboration that's worked really well for us around the world.</p><p>[09:45:38] CHATTERLEY: I also want to talk to you about potential M&amp;A here as well, because obviously, we've been very focused on what we've seen from AB InBev and the IPO that they sort of tried and failed to do over in Asia, selling off the Australian business.</p><p>I know you've been through a process over the last decade of sort of reshaping your offering, and as you called it, the premiumization of the brands that you're doing here, but where are you looking? Whether it's geographically or in the sort of product mix here. Because to your point, I mean, gin is still only what? Four percent and the growth opportunities -- the four percent of your revenues and the growth opportunities here perhaps for that brand around the world is pretty huge.</p><p>MENEZES: Yes, and we are fortunate in the portfolio we have today, it gives us a very good geographic footprint. You know, the developed markets of the U.S. and Europe still have very good growth for premium spirits. And we're well positioned in Asia, Latin America, Africa, India, and China. So, we have a good starting position footprint.</p><p>In terms of brands and categories, again, that the Diageo portfolio has good completion, but we're always looking for interesting businesses to buy. I'd say the last most recent one we did was Casamigos Tequila, which we did a couple of years ago. And that acquisition is performing really well for us.</p><p>Diageo has a strong balance sheet. We have very good cash. We want to be building the brands of tomorrow, acquiring new interesting brands that have good long-term growth. And so we will we will stay active in the space of adding to our portfolio for the right opportunities that come along.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, always looking for potential opportunities. Ivan Menezes, great to have you on the show, as always, the CEO of Diageo there and their solid results. So, congratulations again.</p><p>All right, let's move on. UPS just posted record breaking earnings, too. But the U.S.-China trade war could mean further trouble ahead. My conversation with the CEO of UPS, next.</p><p>[09:50:00] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Trade talks between the United States and China is set to resume next week. The first time since their -- let's call it a pause -- back in May. It comes after the IMF warned this week, if you remember that 70 percent of the world's economy is now slowing trade, a huge contributory factor.</p><p>I spoke to the UPS CEO David Abney, and he was saying to me that he wants to see more measurable progress towards a comprehensive agreement. When we sat down, I asked him about what he is seeing in China and what the overall declining export numbers are telling him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAVID ABNEY, CEO, UPS: Exports are slowing. But if you're based in the U.S., you can judge China exports based on what's coming into the U.S. And so what we've seen that has diminished. There is no doubt about that. It is still a pretty hefty clip, but it's less than what it was.</p><p>But we're seeing China to the rest of the world increase. So, we're seeing trade flows change. And, in fact, we took a 747-8, our largest aircraft that we were going to fly from China to the U.S., we're actually flying it from China to Europe now. It's just an example of how we can change our network when you have these headwinds that come in. So, headwind always creates a tailwind somewhere else, so we're taking advantage of that tailwind.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But what you are saying is actually China then is trading to a greater extent with other areas. So, even as their business with the United States drops, they're actually substituting for other nations.</p><p>They are. Now, they're not fully able to substitute because the decrease in the U.S. is more than increase in the rest of the world. But they are doing a good job diversifying and they are offsetting some of that impact.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: This week, the U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that the Justice Department is right to launch an antitrust probe into Amazon. He says the e-commerce giant has, quote, \"destroyed the retail industry across the United States\" that has no doubt limited competition.</p><p>It's a fascinating comment. UPS is both an Amazon competitor of course, and also a partner at times. So, I asked Abney what he made of those comments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ABNEY: Anything that the governments across the world can do to take away barriers, to create trade agreements that will encourage the small and midsize businesses. We've talked about this before. Only one percent of U.S. small and midsize businesses export. We can encourage them through trade agreements and through logistics networks, like UPS and increase that number. If we do that, that will make them more competitive.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's quite fascinating to me, because I mean, Amazon has what? Forty percent market share of the e-commerce market, but it's less than five percent, I believe, of the overall retail market. So, I guess your point here is, as much as you can perhaps look at the power of some of the big retailers in the United States, what policies here is the government promoting to support smaller and medium sized enterprises, particularly as far as digitization is concerned? Is that the point?</p><p>ABNEY: That is absolutely the key and there's so much the government in the U.S. and throughout can do. And we believe that the U.S., Mexico, Canada Trade Agreement is a big step in that direction. The old NAFTA did not even address e-commerce.</p><p>This has a particular chapter just on small and midsize companies and they are the ones who will benefit. It has been ratified in Mexico. We want to see it ratified in Canada and the U.S.. And we do think they're just becoming a little more bipartisan. So, we believe there's an opportunity to get that done.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I'm sure you talk to the government all the time. I'm sure you talk to the Treasury Secretary, do you think he gets it? Do you think he understands sort of the challenges both for small employers and large ones in the United States from this perspective? You have confidence that he gets it?</p><p>ABNEY: You know, I have had several conversations with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and I do believe that he does. It does not mean that we agree on everything. I've been married for 42 years. We don't agree with everything either.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Congratulations.</p><p>ABNEY: But we do have good conversations back and forth between the Secretary and myself. He listens and he lets me give my opinion, and then of course, he is going to make up his own mind. He is going to make his recommendations. But I do believe he understands global trade, and what we need to do to enhance global trade and create jobs in the U.S., which he wants, we want, and the American public wants.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Forty years and it's up, up and away for UPS in the future. They're applying for a certification from the Federal Aviation Administration for drone operations. I asked David if he believes UPS can get that certification and what they'll then do with it and how fast?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[09:55:11] ABNEY: We do believe we can be the first or among the first to get this FAA Part 135 certification. If we can do that, we can duplicate what we do at Wake Med, to clinics all across the country without having to have line of sight and without restricting the numbers, and then you can look at doing it across other industries, too.</p><p>So, we think it is a very good opportunity. It's not meant to replace the UPS uniformed driver, but it's certainly meant in places where urgency is so important that we can offer our customers another level.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: David Abney there, the CEO of UPS. All right, a quick look at the markets. We are softer here. So, moving away from those record highs hit yesterday for the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ, of course, too.</p><p>I'll be back on \"The Express\" with more, but for now, that's it for the show. You've been watching FIRST MOVE, time to go make yours.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019072501cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNC-N591-DXH2-62PV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7635\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 25, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Strides have been made to offer people more control and protections, but in a 15-minute speech at the UN, Boris Johnson called for more. On Monday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson went on a rant about Google and the Internet of Things (IoT) in front of the United Nations assembly. </p><p>He warned[1] that 'it takes real effort to conceal your thoughts from Google' amid snickers from UN members. He rambled on about Alexa[2]-powered devices and how 'pink-eyed Terminators' could be sent back from the future 'to cull the human race,' completely mangling the plot to the Terminator in the process. Johnson believes that if big tech is not regulated, it will soon become Big Brother with everyone under 24-hour surveillance.'Your mattress will monitor your nightmares. Your fridge will beep for more cheese. Your front door will sweep wide the moment you approach, like some silent butler,' he said.The cost of this efficiency and convenience is the loss of our privacy as the IoT stores all of our secrets in the cloud. Alexa will listen to our every command, but also our every conversation.[embedded content]As bizarre and unhinged as Johnson's speech seemed, his point was not invalid. Emergent technologies can be used for good or evil, and without any regulatory control, there would be nothing to stop the misuse of advanced tech. He called the UN to task on finding a global set of rules to ensure this does not happen. 'The mission of the United Kingdom, and all who share our values, must be to ensure that emerging technologies are designed from the outset for freedom, openness, and pluralism, with the right safeguards in place to protect our peoples,' Johnson said to the assembly.He concluded giving the UN members an open invitation to attend a 2020 summit in London to discuss ethical and responsible technology.Big Data insists it can self-regulate, but we have seen how platforms like Facebook[3] and Google[4] have exploited users data. Politicians in the UK, US, and other counties have been yammering for formal controls and have implemented some. The GDPR[5] is just one example.However, they must also be careful to strike a balance that protects the consumer without stifling innovation.Image credit: Michael Tubi[6] via Shutterstock Related Reads  Share this article:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techspot.com/news/82066-uk-prime-minister-calls-more-regulation-technology-bizarre.html#Share\">https://www.techspot.com/news/82066-uk-prime-minister-calls-more-regulation-technology-bizarre.html#Share</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.techspot.com/news/82066-uk-prime-minister-calls-more-regulation-technology-bizarre.html...le=UK%20prime%20minister%20calls%20for%20more%20regulation%20of%20technology%20in%20bizarre%20speech%20to%20UN\">https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.techspot.com/news/82066-uk-prime-minister-calls-more-regulation-technology-bizarre.html...le=UK%20prime%20minister%20calls%20for%20more%20regulation%20of%20technology%20in%20bizarre%20speech%20to%20UN</url> [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-to-the-un-general-assembly-24-september-2019\">https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-to-the-un-general-assembly-24-september-2019</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techspot.com/tag/alexa/\">https://www.techspot.com/tag/alexa/</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techspot.com/news/78806-scathing-uk-report-facebook-intentionally-knowingly-violated-privacy.html\">https://www.techspot.com/news/78806-scathing-uk-report-facebook-intentionally-knowingly-violated-privacy.html</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techspot.com/news/76630-google-admits-flaws-maintaining-consumer-privacy-senate-committee.html\">https://www.techspot.com/news/76630-google-admits-flaws-maintaining-consumer-privacy-senate-committee.html</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techspot.com/tag/gdpr/\">https://www.techspot.com/tag/gdpr/</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/download/confirm/1460208077?src=eGvep5gqMUk7LBh5Xwg1QA-1-0...e=huge_jpg\">https://www.shutterstock.com/download/confirm/1460208077?src=eGvep5gqMUk7LBh5Xwg1QA-1-0...e=huge_jpg</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TSPT1338811569439244129251762500182</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSPT-133881</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X4J-V2M1-F03R-N38K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"581\"/><timeReceived>7:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>TechSpot</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 25, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000D7EQ</classCode><className>SHUTTERSTOCK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He warned that \"it takes real effort to conceal your thoughts from Google\" amid snickers from UN members.</p><p><br/>He rambled on about Alexa-powered devices and how \"pink-eyed Terminators\" could be sent back from the future \"to cull the human race,\" completely mangling the plot to the Terminator in the process. Johnson believes that if big tech is not regulated, it will soon become Big Brother with everyone under 24-hour surveillance.<br/>\"Your mattress will monitor your nightmares. Your fridge will beep for more cheese. Your front door will sweep wide the moment you approach, like some silent butler,\" he said.<br/>The cost of this efficiency and convenience is the loss of our privacy as the IoT stores all of our secrets in the cloud. Alexa will listen to our every command, but also our every conversation.<br/>\u00a0<br/>As bizarre and unhinged as Johnson's speech seemed, his point was not invalid. Emergent technologies can be used for good or evil, and without any regulatory control, there would be nothing to stop the misuse of advanced tech. He called the UN to task on finding a global set of rules to ensure this does not happen.<br/>\"The mission of the United Kingdom, and all who share our values, must be to ensure that emerging technologies are designed from the outset for freedom, openness, and pluralism, with the right safeguards in place to protect our peoples,\" Johnson said to the assembly.<br/>He concluded giving the UN members an open invitation to attend a 2020 summit in London to discuss ethical and responsible technology.<br/>Big Data insists it can self-regulate, but we have seen how platforms like Facebook and Google have exploited users data. Politicians in the UK, US, and other counties have been yammering for formal controls and have implemented some. The GDPR is just one example.<br/>However, they must also be careful to strike a balance that protects the consumer without stifling innovation.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M-263093</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFJ-6271-DYDW-72M0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"342\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 7, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Besides Britain, it also operates in several countries in Europe and Asia, including Germany, France, Italy and Australia.</p><p>The investigation comes as the regulator is taking a more activist role in seeking to protect consumers in an evolving marketplace.</p><p>\"This type of deal is right in the CMA's area of interest at the moment - large tech incumbents like Amazon investing in smaller rivals - so called 'killer acquisitions,'\" said Nicole Kar, head of the London Competition Practice at law firm Linklaters.</p><p>\"You might not think there is much competition between Deliveroo and Amazon right at present given Deliveroo is very focused on food delivery but that's too simplistic. Amazon wants to get any product to the customer fast and to 'own'the customer for everything they possibly want to buy in their life and every way they want it delivered.\"</p><p>American authorities are likewise taking steps to reign in the growing power of large tech firms. The U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are moving to investigate Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple over their aggressive business practices. In the U.S. Congress, the House Judiciary Committee has announced an antitrust probe, promising \"a top-to-bottom review of the market power held by giant tech platforms.\"</p><p>In the U.K., observers have noted a change of direction at the CMA since Chair Andrew Tyrie took over last year. From the moment he started Tyrie has promised to play a crucial role in Britain's global competitiveness.</p><p>But even so, the decisions this week marked a change of tone, if not direction.</p><p>\"The CMA's move comes as a surprise and suggests that the new regime is much more interventionalist than in the past,\" said Clive Black, the head of research at financial firm Shore Capital. \"As well as the focus upon an investment as opposed to a total take-over, this move by the regulator may also spell a change of view around mega-tech and their expansion in the U.K.\"</p><p>British authorities on Wednesday launched a \"digital markets strategy,\" to respond to online platforms and to make the U.K. competition rules fit for the modern age.</p><p>In the case of Amazon's deal, British authorities will be looking into whether Deliveroo's partnerships with grocers like the Co-Op might signal an intention to build food delivery services beyond the core Deliveroo model at the moment, which is the delivery of food-to-go from restaurants and cafes. Kar added that the watchdog would be looking at whether the investment Amazon made into Deliveroo would give the tech titan the right to determine strategy and investment.</p><p>The exact amount of money Amazon spent on the stake is unclear, but Deliveroo's last fundraising round brought in 450 million pounds ($700 million Cdn) from multiple investors, with Amazon becoming the largest.</p><p>The CMA could block any deal, as it did recently by halting the attempted supermarket merger of Sainsbury's and Walmart's Asda unit. The watchdog concluded that the creation of the country's biggest supermarket would push up prices and reduce quality for shoppers.</p><p>Both Amazon and Deliveroo pledged Friday to work closely with regulators.</p><p>\"There are a number of major companies within the restaurant food delivery sector and this investment will enable Deliveroo to expand, innovate and, we believe, will enhance competition,\" Deliveroo said in a statement.</p><p>Amazon says the expansion will benefit consumers by increasing choice and by \"creating new jobs as more restaurants gain access to the service.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The Associated Press;

The two have published the Online Harm White Paper. UK Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said \"the era of self-regulation for online companies is over\" and that voluntary action from industry to tackle online harms \"have not been applied consistently or gone far enough.\" The proposals are open for a 12-week public consultation that ends on July 1, after which DCMS will review and refine the white paper into a legislation. The proposal includes:</p><p><br/><br/>1. A new regulator: A new independent regulator will be introduced to ensure companies' compliance with laws; the regulator will have the power to impose fines, block access to sites, and hold individual executives responsible for violation any new laws. Business Insider reports that the fines could reach billions of dollars for the biggest companies. The regulator may also have the power to force social media platforms to published annual transparency reports on harmful content and their measures to address it.<br/><br/>2. Duty of care on tech companies: Companies will be required to take steps to ensure users safety and tackle illegal and harmful activity on their services. The proposal seeks to tackle incitement of violence, encouragement of self harm, disinformation, cyber bullying, and children's access to inappropriate content, among other things. The regulator will define a \"code of best practice\" to which social networks and internet companies must adhere.<br/><br/>3. Measures for online safety<br/><br/>* Prevention of distribution of content containing child abuse and terrorist activity<br/><br/>* Making companies respond to users' complaints and address them quickly<br/><br/>* Requirements to minimise the spread of misleading and harmful disinformation, with dedicated fact checkers, particularly during elections<br/><br/>* Safety by design to help companies incorporate safety features into apps and platforms<br/><br/>* Media literacy strategies to deal with harmful online behaviour like grooming, catfishing, and extremism.<br/><br/>Big Tech regulation worldwide</p><p>* Google's global public policy chief has called for \"common rules of the road\" globally and has said that he welcomes \"convergence\" of regulation across countries</p><p>* US Presidential Candidate Elizabeth Warren announced a plan to break up large tech companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook<br/><br/>* The UK itself has said that there is a need to overhaul anti-trust laws in technology<br/><br/>* Google was fined a record 1.49 billion in Europe for antitrust violations in search ads brokering monopoly<br/><br/>* Facebook is facing seven separate data protection-related inquiries in Ireland; a total of 16 cases target Twitter, Apple, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and Instagram.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0047137446</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VW6-HSC1-DXMP-K22H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"469\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This is the first time since 1956 that the lavish banquet has been cancelled, according to the foundation. The event traditionally marks the end of the so-called Nobel Week, when the year's prize-winners are invited to Swedish capital Stockholm for talks and the award ceremony. \"The Nobel Week will not be as it usually is due to the current pandemic. This is a very special year when everyone needs to make sacrifices and adapt to completely new circumstances,\" Lars Heikensten, director of the Nobel Foundation, said in a statement. Joe Biden, in a scathing speech in his campaign to become the next US president, said Donald Trump had 'quit' on US citizens and did not care about America. In a speech on his plan for the economy, in which he promised to expand access to preschool for working families, directly linking the need for affordable childcare to America's economic recovery, Biden said Trump was not taking the public health crisis seriously: Hi, Helen Sullivan joining you now from a crisp Sydney. As always, it would be great to hear from you. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:helen.sullivan@theguardian.com\">helen.sullivan@theguardian.com</email> Brazil has confirmed 41,008 more cases in the past 24 hours, as well as 1,367 related deaths, the country's health ministry has said. Brazil has registered nearly 2.2m cases since the pandemic began, while the official death toll has risen to 81,487, according to ministry data. The US president Donald Trump has asked Americans to wear masks \"whether you like the mask or not\", despite repeatedly downplaying the importance of wearing masks and refusing to wear one on many occasions. The president was first seen wearing a mask publicly earlier this month. At a White House press briefing, he has noted a \"concerning rise\" in cases in parts of the South, in a complete shift from his previous strategy - refusing to acknowledge that there is a problem. He stayed uncharacteristically on-message, saying the government is \"asking Americans to use masks, socially distance and employ vigorous hygiene - wash your hands every chance you get\". He also asked younger people to \"avoid packed bars and other crowded indoor gatherings.\" The US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has launched an extraordinary attack on the World Health Organization during a private meeting in the UK, accusing it of being in the pocket of China and responsible for \"dead Britons\" who passed away during the pandemic, Dan Sabbagh and Heather Stewart write. Pompeo told those present he believed the WHO was \"political, not a science-based organisation\" and accused its current director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of being too close to Beijing. Those present at the meeting on Tuesday said that Pompeo told his audience of 20 MPs and peers that he was saying \"on a firm intelligence foundation, a deal was made\" with China to allow Tedros to win election in 2017. The secretary of state went on to to claim \"when push came to shove, you've got dead Britons because of the deal that was made\" - without providing any further details. His remarks at the meeting organised by the Henry Jackson Society thinktank came in response to a question from Chris Bryant, one of two Labour MPs present in a meeting otherwise dominated by Conservatives, who had challenged him over the Trump administration's repeated decisions to quit multilateral organisations. The euro hit an 18-month high and stock markets gained ground after the EU agreed a (EURO)750bn pandemic recovery fund, in a deal struck hot on the heels of reports that a coronavirus vaccine could be ready within months. After more than four days of tortuous negotiation, the EU's 27 leaders resolved to issue debt jointly, with the proceeds to be disbursed to countries wrestling with an economic downturn not seen since the Great Depression. The accord built on optimism sparked by the nascent success in trials of a coronavirus vaccine pioneered at Oxford University. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has suggested the vaccine could be ready by the end of the year. California's governor has granted an emergency release to Patricia Wright, a 69-year-old woman battling terminal cancer inside a prison that has suffered a major outbreak. Wright, who doctors say has months to live, left prison on Tuesday morning for the first time in 23 years, greeted by her five children, three sisters and a dozen other relatives waiting on the other side of the gates at the California Institution for Women (CIW), east of Los Angeles. The family's long fight for her release became increasingly urgent due to Covid-19, which has infected more than 160 people at CIW and nearly 7,000 people across the state's prison system. \"I've been waiting for this day for 23 years, it is really indescribable,\" said Wright, standing on the street outside CIW as her grandchildren and other loved ones swarmed her with hugs and handed her flowers and gifts, including her first iPhone. She danced and held her hands in the air. \"Oh my God! I'm walking on cloud nine ... I just want to sit down at the table with my family and embrace my children.\" Wright, who has battled breast and ovarian cancer and is legally blind, is undergoing chemotherapy. She spoke of her fears of dying alone behind bars in recent interviews with the Guardian, and is one of tens of thousands of older and at-risk prisoners who have been pleading for some form of clemency in response to Covid-19. Since March, 40 prisoners have died and those numbers are expected to increase in the coming weeks. \"For the past 23 years, I've had this burden in my heart every day. I could not live fully thinking about my sister in prison,\" said Chantel Bonet, who years earlier moved to the city of Corona, where the prison is located, so she could be closer to her sister. \"Now that burden is lifted.\" Wright, a survivor of domestic violence, was accused of hiring someone to kill her abusive husband but has maintained her innocence. She is one of many women convicted of murder under US laws that have faced widespread scrutiny for targeting victims of abuse. She was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, meaning this kind of direct action from the governor was her only option. Here's a summary of the latest developments: The United States is failing to report vital information on Covid-19. The data would help authorities track the spread of the disease and prevent the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans, according to the first comprehensive review of the nation's coronavirus data. Covid-19 is showing no signs of \"slowing down\" in the Americas. Carissa Etienne, the Pan American Health Organization director, said there were surges in Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia and Peru. Etienne also said some central American nations were seeing their highest weekly increase of cases since the pandemic began. UK records 110 new coronavirus-related deaths. A further 110 people have died in the UK after testing positive for Covid-19 across all settings - including hospitals and the wider community. The total number of recorded coronavirus deaths in the country now stands at 45,422, according to government figures. Spain will send (EURO)1.7 billion in aid to developing countries to help them deal with coronavirus outbreak. Spain will send (EURO)1.7bn in aid to developing countries to help them deal with coronavirus pandemic, foreign minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya said on Tuesday. Spain hopes to save lives and strengthen public health systems. Iran announces record daily deaths. The health ministry said 229 people have died of coronavirus in the past 24 hours, a new high as the country struggles to contain the virus. Italy to receive (EURO)210bn from new EU fund. Some EU member states have been setting out how much financial support they are likely to receive following the (EURO)750bn deal struck at the end of a marathon negotiating session on Tuesday morning. In the US state of Texas, more than 500 women at a federal medical prison have tested positive, the Bureau of Prisons has said. According to the Associated Press, it is one of the largest confirmed outbreaks at a federal prison. The number of confirmed cases at the Federal Medical Center-Carswell in Fort Worth jumped to 509 on Monday, just one day after the Bureau of Prisons reported that 200 women there had tested positive. Only the federal prison in Seagoville, also located in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, had more infected inmates, with 1,132 cases as of Monday. The Trump administration does want to make sure coronavirus testing is funded, the US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin has claimed, after the president's fellow Republicans said the White House was blocking funding for key tests. We want to make sure there's plenty of money for testing. And that's a big priority. Mnuchin said he had held productive meetings with appropriations committee members. About 2,000 Israelis rallied outside the prime minister's residence in Jerusalem on Tuesday as protests mounted against Benjamin Netanyahu over his handling of its worsening epidemic, as well as alleged corruption. Wearing protective masks, the demonstrators marched from Netanyahu's official residence to Israel's parliament, holding up signs that read \"Crime Minister\" and calling on the five-term premier to step down. Reimposed curbs after a rise in new cases have prompted Israelis demanding better state aid to take to the streets in almost daily demonstrations. Public anger has been also been fuelled by corruption alleged against Netanyahu, who went on trial in May for bribery, fraud and breach of trust; charges he denies. France has confirmed 584 new cases in the past 24 hours, according to the latest health ministry data. The total number now stands at 177,338, the ministry said. The number of people in hospitals with the virus was down 107, and the number in intensive care was down by 12, the figures showed. The ministry revised down slightly its figure for the total death toll since the start of the outbreak, to 30,165 from 30,177 a day earlier. It did not immediately give a reason for the revision, Reuters has reported. The United States is failing to report vital information on Covid-19.

Sales of alcohol, tea and coffee in UK supermarkets and corner shops have soared since the lockdown as the nation's drinking habits have become home-based. The value of beer, wine and spirits sold through grocers was up 41% in the past month, even though pubs in England started to reopen on 4 July, as consumers continue to eat and drink at home. Scottish pubs followed suit on 6 July. Grocery stores also rang up an extra \u00a324m in tea and coffee sales in the past month, and an additional \u00a319m on biscuits - marking a massive shift away from takeaway lattes towards boiling the kettle. The sharp rise in sales of beer, wine and spirits in the past month has underpinned the fastest rise in grocery sales since records began 26 years ago. Sales of groceries, excluding takeaway food and drink, rose nearly 17% in the three months to 12 July, with local shops and online services accounting for the bulk of that growth, according to the market research firm Kantar. The UK government aims to secure stocks not of one vaccine or even two - but up to 12 that are being developed around the world, hedging its bets to ensure it has something that works as early as possible to try to end the health, social and economic havoc being wreaked by Covid-19. As Oxford University published its first results, showing its vaccine is safe and provokes a good immune response, Kate Bingham, chair of the government's vaccines taskforce, explained that the strategy was to have an entire portfolio, not just one star player. On Monday the government announced it was investing in BioNTech/Pfizer's vaccine and a second being developed by the French company Valneva which has a manufacturing site in Scotland. That is a total of 90 million doses, almost as many as the 100 million secured from Oxford. Bingham said: The strategy has been very clear. We have no template to show us how to make a vaccine against coronavirus because it has never been done. So the intention is to \"explore the landscape\" and select a few out of each of the four \"buckets\" as she described them - the different modalities or technologies being used around the world in vaccine development. EU leaders seal 'historic' (EURO)750bn Covid-19 recovery plan Covid-19 is showing no signs of \"slowing down\" in the Americas, according to the Pan American Health Organization director, amid surges in Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia and Peru. During a virtual briefing from the organisation's Washington base on Tuesday, Carissa Etienne also said some central American nations were seeing their highest weekly increase of cases since the pandemic began. She added that because of the high burden of infectious diseases and chronic conditions in the continent, three out of ten people - 325 million - were at \"increased risk\" of developing complications from the virus. The Nobel prize banquet has been cancelled for the first time in over 50 years over fears about the spread of coronavirus. Winners for 2020 will be announced this year, but the banquet - which is held on December 10 in Stockholm and normally draws around 1,300 guests - will not go ahead, Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter has reported. \"There are two problems. You can not gather that many people next to each other. And it is uncertain whether people can travel to Sweden to the extent they want,\" Nobel Foundation Chairman Lars Heikensten told the newspaper. The banquet was last cancelled in 1956 in protest of the Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary. It was also cancelled during World War One and Two. Nobel prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace were created and funded in the will of the Swedish dynamite inventor, Alfred Nobel, and have been awarded since 1901.

A further 110 people have died in the UK after testing positive for Covid-19 across all settings - including hospitals and the wider community. The total number of recorded coronavirus deaths in the country now stands at 45,422, according to government figures. As of Tuesday, a further 445 people tested positive for the virus, bringing the total caseload to 295,817. The US Justice Department has indicted two Chinese nationals for hacking defence contractors, COVID researchers, and other companies worldwide, according to a court filing published on Tuesday. Reuters reports: US authorities said the Chinese nationals, Li Xiaoyu and Dong Jiazhi, participated in a multiyear cyberespionage campaign that stole weapons designs, drug information, software source code and more. Contact details for the pair were not immediately available. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately return a message seeking comment. The indictment did not name any specific companies, but it said that Li and Dong stole terabytes of data from computers around the world, including the United States, Britain, Germany, Australia and Belgium. The United States is failing to report vital information on Covid-19 that could help track the spread of the disease and prevent the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans, according to the first comprehensive review of the nation's coronavirus data. The report, Tracking Covid-19 in the United States, paints a bleak picture of the country's response to the disease. Five months into the pandemic, the essential intelligence that would allow public health authorities to get to grips with the virus is still not being compiled in usable form. That includes critical data on testing, contact tracing, new cases and deaths. What the authors call \"life-and-death information\" is being pulled together haphazardly by individual states in a way that is \"inconsistent, incomplete and inaccessible in most locations\". Without such intelligence the country is effectively walking blind, with very little chance of getting \"our children to school in the fall, ourselves back to work, our economy restarted, and preventing tens of thousands of deaths\". The review has been carried out by Resolve to Save Lives, a part of the global health group Vital Strategies. It is led by Tom Frieden, the former director of the main US public health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Governments around the world have been warned by the International Monetary Fund to take swift action to limit the economic damage for women that has been unleashed by Covid-19. Sounding the alarm over the disproportionate impact on women amid the worst global recession since the 1930s Great Depression, the Washington-based organisation said the pandemic threatened to roll back gains in women's economic opportunities, widening gender gaps that persist despite 30 years of progress. The IMF said governments needed to use the full power of their tax and spending toolkit to extend income support to the most vulnerable people, protect employment and provide incentives to balance work and family care responsibilities. Warning of the impact for women around the world, it said policies could be designed to tackle gender inequality by creating the right conditions and incentives for women to work. It said investing in education and infrastructure, subsidising childcare and offering parental leave would be vital to a sustainable recovery from Covid-19. Here's a dispatch from Jeff Abbott from Guatemala. The lines for a solidarity soup kitchen in Guatemala's historic center begin to form hours before volunteers begin to hand out plates of freshly prepared food from the solidarity soup kitchen, known as the Community Pot - Olla Comunitaria in Spanish. Each day for nearly four months volunteers have gathered at the Rayuela bar and restaurant to prepare meals for Guatemala's most vulnerable populations affected by the measures taken to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the Central American country. According to Byron Vasquez who owns La Rayuela, they only began to hand out food to homeless people, but as the impacts of the government's measures to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic they saw more need among unemployed workers. \"Little by little whole families who had been left without work began to arrive,\" Vasquez told The Guardian. The pandemic created a whole new problem for those in poverty in Guatemala. Unemployment has risen significantly, and those in the informal economy struggle to provide food for their families. Since April, the number of people arriving has grown from around 100 to nearly 1500 per day, Vasquez estimates. Since June they have served long lines of people in the Central Plaza to make the need that exists in Guatemala visible to the country. Spain is not holding talks with other EU countries over the potential closure of land borders, foreign minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya said on Tuesday, according to a report by Reuters. The statement follows reports that France could consider such a move over coronavirus worries. French prime minister Jean Castex on Sunday did not rule out closing the border with Spain, which is struggling to control a fresh surge of coronavirus cases. Most of the infections are located in Catalonia, which borders France. Which countries can UK holidaymakers visit without restrictions on arrival? Here's a guide by Antonia Wilson in light of the government's updated travel corridor list. People were more likely to contract coronavirus from members of their own households than from contacts outside the home, according to a study published by South Korean epidemiologists in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Reuters reports: A study published in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on July 16 looked in detail at 5,706 \"index patients\" who had tested positive for the coronavirus and more than 59,000 people who came into contact with them. The findings showed just two out of 100 infected people had caught the virus from non-household contacts, while one in 10 had contracted the disease from their own families. By age group, the infection rate within the household was higher when the first confirmed cases were teenagers or people in their 60s and 70s. \"This is probably because these age groups are more likely to be in close contact with family members as the group is in more need of protection or support,\" Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) and one of the authors of the study, told a briefing. Spain will send (EURO)1.7bn in aid to developing countries to help them deal with coronavirus pandemic, Foreign minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya said on Tuesday after a cabinet meeting, according to a report by Reuters. Spain aims to help save lives and strengthen public health systems and also protect and restore rights and capacities, among other goals, Gonzalez Laya told a news conference. Australian police on Tuesday warned the public of \"insidious\" online predators that were targeting new child victims during the coronavirus outbreak. The warning comes after a surge in coronavirus infections put Melbourne, the country's second-largest city, under partial lockdown. Reuters reports: Australian health authorities said it could take weeks to tame the COVID-19 outbreak after hundreds of new cases reported in the state of Victoria, whose capital Melbourne is in partial lockdown. The measures prompted the Australian federal police to urge parents to ensure their children do not fall victim to \"insidious online predators\", after abuse cases spiked during a national lockdown in March. Traffic to websites hosting online child sexual abuse content skyrocketed during the earlier lockdown and such material posted to the dark web doubled, police said. \"We suspect that offenders will use this second wave of COVID-19 as an opportunity to find more potential child victims, as young people spend an increasing amount of time online with limited adult supervision,\" police commander Jamie Strauss said. The UK Ministry of Justice has said that new rules that allow youth detention facilities to hold children in solitary confinement for up to 22 hours a day to prevent the spread of Covid-19 could remain in place for two years despite lockdown measures being relaxed for the rest of the UK. Lawyers have told the Guardian that time out of cells and access to education are still being severely curtailed in many facilities across the country. \"The recent announcement by the MoJ that these restrictions could go on in some form until next year or even further is very concerning,\" said Jude Lanchin of Bindmans solicitors. Lanchin told the Guardian that one of her clients, a 16-year-old held in a secure training centre, was being severely affected by having to spend every day alone in his cell. \"My client is on remand and has not even been convicted of an offence. It has been extremely difficult to work with him on the case and I was only able to see him recently on video-link for the first time after months of detention,\" she said. \"He has told me the hours in his cell mean 'things go round and round in my head'. As a 'looked-after' child in care, he already had issues of concern and has now become depressed, anxious and agitated.\" Six Victorian prisons have been placed in lockdown after an officer working at a men's jail in Melbourne, Australia tested positive for Covid-19, prompting calls from legal groups to release low-risk prisoners during the pandemic. The officer, who the Guardian understands is male, is employed by GEO, the private correctional services provider which operates the Ravenhall Correctional Centre in Melbourne's west. While he had been in self-isolation since 16 July after learning he was a close contact of a confirmed Covid-19 case, five further facilities - Hopkins Correctional Centre, Langi Kal Kal Prison, Barwon Prison, Fulham and Loddon - have been placed in lockdown while Corrections Victoria investigates which other staff and prisoners he may have had contact with. The Guardian understands that while the officer only worked at the Ravenhall facility, officers and prisoners he came into contact with may have moved to different facilities. A Victorian justice department spokeswoman told the Guardian \"measures are being taken in line with Corrections Victoria's coronavirus management plans\". US deaths from coronavirus rose for a second week in a row to more than 5,200 in the week ending 19 July, up 5% from the previous seven days, according to an analysis by Reuters. Reuters reports: The country reported over 460,000 new coronavirus cases last week, up nearly 15% from the prior week, according to the analysis of data from The Covid Tracking Project, a volunteer-run effort to track the outbreak. Nineteen states have reported increases in deaths for at least two straight weeks, including, Arizona, Florida and Texas. Testing for Covid-19 rose by 9% in the United States last week and set a new record high on Friday, with over 850,000 tests performed, the Reuters analysis found. Australia has recorded 12,428 cases of coronavirus since the outbreak began, according to the latest figures. The country has had 126 deaths. The Australian department for health has published the following infographic. In the US, a poll has found that a third of Americans believe official figures overstate the number of people who have died from coronavirus. This week's Axios-Ipsos Coronavirus Index has found \"most Americans believe others are making the pandemic worse\". They also find that more Americans, particularly Republicans, are denying the official toll of the pandemic. The report comes as US hospitalisations have hit a record level in seven states. For all the latest on coronavirus developments from the US, you can also head over to our US live blog: In the UK, the health secretary Matt Hancock has announced an urgent review into how Public Health England (PHE) counts Covid-19 deaths after discovering what appeared to be a serious issue in how rates are calculated. Following the health secretary's move on Friday, Yoon K Loke and Carl Heneghan, of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University, wrote in a blogpost: \"It seems that PHE regularly looks for people on the NHS database who have ever tested positive, and simply checks to see if they are still alive or not. PHE does not appear to consider how long ago the Covid test result was, nor whether the person has been successfully treated in hospital and discharged to the community.\" A Department of Health and Social Care source summed this up as: \"You could have been tested positive in February, have no symptoms, then be hit by a bus in July and you'd be recorded as a Covid death.\" When the Guardian put this to a source at PHE, they said that such a scenario would \"technically\" be counted as a coronavirus death, \"though the numbers where that situation would apply are likely to be very small\". PHE says it calculates deaths in this way because, in most circumstances, it cannot dismiss the possibility that Covid-19 could have played a role in the death. But does this mean PHE's figures are much higher than the actual virus death rate? Not quite. Read the full analysis by Pamela Duncan, Nicola Davis and Niamh McIntyre here: Hello, I'm Aamna taking over the blog from my colleague Josh for the rest of the day. If you want to get in touch, you can email me (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com\">aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com</email>) or contact me on Twitter (@aamnamohdin) Iran's health ministry says 229 people have died of coronavirus in the past 24 hours, a new high as the country struggles to contain the virus. The country's death toll now stands at 14,634 people with nearly 300,000 confirmed cases. Oman will ban travel between all provinces from 25 July to 8 August to prevent the spread of coronavirus, state media have reported. The Gulf state will also implement a daily 7pm to 6am curfew during that same period, which includes the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha. Shops and public spaces will be closed during the curfew hours, state news agency ONA has said. Spain's prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has welcomed the (EURO)750bn EU deal, saying: \"Europe has shown it knows how to respond when faced with a historic challenge by coming up with a historic deal.\" S\u00e1nchez also said the agreement would go down in EU history, adding: \"Today, all Europeans are winners and the EU has emerged far stronger.\" Coronavirus has claimed more than 28,000 lives in Spain to date. Despite the success of the country's stringent lockdown in dramatically reducing the spread of the disease, more than 200 clusters have erupted following the end of the state of emergency - many of them in and around the Catalan cities of Barcelona and Lleida. Over the weekend, 4,581 new cases of the virus were logged, bringing the total number of Covid-19 cases in Spain to 264,836. The latest figures from the health ministry show that the number of cases per 100,000 people in Spain has tripled over the past three weeks, rising from 8.76 to 27.39. The health minister, Salvador Illa, said most of the new clusters involved family gatherings or nightlife venues, and has called for people to respect guidelines. Many Spanish regions have made the wearing of masks compulsory even in situations where social distancing of 1.5m is possible. On Friday, the Catalan regional government - which has been criticised for its slow response - called on four million people, including those in Barcelona, to stay at home. But the call was not mandatory and many people flocked to beaches over the weekend. Some 160,000 people are currently in compulsory lockdown around Lleida. Indonesia has reported 1,655 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total number of infections to 89,869, according to official data released by the government. The number of fatalities due to Covid-19 rose by 81 on Tuesday to reach a total of 4,320, the data showed, while 48,466 people have recovered from the virus. Most of the nurses in Ireland who got Covid-19 and supposedly recovered from it are still experiencing symptoms such as fatigue, headaches and breathing problems, according to a nurses union. The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation said of 545 respondents who told the union they had recovered, 497 stated they continued to experience symptoms, including mental health difficulties. The results suggests some of the nurses may be so-called \"long-haulers\". The union is to present the findings in a written submission on Tuesday to a parliamentary special committee on Covid-19, RTE reported. In a separate submission the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union (Siptu) said some healthcare workers did not declare symptoms to employers because they feared losing overtime and premiums put on leave. The union said shortages of personal protective equipment had eased, with 77% of its health service members saying they now had enough PPE, versus 19% who said they did not. Andrej Babis, the prime minister of the Czech Republic, found a clever way to get some much-needed sleep on the flight home from the marathon EU Covid-19 talks: Hong Kong has recorded two new deaths from Covid-19, bringing the total number of fatalities to 14, the health authority has announced. Two men, one aged 77 and another 87-year-old aged care home resident, died on Tuesday. Hong Kong is in the grips of its third and worst wave of the virus, after being considered to have one of the most successful responses to the outbreak earlier in the year, and is attempting to avoid an economically devastating lockdown. However, the government and health authorities are dealing with daily virus counts in double or triple figures from numerous clusters, and large numbers of cases having no known source of infection. The government has also faced criticism that it allowed too many exemptions in its quarantine rules. Dr Leung Chi-chiu, the chair of the medical association's advisory committee on communicable diseases, told local radio on Tuesday it was up to people to stay home as much as they could. He said a lockdown on the city would be a \"point of no return\" economically, and wouldn't necessarily cut the chains of transmission. Testing labs are reportedly nearing capacity, and the Hong Kong Public Doctors' Association president told RTHK people should only seek testing when necessary. In recent days there have been up to 10,000 daily tests conducted, compared with a usual 7,500. Quarantine beds are also reportedly at 80% capacity, as the government looks to open up new facilities Russia has reported 5,842 new cases of coronavirus, pushing its total infection tally to 783,328, the fourth largest in the world. The country's coronavirus response centre said 153 people had died in the past 24 hours, bringing Russia's overall death toll from the virus to 12,580. Unsurprisingly, the huge European recovery plan has not been welcomed by anti-EU and far-right figures. The French far-right leader Marine Le Pen describes the deal as \"the worst agreement for France in the history of the EU\". She says Emmanuel Macron has sacrificed \"our future and our independence\" to \"protect his ego\". Geert Wilders, of the Netherlands, called it a \"(EURO)390bn gift for southern Europe\". Jessica Stegrud MEP, a member of the nationalist Sweden Democrats party, said the deal hands \"more power to Brussels\", saves the Eurozone in the short term and hits \"indebted Swedish taxpayers\". Some EU member states have been setting out how much financial support they are likely to receive following the (EURO)750bn deal struck at the end of a marathon negotiating session on Tuesday morning. Italy will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Covid-19 recovery fund as it is one of the hardest hit countries in Europe. Giuseppe Conte, the Italian prime minister, said it would receive 28% ((EURO)210bn) of the fund, of which (EURO)81bn would be in grants and (EURO)127bn in repayable loans. Spain, which has also been badly hit, will also receive one of the highest amounts. It will receive (EURO)140bn, just over half of which ((EURO)72.7bn) will be grants and the remainder in loans to be repaid. Greece said it would be allocated (EURO)72bn, though there was no detail on what proportion of that would be in grants. France said it would get (EURO)40bn in subsidies as part of the EU package. The French government said it will set out more detail of its recovery plan on 24 August. Passengers of China-bound flights must provide negative Covid-19 test results before boarding, China's aviation authority has said. The Chinese government has sought to reduce the risk of imported coronavirus cases as international travel resumes. On Tuesday, it said passengers flying to China must complete nucleic acid tests within five days of boarding and that these should be conducted at facilities designated or recognised by Chinese embassies in host countries. The embassies will carefully assess the testing capacity of host countries and formulate travel procedures when testing conditions are met, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said. The (EURO)750bn deal is the \"most important economic decision since the introduction of the euro,\" according to the EU's economy commissioner Paolo Gentiloni, who said the most difficult challenge for the commission starts now. German chancellor Angela Merkel said the \"extraordinary events\" of the coronavirus pandemic required \"extraordinary new methods\" to help nations recover. Merkel added: We have laid the financial foundations for the EU for the next seven years and came up with a response to this arguably biggest crisis of the European Union. Merkel and president Emmanuel Macron of France, reportedly walked out of a negotiating meeting over the weekend in protest as the prospect of a deal with their EU counterparts looked remote. Merkel and Macron initially wanted the deal to include (EURO)500bn in grants to nations - but this was opposed by the self-proclaimed \"frugal four\" five wealthy northern nations led by the Netherlands. The final deal, struck in the early hours of this morning, is formed of (EURO)390bn in grants after the two sides reached a compromise. It is thought that Italy and Spain will be the main recipients of the grants, as the two EU nations hardest hit by the pandemic. The total number of coronavirus cases in Ukraine has reached 60,166 and 1,518 people died as of 21 July, Ukrainian health minister Maksym Stepanov has said, according to Reuters. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last week Ukrainians were fed up with the coronavirus lockdown and the government should be cautious about extending it. The Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has described the historic EU deal as a \"national success\" that would allocate Greece (EURO)72bn to help the country recover from Covid-19. \"Today we have managed a very ambitious response, a response which responds to the symmetrical shock which the pandemic has triggered in all economies,\" Mitsotakis said. He said the funds would be disbursed carefully in Greece and with meticulous planning: We have no intention of spreading the money around with the carefree attitude of the nouveau-riche. We have no intention of wasting this significant European capital now at our disposal. We will invest it to the benefit of all Greeks. Most of the UK front pages this morning focus on the glimmer of hope presented by the search for a potential Covid-19 vaccine: The Daily Telegraph leads with a story on the anticipated Russia report, due to be released by parliament's intelligence and security committee in a matter of hours. The paper reports that the committee has found that Russia meddled in the Scottish independence referendum in 2014 but, somewhat surprisingly, not the UK's EU referendum in 2016. Hello. It's Josh Halliday in Manchester, England, taking over from my colleague Alison Rourke for the next few hours of coronavirus news. Europe agrees Covid-19 recovery plan. European council president Charles Michel said the agreement was a \"pivotal moment\" as heads of state finally thrashed out a deal on day five of their summit. It set out a (EURO)750bn pandemic recovery fund and long-term spending plans. WHO warns over Covid-19's spread in Africa. The group warned that South Africa's growing numbers could be a \"precursor\" for outbreaks elsewhere on the continent. South Africa has 373,000 cases - around half the continent's cases. \"South Africa may unfortunately be a precursor, it may be a warning for what will happen in the rest of Africa,\" said the WHO emergencies chief, Michael Ryan. While South Africa's numbers were by far the largest, they had \"only\" increased by 30% in the past week, Ryan said. By comparison, numbers in Kenya had increased by 31%, in Madagascar by 50%, in Zambia by 57% and in Namibia by 69%, he pointed out. Donald Trump hails masks as \"patriotic\" and vows to restart daily briefings. The US president tweeted a picture of himself in a mask saying: \"Many people say it is patriotic to wear a face mask when you can't socially distance\". He publicly wore a mask for the first time during the pandemic on a visit about 10 days ago to the Walter Reed military hospital outside Washington. The president also said he planned to restart daily coronavirus briefings from Tuesday. Brazil's health ministry has reported the country's death toll has passed 80,000 and the number of cases is now 2.1m. It comes as two more Brazilian government ministers said on Monday they had tested positive for Covid-19. The hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia will begin on 29 July. The drastically scaled back event will include only around 1,000 Muslim pilgrims due to the pandemic. Mexico's health ministry on Monday reported 5,172 new confirmed coronavirus infections and 301 additional fatalities, bringing the total in the country to 349,396 cases and 39,485 deaths. Australia's southern state of Victoria reported 374 new coronavirus cases. The state has introduced mandatory face coverings from 11.59pm on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, extended Covid-19 job support payments, but reduced the size of the payments. New Zealand reported one new case of Covid-19 in a returned traveller. The woman in her 30s arrived in the country on 16 July from London via Doha and Sydney. She has been transferred to an Auckland quarantine facility. European stock markets are set to rise sharply this morning thanks to the EU leaders' deal in Brussels. Germany's DAX index is expected to lead the way with a rise of more than 1% and the French CAC is due to open up by almost the same. Austria's chancellor Sebastian Kurz thanked his colleagues for reaching the \"good deal\", especially the self-proclaimed \"frugals\" - Sweden, Denmark, Austria and the Netherlands - along with Finland, who had opposed allowing (EURO)500bn to be offered in the form of grants to countries hardest-hit by Covid-19. The BBC's Europe reporter Gavin Lee is quoting Angela Merkel on the deal, including an apparent shot at the UK. This tweet from the European council press office shows the size of the economic recovery package relative to overall EU funding. Charles Michel, the European council president, has tweeted a video of leaders looking happy and relieved that the deal has been done. Italy's prime minister Giuseppe Conte says EU leaders have approved an ambitious recovery plan that will allow the EU to face the crisis with strength and effectiveness. The Dutch PM, Mark Rutte, said he saw \"no disappointments\" in the EU deal. \"Our relations with European partners remains strong, despite difficult negotiations,\" Rutte said. The French president says the European deal is \"historic\". He said he was convinced that the recovery plan and budget could meet the challenge, adding that concessions were made to reach the deal. He said the compromises that were made were proportionate and necessary. \"There is no such thing as a perfect world, but we have made progress,\" Macron told a news briefing. Michel hails the European council decision on the deal: \"We are united and we send the message 'Europe is strong',\" he says. He's asked about member states or the EU parliament raising objections to parts of the deal. Michel says both countries and the parliament need to be respected. He says he knows it will be difficult and he will have to explain the reasons for the decisions that have been taken. \"With constant dialogue it will be possible to implement what we have decided today,\" he says. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of European commission, is speaking now. She says there's \"a lot of work ahead of us\" concerning the future of Europe, that is \"badly needed\". Both leaders agree the deal is an historic moment. They give each other an elbow \"bump\", put their face masks back on and leave the press conference. EU leaders are holding news conference now about the deal they have reached. The European Council president, Charles Michel, says the EU is sending a strong signal that the union is \"solid, robust and united\", something he says is essential to \"face this crisis\". Here are some more of the details on the EU deal. The (EURO)750bn package will fund a recovery programme and long0term spending plans. It follows acrimonious debate at what was the bloc's longest summit in two decades. Talks went late into the night and then resumed at around 5am on Tuesday to seal the deal. The euro rose against the dollar on the news to stand at $1.145 on the news of the deal. You can read our full coverage of the deal below: Some breaking news... the EU has agreed the deal to implement its coronavirus recovery plan. The President of the European Council, Charles Michel, tweeted \"deal\" a few moments ago. The Reuters news agency is reporting that the US recorded 61,671 new cases of Covid-19 on Monday, taking the total cases to 3.85m. I'm still waiting for the CDC to update their Monday figures, but on Sunday it said the US recorded 63,201 new cases It's worth noting that the the CDC's seven-day rolling average for new cases is is 66,022. Los Angeles county - the most populous county in the US - still has the highest number of confirmed cases, at 155,917. Cook county in Chicago - the second most populous US country - is second, with 98,670 cases. Maricopa country in Arizona, has the third most infections with 95,471 and Miami Dade in Florida is fourth, with 84,238 cases. EU leaders have resumed meeting to try to seal their (EURO)750bn Covid-19 recovery plan. A new \"spirit of compromise\" had been found, Emmanuel Macron said, despite the French president thumping the negotiating table at the Brussels event in frustration the previous evening and likening those thwarting his spending plans to the ill-fated British in previous budget negotiations. Tokyo is expected to report 230 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, according to Japanese media. Tokyo's governor, Koike Yuriko, told reporters the figure was still being checked, but she expects it will surpass 200 and reach about 230. It would be the first time in three days cases have exceeded 200. This year's hajj, which has been scaled back dramatically to include only around 1,000 Muslim pilgrims, will begin on 29 July, Saudi authorities said Monday. Some 2.5 million people usually participate in the ritual of several days, centred on the holy city of Mecca. \"The stand of pilgrims on Mount Arafat, the peak of the hajj ritual, falls on Thursday,\" the official Saudi Press Agency cited the supreme court as saying. The timing of the hajj is determined by the position of the moon, in accordance with the Islamic lunar calendar. Last month, Saudi Arabia announced it would hold a \"very limited\" hajj, a decision fraught with political and economic peril as it battles a surge in coronavirus infections with some 253,349 cases so far including 2,523 deaths - the highest in the Gulf. The hajj and the lesser umrah pilgrimage together usually rake in some $12 billion per year. Although hajj officials said the pilgrimage would be restricted to 1,000 people already present in the kingdom, 70% of them foreigners, some press reports have said that 10,000 people may take part. Saudi citizens will make up the remaining 30% of the pilgrims, with the ritual restricted to medical professionals and security personnel who have recovered from the virus, the hajj ministry said. The decision to exclude pilgrims arriving from outside Saudi Arabia is a first in the kingdom's modern history. Brazil will begin advanced clinical testing of a Chinese-made vaccine against the new coronavirus Tuesday, issuing the first doses to around 900 volunteers, Agence France-Presse reports. The coronavirus vaccine, developed by private Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac, is the third in the world to enter Phase 3 trials, or large-scale testing on humans - the last step before regulatory approval. It will be administered to doctors and other health workers who volunteer for the program across six states in Brazil, one of the countries hit hardest by the pandemic. \"Trials of CoronaVac, one of the vaccines that has advanced furthest in testing in the world, will begin at the Clinical Hospital of Sao Paulo,\" the state's governor, Joao Doria, told a news conference. He said initial results were expected within 90 days. Just while I'm on Australia, Bauer Media in the country has axed eight magazines including Harper's Bazaar, Elle and Men's Health, in the latest hit to the media industry. German-owned publisher cited a catastrophic drop in revenue due to impact of Covid-19 as reason for closures. InStyle, Women's Health, Good Health, NW and OK! magazines will also be axed. Bauer said the economic impact of a full month of Covid-19 lockdowns was a 38.8% month-on-month drop in media advertising expenditure. Seven of the titles had already been suspended by Bauer in May. You can read our full coverage below from our media correspondent, Amanda Meade. Australia's prime minister, Scott Morrison, is now giving a press conference which is expected to address the economic support measures put in place during the pandemic. \"Australia is a country that just doesn't look to survive these things. We don't go through challenges with our heads looking down. Overwhelmed by the circumstances, that is not who we are. Who we are is innovative adaptive people, supporting each other, reaching out to each other, drawing us all through, not for survival, but to be on the other side in the position where we can emerge strongly,\" Morrison says. He is explaining changes to the Jobkeeper and Jobseeker allowances that have helped to support those who have lost their jobs, and to help businesses keep their workers on during the crisis. The Jobkeeper payment will be reduced he says and there will be a lower payment for people working less than 20 hours per week. There will also be reductions to the Jobseeker or unemployment allowance - you can see all the details on our Australian live blog below. We are hearing the day's figures from Australia, where a serious outbreak in the southern state of Victoria has prompted a six-week lockdown in the capital of Melbourne and the adjacent Mitchell Shire. The state premiere, Daniel Andrews reported another 374 cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, and three deaths. Sixty-two of the new cases were connected to known and contained outbreaks, and 312 were under investigation. The deaths were of a woman in her 100s, a woman in her 90s and a woman in her 80s. Residents in Melbourne and Mitchell Shire to the city's north will be required to wear face masks or coverings from 11.59pm on Wednesday night. Both areas were returned to a six-week lockdown after the current outbreak grew significantly. The neighbouring state of New South Wales, which is the most populous state in the country, reported 13 new cases of coronavirus on Tuesday. All cases were related to known clusters and one was a returned traveller in hotel quarantine. New Zealand has reported one new case of Covid-19 in its managed isolation facilities. Newshub says the case is a woman in her 30s who arrived in the country on 16 July. She had flown from London via Doha and Sydney. She has been transferred to an Auckland quarantine facility. New Zealand continues to have no known cases of local transmission of Covid-19, with 81 days since a case of coronavirus was acquired locally from an unknown source. The WHO has warned of its concerns over the spread of Covid-19 in Africa and that South Africa's growing numbers could be a \"precursor\" for outbreaks elsewhere on the continent. South Africa has 373,000 cases - around half the continent's cases. \"I am very concerned right now that we are beginning to see an acceleration of disease in Africa,\" said the WHO's emergencies chief Michael Ryan. \"While South Africa is experiencing a very, very severe event, I think it is really a marker of what the continent could face if urgent action is not taken to provide further support,\" he said. \"South Africa may unfortunately be a precursor, it may be a warning for what will happen in the rest of Africa.\" With more than 15,000 deaths and close to 725,000 cases, the continent remains the world's second least affected after Oceania. While South Africa's numbers were by far the largest, they had \"only\" increased by 30% in the past week, Ryan said. By comparison, numbers in Kenya had increased by 31%, in Madagascar by 50%, in Zambia by 57% and in Namibia by 69%, he pointed out. \"I think what we are starting to see is a continued acceleration of transmission in a number of countries,\" he said. Stock markets in Asia Pacific have opened in positive territory this morning after a strong showing from tech stocks on Wall Street pushed the Nasdaq 2.5% higher to a record 10,767.09 points at the close on Monday night. The driving force was positive data from trials of three potential COVID-19 vaccines and hopes that the European Union would finalise a recovery fund. And while we're at it, how about this for a stat: the value of America's four big tech companies is now greater than that of the entire Japanese market. Mexico's health ministry on Monday reported 5,172 new confirmed coronavirus infections and 301 additional fatalities, bringing the total in the country to 349,396 cases and 39,485 deaths. The government has said the real number of infected people is likely significantly higher than the confirmed cases. Brazil's health ministry has reported the country's death toll has passed 80,000 and the number of cases is now 2.1m. It comes as two more Brazilian government ministers said on Monday they had tested positive for Covid-19. The citizenship minister, Onyx Lorenzoni, and newly appointed education minister, Milton Ribeiro, both announced their diagnoses and new quarantine measures on social media. Reuters reports that Lorenzoni, a close ally of President Jair Bolsonaro, credited relatively mild symptoms to an anti-malarial drug touted by the president on social media and at public rallies. Bolsonaro, who is quarantined after he also tested positive for the virus, has said he was taking hydroxychloroquine, a drug used mainly to treat malaria, which Donald Trump also strongly backed, despite criticism from the medical community. In June, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) wrote: \"Based on ongoing analysis and emerging scientific data, FDA has revoked the emergency use authorization (EUA) to use hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat COVID-19 in certain hospitalized patients when a clinical trial is unavailable or participation is not feasible,\" it said on its website. EU leaders shifted their positions on Monday evening towards reaching a historic agreement on the bloc's long-term spending plans and a (EURO)750bn pandemic recovery fund following days of acrimonious debate at the longest leaders' summit in two decades, write the Guardian's Daniel Boffey and Jennifer Rankin. A new \"spirit of compromise\" had been found, Emmanuel Macron said, despite the French president thumping the negotiating table at the Brussels event in frustration the previous evening and likening those thwarting his spending plans to the ill-fated British in previous budget negotiations. Shortly after 1am local time the commission president Ursula von der Leyen tweeted that it was \"time to move\", in a sign that agreement was imminent. As Macron had arrived ahead of a fourth evening of negotiations with his fellow leaders on Monday he spoke of cautious optimism. Within hours senior EU diplomats spoke of an impending breakthrough. The renewed confidence followed a new proposal from the European council president, Charles Michel, for the EU to pay out (EURO)390bn in non-repayable grants for the worst-hit countries and (EURO)360bn in loans. The money would be raised through jointly issued debt. The \"frugal\" states of the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Austria have been pushing for the original proposal by the European commission for (EURO)500bn in grants for stricken countries to be reduced to (EURO)350bn, to the evident frustration of Macron and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. Italy's prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, had warned his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte, who has led the way on reducing the level of grants, that he faced being blamed for a lack of EU response to the deep economic recession facing the continent. You can read our full coverage below: Donald Trump's tweet about it being \"patriotic\" to wear face masks, comes the week after he appointed a new head to his election campaign team. The president has been well-known for not wearing face mask. He wore one for the first time in front of TV cameras when he visited the Walter Reed military hospital outside Washington about 10 days ago. His tweet came more than three months after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first urged Americans to wear face coverings to help limit their risk of contracting the virus. Another change out of Washington is that the president's daily coronavirus briefings look set to resume. They are expected to start on Tuesday. The president abruptly stopped the briefings after he was widely ridiculed for suggesting injecting bleach may be an option to treat the virus. \"Well, we had very successful briefings,\" Trump told reporters at the Oval office on Monday. \"I was doing them and we had a lot of people watching, record numbers watching in the history of cable television - television, there's never been anything like it. And we were doing very well, and I thought it would be sort of, automatic and a lot of positive things were happening and frankly, a lot of the country is doing well,\" he said. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Alison Rourke. President Trump has tweeted a photo of himself wearing a face mask, with the caption: \"Many people say that it is Patriotic to wear a face mask when you can't socially distance,\" he said. \"There is nobody more Patriotic than me, your favourite President!\" The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention first first urged Americans to wear face coverings in April, but Trump was only seen publicly wearing a mask for the first time earlier this month. President Trump to resume daily coronavirus briefings. The White House briefings stopped abruptly after the president (wrongly) suggested injecting disinfectant may be a way of treating Covid-19. The announcement comes as the president's approval and polling numbers continue to decline. EU set to agree on (EURO)750bn Covid-19 recovery plans. Leaders shifted their positions on Monday evening towards reaching a historic agreement on the bloc's long-term spending plans and a (EURO)750bn pandemic recovery fund following days of acrimonious debate at the longest leaders' summit in two decades. Brazil death toll passes 80,000. Health ministry figures showed cases in the country had grown to more than 2.1m, with deaths now standing at 80,120. Two more Brazilian ministers also tested positive for Covid-19, with one, the citizenship minister, Onyx Lorenzoni, who is a close ally of President Bolsonaro crediting relatively mild symptoms to an anti-malarial drug touted. The World Health Organziation voiced alarm Monday at the spread in Africa. It warned that South Africa's surging numbers could be a \"precursor\" for outbreaks across the continent. The hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia will begin on 29 July. The drastically scaled back event will include only around 1,000 Muslim pilgrims due to the pandemic. A coronavirus vaccine developed by Oxford University appears to be safe and prompts an immune response, raising hopes about the distribution of a vaccine in the coming months. The Oxford team published the results of its vaccine trials in the medical journal the Lancet today. France reports up to 500 virus clusters. Despite the clusters, authorities say there are no signs of an imminent \"second wave\", according to the health minister Olivier Veran. Many of the clusters involve abattoirs or other contained professional settings such as old age homes, he said.

It highlighted the many benefits of big tech and big data, indicating that their influence and importance is only likely to grow. However, his speech also stressed that there are deep public concerns about the business models of some tech giants and their increasingly opaque uses of personal data.</p><p>Three main topics were addressed:</p><p> The need for balance between privacy and innovation.</p><p>As technology advances, it will become more difficult for individuals to obtain a clear explanation about how their data is used, or even when it is being processed. It is important that the public know what their legal rights to privacy are and are reassured that technology is not racing ahead without regard to those rights.</p><p>The Deputy Commissioner made it clear that bigger organisations present some of the greatest risks to individuals' rights and freedoms.</p><p>2. Enforcement.</p><p>The Deputy Commissioner highlighted the flexibility of the ICO's enforcement regime and how the ICO will use this flexibility to achieve the balance between privacy and innovation.</p><p>By way of example, when the Royal Free NHS Trust (the Royal Free) allowed a third party access to 1.6 million patient records for the purpose of trialling a new alert, diagnosis and detection system for acute kidney injury, the ICO required the Royal Free to sign an undertaking committing it to a range of measures in order to safeguard public data rather than imposing a fine. Why? Because the ICO did not want to stifle the potential for creative uses of patient data, allowing innovation to proceed while still protecting privacy.</p><p>Examples of the ICO's recent enforcement activities were provided to demonstrate how the ICO will also take a preventative approach where necessary. This preventative approach includes identifying unreasonable risks and using its powers to prevent problems before they became more serious.</p><p>3. Collaboration.</p><p>Recognising the multinational scope and reach of big tech firms, the Deputy Commissioner commented that data does not recognise borders. Consequently, the ICO is focusing on even greater collaboration and innovation, domestically and internationally, with other regulatory bodies and governments. This strategy will continue post-Brexit.</p><p>Comments</p><p>The Deputy Commissioner's speech provides an insight into the ICO's enforcement approach in regulating the tech industry.</p><p>Moving forwards, organisations, and tech giants in particular, can expect to see more of the ICO's preventative approach in the future. A close eye will be kept on the bigger tech organisations, which process the largest volumes of personal data. However, the speech reinforces the ICO's preference for collaboration over sanctions, and the ICO continues to encourage organisations to engage with it to resolve issues at an early stage.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

This month alone, Singapore announced a bill to clamp down on fake news, Taiwan said it would ban Chinese-owned video-streaming services and Australia rushed through its parliament a Sharing of Abhorrent Violent Material bill, which among other things seeks to hold tech-company executives personally liable for failing swiftly to take down offensive content.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On April 8th the British government published a 102-page policy paper outlining how it thinks internet regulation should work to reduce what it awkwardly calls \"online harms\". It is enormous in scope and hugely ambitious, encompassing any company that allows people \"to share or discover user-generated content or interact with each other online\". That would include not just big social networks but also community forums, review sites, dating apps and much else. The harms covered are similarly extensive, from terrorist material and child abuse to more subjective things such as trolling and disinformation. Some fear it opens the door to censorship of the internet.</p><p>To be sure, there is a lot to iron out. The government appears keen to avoid stifling speech, imposing cumbersome regulation on small companies, snooping on private conversations or setting up large-scale monitoring of online traffic. But the paper is vague on how it will achieve its aims of proportionate regulation and monitoring without infringing on liberties.</p><p>Moderating content on the internet has so far been a losing game of whack-a-mole. This was brought home by the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand in March, when a video of the shooting and a manifesto written by the alleged culprit spread rapidly on some of the world's best-resourced social-media platforms despite efforts to prevent their dissemination. In the case of both copyright and terrorist- or abuse-related material, tech platforms are legally responsible for quickly removing content they find or are made aware of. Yet merely taking down objectionable content ignores the question of how it got there.</p><p>Britain's approach--which it hopes will be adopted elsewhere--is to require companies to design their services in ways that make it harder for bad content to spread in the first place. The big idea is to impose a statutory \"duty of care\". Companies must \"take reasonable steps to keep their users safe and tackle illegal and harmful activity on their services\". The government will set up a new regulator or hand new responsibilities to an existing one, such as Ofcom, which oversees broadcast media and telecoms, or the Information Commissioner's Office, the data-protection watchdog. The regulator's mandate will be broad: publishing guidelines for companies, overseeing complaints, encouraging co-operation between firms and issuing fines, as well as other, harsher penalties, including blocking websites in Britain or holding senior managers personally responsible.</p><p>The eventual legislation will have to walk a tightrope between several conflicting imperatives. Maintaining national security and protecting the vulnerable must be balanced against individual liberties. Imposing substantial requirements on big tech companies must not stifle innovation or prevent smaller firms from thriving. And the new law must not conflict with existing British and European rules that protect online platforms from liability for content they simply host. On the last, the government's plans seem to suggest that, so long as companies live up to their duty of care by designing products in a way that discourages the dissemination of proscribed material, they will be protected.</p><p>Tech firms said they would work with ministers to fine-tune the regulations. They are already resigned to being kept on a tighter leash. Last month Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's boss, called for more internet regulation in an article in the Washington Post. Draft legislation will appear at the earliest in the autumn, and is unlikely to become\u00a0law for a couple of years. A change of prime minister, a general election or continued parliamentary gridlock around Brexit could see it slip down the agenda. As the policy paper puts it, the government will \"bring forward legislation when parliamentary time allows\". In the meanwhile, the harms continue to multiply.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EIUVWS-vwvwmain20190412t1620000006xmlxml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EIUVWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VW2-HR31-JCDS-31X9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253486</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"735\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit Ltd.
