The OECD talks involve over 100 countries on a major rewrite of global tax rules to bring them up to date for the digital era, but they have so far not produced results as the negotiations have been complicated by the coronavirus pandemic.    The United States has already initiated investigations of digital services taxes adopted or being considered by countries such as France, India and Turkey, saying it discriminates against U.S. tech firms.

Google and other companies have been concerned with India\u2019s recent decision to impose a 2% digital tax that also applies on advertising revenue earned overseas if the ads target customers in India, Reuters has previously reported.    Pichai did not directly comment on the Indian tax.    His comments came as Google announced a plan on Monday to invest $10 billion into Indian companies over 5-7 years, marking its biggest bet on the South Asian market and its fast-growing digital economy.    Google and other tech companies also continue to face a raft of regulatory hurdles around the world as governments impose more controls over how big technology companies use and process data of millions of users.    In terms of the data regulations being developed in India and other countries, Pichai called for a balanced approach of policy making that promotes innovation.    \u201cIt\u2019s important you find the balance in protecting the privacy of your citizens but allowing for free flow of products and services,\u201d Pichai said.    \u201cThat\u2019s the potential of a digital economy \u2026 the strength of the internet comes in the fact that it works globally.\u201d    Data storage rules, for example, have been criticised for hindering long-term growth of companies, while restrictions on cross-border data flows has been blamed for hampering innovation.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse   The OECD talks involve over 100 countries on a major rewrite of global tax rules to bring them up to date for the digital era, but they have so far not produced results as the negotiations have been complicated by the coronavirus pandemic.   The United States has already initiated investigations of digital services taxes adopted or being considered by countries such as France, India and Turkey, saying it discriminates against U.S. tech firms.

The OECD talks involve over 100 countries on a major rewrite of global tax rules to bring them up to date for the digital era, but they have so far not produced results as the negotiations have been complicated by the coronavirus pandemic.    The United States has already initiated investigations of digital services taxes adopted or being considered by countries such as France, India and Turkey, saying it discriminates against U.S. tech firms.    Pichai said it was important to rely on OECD frameworks, which he referred to as the \"right approach\".    \"It's not (an issue) for an individual company to solve,\" Pichai said in an interview from San Francisco via a video conference. \"We would be supportive of the OECD engagement.\"    Countries imposing digital service taxes see it as a way to raise revenue from the local operations of big tech companies which they say profit enormously from local markets while making only limited contributions to public coffers.    Google and other companies have been concerned with India's recent decision to impose a 2% digital tax that also applies on advertising revenue earned overseas if the ads target customers in India, Reuters has previously reported.    Pichai did not directly comment on the Indian tax.    His comments came as Google announced a plan on Monday to invest $10 billion into Indian companies over 5-7 years, marking its biggest bet on the South Asian market and its fast-growing digital economy.    Google and other tech companies also continue to face a raft of regulatory hurdles around the world as governments impose more controls over how big technology companies use and process data of millions of users.    In terms of the data regulations being developed in India and other countries, Pichai called for a balanced approach of policy making that promotes innovation.    \"It's important you find the balance in protecting the privacy of your citizens but allowing for free flow of products and services,\" Pichai said.    \"That's the potential of a digital economy ... the strength of the internet comes in the fact that it works globally.\"    Data storage rules, for example, have been criticised for hindering long-term growth of companies, while restrictions on cross-border data flows has been blamed for hampering innovation. Governments, however, say such controls are necessary for protecting user privacy and data abuse.    (Reporting by Aditya Kalra.

The OECD talks involve over 100 countries on a major rewrite of global tax rules to bring them up to date for the digital era, but they have so far not produced results as the negotiations have been complicated by the coronavirus pandemic.  The United States has already initiated investigations of digital services taxes adopted or being considered by countries such as France, India and Turkey, saying it discriminates against U.S. tech firms.  Pichai said it was important to rely on OECD frameworks, which he referred to as the \"right approach\".  \"It's not (an issue) for an individual company to solve,\" Pichai said in an interview from San Francisco via a video conference. \"We would be supportive of the OECD engagement.\"  Countries imposing digital service taxes see it as a way to raise revenue from the local operations of big tech companies which they say profit enormously from local markets while making only limited contributions to public coffers.  Google and other companies have been concerned with India's recent decision to impose a 2% digital tax that also applies on advertising revenue earned overseas if the ads target customers in India, Reuters has previously reported.  Pichai did not directly comment on the Indian tax.  His comments came as Google announced a plan on Monday to invest $10 billion into Indian companies over 5-7 years, marking its biggest bet on the South Asian market and its fast-growing digital economy.  Google and other tech companies also continue to face a raft of regulatory hurdles around the world as governments impose more controls over how big technology companies use and process data of millions of users.  In terms of the data regulations being developed in India and other countries, Pichai called for a balanced approach of policy making that promotes innovation.  \"It's important you find the balance in protecting the privacy of your citizens but allowing for free flow of products and services,\" Pichai said.  \"That's the potential of a digital economy ... the strength of the internet comes in the fact that it works globally.\"  Data storage rules, for example, have been criticised for hindering long-term growth of companies, while restrictions on cross-border data flows has been blamed for hampering innovation. Governments, however, say such controls are necessary for protecting user privacy and data abuse.(Reporting by Aditya Kalra.

The OECD talks involve over 100 countries on a major rewrite of global tax rules to bring them up to date for the digital era, but they have so far not produced results as the negotiations have been complicated by the coronavirus pandemic.   The United States has already initiated investigations of digital services taxes adopted or being considered by countries such as France, India and Turkey, saying it discriminates against U.S. tech firms.   Pichai said it was important to rely on OECD frameworks, which he referred to as the \u201cright approach\u201d.   \u201cIt\u2019s not (an issue) for an individual company to solve,\u201d Pichai said in an interview from San Francisco via a video conference. \u201cWe would be supportive of the OECD engagement.\u201d   Countries imposing digital service taxes see it as a way to raise revenue from the local operations of big tech companies which they say profit enormously from local markets while making only limited contributions to public coffers.   Google and other companies have been concerned with India\u2019s recent decision to impose a 2% digital tax that also applies on advertising revenue earned overseas if the ads target customers in India, Reuters has previously reported.   Pichai did not directly comment on the Indian tax.   His comments came as Google announced a plan on Monday to invest $10 billion into Indian companies over 5-7 years, marking its biggest bet on the South Asian market and its fast-growing digital economy.   Google and other tech companies also continue to face a raft of regulatory hurdles around the world as governments impose more controls over how big technology companies use and process data of millions of users.   In terms of the data regulations being developed in India and other countries, Pichai called for a balanced approach of policy making that promotes innovation.   \u201cIt\u2019s important you find the balance in protecting the privacy of your citizens but allowing for free flow of products and services,\u201d Pichai said.   \u201cThat\u2019s the potential of a digital economy ... the strength of the internet comes in the fact that it works globally.\u201d   Data storage rules, for example, have been criticised for hindering long-term growth of companies, while restrictions on cross-border data flows has been blamed for hampering innovation. Governments, however, say such controls are necessary for protecting user privacy and data abuse.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42586433567</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60BN-Y721-F07F-836P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"487\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Reuters UK</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 13, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The search giant will also pay to give readers access to selected articles that are behind a pay wall.</p><p>It is understood that Google is approaching publishers individually, so larger media outlets in Canada, such as Torstar Corp., owner of the Toronto Star, and National Post owner Postmedia Inc., are likely to be approached, said John Hinds, chief executive of the industry group News Media Canada. Less clear is whether they will be in favour of the terms the tech giant is offering.</p><p>\"With the announcement of $1 billion globally there won't be a lot of money for Canada,\" said Hinds.</p><p>He estimated that about $9 million would be earmarked for Canada based on per capita spend.</p><p>That amount is just a fraction of what some countries believe the tech giants should be paying media. In Australia, for example, legislation is being developed with the expectation that news organizations in that country alone might receive between $600 million and $1 billion from Google and Facebook Inc.</p><p>Hinds noted that the recent throne speech delivered in Ottawa suggests the Canadian government, too, is considering putting a framework in place that would require the digital giants to pay for content.</p><p>Traditional media outlets have complained for years that they aren't compensated by large digital platforms such as Google and Facebook, which showcase news items to attract audiences and generate revenue from search and user data.</p><p>Governments and regulators around the world, particularly in Europe and Australia, have begun to look at the market power of the big tech firms, and are putting measures in place to help level the playing field.</p><p>But the tech giants have pushed back, suggesting that linking to third-party news sites generates little income for their platforms. In response to a mandatory code of conduct being passed into law in Australia, Facebook indicated last month that it could stop the sharing of news items on its platform there altogether. In the past, Google has pulled its Google News aggregation site from users in countries where reform measures were considered out of line.</p><p>Michael Geist, a law professor at the University of Ottawa and Canada Research Chair in internet and e-commerce law, said uncertainty in Canada over what the government plans to do to level the playing field - and when - could encourage publishers to skip licensing their content at market rates with Google. Instead, they could hold out \"in the hope that the Canadian government will mandate payments well above market value,\" he said.</p><p>But Jeff Elgie, chief executive of Village Media, said joining Google's News Showcase licensing arrangement was an \"easy decision\" for the Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.-based company.</p><p>\"This is a new and meaningful revenue stream for us,\" he said, adding that it fulfils an important goal by keeping the \"user experience\" on Village Media's website while attracting traffic and hopefully new audiences from Google.</p><p>\"And in this case, we're being paid for it,\" he said. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

But as a realist, I recognize that when businesses become big and begin to be seen as abusing their power, they make it much harder for defenders of a pure free market to prevail in the regulatory debate. </p><p>NBC's attempt to deplatform the Federalist was only made possible by the immense power that Google has, with a near monopoly on the search traffic that fuels its advertising business. While it turns out that NBC got the story wrong, Google did put the Federalist on notice that it could lose access to Google Ads revenue if it didn't change its comment section, which has been temporarily removed.</p><p>In the debate concerning whether to target tech companies over their bias against conservatives, I've been on the side of arguing that private businesses should have the right to set any rules they want for users. I was critical of a proposal by Sen. Josh Hawley that would have ended the immunity that social media companies have against lawsuits for content posted on their platforms. Under his proposal, companies would have to apply to the federal government for temporary certificates of immunity after demonstrating they've been free of political bias in removing content. On the left, Sen. Elizabeth Warren has proposed breaking up large tech companies \u2014 though for different reasons.</p><p>Arguments in favor of the free market are always weakened when businesses behave in ways that make it easy for people to portray them as the bad guys.</p><p>A free market healthcare system has been made harder to achieve by stories of insurers fighting to deny care to those who have insurance, of hospitals issuing exorbitant bills that are hard to justify, and of drug companies that rely on patent protection to charge jaw-dropping amounts for prescription drugs. Manufacturers that recklessly polluted and then tried to cover it up made it more difficult to argue against environmental regulations, and big banks that blew up the economy and then demanded bailouts made it more difficult to make the case against financial regulation. </p><p>Google, in trying to explain its threat against the Federalist, stated, \"Our policies do not allow ads to run against dangerous or derogatory content, which includes comments on sites.\" To which many people had the same reaction: Has Google not looked at the comments section of any typical video on its own YouTube service?</p><p>This was not lost on Hawley.</p><p>Tweet</p><p>On Wednesday, he is introducing legislation that would give \"users the right to sue if the big platforms enforce their terms unfairly or unequally.\" He is being joined by Sens. Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton, and Mike Braun.</p><p>In a political world in which most people are more interested in outcomes rather than underlying principles, if the power of Google and other large tech companies is used to disproportionately target conservatives, it's going to be increasingly difficult for those on the libertarian side of the spectrum to win any argument over the freedom of these companies to self-police. </p><p>Photo Caption:Kyiv, Ukraine  - March 13, 2011: Google logo in browser window on monitor screen.

It's an apt name with a pretty logo, but it's missing something. Looking at the Stadia logo, you'd never know it was part of Google \u2014 and there's a good reason for that. Google took the wraps off its game streaming service on Tuesday [3]with a barrage of fanfare, high-octane demos and a shiny new name and logo. Meet: Stadia. </p><p>As far as names go, it's not bad. According to the Cambridge Dictionary,[4] Stadia is a plural form of stadiums \u2014 an apt moniker for a product that aspires to provide virtual arenas for gamers and spectators anywhere in the world. \"One place... where you, and everyone you know, and everyone they know, will all play together,\" the narrator of Stadia's introductory video[5] explains in a solemn tone. For me though, the most striking thing about the new name and logo, is how utterly foreign it is to the Google brand. And that's not an accident. Stadia's giant S looks like it belongs on the chest of a cartoon superhero. There's no mention of its Google pedigree anywhere (other than a brief flash of the letter G at the end of the demo video). And the visual cues (such as the standard color palette) that Google typically uses to tie together its family of products are notably absent. Take a look at the logos below. All are Google products, but one of them is not like the others.Google Fi, the company's wireless phone service: Google Photos:Google Maps:And here's Stadia: Sure, not all Google products mention Google. YouTube, which Google acquired for $1.65 billion back in 2006, has preserved its identity as an independent brand.Unlike YouTube, however, Stadia doesn't have a pre-existing brand to preserve. The Google foundation that Stadia is built on is one of its greatest assets. Google's vast network of data centers and undersea cables will make the games Stadia streams rock solid and lag-free; Google's AI prowess will enhance the gaming experience with integrated features like Google Assistant; Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, even spoke at the event, underscoring the importance of the relationship. So Stadia's conscious decoupling with Google in its brand identity is worth paying attention to. We've seen Google do this before. When Google introduced its mobile operating system a decade ago, it wanted the phone industry to embrace it as the answer to the rising iPhone threat. But even though phone companies were worried about Apple eating their lunch, there was distrust of Google too. Enter Android, a cute little green alien that looks nothing like the rest of Google's brands:Now, as Google barges into another established market, the company is walking a similar tightrope. Google's success in gaming will in large part come down to winning the support of industry incumbents \u2014 the game developers and studios that it hopes to offer on its streaming platform. There's reason for them to be wary. After all, they'll be giving up control over distribution, customer relationships and perhaps even a portion of their revenue to Google. The precedents for these kinds of arrangements, whether in music or publishing, are not feel-good stories. Google might even one day pose a serious threat to the largest game makers. Stadia Games and Entertainment, the first-party studio that was also announced on Tuesday, is tasked with creating games specifically for the Stadia streaming platform[6]. The story right now is that this will let Google work hand-in-hand with independent game studios to develop experiences that sizzle on the streaming service. But as Google also builds its own games, it runs the risk of building up into the kind of heavyweight that draws audience away from the established players. That's precisely the kind of arrangement that regulators and politicians are increasingly criticizing. A major pillar of US Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren's rationale for breaking up big tech companies[7] is that Google and Apple run marketplaces for apps and other services, while also promoting their own products in those marketplaces. Will Google try to do the same thing with Stadia? It's too early to know. Right now, Google isn't even revealing the price of the service, which is due to launch sometime later this year. Until then, the world must wait and marvel at the beauty of Stadia's gleaming S logo.

According to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/stadia?q=Stadia\">Cambridge Dictionary,</url> Stadia is a plural form of stadiums - an apt moniker for a product that aspires to provide virtual arenas for gamers and spectators anywhere in the world.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"One place... where you, and everyone you know, and everyone they know, will all play together,\" the narrator of <url normalizedValue=\"https://blog.google/products/stadia/stadia-a-new-way-to-play/\">Stadia's introductory video</url> explains in a solemn tone.</p><p>For me though, the most striking thing about the new name and logo, is how utterly foreign it is to the Google brand. And that's not an accident.\u00a0</p><p>Stadia's giant S looks like it belongs on the chest of a cartoon superhero. There's no mention of its Google pedigree anywhere (other than a brief flash of the letter G at the end of the demo video). And the visual cues (such as the standard color palette) that Google typically uses to tie together its family of products are notably absent.</p><p>Take a look at the logos below. All are Google products, but one of them is not like the others.\u00a0</p><h>Google Fi, the company's wireless phone service:</h><p>Google</p><p>\u00a0</p><h>Google Photos:</h><p>Google</p><h>Google Maps:</h><p>Google</p><h>And here's Stadia:</h><p>Google</p><p>Sure, not all Google products mention Google. YouTube, which Google acquired for $1.65 billion back in 2006, has preserved its identity as an independent brand.\u00a0</p><p>Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg via Getty Images</p><p>Unlike YouTube, however, Stadia doesn't have a pre-existing brand to preserve.</p><p>The Google foundation that Stadia is built on is one of its greatest assets. Google's vast network of data centers and undersea cables will make the games Stadia streams rock solid and lag-free; Google's AI prowess will enhance the gaming experience with integrated features like Google Assistant; Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, even spoke at the event, underscoring the importance of the relationship.</p><p>So Stadia's conscious decoupling with Google in its brand identity is worth paying attention to.\u00a0</p><p>We've seen Google do this before. When Google introduced its mobile operating system a decade ago, it wanted the phone industry to embrace it as the answer to the rising iPhone threat. But even though phone companies were worried about Apple eating their lunch, there was distrust of Google too.</p><p>Enter Android, a cute little green alien that looks nothing like the rest of Google's brands:</p><p>Android Instagram page</p><p>Now, as Google barges into another established market, the company is walking a similar tightrope. Google's success in gaming will in large part come down to winning the support of industry incumbents - the game developers and studios that it hopes to offer on its streaming platform.\u00a0</p><p>There's reason for them to be wary. After all, they'll be giving up control over distribution, customer relationships and perhaps even a portion of their revenue to Google. The precedents for these kinds of arrangements, whether in music or publishing, are not feel-good stories.</p><p>Google might even one day pose a serious threat to the largest game makers. Stadia Games and Entertainment, the first-party studio that was also announced on Tuesday, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jade-raymond-google-stadia-2019-3?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">is tasked with creating games specifically for the Stadia streaming platform</url>. The story right now is that this will let Google work hand-in-hand with independent game studios to develop experiences that sizzle on the streaming service. But as Google also builds its own games, it runs the risk of building up into the kind of heavyweight that draws audience away from the established players.</p><p>That's precisely the kind of arrangement that regulators and politicians are increasingly criticizing. A major pillar of US Presidential candidate <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-warren-call-to-break-up-amazon-google-is-a-real-threat-2019-3?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">Elizabeth Warren's rationale for breaking up big tech companies</url> is that Google and Apple run marketplaces for apps and other services, while also promoting their own products in those marketplaces.</p><p>You can't have both, in Warren's view, especially if you're a giant tech comapny like Google.</p><p>Will Google try to use its size and advantages the same way with Stadia? It's too early to know. Right now, Google isn't even revealing the price of the service, which is due to launch sometime later this year.\u00a0</p><p>Until then, the world can only wait and marvel at the beauty of Stadia's gleaming S logo.</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Read more:</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-gdc-keynote-live-blog-announcements-2019-3?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">Google just unveiled its vision for 'the future of gaming' - here's everything it announced</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-stadia-supported-devices-2019-3?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">Google's new Stadia gaming service supports so many devices you might not need to buy anything</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jade-raymond-google-stadia-2019-3?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\"> Industry veteran Jade Raymond is in charge of turning Google into a major video game publisher - and that has huge ramifications</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-stadia-hands-on-impressions-2019-3?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">I tried Stadia, Google's big play to conquer video games.

I'm Neil Cavuto.  Glad to  have you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And who knew Google has its own fast pass to the White House?  I'm  talking very fast, fast pass and apparently, one that never expires.   You should be so lucky with yours at Disney because Google employees get  on a lot of rides at this White House park -- try 230 of them since the  president first took office.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, that roughly (INAUDIBLE) about one a week and apparently, they  weren't all going for the ride.  Many of these meetings came as the  government was wrapping up its antitrust investigation into Google.  So  awkward.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, I don't know.  But here's what I do know.  The Federal Trade  Commission eventually closed that investigation.  Google agreed to make  some voluntary changes to its business practices.  But you needn't  Google the term \"quid pro quo\" to know something doesn't smell right  because I don't know about you but this kind of stuff doesn't happen to  us.  Taxpayers don't get these kind of breaks or fast passes.  In fact,  for most businesses, it is far more common to be shut out of the White  House than ever get so much as a kind word from the White House.</p><p>But again, that is just me.</p><p>Steve Moore wants to shut this ride down.  But Basil Smikle says it is  (INAUDIBLE), I should say it's not such a bad ride.</p><p>You don't like the sound of any of it?</p><p>STEVE MOORE, HERITAGE CHIEF ECONOMIST:  I'm old enough to remember when  Google and Apple and Microsoft and Netflix didn't even have lobbying  operations in Washington, you know?  And the high tech community in  Silicon Valley just said, \"Leave us alone.  We'll do our thing and you  do your thing.\"  And now, they have these massive lobbying operations in  Washington.  And it's basically the Google administration right now.  I  mean, they (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  But they're not alone, I guess, because their sheer size, the - - it looks a little more obvious.</p><p>BASIL SMIKLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, I think to your point  exactly, tech -- the government and our legislature always lags behind  technology.  And right now, these companies are sort of ruling the  world.  It's not surprising.</p><p>MOORE:  (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>CAVUTO:  So why wasn't he meeting with these Google guys before the  launch of the Affordable Care Act (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>SMIKLE:  Well, it's not surprising that he's meeting with them now.   Look at all (INAUDIBLE) that we've been talking about in the last year.   We talked about.</p><p>CAVUTO:  The sheer number of meetings, (INAUDIBLE), come on.</p><p>SMIKLE:  .we've talked about -- we've talked about immigration and  they're certainly going to lobby for high school workers.</p><p>CAVUTO:  One a week.</p><p>SMIKLE:  We talked about net neutrality.  That's going to be a key  issue.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I know, I know.  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SMIKLE:  The problem is -- the point is that they have a lot of stuff to  talk about and (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MOORE:  They have.  (INAUDIBLE) problem.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>SMIKLE:  I don't begrudge them but using their resources in trying to  push (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MOORE:  The interesting thing about the net neutrality issue is that  Google was on the side of net neutrality at the beginning and then --  then saw the government got their fangs.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, it evolved.  They evolved as they've been getting bigger.   (INAUDIBLE).  If George Bush were doing this with defense contractors  every week, you would be -- flip a gasket, as would I.</p><p>SMIKLE:  I probably would but I would -- instead of pointing to George  Bush, I'd point to Ronald Reagan.  Think about the coziness that he had  with some of the media companies 'cause they -- he actually sparked a  lot of this sort of consolidation in media under his watch.  You had  more companies than ever before in history and the mergers and  acquisitions.  So that's (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>CAVUTO:  I think it's fair to say during that time though, he did not  have a cozy relationship with the media.  They were blistering him every  day.</p><p>SMIKLE:  But he did with big business and we forgave him that or others  forgave him that.  So.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Not the Washington Post.</p><p>MOORE:  This is the most (INAUDIBLE) situation of all though.  You have  big - $4 trillion government and you have these massive companies like  Google -- I think Google's the biggest company in the world right now in  terms of revenues -- and you put them together and bad things happen.   We want big government and big business to stay on top.</p><p>CAVUTO:  See, but I agree, Basil, but I think it's fine for a CEO --  CEOs -- to meet at the White House.  I think he gets a little  problematic when it turns into like \"Skip the pass, you can just walk in  through the front gate.\"  </p><p>SMIKLE:  Well, I don't know if it was that -- if they had that kind of  access.  But the reality.</p><p>CAVUTO:  It all comes back to bite you.  Remember what happened to  JPMorgan Chase.  Jamie Dimon could just waltz into the Oval Office  anytime he wanted.  As soon as he started getting attacked critical, not  only did they take the fast pass away, before you know it, the firm was  facing billions of dollars (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SMIKLE:  So are you saying that the Bush administration shouldn't have  allowed him in as much as they should've?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm saying not every week.  That's what I'm saying.  I just  think that that gets a little weird.</p><p>SMIKLE:  Well, I think as businesses grow, as industries go, I would  imagine that this occurred with the auto industry at some point -- that  as they become such huge (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  Talk to others.  Talk to others.  Talk to others.  </p><p>SMIKLE:  When they have such a huge role in our business, in our  industry, they're going to be meeting with government officials  (INAUDIBLE) all the time.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But it's the same thing I said at this president (INAUDIBLE)  meeting with the likes of Al Sharpton (INAUDIBLE) the racial issue --  meet with other representatives from points of view.  But be fair and  balanced.  He is now choosing \"I'm going to be fair if I focus on  Google, I focus on Apple, and I kind of ignore everyone else.\" </p><p>SMIKLE:  But who else is driving our conversations about technology  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, those guys will never get the chance.  Those guys will  never get the chance.</p><p>MOORE:  There are thousands and thousands of small businesses in the  technology industry, by the way, biting at the heels of Google and I  guarantee you, most of them do not have a lobbyist.  I'm sure they don't  have a (INAUDIBLE).  But that's -- I have a little bit take on this  thing.  You, Neil.  I mean, I just think when the government tries to  regulate the high tech industry, as you said, you put it very well.   There are three generations behind where this industry is at.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  But what did I say about regulating technology?  I didn't  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MOORE:  No, no.  I just -- I just mean -- I think the problem.</p><p>CAVUTO:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MOORE:  .of course, Google's going to have all these lobbyists because  the government is sticking its fingers in everything that they do.</p><p>SMIKLE:  But I agree the small businesses should have a role at the  table.  </p><p>MOORE:  No.  No, no.  That's not my point.</p><p>SMIKLE:  I know but I do (INAUDIBLE) -- I do think -- I do think that  small businesses (INAUDIBLE) -- should have -- should have (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MOORE:  The government -- there's too many of them.  There are millions  of small businesses.  There's not enough Lincoln Bedrooms.</p><p>CAVUTO:  He makes more sense than you do.  That's scary, right there.  </p><p>SMIKLE:  That's scary, wow.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Guys, seriously, thank you both very, very much.</p><p>In the meantime, no wonder so many want to (INAUDIBLE) Google.  With  connections like those, who wouldn't?  </p><p>Now, add Ruth Porat onto that growing list of eager Google recruits.   But Ms. Porat isn't just any recruit, is she?  She's the chief financial  officer of investment bank Morgan Stanley, one of the most powerful  women -- actually, one of the most powerful anyone on Wall Street.  And  now, she's going to become CFO of Google.</p><p>Add her to a growing list of Wall Streeters going to tech including a  top Goldman strategist to Twitter or -- continuing with this revolving  door thing -- former Obama advisor David Plouffe to Uber and Jay Carney  to Amazon.</p><p>Forget what this means to tech.  What does this mean to what's left of  Wall Street?  </p><p>Scott Martin says not much but given the way the White House, he says,  has been bashing Wall Street, not much we can do to stop it.</p><p>The allure, I think, for a lot of them is technology's cool, there's  actually even more money in it which is hard to believe because you're  sinfully rich enough but what's going on here?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, UNITED ADVISORS CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST:  Sinfully rich.   Yes, that's why I describe myself on Twitter--.  Neil, it's tough.  I  mean, the dreaded brain drain in the financial industry is upon us.  I  mean, the financial industry, the markets couldn't even keep around a  nice lady like Veronica Vain -- look her up -- sports fans being  interesting because the allure is not there anymore, Neil.  Really, I  mean, it is the technology sector.  It is all these cool things that are  going on outside of this once-big structural firm that was Wall Street,  that where all the banks are (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  I think it's money, Scott.  I really do think it's money  because as much as the financial industry pays, it's chump change in  comparison to the stake you take when a technology company does well,  goes well, between options and advances and stock, I mean you become a  gazilionaire a lot quicker there than you ever could on Wall Street.</p><p>MARTIN:  You do.  I think Wall Street tough too, Neil, also thanks to  the administration, thanks to the financial crisis, has a little bit of  an image problem still.  In fact, I'd argue that the financial crisis,  our financial situation, for a lot of thee banks is not near what it was  before the crisis.  So you have the perception on both Main Street and  some of the certainly people in D.C. that say, \"You know what?  The  banks are still doing things wrong and to your point about the  financials of them, Dodd-Frank, (INAUDIBLE) regulations, all things that  are out there now -- Elizabeth Warren being a big party in the  Democrats' side of.</p><p>CAVUTO:  No, I think the bloom is off the rose.  You're absolutely right  on that as you are in these issues.  And I think the latest telltale  sign, college graduates, MBA graduates used to be by overwhelmingly  flock to the -- Wall Street.  Now, it's half and half and that other  half is going to technology.</p><p>MARTIN:  And here's the ironic thing, right?  Now, the only reason that  you probably like your bank or that you can deal with them is because  the technology behind it allows you to do what you want to do.  But if  you work at that bank, if you have that high-paying job on Wall Stree  which isn't as high-paying as it once was, that doesn't hold its same  mustard as it did, say, five, 10 years ago,.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You're right.  Scott, you will be the last guy standing and all  the money will be yours.  </p><p>All right.  Scott.</p><p>MARTIN:  That's a scary thought.  See you later.</p><p>CAVUTO:  That is scary.  Thank you, my friend.</p><p>In the meantime, Wall Street's not the only one with a Silicon Valley  problem.  You might have one.  </p><p>It's true because Fidelity and other money managers are striking deals  with tech startups like Uber and Pinterest who load up your retirement  portfolio.  And I bet you didn't even know it.  </p><p>And what's even scary to Larry Winget is they're doing it in companies  that don't have any money or (INAUDIBLE) of making money anytime soon.</p><p>Larry, the argument for this is that, \"Hey, we're spreading our bets.   We're giving you a more diversified portfolio.  We don't know the  percentage that they pour in to these kind of companies but we know they  never did before.\"  So what do you make of this?</p><p>LARRY WINGET, \"GROW A PAIR\" AUTHOR:  Well, I wouldn't find it especially  alarming if they're pouring big percentages into it if you're a retiree  and you're counting on this to be your retirement fund to live on  because it's pure speculation what these tech startups are going to be  worth.  They value them but that value is not based on publicly-released  financial statements.  They've never been traded anywhere before.  These  are privately-held companies.  And from a guy like me, it would just be  a made-up number.  When I look at some of the stuff that's out there --  look at Uber, for instance.  In mid-2013, it was supposedly worth $3.5  billion.  Now, the valuation is over $40 billion.  A thousand percent  when the S&amp;P 500 is up 28 percent.  How did they come up with a 1,000  percent growth in less than two years?  That would bother me.  </p><p>CAVUTO: All right.  Well, they could also move on to the government, if  that's -- if they don't make (INAUDIBLE).  But do you think they  shouldn't invest in this (INAUDIBLE), that it shouldn't' be part of any  portfolio or do you think when it comes to people and their retirement  money -- 'cause a lot (INAUDIBLE), this is multiyear, multi-decade  money, that there shouldn't be a little bit of aggressive investment in  there anyway.</p><p>WINGET:  I have no problem with there being a very small percentage and  some of them are saying -- some of the mutual funds are saying you will  only be a very small percentage.  The good side is if it's very small,  you're not going to lose a lot of money.  But the bad side is even if  they make a lot of money and -- for instance, Uber is worth a thousand  times more than it was a couple of years ago, you're probably not going  to make a lot of money either.  It all comes down to how old you are  (INAUDIBLE).  If you're 40 years old, you could -= and you have most of  your earning years ahead of you, you could afford to be a little more  risky.  If you're in your 60s, you can't afford that kind of risk.  Yes,  there's a lot of money to be made but there's always the other side of  that -- there's a lot of money to be lost and I don't want any of that  money as I approach retirement to be mine when it comes to losing it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, not everyone can write an incredible bestseller one after  the other like you.  People have to hedge their beds.</p><p>Larry Winget, thank you very, very much.</p><p>WINGET:  Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, holy moly.  With Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee and Ben  Carson likely carving up the Christian vote, are you starting to think  that Rick Santorum doesn't have a prayer?  </p><p>Rick's here to say \"You don't have a clue.\"</p><p>And you think making cakes is about as far as 3D printers can go?  Then  this just takes the cake.  Now, they're printing construction guys right  of their jobs.</p><p>What the Tech?!  What do we do when tech turns on us?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>Well, who needs an architect or construction expert if a 3D printer can  spit out what they do and in a fraction of the time.  What the tech?!   What just happened?</p><p>Up first in the segment that is taking the nation by storm, the storm  over these cool 3D printers that came in peace but are now apparently  peacefully printing out pink slips for many in the building industry.  I  warned you, America.</p><p>To tech watcher Shama Hyder on what this is all about.</p><p>Shana, what's going -- what can these printers do that's got so many in  the construction industry going nuts?</p><p>SHAMA HYDER, MARKETING ZEN CEO:  Well, these printers are pretty cool in  a lot of ways because they do have the capability of building an entire  building.  I mean, they're -- they -- they can -- they're stackable.   You -- so if you have a job in the construction industry which involves  hitting a nail with a hammer over and over again, you should be scared  because chances are, some of the printers are going to take that over.   But really, if you're.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And do that as well?</p><p>HYDER:  They're going to do that but they're really good at repetitive  tasks.  But when it comes to strategically building something, you still  need human minds behind it.  So this is the whole (INAUDIBLE) we've been  hearing for so long -- is technology replacing humans?  No.  It's really  not.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I saw \"2001 Space Odyssey.\"  I remember how a certain pod bay  door wasn't opened so I know how this ends.  Where's this all going?</p><p>HYDER:  This has a different ending though.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Oh, really?</p><p>HYDER:  Yes, it does and I'll tell you -- because technology (INAUDIBLE)  can really assist people.  I think we'll see homes becoming cheaper in  many ways which would -- I mean, I'd appreciate that.  That'd be great.   But also imagine in.</p><p>CAVUTO:  If you had a job to buy the home.</p><p>HYDER:  That's right.  But imagine in places where it's war-torn or a  storm comes through and totally demolishes that community.  Having  something like this could mean that people have shelter within days,  within hours, and that's powerful.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  As long as they don't advance into the TV news  business (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>All right.  Next up, a workout suit that will intensify your workout.   Forget three hours sweating up a storm, they say you put this thing on,  20 minutes, you have the same effect and you're done.  Now, if they can  get that puppy down to 20 seconds, sign me up.  But in the meantime,  Shama, how does this thing even work?</p><p>HYDER:  So it's pretty neat.  It's got electrodes that go on your skin  essentially through this body suit which looks just like a normal gym  suit, something you might wear to workout.  But essentially, it works  with the muscles so they work out harder.  This really neat (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, how is it -- is it telling you \"You're not working hard  enough\", or is it just dragging your hand to the punching bag?</p><p>HYDER:  No, you do have to put in the motion.  You do have to put in the  work, right, but it essentially.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Oh, so I actually have to work-out.</p><p>HYDER:  You do -- you do -- you do have to get up.  You do have to work- out but it amplifies it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, that's the problem.  All right.  All right.</p><p>HYDER:  Right.  So there's no -- there's no magic here but it will  amplify the effects you get.</p><p>CAVUTO:  In other words, you get a lot more done in a shorter period.</p><p>HYDER:  Absolutely.  But are you going to see like the normal mom going  to do this after dropping the kids off and going to gym?  No.  But for  athletes, for people in the sports industry where every little edge  counts, this is going to be huge.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, apparently, I'll have more time on my hands after a 3D  printer takes my place.  It just might work out.</p><p>Meanwhile, this is incredible because after that airbus crash in the  south of France, for rival Boeing, it's an announcement that might be  eerily time because the company has now uncovered two black boxes in the  French Alps.  That is, the company behind this crash.  The problem is  one is very badly damaged.  The other is missing its memory card.  </p><p>But what Boeing has come up with might make black boxes themselves  obsolete, totally unnecessary.  The airplane maker just patented a force  field of lasers.  What that would do is make a plane impenetrable to  missiles or outside forces.  So let me be clear here, it wouldn't  prevent the kind of crash we saw this week in France but it might have  stopped that Malaysian jet from being shotdown over the Ukraine last  year. </p><p>So Shama, I guess the only issue here would be the expense for this,  right?</p><p>HYDER:  Yes.  I mean, this is going to be expensive but innovation  generally is until it's not, right?  But anytime you're talking  electromagnetic fields, you're talking about new technology that the  U.S. government uses now that can see through concrete walls.  And so,  this isn't necessarily new technology.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And it doesn't interrupt to them -- and that static field  doesn't' interrupt with the cockpit controls or any of the device.</p><p>HYDER:  And so, I mean, this is all the stuff that they're going to have  to work out, obviously.  It's very, very early stages but yes.  It's  good.  It's going to be a huge expense but as they -- as they tinker  with it, as they play with it, it'll obviously get cheaper and hopefully  make the world safer.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  There was a big push -- I mean -- after this shoot-down  that \"Hey, we have to help or retrofit airlines with this sort of  technology.\"  Now, again, to your point, it depends on the expense.  But  I kind of think something like this is just a matter of time.</p><p>HYDER:  It is.  It's absolutely a matter of time.  And once they test it  out, they'll get better and better with it.  There's certain things  that'll make technology overall cheaper like battery life.  That's  something Google's working very hard right now on.  If they can figure  out a way for batteries to be cheaper, last longer, all of this  technology becomes easier, cheaper, faster.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  We'll watch closely, Shama.  Thank you very, very  much.</p><p>HYDER:  My pleasure.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, saints preserve us.  We've got a lot of saints in this  presidential race.  Men of God who have no problem talking about God.   Now, four years ago, only Rick Santorum was doing that.  Now, a fee  other presidential wannabees art harping in.  Harp.  (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>Anyway, think Rick is losing the religious right?  Why don't I ask Rick  myself?  Because he's here and only here, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Boy, this just boils me.  </p><p>Remember when I was chatting with Mitt Romney yesterday about this  likely  very crowded Republican presidential field?  Now, I said it is  so crowded, good luck, Republicans, deciding on a nominee by convention  time, like they did back with him, back 2012.  Come 2016, it's not going  to happen.  Now, he scoffed. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  If there s potion by vote -- primaries -- falling out, you  could get to a situation which begs the issue, would you entertain the  party coming to you and saying, \"Governor, we're at a draw here.\"</p><p>MITT ROMNEY, (R) 2012 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  First, that's not going  to happen.  Two, I'm not.</p><p>CAVUTO:  It's happened before.</p><p>ROMNEY:  Two, I'm not an entertainer.  And three, that was a long time  ago that happened.  Look, we're going to have our nominee and I'm one of  those people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, he may say never, never, never.  But girls told me that  all the time in high school before my mother finally said yes and we  went to the prom together.</p><p>Anyway, my point is this -- there are going to be a lot of Republicans  vying for this presidential nomination.  I'm thinking at least a dozen,  probably more.  Let's say half of them -- half of them -- stick it out  right to the spring.  And so many of these primaries (INAUDIBLE)  delegates based on your portion of the vote.  That means they're all  competing for the same number of delegates being portioned out.  It gets  to be mathematically impossible for any one man or woman to amass the  delegates necessary by the time the convention gets to Cleveland.  </p><p>So consider just those vying for the evangelical vote.  Back in 2008, it  was just Mike Huckabee.  Four years later, it was pretty much just Rick  Santorum.  But this time, it'll be Rick and Mike and Ted Cruz and maybe  Ben Carson and maybe Marco Rubio making his Roman Catholic claim to  Christian conservatives.  You get the picture?  It's a crowded picture.   It's a crowded race.  </p><p>To Rick Santorum who joins us on the phone whether he's praying a little  bit more these days. </p><p>Senator, what do you think?</p><p>RICK SANTORUM, (R) FMR. PENNSYLVANIA SENATOR (ON THE PHONE):  I can  always use a few more prayers, Neil.  Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well.   </p><p>SANTORUM:  Look, I don't -- I think that it's way too early.  I mean, if  you go back to four years ago, there were a whole lot of other people  who were considering -- you talk about Rick Santorum being the only  person (INAUDIBLE)I think Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain and Rick  Perry and Newt Gingrich, there're a whole lot of people who were trying  to appeal to those voters that we eventually did very well with.  That's  -- it's going to be a --it's office competitive. It has been competitive  in the past and this thing will winnow itself down.  There isn't --  there isn't enough air in the -- in the chamber for 12 or 13 candidates  to make it for a few weeks.  It will -- it will narrow down in the first  few weeks and the first few primaries.  </p><p>CAVUTO:    All right.  I know you're a very religious guy but I'm  married to math.  I am a numbers geek although I try to be decent and  the numbers just don't add up.  I mean, in other words, just to get to  the 1200, 1300 delegates, you're going to need ultimately what the  states decide on how much is a portion in each state.  It's going to be  an uphill climb and if someone stays in, even a significant group  through April or May -- which is an (INAUDIBLE) possibility, it gets to  be prohibitive.  Does that make you think there is a possibility because  as you know, Senator, when you're a good historian, this used to be more  than norm -- multiple balance and recent history where it's a single  ballot - where that could happen again?</p><p>SANTORUM:  I think -- it certainly, it could've happened last time and  there was -- there was several candidates who (INAUDIBLE) but as you  know, if we go back and look at the last time, there were several  candidates and it narrowed down after a few weeks.  It narrowed down to  really two who had a possibility of winning.  And that is likely to  happen this time also.  But if it doesn't happen, as I said last time  around, it's not the end of the world.  The bottom line is that the  primary process -- let it work, let the competition work, and if there  is a real division, then we'll go to something that I'm certainly not  worried about.  I think an interesting -- a convention where we have  ideas out there and we have candidates pretty (INAUDIBLE) the different  visions for the country in a dynamic way that -- and captivate a nation.   I mean, we haven't had a competitive Republican or Democratic primary  convention and in a couple of generations.  This would be -- I think it  would exciting (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, I'm not ready to bet with you.  I think it's going to  happen.  You could very well be in that mix.  But enough about me.  Back  to you and the guest I had on with me talking about you, including  Foster Friess -- big friend of yours, big backer of yours.  And I raised  with him the fact that he also likes some other guys in the Party.  </p><p>This is Foster Friess from a few days ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Now, I know you placed your bets and your support behind Rick  Santorum but you also have been seen in the company of Senator Cruz.   Were you hedging your bets?</p><p>FOSTER FRIESS, GOP FUNDRAISER:  I'm a Rick Santorum guy and I'm just so  impressed with our entire field and Ted Cruz is one amazing human being  but the challenge that all of us face is how do we get the establishment  and the tea party to kiss and make up because if that doesn't happen,  we're dead in the water as Republicans.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Senator, is he leaving you?</p><p>SANTORUM:  Is he what, Neil?  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  Was he hinting he could drop you?</p><p>SANTORUM:  No.  I mean, I just talked to Foster today, as a matter of  fact.  No.  No.  Foster's a good friend and a great supporter.  And by  the way, we've got -- we're building a very strong team.  I mean, it's  really exciting to see so many people who are encouraging us to get into  this race.  We haven't made any decisions of that yet (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  But he hasn't said anything to you, Senator, where he says, \"I  love you dearly, Rick.  You're an honorable great man but at the first  sign of stumbling, I'm going to leave you in a heartbeat\"?</p><p>SANTORUM:  Oh, my goodness.  No, I don't know.  Foster and I are very,  very close personal friends as well as (INAUDIBLE) in all aspects the  same.  And so -- now I'm not -- that's the last thing I'm concerned  about.  I -- what I'm concerned about is making sure that and before we  enter into this thing that we've got a big, strong team that we can --  we can run the kind of race that's going to be a winning race, not only  in the primary but also in the general--.  Do what Foster's--.  With  Foster, I talked about this a lot.  </p><p>We have to have a message that's a unifying message.  Not just between  the Tea Party and the establishment, but you know reaching out, and  bridging this country together.  I think so many people are sick of the  division that is going on in this country and they are looking for  someone with a fresh message to bring us together.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, we'll watch closely, Senator.  It's always a  pleasure.  Thank you very, very much.</p><p>SANTORUM:  Thank you, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Rick Santorum.</p><p>In the meantime, I want you to think quick.  Taylor Swift, RadioShack,  one is buying up porn sites with all of their nasty stuff.  The other is  selling off anything that is not nailed down, including your personal  stuff.  Which one is sexy and which one is just sad?  We shake it up,  you decide.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Maybe it's just me, but I think this is RadioShack's version of  looking under couch cushions for some spare change, only it's customer  data the bankrupt retailers cashing in and I bet you have no idea it's  even going on.</p><p>Well, it is going on.  Apparently, it is all perfectly legal like  selling mailing list to companies even though RadioShack is on the verge  of no longer even being a company.  Well, Kennedy is worried RadioShack  is not alone, not a fan of this sort of thing, right?</p><p>KENNEDY \"KENNEDY\" HOST ON FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  Neil, very good to be  here with you today.  RadioShack -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  Why do you sound like you don't mean that?</p><p>KENNEDY:  I so mean that.  You know that I'm -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  Continue.</p><p>KENNEDY:  -- I baked you a ham loaf not long ago out of deep adoration  and affection.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, so what is this?  Everyone has a list, right?</p><p>KENNEDY:  They do.  Everyone has a list and if you are dumb enough to go  to a store, and give them your address and your email address, and your  phone number and your name because you want to be a part of their gift  club, and the fan club, and everything else.</p><p>That's on you because what do you think they are doing with it.  Do you  think they are just going to luck into a safe?</p><p>CAVUTO:  But when you order stuff online, someone is scarfing that up  information.</p><p>KENNEDY:  Of course, they are.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Not just the company you're -- </p><p>KENNEDY:  No, I mean, that is the price of doing business in an  electronic age.  I get that.  I accept that responsibility as a  consumer.  I am not wild about it.  Whatever -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  So RadioShack, it's selling everything but the kitchen sink,  right?</p><p>KENNEDY:  Do you know why?  My husband pointed this out this weekend  because they were dismantling a RadioShack sign where we live in the  west side of Los Angeles.  He said, of course, they are going out of  business.  It is called RadioShack, what is the last time you bought a  radio?</p><p>CAVUTO:  Internet shack or something.</p><p>KENNEDY:  Well, it's so fashion backward.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, it is legal, lawyers tell me, legal what they are  doing, not their cup of tea, but it is legal.  But you -- </p><p>KENNEDY:  Attorneys general in Texas and Tennessee actually disagree  with that because in Texas, it violates some of the privacy laws there.   So it will be up to -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  So companies that sells these as back and forth, they can't do  that.</p><p>KENNEDY:  And depending on the state, and that is what a republic is,  that is fine 92.  If you want to live in a state of Texas -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  That is us.  There you go.</p><p>KENNEDY:  Indeed, you are a 100 percent correct as per usual, Neil  Cavuto.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Thank you very much.  So, I think RadioShack will do it someone  will buy the list, and I don't know who because it is a dwindling list,  some of the names go back to 1980s.  I thought many of them are dead.</p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes, and some of those people don't even have a 19 in front of  their birth year if you know what I'm saying.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Is that right?</p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes, they've done a lot of civil war era.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I think we have all their Social Security cards.  I mean, that  was a big -- yes.</p><p>KENNEDY:  AT&amp;T actually has a vested interest in this because they have  done some brand sharing and partnering with RadioShack trying to sell  their devices and they might be we are owed that list by virtue of our  co-investment and co-branding together.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But as an update, how do you advice -- you are big on this sort  of stuff, word -- either on internet, limit what you share, right?</p><p>KENNEDY:  I think you should limit what you share.  I think you should  have one e-mail address for all of your online purchases.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Wouldn't that have saved Hillary Clinton a lot of trouble?</p><p>KENNEDY:  And then you should get your own server and have someone named  Huma be your wolf dog.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Isn't that great that she has her own server?</p><p>KENNEDY:  It's very luxurious.  It used to be a 300 foot luxury yachts,  and those are just for Russian billionaires that's very boring, so 2004,  but your own server, like Martha Stewart used to have her own brand.   But she doesn't even have her own server.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You have a server?</p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Kennedy, thank you very much.</p><p>KENNEDY:  You got served, Neil.  I like you.</p><p>CAVUTO:  She is on fire.  All right, the taxes you leave your heirs will  have you wants to save them will trouble, you might want to hear this  next Republican out.  He is the only one in the Senate not running for  president.  John Thune is going to tell you how he is on a mission from  God.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, raising death tax very much alive and well.  To the  Republican senator who wants to kill off the estate tax itself before,  well, any Democrats including the president get any more bright ideas  about hiking it.</p><p>South Dakota Senator John Thune joins us with something called the Death  Tax Repeal Act of 2015.  Senator, always good to see you.  What is this  about?</p><p>SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD), SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE MEMBER:  Great to be  with you, Neil.  Thank you.  Well, look, we think that the death tax is  punitive.  The farmers and ranchers and small business people, family  businesses and operations.  You want to pass it on to next generation.</p><p>The Congressional Budget Office in 2009 said a third of businesses who  owe the death tax owe more in taxes than what their assets are worth.   So, what typically happens is they have to liquidate the business in  order to pay IRS.</p><p>It is a tax that is inefficient and it hurts.  It hurts jobs and the  economy in this country, and we think it is time for it to go.  And so  we have a bill that would repeal it and end the death tax once and for  all.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Now what kind of support do you have?</p><p>THUNE:  Well, we have, we got good support obviously among Republicans.   We have been reaching out to some Democrats.  There are some Democrats  in the past, who have expressed support for getting rid of the death  tax.</p><p>We hope that they will there be some bipartisan support in Congress.   Kevin Brady is introducing the bill in the House of Representatives.  We  are going to hold a news conference tomorrow to talk about why it's  important that Congress take the steps that are necessary to do away  with this very burdensome, very punitive tax.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, the administration, I am sure you are aware of this,  Senator, comes out and says I don't know what Thune is arguing about.   The fact of the matter is very few pay this tax because very few really  fit the criteria or the means by which to have to pay it.  What do you  say?  I think they say it's closer to 2 percent at that?</p><p>THUNE:  Right, well, if you look at run-up, Neil, in land values in  state like South Dakota over past decade, we have seen land value  increase to point now that about a third of the farms in South Dakota  are actually over the exemption amount.</p><p>So they would be liable to pay the tax.  This is a very big issue in  farm and ranch country where people are land rich and cash poor, but it  also hits a lot of small businesses in this country.  Douglas  (inaudible) did a study here recently that suggested that ending the  death tax would add a million and a half jobs to our economy.</p><p>So, we think it is about jobs.  It is about growth and you think about  how much money people spend to avoid the taxes well, and you know, this  isn't something that in our economy we really don't need.</p><p>We want to encourage people to pass that family farm or business on to  the next generation and getting rid of the death tax would help make  that possible.</p><p>CAVUTO:  As of right now, Senator, you are one of only Republican  senators presently not planning to run for president that I know of.  So  I wonder when you hear and out of your colleagues this idea for  simplified tax code and some of these other stuff, they seemed to be  very unified.  The approach is different.  Will that be a Republican  rallying cry in 2016 because we're a long way from anything that  approaches a simpler tax code?</p><p>THUNE:  I agree, and it should be a rallying cry.  The tax code is way  too complicated.  It is way too costly to comply with.  If we could  broaden tax base in this country and lower rates, I think would unleash  a period of economic growth unlike anything we've seen in a long time  and included in that should be getting rid of the death tax.</p><p>You got an administration in Washington right now that very much likes  to raise taxes, take from some people and give it to others, and we just  think that the best way to get growth in the economy is to get the tax  rate down at the lowest level possible.</p><p>There were people who are making decisions based up what's best for a  return as opposed to tax consequences and so, you know, my hope would be  that our candidates in 2016 are out there aggressively talking about  their plans to reform tax code to make it more simple, more fair, and  lower rates, and focus on economic growth.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Senator Thune, always a pleasure.</p><p>THUNE:  Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO:  If you decide to run or join your other colleagues, just please  let us know, but it's always -- </p><p>THUNE:  You will be first to know, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Senator Thune, great seeing you again.  Thank you.</p><p>THUNE:  You too.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, Taylor sure has been swifted, buying up all these porn  sites, the skinny on what this rock star is really doing.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, a Fox Biz alert for you, Taylor Swift is buying up  all the porn, no, not this porn, dot-porn, grabbing, Taylorswift.porn,  what am I thinking?  And Taylorswift.adult before the dirty domains go  up on sale on the public market this summer.</p><p>\"STRANGE INHERITANCE\" star, Jamie Colby, said nothing strange about it,  if she does not do this now, she could facing legal hurdles later.  She  is not alone.  A lot of stars, actresses are trying to do this kind of  thing, why?</p><p>JAMIE COLBY, FBN HOST, \"STRANGE INHERITANCE\":  It happened to me,  someone took my name, and web site, and probably taking Neil Cavuto dot  whatever, except porn would be a profitable proposition.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Although I've run into this myself, but -- </p><p>COLBY:  The things that it takes to be you, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And you, you know, we know.</p><p>COLBY:  It is becoming more difficult to be me, but it's a hell of a lot  of fun.  I have to tell you that there is no legal case.  As you know,  I'm the illegal smarty pants and almost every state in America.  It is  not illegal to take somebody's name and buy a web site with their name  with the hope of profiting later.</p><p>If you put something on that web site that is disparaging or you make  some profit from having that web site, you got to share the profits and  you might get sued for saying something wrong.</p><p>CAVUTO:  So what if she is taking these sites with her name, and they  are still being used for porn, can they still be used?</p><p>COLBY:  No, not.  Once she buys them she owns them.  She has a  proprietary right to whatever goes on them.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But images of her can pop up on sites where her name is not in  it.</p><p>COLBY:  Well, that she has a right to sue especially if they are used in  disparaging way.</p><p>CAVUTO:  OK, so legally, buying up the names does not shield you from  this type of stuff coming up anyway.</p><p>COLBY:  Well, it is smart of her to buy the name, but I thought question  you were posing was if someone else buys the name with her name, is  there a suit in ex and of itself there isn't.</p><p>I wanted to tell you this could happen to anybody.  I went with Rick  Ritemoth, our weather dude.  He said, you have to come down the street  to the deli.  You are not going to believe it.</p><p>Your face is on an ad for a male healthful product and I said, wait a  minute now, we went over there.  He saw it hanging over the cash  register.  You have to come here, your face on an ad for a male health  product, it was my picture, I seek legal remedy to get it stopped.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Did they take it off the deli wall?</p><p>COLBY:  It is gone.  I do not have it any more.  If Taylor Swift did not  buy the sites, someone else did and they made money, and put something  unflattering of Hershey would have a suit, but who whether or not you  there was a dot-porn.</p><p>CAVUTO:  She is a smart lady as of you, how is the show?</p><p>COLBY:  Great, tonight, if you love \"STRANGE INHERITANCE,\" so many  people do.

This is real families.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I want to string together your reaction stocks when scary  people, you talk to scary people, it seems, find me a window where is  the door.</p><p>COLBY:  Sometimes my chair rolls back.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Look at the time.</p><p>COLBY:  That is Dr. Keith Ablow does, I see we're ought of time.</p><p>CAVUTO:  It's a great show.</p><p>COLBY:  Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO:  She made it because -- </p><p>COLBY:  Tonight at 9 p.m. on Fox Business Network.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You got it done.</p><p>COLBY:  But it's a power to prosper and enjoy.</p><p>CAVUTO:  The idea is to not promote.</p><p>COLBY:  Excuse me?</p><p>CAVUTO:  Look at the time.  We'll have more right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  And what's the deal with all of this constant Ted Cruz bashing,  too brash, too young, too extreme?  To a lot of you too much, Dennis in  Ohio, \"May we point out that Hillary, Biden and Dodd, all the Democratic  candidates for president in 2008 told us how inexperienced Obama was,  yet they got behind him, when they saw an opportunity to gain power.\"   Such is politics.</p><p>Jim emails \"Day one of Cruz and the Democrats already spewing hate and  lies.  And the GOP still have 12 more presidential candidates to come  out.\"</p><p>Al emails, \"There is no doubt that Cruz is a very bright guy, but I  don't see him as having charisma to beat Hillary.  He is just not that  likable.  In addition, I saw his stand on repealing Obamacare, as less  than heroic.  He knew he was fighting a losing battle yet he was willing  to fight until he was the last Republican left standing.\"</p><p>Well, Al, I just say hear him out because he will be part of a very  vibrant mix of candidates and ideas that will stimulate and who will  stimulate the debate.</p><p>Russ and Cathy email, \"Hi, Neil, unfortunately, I think you are correct.   What a fabulous Cabinet it would be if the Republicans became a team  instead of having the blood-letting even if they just played, \"Rock,  paper, scissors.\"  We would have a great president.</p><p>Then Mitt Romney insist that it might be a crowded field, but by  convention time, it will be down to one nominee.  I disagree.  We will  not have a nominee by convention time, and that is when Republican seek  him out, as maybe a consensus candidate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  There are a lot of those guys were bummed out when you said you  were not going to run.  So I'm wondering now, you say never?</p><p>MITT ROMNEY, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  This is not going to  happen, I'm sorry, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO:  That is never, never.</p><p>ROMNEY:  It's not going to happen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  I don't know, never, never sounds like maybe to me.  Stacy  emails, \"I just watched your interview with Mr. Romney, it was good, I  sure wish he would have made it into office.\"</p><p>Tony in Vermont, \"My comment on your Facebook post about Mitt Romney had  600 likes, in first 30 minutes, did I just go viral?\"  No, you are just  hitching along for ride.</p><p>Meanwhile, Henry via centurylink.net, \"Neil, for a long time, several  times, I have written you about criticism about your constant  interruptions and also your stupid laugh.</p><p>Today, your interview with Governor Mitt Romney was the latest in your  annoying actions.  So I have designated you as the newest on my list of  men a carried for a long time as the least admirable three men in the  world, the title you are now on is jerk.\"</p><p>Well, at least, you didn't call me fat.  By the way, you got to tell me,  who are other two?  Buffalo businessman, Karl Paladino weighing in on  2016 and Mitt Romney.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARL PALADINO (R), FORMER NEW YORK GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE:  We need a  guy who can create jobs that understands means of creating jobs does not  side with 1 percent against the 99 percent.  The Republican base, that  is there, many of them did not come out for Romney, they done vote.   That hurt him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Tommy in North Carolina, not a fan of Carl's, \"Alan Grayson is  a very good businessman.  That does not mean he is sane.  Grayson,  Donald Trump, and Carl Paladino should form a club.\"  That would be a  wealthy club.</p><p>Russ emails, \"Good to see Paladino back.  Good ideas as always.\"   Finally, this from Jim, \"Neil, I see on the news that Hillary has a new  e-mail account.  Since she isn't using the old one, can we see the  server?\"</p><p>You know, well, I guess, she is not using it.

I'm Neil Cavuto.  Glad to  have you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And who knew Google has its own fast pass to the White House?  I'm  talking very fast, fast pass and apparently, one that never expires.   You should be so lucky with yours at Disney because Google employees get  on a lot of rides at this White House park -- try 230 of them since the  president first took office.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, that roughly (INAUDIBLE) about one a week and apparently, they  weren't all going for the ride.  Many of these meetings came as the  government was wrapping up its antitrust investigation into Google.  So  awkward.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, I don't know.  But here's what I do know.  The Federal Trade  Commission eventually closed that investigation.  Google agreed to make  some voluntary changes to its business practices.  But you needn't  Google the term \"quid pro quo\" to know something doesn't smell right  because I don't know about you but this kind of stuff doesn't happen to  us.  Taxpayers don't get these kind of breaks or fast passes.  In fact,  for most businesses, it is far more common to be shut out of the White  House than ever get so much as a kind word from the White House.</p><p>But again, that is just me.</p><p>Steve Moore wants to shut this ride down.  But Basil Smikle says it is  (INAUDIBLE), I should say it's not such a bad ride.</p><p>You don't like the sound of any of it?</p><p>STEVE MOORE, HERITAGE CHIEF ECONOMIST:  I'm old enough to remember when  Google and Apple and Microsoft and Netflix didn't even have lobbying  operations in Washington, you know?  And the high tech community in  Silicon Valley just said, \"Leave us alone.  We'll do our thing and you  do your thing.\"  And now, they have these massive lobbying operations in  Washington.  And it's basically the Google administration right now.  I  mean, they (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  But they're not alone, I guess, because their sheer size, the - - it looks a little more obvious.</p><p>BASIL SMIKLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, I think to your point  exactly, tech -- the government and our legislature always lags behind  technology.  And right now, these companies are sort of ruling the  world.  It's not surprising.</p><p>MOORE:  (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>CAVUTO:  So why wasn't he meeting with these Google guys before the  launch of the Affordable Care Act (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>SMIKLE:  Well, it's not surprising that he's meeting with them now.   Look at all (INAUDIBLE) that we've been talking about in the last year.   We talked about.</p><p>CAVUTO:  The sheer number of meetings, (INAUDIBLE), come on.</p><p>SMIKLE:  .we've talked about -- we've talked about immigration and  they're certainly going to lobby for high school workers.</p><p>CAVUTO:  One a week.</p><p>SMIKLE:  We talked about net neutrality.  That's going to be a key  issue.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I know, I know.  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SMIKLE:  The problem is -- the point is that they have a lot of stuff to  talk about and (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MOORE:  They have.  (INAUDIBLE) problem.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>SMIKLE:  I don't begrudge them but using their resources in trying to  push (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MOORE:  The interesting thing about the net neutrality issue is that  Google was on the side of net neutrality at the beginning and then --  then saw the government got their fangs.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, it evolved.  They evolved as they've been getting bigger.   (INAUDIBLE).  If George Bush were doing this with defense contractors  every week, you would be -- flip a gasket, as would I.</p><p>SMIKLE:  I probably would but I would -- instead of pointing to George  Bush, I'd point to Ronald Reagan.  Think about the coziness that he had  with some of the media companies 'cause they -- he actually sparked a  lot of this sort of consolidation in media under his watch.  You had  more companies than ever before in history and the mergers and  acquisitions.  So that's (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>CAVUTO:  I think it's fair to say during that time though, he did not  have a cozy relationship with the media.  They were blistering him every  day.</p><p>SMIKLE:  But he did with big business and we forgave him that or others  forgave him that.  So.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Not the Washington Post.</p><p>MOORE:  This is the most (INAUDIBLE) situation of all though.  You have  big - $4 trillion government and you have these massive companies like  Google -- I think Google's the biggest company in the world right now in  terms of revenues -- and you put them together and bad things happen.   We want big government and big business to stay on top.</p><p>CAVUTO:  See, but I agree, Basil, but I think it's fine for a CEO --  CEOs -- to meet at the White House.  I think he gets a little  problematic when it turns into like \"Skip the pass, you can just walk in  through the front gate.\"  </p><p>SMIKLE:  Well, I don't know if it was that -- if they had that kind of  access.  But the reality.</p><p>CAVUTO:  It all comes back to bite you.  Remember what happened to  JPMorgan Chase.  Jamie Dimon could just waltz into the Oval Office  anytime he wanted.  As soon as he started getting attacked critical, not  only did they take the fast pass away, before you know it, the firm was  facing billions of dollars (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SMIKLE:  So are you saying that the Bush administration shouldn't have  allowed him in as much as they should've?</p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm saying not every week.  That's what I'm saying.  I just  think that that gets a little weird.</p><p>SMIKLE:  Well, I think as businesses grow, as industries go, I would  imagine that this occurred with the auto industry at some point -- that  as they become such huge (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  Talk to others.  Talk to others.  Talk to others.  </p><p>SMIKLE:  When they have such a huge role in our business, in our  industry, they're going to be meeting with government officials  (INAUDIBLE) all the time.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But it's the same thing I said at this president (INAUDIBLE)  meeting with the likes of Al Sharpton (INAUDIBLE) the racial issue --  meet with other representatives from points of view.  But be fair and  balanced.  He is now choosing \"I'm going to be fair if I focus on  Google, I focus on Apple, and I kind of ignore everyone else.\" </p><p>SMIKLE:  But who else is driving our conversations about technology  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, those guys will never get the chance.  Those guys will  never get the chance.</p><p>MOORE:  There are thousands and thousands of small businesses in the  technology industry, by the way, biting at the heels of Google and I  guarantee you, most of them do not have a lobbyist.  I'm sure they don't  have a (INAUDIBLE).  But that's -- I have a little bit take on this  thing.  You, Neil.  I mean, I just think when the government tries to  regulate the high tech industry, as you said, you put it very well.   There are three generations behind where this industry is at.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  But what did I say about regulating technology?  I didn't  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MOORE:  No, no.  I just -- I just mean -- I think the problem.</p><p>CAVUTO:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MOORE:  .of course, Google's going to have all these lobbyists because  the government is sticking its fingers in everything that they do.</p><p>SMIKLE:  But I agree the small businesses should have a role at the  table.  </p><p>MOORE:  No.  No, no.  That's not my point.</p><p>SMIKLE:  I know but I do (INAUDIBLE) -- I do think -- I do think that  small businesses (INAUDIBLE) -- should have -- should have (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MOORE:  The government -- there's too many of them.  There are millions  of small businesses.  There's not enough Lincoln Bedrooms.</p><p>CAVUTO:  He makes more sense than you do.  That's scary, right there.  </p><p>SMIKLE:  That's scary, wow.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Guys, seriously, thank you both very, very much.</p><p>In the meantime, no wonder so many want to (INAUDIBLE) Google.  With  connections like those, who wouldn't?  </p><p>Now, add Ruth Porat onto that growing list of eager Google recruits.   But Ms. Porat isn't just any recruit, is she?  She's the chief financial  officer of investment bank Morgan Stanley, one of the most powerful  women -- actually, one of the most powerful anyone on Wall Street.  And  now, she's going to become CFO of Google.</p><p>Add her to a growing list of Wall Streeters going to tech including a  top Goldman strategist to Twitter or -- continuing with this revolving  door thing -- former Obama advisor David Plouffe to Uber and Jay Carney  to Amazon.</p><p>Forget what this means to tech.  What does this mean to what's left of  Wall Street?  </p><p>Scott Martin says not much but given the way the White House, he says,  has been bashing Wall Street, not much we can do to stop it.</p><p>The allure, I think, for a lot of them is technology's cool, there's  actually even more money in it which is hard to believe because you're  sinfully rich enough but what's going on here?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, UNITED ADVISORS CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST:  Sinfully rich.   Yes, that's why I describe myself on Twitter--.  Neil, it's tough.  I  mean, the dreaded brain drain in the financial industry is upon us.  I  mean, the financial industry, the markets couldn't even keep around a  nice lady like Veronica Vain -- look her up -- sports fans being  interesting because the allure is not there anymore, Neil.  Really, I  mean, it is the technology sector.  It is all these cool things that are  going on outside of this once-big structural firm that was Wall Street,  that where all the banks are (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  I think it's money, Scott.  I really do think it's money  because as much as the financial industry pays, it's chump change in  comparison to the stake you take when a technology company does well,  goes well, between options and advances and stock, I mean you become a  gazilionaire a lot quicker there than you ever could on Wall Street.</p><p>MARTIN:  You do.  I think Wall Street tough too, Neil, also thanks to  the administration, thanks to the financial crisis, has a little bit of  an image problem still.  In fact, I'd argue that the financial crisis,  our financial situation, for a lot of thee banks is not near what it was  before the crisis.  So you have the perception on both Main Street and  some of the certainly people in D.C. that say, \"You know what?  The  banks are still doing things wrong and to your point about the  financials of them, Dodd-Frank, (INAUDIBLE) regulations, all things that  are out there now -- Elizabeth Warren being a big party in the  Democrats' side of.</p><p>CAVUTO:  No, I think the bloom is off the rose.  You're absolutely right  on that as you are in these issues.  And I think the latest telltale  sign, college graduates, MBA graduates used to be by overwhelmingly  flock to the -- Wall Street.  Now, it's half and half and that other  half is going to technology.</p><p>MARTIN:  And here's the ironic thing, right?  Now, the only reason that  you probably like your bank or that you can deal with them is because  the technology behind it allows you to do what you want to do.  But if  you work at that bank, if you have that high-paying job on Wall Stree  which isn't as high-paying as it once was, that doesn't hold its same  mustard as it did, say, five, 10 years ago,.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You're right.  Scott, you will be the last guy standing and all  the money will be yours.  </p><p>All right.  Scott.</p><p>MARTIN:  That's a scary thought.  See you later.</p><p>CAVUTO:  That is scary.  Thank you, my friend.</p><p>In the meantime, Wall Street's not the only one with a Silicon Valley  problem.  You might have one.  </p><p>It's true because Fidelity and other money managers are striking deals  with tech startups like Uber and Pinterest who load up your retirement  portfolio.  And I bet you didn't even know it.  </p><p>And what's even scary to Larry Winget is they're doing it in companies  that don't have any money or (INAUDIBLE) of making money anytime soon.</p><p>Larry, the argument for this is that, \"Hey, we're spreading our bets.   We're giving you a more diversified portfolio.  We don't know the  percentage that they pour in to these kind of companies but we know they  never did before.\"  So what do you make of this?</p><p>LARRY WINGET, \"GROW A PAIR\" AUTHOR:  Well, I wouldn't find it especially  alarming if they're pouring big percentages into it if you're a retiree  and you're counting on this to be your retirement fund to live on  because it's pure speculation what these tech startups are going to be  worth.  They value them but that value is not based on publicly-released  financial statements.  They've never been traded anywhere before.  These  are privately-held companies.  And from a guy like me, it would just be  a made-up number.  When I look at some of the stuff that's out there --  look at Uber, for instance.  In mid-2013, it was supposedly worth $3.5  billion.  Now, the valuation is over $40 billion.  A thousand percent  when the S&amp;P 500 is up 28 percent.  How did they come up with a 1,000  percent growth in less than two years?  That would bother me.  </p><p>CAVUTO: All right.  Well, they could also move on to the government, if  that's -- if they don't make (INAUDIBLE).  But do you think they  shouldn't invest in this (INAUDIBLE), that it shouldn't' be part of any  portfolio or do you think when it comes to people and their retirement  money -- 'cause a lot (INAUDIBLE), this is multiyear, multi-decade  money, that there shouldn't be a little bit of aggressive investment in  there anyway.</p><p>WINGET:  I have no problem with there being a very small percentage and  some of them are saying -- some of the mutual funds are saying you will  only be a very small percentage.  The good side is if it's very small,  you're not going to lose a lot of money.  But the bad side is even if  they make a lot of money and -- for instance, Uber is worth a thousand  times more than it was a couple of years ago, you're probably not going  to make a lot of money either.  It all comes down to how old you are  (INAUDIBLE).  If you're 40 years old, you could -= and you have most of  your earning years ahead of you, you could afford to be a little more  risky.  If you're in your 60s, you can't afford that kind of risk.  Yes,  there's a lot of money to be made but there's always the other side of  that -- there's a lot of money to be lost and I don't want any of that  money as I approach retirement to be mine when it comes to losing it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, not everyone can write an incredible bestseller one after  the other like you.  People have to hedge their beds.</p><p>Larry Winget, thank you very, very much.</p><p>WINGET:  Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, holy moly.  With Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee and Ben  Carson likely carving up the Christian vote, are you starting to think  that Rick Santorum doesn't have a prayer?  </p><p>Rick's here to say \"You don't have a clue.\"</p><p>And you think making cakes is about as far as 3D printers can go?  Then  this just takes the cake.  Now, they're printing construction guys right  of their jobs.</p><p>What the Tech?!  What do we do when tech turns on us?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>Well, who needs an architect or construction expert if a 3D printer can  spit out what they do and in a fraction of the time.  What the tech?!   What just happened?</p><p>Up first in the segment that is taking the nation by storm, the storm  over these cool 3D printers that came in peace but are now apparently  peacefully printing out pink slips for many in the building industry.  I  warned you, America.</p><p>To tech watcher Shama Hyder on what this is all about.</p><p>Shana, what's going -- what can these printers do that's got so many in  the construction industry going nuts?</p><p>SHAMA HYDER, MARKETING ZEN CEO:  Well, these printers are pretty cool in  a lot of ways because they do have the capability of building an entire  building.  I mean, they're -- they -- they can -- they're stackable.   You -- so if you have a job in the construction industry which involves  hitting a nail with a hammer over and over again, you should be scared  because chances are, some of the printers are going to take that over.   But really, if you're.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And do that as well?</p><p>HYDER:  They're going to do that but they're really good at repetitive  tasks.  But when it comes to strategically building something, you still  need human minds behind it.  So this is the whole (INAUDIBLE) we've been  hearing for so long -- is technology replacing humans?  No.  It's really  not.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I saw \"2001 Space Odyssey.\"  I remember how a certain pod bay  door wasn't opened so I know how this ends.  Where's this all going?</p><p>HYDER:  This has a different ending though.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Oh, really?</p><p>HYDER:  Yes, it does and I'll tell you -- because technology (INAUDIBLE)  can really assist people.  I think we'll see homes becoming cheaper in  many ways which would -- I mean, I'd appreciate that.  That'd be great.   But also imagine in.</p><p>CAVUTO:  If you had a job to buy the home.</p><p>HYDER:  That's right.  But imagine in places where it's war-torn or a  storm comes through and totally demolishes that community.  Having  something like this could mean that people have shelter within days,  within hours, and that's powerful.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  As long as they don't advance into the TV news  business (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>All right.  Next up, a workout suit that will intensify your workout.   Forget three hours sweating up a storm, they say you put this thing on,  20 minutes, you have the same effect and you're done.  Now, if they can  get that puppy down to 20 seconds, sign me up.  But in the meantime,  Shama, how does this thing even work?</p><p>HYDER:  So it's pretty neat.  It's got electrodes that go on your skin  essentially through this body suit which looks just like a normal gym  suit, something you might wear to workout.  But essentially, it works  with the muscles so they work out harder.  This really neat (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, how is it -- is it telling you \"You're not working hard  enough\", or is it just dragging your hand to the punching bag?</p><p>HYDER:  No, you do have to put in the motion.  You do have to put in the  work, right, but it essentially.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Oh, so I actually have to work-out.</p><p>HYDER:  You do -- you do -- you do have to get up.  You do have to work- out but it amplifies it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, that's the problem.  All right.  All right.</p><p>HYDER:  Right.  So there's no -- there's no magic here but it will  amplify the effects you get.</p><p>CAVUTO:  In other words, you get a lot more done in a shorter period.</p><p>HYDER:  Absolutely.  But are you going to see like the normal mom going  to do this after dropping the kids off and going to gym?  No.  But for  athletes, for people in the sports industry where every little edge  counts, this is going to be huge.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, apparently, I'll have more time on my hands after a 3D  printer takes my place.  It just might work out.</p><p>Meanwhile, this is incredible because after that airbus crash in the  south of France, for rival Boeing, it's an announcement that might be  eerily time because the company has now uncovered two black boxes in the  French Alps.  That is, the company behind this crash.  The problem is  one is very badly damaged.  The other is missing its memory card.  </p><p>But what Boeing has come up with might make black boxes themselves  obsolete, totally unnecessary.  The airplane maker just patented a force  field of lasers.  What that would do is make a plane impenetrable to  missiles or outside forces.  So let me be clear here, it wouldn't  prevent the kind of crash we saw this week in France but it might have  stopped that Malaysian jet from being shotdown over the Ukraine last  year. </p><p>So Shama, I guess the only issue here would be the expense for this,  right?</p><p>HYDER:  Yes.  I mean, this is going to be expensive but innovation  generally is until it's not, right?  But anytime you're talking  electromagnetic fields, you're talking about new technology that the  U.S. government uses now that can see through concrete walls.  And so,  this isn't necessarily new technology.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And it doesn't interrupt to them -- and that static field  doesn't' interrupt with the cockpit controls or any of the device.</p><p>HYDER:  And so, I mean, this is all the stuff that they're going to have  to work out, obviously.  It's very, very early stages but yes.  It's  good.  It's going to be a huge expense but as they -- as they tinker  with it, as they play with it, it'll obviously get cheaper and hopefully  make the world safer.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  There was a big push -- I mean -- after this shoot-down  that \"Hey, we have to help or retrofit airlines with this sort of  technology.\"  Now, again, to your point, it depends on the expense.  But  I kind of think something like this is just a matter of time.</p><p>HYDER:  It is.  It's absolutely a matter of time.  And once they test it  out, they'll get better and better with it.  There's certain things  that'll make technology overall cheaper like battery life.  That's  something Google's working very hard right now on.  If they can figure  out a way for batteries to be cheaper, last longer, all of this  technology becomes easier, cheaper, faster.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  We'll watch closely, Shama.  Thank you very, very  much.</p><p>HYDER:  My pleasure.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, saints preserve us.  We've got a lot of saints in this  presidential race.  Men of God who have no problem talking about God.   Now, four years ago, only Rick Santorum was doing that.  Now, a fee  other presidential wannabees art harping in.  Harp.  (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>Anyway, think Rick is losing the religious right?  Why don't I ask Rick  myself?  Because he's here and only here, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Boy, this just boils me.  </p><p>Remember when I was chatting with Mitt Romney yesterday about this  likely  very crowded Republican presidential field?  Now, I said it is  so crowded, good luck, Republicans, deciding on a nominee by convention  time, like they did back with him, back 2012.  Come 2016, it's not going  to happen.  Now, he scoffed. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  If there s potion by vote -- primaries -- falling out, you  could get to a situation which begs the issue, would you entertain the  party coming to you and saying, \"Governor, we're at a draw here.\"</p><p>MITT ROMNEY, (R) 2012 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  First, that's not going  to happen.  Two, I'm not.</p><p>CAVUTO:  It's happened before.</p><p>ROMNEY:  Two, I'm not an entertainer.  And three, that was a long time  ago that happened.  Look, we're going to have our nominee and I'm one of  those people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, he may say never, never, never.  But girls told me that  all the time in high school before my mother finally said yes and we  went to the prom together.</p><p>Anyway, my point is this -- there are going to be a lot of Republicans  vying for this presidential nomination.  I'm thinking at least a dozen,  probably more.  Let's say half of them -- half of them -- stick it out  right to the spring.  And so many of these primaries (INAUDIBLE)  delegates based on your portion of the vote.  That means they're all  competing for the same number of delegates being portioned out.  It gets  to be mathematically impossible for any one man or woman to amass the  delegates necessary by the time the convention gets to Cleveland.  </p><p>So consider just those vying for the evangelical vote.  Back in 2008, it  was just Mike Huckabee.  Four years later, it was pretty much just Rick  Santorum.  But this time, it'll be Rick and Mike and Ted Cruz and maybe  Ben Carson and maybe Marco Rubio making his Roman Catholic claim to  Christian conservatives.  You get the picture?  It's a crowded picture.   It's a crowded race.  </p><p>To Rick Santorum who joins us on the phone whether he's praying a little  bit more these days. </p><p>Senator, what do you think?</p><p>RICK SANTORUM, (R) FMR. PENNSYLVANIA SENATOR (ON THE PHONE):  I can  always use a few more prayers, Neil.  Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well.   </p><p>SANTORUM:  Look, I don't -- I think that it's way too early.  I mean, if  you go back to four years ago, there were a whole lot of other people  who were considering -- you talk about Rick Santorum being the only  person (INAUDIBLE)I think Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain and Rick  Perry and Newt Gingrich, there're a whole lot of people who were trying  to appeal to those voters that we eventually did very well with.  That's  -- it's going to be a --it's office competitive. It has been competitive  in the past and this thing will winnow itself down.  There isn't --  there isn't enough air in the -- in the chamber for 12 or 13 candidates  to make it for a few weeks.  It will -- it will narrow down in the first  few weeks and the first few primaries.  </p><p>CAVUTO:    All right.  I know you're a very religious guy but I'm  married to math.  I am a numbers geek although I try to be decent and  the numbers just don't add up.  I mean, in other words, just to get to  the 1200, 1300 delegates, you're going to need ultimately what the  states decide on how much is a portion in each state.  It's going to be  an uphill climb and if someone stays in, even a significant group  through April or May -- which is an (INAUDIBLE) possibility, it gets to  be prohibitive.  Does that make you think there is a possibility because  as you know, Senator, when you're a good historian, this used to be more  than norm -- multiple balance and recent history where it's a single  ballot - where that could happen again?</p><p>SANTORUM:  I think -- it certainly, it could've happened last time and  there was -- there was several candidates who (INAUDIBLE) but as you  know, if we go back and look at the last time, there were several  candidates and it narrowed down after a few weeks.  It narrowed down to  really two who had a possibility of winning.  And that is likely to  happen this time also.  But if it doesn't happen, as I said last time  around, it's not the end of the world.  The bottom line is that the  primary process -- let it work, let the competition work, and if there  is a real division, then we'll go to something that I'm certainly not  worried about.  I think an interesting -- a convention where we have  ideas out there and we have candidates pretty (INAUDIBLE) the different  visions for the country in a dynamic way that -- and captivate a nation.   I mean, we haven't had a competitive Republican or Democratic primary  convention and in a couple of generations.  This would be -- I think it  would exciting (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, I'm not ready to bet with you.  I think it's going to  happen.  You could very well be in that mix.  But enough about me.  Back  to you and the guest I had on with me talking about you, including  Foster Friess -- big friend of yours, big backer of yours.  And I raised  with him the fact that he also likes some other guys in the Party.  </p><p>This is Foster Friess from a few days ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Now, I know you placed your bets and your support behind Rick  Santorum but you also have been seen in the company of Senator Cruz.   Were you hedging your bets?</p><p>FOSTER FRIESS, GOP FUNDRAISER:  I'm a Rick Santorum guy and I'm just so  impressed with our entire field and Ted Cruz is one amazing human being  but the challenge that all of us face is how do we get the establishment  and the tea party to kiss and make up because if that doesn't happen,  we're dead in the water as Republicans.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Senator, is he leaving you?</p><p>SANTORUM:  Is he what, Neil?  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  Was he hinting he could drop you?</p><p>SANTORUM:  No.  I mean, I just talked to Foster today, as a matter of  fact.  No.  No.  Foster's a good friend and a great supporter.  And by  the way, we've got -- we're building a very strong team.  I mean, it's  really exciting to see so many people who are encouraging us to get into  this race.  We haven't made any decisions of that yet (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  But he hasn't said anything to you, Senator, where he says, \"I  love you dearly, Rick.  You're an honorable great man but at the first  sign of stumbling, I'm going to leave you in a heartbeat\"?</p><p>SANTORUM:  Oh, my goodness.  No, I don't know.  Foster and I are very,  very close personal friends as well as (INAUDIBLE) in all aspects the  same.  And so -- now I'm not -- that's the last thing I'm concerned  about.  I -- what I'm concerned about is making sure that and before we  enter into this thing that we've got a big, strong team that we can --  we can run the kind of race that's going to be a winning race, not only  in the primary but also in the general--.  Do what Foster's--.  With  Foster, I talked about this a lot.  </p><p>We have to have a message that's a unifying message.  Not just between  the Tea Party and the establishment, but you know reaching out, and  bridging this country together.  I think so many people are sick of the  division that is going on in this country and they are looking for  someone with a fresh message to bring us together.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, we'll watch closely, Senator.  It's always a  pleasure.  Thank you very, very much.</p><p>SANTORUM:  Thank you, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Rick Santorum.</p><p>In the meantime, I want you to think quick.  Taylor Swift, RadioShack,  one is buying up porn sites with all of their nasty stuff.  The other is  selling off anything that is not nailed down, including your personal  stuff.  Which one is sexy and which one is just sad?  We shake it up,  you decide.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Maybe it's just me, but I think this is RadioShack's version of  looking under couch cushions for some spare change, only it's customer  data the bankrupt retailers cashing in and I bet you have no idea it's  even going on.</p><p>Well, it is going on.  Apparently, it is all perfectly legal like  selling mailing list to companies even though RadioShack is on the verge  of no longer even being a company.  Well, Kennedy is worried RadioShack  is not alone, not a fan of this sort of thing, right?</p><p>KENNEDY \"KENNEDY\" HOST ON FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  Neil, very good to be  here with you today.  RadioShack -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  Why do you sound like you don't mean that?</p><p>KENNEDY:  I so mean that.  You know that I'm -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  Continue.</p><p>KENNEDY:  -- I baked you a ham loaf not long ago out of deep adoration  and affection.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, so what is this?  Everyone has a list, right?</p><p>KENNEDY:  They do.  Everyone has a list and if you are dumb enough to go  to a store, and give them your address and your email address, and your  phone number and your name because you want to be a part of their gift  club, and the fan club, and everything else.</p><p>That's on you because what do you think they are doing with it.  Do you  think they are just going to luck into a safe?</p><p>CAVUTO:  But when you order stuff online, someone is scarfing that up  information.</p><p>KENNEDY:  Of course, they are.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Not just the company you're -- </p><p>KENNEDY:  No, I mean, that is the price of doing business in an  electronic age.  I get that.  I accept that responsibility as a  consumer.  I am not wild about it.  Whatever -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  So RadioShack, it's selling everything but the kitchen sink,  right?</p><p>KENNEDY:  Do you know why?  My husband pointed this out this weekend  because they were dismantling a RadioShack sign where we live in the  west side of Los Angeles.  He said, of course, they are going out of  business.  It is called RadioShack, what is the last time you bought a  radio?</p><p>CAVUTO:  Internet shack or something.</p><p>KENNEDY:  Well, it's so fashion backward.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, it is legal, lawyers tell me, legal what they are  doing, not their cup of tea, but it is legal.  But you -- </p><p>KENNEDY:  Attorneys general in Texas and Tennessee actually disagree  with that because in Texas, it violates some of the privacy laws there.   So it will be up to -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  So companies that sells these as back and forth, they can't do  that.</p><p>KENNEDY:  And depending on the state, and that is what a republic is,  that is fine 92.  If you want to live in a state of Texas -- </p><p>CAVUTO:  That is us.  There you go.</p><p>KENNEDY:  Indeed, you are a 100 percent correct as per usual, Neil  Cavuto.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Thank you very much.  So, I think RadioShack will do it someone  will buy the list, and I don't know who because it is a dwindling list,  some of the names go back to 1980s.  I thought many of them are dead.</p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes, and some of those people don't even have a 19 in front of  their birth year if you know what I'm saying.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Is that right?</p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes, they've done a lot of civil war era.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I think we have all their Social Security cards.  I mean, that  was a big -- yes.</p><p>KENNEDY:  AT&amp;T actually has a vested interest in this because they have  done some brand sharing and partnering with RadioShack trying to sell  their devices and they might be we are owed that list by virtue of our  co-investment and co-branding together.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But as an update, how do you advice -- you are big on this sort  of stuff, word -- either on internet, limit what you share, right?</p><p>KENNEDY:  I think you should limit what you share.  I think you should  have one e-mail address for all of your online purchases.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Wouldn't that have saved Hillary Clinton a lot of trouble?</p><p>KENNEDY:  And then you should get your own server and have someone named  Huma be your wolf dog.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Isn't that great that she has her own server?</p><p>KENNEDY:  It's very luxurious.  It used to be a 300 foot luxury yachts,  and those are just for Russian billionaires that's very boring, so 2004,  but your own server, like Martha Stewart used to have her own brand.   But she doesn't even have her own server.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You have a server?</p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Kennedy, thank you very much.</p><p>KENNEDY:  You got served, Neil.  I like you.</p><p>CAVUTO:  She is on fire.  All right, the taxes you leave your heirs will  have you wants to save them will trouble, you might want to hear this  next Republican out.  He is the only one in the Senate not running for  president.  John Thune is going to tell you how he is on a mission from  God.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, raising death tax very much alive and well.  To the  Republican senator who wants to kill off the estate tax itself before,  well, any Democrats including the president get any more bright ideas  about hiking it.</p><p>South Dakota Senator John Thune joins us with something called the Death  Tax Repeal Act of 2015.  Senator, always good to see you.  What is this  about?</p><p>SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD), SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE MEMBER:  Great to be  with you, Neil.  Thank you.  Well, look, we think that the death tax is  punitive.  The farmers and ranchers and small business people, family  businesses and operations.  You want to pass it on to next generation.</p><p>The Congressional Budget Office in 2009 said a third of businesses who  owe the death tax owe more in taxes than what their assets are worth.   So, what typically happens is they have to liquidate the business in  order to pay IRS.</p><p>It is a tax that is inefficient and it hurts.  It hurts jobs and the  economy in this country, and we think it is time for it to go.  And so  we have a bill that would repeal it and end the death tax once and for  all.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Now what kind of support do you have?</p><p>THUNE:  Well, we have, we got good support obviously among Republicans.   We have been reaching out to some Democrats.  There are some Democrats  in the past, who have expressed support for getting rid of the death  tax.</p><p>We hope that they will there be some bipartisan support in Congress.   Kevin Brady is introducing the bill in the House of Representatives.  We  are going to hold a news conference tomorrow to talk about why it's  important that Congress take the steps that are necessary to do away  with this very burdensome, very punitive tax.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, the administration, I am sure you are aware of this,  Senator, comes out and says I don't know what Thune is arguing about.   The fact of the matter is very few pay this tax because very few really  fit the criteria or the means by which to have to pay it.  What do you  say?  I think they say it's closer to 2 percent at that?</p><p>THUNE:  Right, well, if you look at run-up, Neil, in land values in  state like South Dakota over past decade, we have seen land value  increase to point now that about a third of the farms in South Dakota  are actually over the exemption amount.</p><p>So they would be liable to pay the tax.  This is a very big issue in  farm and ranch country where people are land rich and cash poor, but it  also hits a lot of small businesses in this country.  Douglas  (inaudible) did a study here recently that suggested that ending the  death tax would add a million and a half jobs to our economy.</p><p>So, we think it is about jobs.  It is about growth and you think about  how much money people spend to avoid the taxes well, and you know, this  isn't something that in our economy we really don't need.</p><p>We want to encourage people to pass that family farm or business on to  the next generation and getting rid of the death tax would help make  that possible.</p><p>CAVUTO:  As of right now, Senator, you are one of only Republican  senators presently not planning to run for president that I know of.  So  I wonder when you hear and out of your colleagues this idea for  simplified tax code and some of these other stuff, they seemed to be  very unified.  The approach is different.  Will that be a Republican  rallying cry in 2016 because we're a long way from anything that  approaches a simpler tax code?</p><p>THUNE:  I agree, and it should be a rallying cry.  The tax code is way  too complicated.  It is way too costly to comply with.  If we could  broaden tax base in this country and lower rates, I think would unleash  a period of economic growth unlike anything we've seen in a long time  and included in that should be getting rid of the death tax.</p><p>You got an administration in Washington right now that very much likes  to raise taxes, take from some people and give it to others, and we just  think that the best way to get growth in the economy is to get the tax  rate down at the lowest level possible.</p><p>There were people who are making decisions based up what's best for a  return as opposed to tax consequences and so, you know, my hope would be  that our candidates in 2016 are out there aggressively talking about  their plans to reform tax code to make it more simple, more fair, and  lower rates, and focus on economic growth.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Senator Thune, always a pleasure.</p><p>THUNE:  Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO:  If you decide to run or join your other colleagues, just please  let us know, but it's always -- </p><p>THUNE:  You will be first to know, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Senator Thune, great seeing you again.  Thank you.</p><p>THUNE:  You too.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, Taylor sure has been swifted, buying up all these porn  sites, the skinny on what this rock star is really doing.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, a Fox Biz alert for you, Taylor Swift is buying up  all the porn, no, not this porn, dot-porn, grabbing, Taylorswift.porn,  what am I thinking?  And Taylorswift.adult before the dirty domains go  up on sale on the public market this summer.</p><p>\"STRANGE INHERITANCE\" star, Jamie Colby, said nothing strange about it,  if she does not do this now, she could facing legal hurdles later.  She  is not alone.  A lot of stars, actresses are trying to do this kind of  thing, why?</p><p>JAMIE COLBY, FBN HOST, \"STRANGE INHERITANCE\":  It happened to me,  someone took my name, and web site, and probably taking Neil Cavuto dot  whatever, except porn would be a profitable proposition.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Although I've run into this myself, but -- </p><p>COLBY:  The things that it takes to be you, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And you, you know, we know.</p><p>COLBY:  It is becoming more difficult to be me, but it's a hell of a lot  of fun.  I have to tell you that there is no legal case.  As you know,  I'm the illegal smarty pants and almost every state in America.  It is  not illegal to take somebody's name and buy a web site with their name  with the hope of profiting later.</p><p>If you put something on that web site that is disparaging or you make  some profit from having that web site, you got to share the profits and  you might get sued for saying something wrong.</p><p>CAVUTO:  So what if she is taking these sites with her name, and they  are still being used for porn, can they still be used?</p><p>COLBY:  No, not.  Once she buys them she owns them.  She has a  proprietary right to whatever goes on them.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But images of her can pop up on sites where her name is not in  it.</p><p>COLBY:  Well, that she has a right to sue especially if they are used in  disparaging way.</p><p>CAVUTO:  OK, so legally, buying up the names does not shield you from  this type of stuff coming up anyway.</p><p>COLBY:  Well, it is smart of her to buy the name, but I thought question  you were posing was if someone else buys the name with her name, is  there a suit in ex and of itself there isn't.</p><p>I wanted to tell you this could happen to anybody.  I went with Rick  Ritemoth, our weather dude.  He said, you have to come down the street  to the deli.  You are not going to believe it.</p><p>Your face is on an ad for a male healthful product and I said, wait a  minute now, we went over there.  He saw it hanging over the cash  register.  You have to come here, your face on an ad for a male health  product, it was my picture, I seek legal remedy to get it stopped.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Did they take it off the deli wall?</p><p>COLBY:  It is gone.  I do not have it any more.  If Taylor Swift did not  buy the sites, someone else did and they made money, and put something  unflattering of Hershey would have a suit, but who whether or not you  there was a dot-porn.</p><p>CAVUTO:  She is a smart lady as of you, how is the show?</p><p>COLBY:  Great, tonight, if you love \"STRANGE INHERITANCE,\" so many  people do.  If you love animals, a sanctuary that was left with lions,  tigers and bears and that baboon.  I met him personally.  The way to  their heart is through their stomach.</p><p>They are rescues, she inherited them, a beautiful story of survival a  family that wants to continue a great gesture of taking care of the  animal, second one a rancher did not inherit enough land to ranch.  He  found a surprise of his lifetime.  He turned down $5 million for a  dinosaur a species that scientists did not know existed.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Was it a prehistoric?</p><p>COLBY:  Like this, like this.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Are you surprised at the success of the show?</p><p>COLBY:  This is real stuff, this is not reality.  This is real families.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I want to string together your reaction stocks when scary  people, you talk to scary people, it seems, find me a window where is  the door.</p><p>COLBY:  Sometimes my chair rolls back.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Look at the time.</p><p>COLBY:  That is Dr. Keith Ablow does, I see we're ought of time.</p><p>CAVUTO:  It's a great show.</p><p>COLBY:  Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO:  She made it because -- </p><p>COLBY:  Tonight at 9 p.m. on Fox Business Network.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You got it done.</p><p>COLBY:  But it's a power to prosper and enjoy.</p><p>CAVUTO:  The idea is to not promote.</p><p>COLBY:  Excuse me?</p><p>CAVUTO:  Look at the time.  We'll have more right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  And what's the deal with all of this constant Ted Cruz bashing,  too brash, too young, too extreme?  To a lot of you too much, Dennis in  Ohio, \"May we point out that Hillary, Biden and Dodd, all the Democratic  candidates for president in 2008 told us how inexperienced Obama was,  yet they got behind him, when they saw an opportunity to gain power.\"   Such is politics.</p><p>Jim emails \"Day one of Cruz and the Democrats already spewing hate and  lies.  And the GOP still have 12 more presidential candidates to come  out.\"</p><p>Al emails, \"There is no doubt that Cruz is a very bright guy, but I  don't see him as having charisma to beat Hillary.  He is just not that  likable.  In addition, I saw his stand on repealing Obamacare, as less  than heroic.  He knew he was fighting a losing battle yet he was willing  to fight until he was the last Republican left standing.\"</p><p>Well, Al, I just say hear him out because he will be part of a very  vibrant mix of candidates and ideas that will stimulate and who will  stimulate the debate.</p><p>Russ and Cathy email, \"Hi, Neil, unfortunately, I think you are correct.   What a fabulous Cabinet it would be if the Republicans became a team  instead of having the blood-letting even if they just played, \"Rock,  paper, scissors.\"  We would have a great president.</p><p>Then Mitt Romney insist that it might be a crowded field, but by  convention time, it will be down to one nominee.  I disagree.  We will  not have a nominee by convention time, and that is when Republican seek  him out, as maybe a consensus candidate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  There are a lot of those guys were bummed out when you said you  were not going to run.  So I'm wondering now, you say never?</p><p>MITT ROMNEY, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  This is not going to  happen, I'm sorry, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO:  That is never, never.</p><p>ROMNEY:  It's not going to happen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  I don't know, never, never sounds like maybe to me.  Stacy  emails, \"I just watched your interview with Mr. Romney, it was good, I  sure wish he would have made it into office.\"</p><p>Tony in Vermont, \"My comment on your Facebook post about Mitt Romney had  600 likes, in first 30 minutes, did I just go viral?\"  No, you are just  hitching along for ride.</p><p>Meanwhile, Henry via centurylink.net, \"Neil, for a long time, several  times, I have written you about criticism about your constant  interruptions and also your stupid laugh.</p><p>Today, your interview with Governor Mitt Romney was the latest in your  annoying actions.  So I have designated you as the newest on my list of  men a carried for a long time as the least admirable three men in the  world, the title you are now on is jerk.\"</p><p>Well, at least, you didn't call me fat.  By the way, you got to tell me,  who are other two?  Buffalo businessman, Karl Paladino weighing in on  2016 and Mitt Romney.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARL PALADINO (R), FORMER NEW YORK GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE:  We need a  guy who can create jobs that understands means of creating jobs does not  side with 1 percent against the 99 percent.  The Republican base, that  is there, many of them did not come out for Romney, they done vote.   That hurt him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Tommy in North Carolina, not a fan of Carl's, \"Alan Grayson is  a very good businessman.  That does not mean he is sane.  Grayson,  Donald Trump, and Carl Paladino should form a club.\"  That would be a  wealthy club.</p><p>Russ emails, \"Good to see Paladino back.  Good ideas as always.\"   Finally, this from Jim, \"Neil, I see on the news that Hillary has a new  e-mail account.  Since she isn't using the old one, can we see the  server?\"</p><p>You know, well, I guess, she is not using it.  Thanks for watching.   \"STRANGE INHERITANCE\" right now.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

I'm <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto. </nameText></person>Glad to have you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And who knew Google has its own fast pass to the White House? I'm talking very fast, fast pass and apparently, one that never expires. You should be so lucky with yours at Disney because Google employees get on a lot of rides at this White House park -- try 230 of them since the president first took office.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, that roughly (INAUDIBLE) about one a week and apparently, they weren't all going for the ride. Many of these meetings came as the government was wrapping up its antitrust investigation into Google. So awkward.</p><p/><p>Now, I don't know. But here's what I do know. The Federal Trade Commission eventually closed that investigation. Google agreed to make some voluntary changes to its business practices. But you needn't Google the term \"quid pro quo\" to know something doesn't smell right because I don't know about you but this kind of stuff doesn't happen to us. Taxpayers don't get these kind of breaks or fast passes. In fact, for most businesses, it is far more common to be shut out of the White House than ever get so much as a kind word from the White House.</p><p/><p>But again, that is just me.</p><p/><p>Steve Moore wants to shut this ride down. But Basil Smikle says it is (INAUDIBLE), I should say it's not such a bad ride.</p><p/><p>You don't like the sound of any of it?</p><p/><p>STEVE MOORE, HERITAGE CHIEF ECONOMIST: I'm old enough to remember when Google and Apple and Microsoft and Netflix didn't even have lobbying operations in Washington, you know? And the high tech community in Silicon Valley just said, \"Leave us alone. We'll do our thing and you do your thing.\" And now, they have these massive lobbying operations in Washington. And it's basically the Google administration right now. I mean, they (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But they're not alone, I guess, because their sheer size, the - - it looks a little more obvious.</p><p/><p>BASIL SMIKLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I think to your point exactly, tech -- the government and our legislature always lags behind technology. And right now, these companies are sort of ruling the world. It's not surprising.</p><p/><p>MOORE: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: So why wasn't he meeting with these Google guys before the launch of the Affordable Care Act (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p/><p>SMIKLE: Well, it's not surprising that he's meeting with them now. Look at all (INAUDIBLE) that we've been talking about in the last year. We talked about.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: The sheer number of meetings, (INAUDIBLE), come on.</p><p/><p>SMIKLE: .we've talked about -- we've talked about immigration and they're certainly going to lobby for high school workers.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: One a week.</p><p/><p>SMIKLE: We talked about net neutrality. That's going to be a key issue.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I know, I know. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>SMIKLE: The problem is -- the point is that they have a lot of stuff to talk about and (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>MOORE: They have. (INAUDIBLE) problem.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p/><p>SMIKLE: I don't begrudge them but using their resources in trying to push (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>MOORE: The interesting thing about the net neutrality issue is that Google was on the side of net neutrality at the beginning and then -- then saw the government got their fangs.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, it evolved. They evolved as they've been getting bigger. (INAUDIBLE). If George Bush were doing this with defense contractors every week, you would be -- flip a gasket, as would I.</p><p/><p>SMIKLE: I probably would but I would -- instead of pointing to George Bush, I'd point to Ronald Reagan. Think about the coziness that he had with some of the media companies 'cause they -- he actually sparked a lot of this sort of consolidation in media under his watch. You had more companies than ever before in history and the mergers and acquisitions. So that's (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I think it's fair to say during that time though, he did not have a cozy relationship with the media. They were blistering him every day.</p><p/><p>SMIKLE: But he did with big business and we forgave him that or others forgave him that. So.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Not the Washington Post.</p><p/><p>MOORE: This is the most (INAUDIBLE) situation of all though. You have big - $4 trillion government and you have these massive companies like Google -- I think Google's the biggest company in the world right now in terms of revenues -- and you put them together and bad things happen. We want big government and big business to stay on top.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: See, but I agree, Basil, but I think it's fine for a CEO -- CEOs -- to meet at the White House. I think he gets a little problematic when it turns into like \"Skip the pass, you can just walk in through the front gate.\"</p><p/><p>SMIKLE: Well, I don't know if it was that -- if they had that kind of access. But the reality.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: It all comes back to bite you. Remember what happened to JPMorgan Chase. Jamie Dimon could just waltz into the Oval Office anytime he wanted. As soon as he started getting attacked critical, not only did they take the fast pass away, before you know it, the firm was facing billions of dollars (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>SMIKLE: So are you saying that the Bush administration shouldn't have allowed him in as much as they should've?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I'm saying not every week. That's what I'm saying. I just think that that gets a little weird.</p><p/><p>SMIKLE: Well, I think as businesses grow, as industries go, I would imagine that this occurred with the auto industry at some point -- that as they become such huge (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Talk to others. Talk to others. Talk to others.</p><p/><p>SMIKLE: When they have such a huge role in our business, in our industry, they're going to be meeting with government officials (INAUDIBLE) all the time.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But it's the same thing I said at this president (INAUDIBLE) meeting with the likes of Al Sharpton (INAUDIBLE) the racial issue -- meet with other representatives from points of view. But be fair and balanced. He is now choosing \"I'm going to be fair if I focus on Google, I focus on Apple, and I kind of ignore everyone else.\"</p><p/><p>SMIKLE: But who else is driving our conversations about technology (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, those guys will never get the chance. Those guys will never get the chance.</p><p/><p>MOORE: There are thousands and thousands of small businesses in the technology industry, by the way, biting at the heels of Google and I guarantee you, most of them do not have a lobbyist. I'm sure they don't have a (INAUDIBLE). But that's -- I have a little bit take on this thing. You, Neil. I mean, I just think when the government tries to regulate the high tech industry, as you said, you put it very well. There are three generations behind where this industry is at.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But what did I say about regulating technology? I didn't (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>MOORE: No, no. I just -- I just mean -- I think the problem.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>MOORE: .of course, Google's going to have all these lobbyists because the government is sticking its fingers in everything that they do.</p><p/><p>SMIKLE: But I agree the small businesses should have a role at the table.</p><p/><p>MOORE: No. No, no. That's not my point.</p><p/><p>SMIKLE: I know but I do (INAUDIBLE) -- I do think -- I do think that small businesses (INAUDIBLE) -- should have -- should have (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>MOORE: The government -- there's too many of them. There are millions of small businesses. There's not enough Lincoln Bedrooms.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: He makes more sense than you do. That's scary, right there.</p><p/><p>SMIKLE: That's scary, wow.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Guys, seriously, thank you both very, very much.</p><p/><p>In the meantime, no wonder so many want to (INAUDIBLE) Google. With connections like those, who wouldn't?</p><p/><p>Now, add Ruth Porat onto that growing list of eager Google recruits. But Ms. Porat isn't just any recruit, is she? She's the chief financial officer of investment bank Morgan Stanley, one of the most powerful women -- actually, one of the most powerful anyone on Wall Street. And now, she's going to become CFO of Google.</p><p/><p>Add her to a growing list of Wall Streeters going to tech including a top Goldman strategist to Twitter or -- continuing with this revolving door thing -- former Obama advisor David Plouffe to Uber and Jay Carney to Amazon.</p><p/><p>Forget what this means to tech. What does this mean to what's left of Wall Street?</p><p/><p>Scott Martin says not much but given the way the White House, he says, has been bashing Wall Street, not much we can do to stop it.</p><p/><p>The allure, I think, for a lot of them is technology's cool, there's actually even more money in it which is hard to believe because you're sinfully rich enough but what's going on here?</p><p/><p>SCOTT MARTIN, UNITED ADVISORS CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST: Sinfully rich. Yes, that's why I describe myself on Twitter--. Neil, it's tough. I mean, the dreaded brain drain in the financial industry is upon us. I mean, the financial industry, the markets couldn't even keep around a nice lady like Veronica Vain -- look her up -- sports fans being interesting because the allure is not there anymore, Neil. Really, I mean, it is the technology sector. It is all these cool things that are going on outside of this once-big structural firm that was Wall Street, that where all the banks are (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I think it's money, Scott. I really do think it's money because as much as the financial industry pays, it's chump change in comparison to the stake you take when a technology company does well, goes well, between options and advances and stock, I mean you become a gazilionaire a lot quicker there than you ever could on Wall Street.</p><p/><p>MARTIN: You do. I think Wall Street tough too, Neil, also thanks to the administration, thanks to the financial crisis, has a little bit of an image problem still. In fact, I'd argue that the financial crisis, our financial situation, for a lot of thee banks is not near what it was before the crisis. So you have the perception on both Main Street and some of the certainly people in D.C. that say, \"You know what? The banks are still doing things wrong and to your point about the financials of them, Dodd-Frank, (INAUDIBLE) regulations, all things that are out there now -- Elizabeth Warren being a big party in the Democrats' side of.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: No, I think the bloom is off the rose. You're absolutely right on that as you are in these issues. And I think the latest telltale sign, college graduates, MBA graduates used to be by overwhelmingly flock to the -- Wall Street. Now, it's half and half and that other half is going to technology.</p><p/><p>MARTIN: And here's the ironic thing, right? Now, the only reason that you probably like your bank or that you can deal with them is because the technology behind it allows you to do what you want to do. But if you work at that bank, if you have that high-paying job on Wall Stree which isn't as high-paying as it once was, that doesn't hold its same mustard as it did, say, five, 10 years ago,.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You're right. Scott, you will be the last guy standing and all the money will be yours.</p><p/><p>All right. Scott.</p><p/><p>MARTIN: That's a scary thought. See you later.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: That is scary. Thank you, my friend.</p><p/><p>In the meantime, Wall Street's not the only one with a Silicon Valley problem. You might have one.</p><p/><p>It's true because Fidelity and other money managers are striking deals with tech startups like Uber and Pinterest who load up your retirement portfolio. And I bet you didn't even know it.</p><p/><p>And what's even scary to Larry Winget is they're doing it in companies that don't have any money or (INAUDIBLE) of making money anytime soon.</p><p/><p>Larry, the argument for this is that, \"Hey, we're spreading our bets. We're giving you a more diversified portfolio. We don't know the percentage that they pour in to these kind of companies but we know they never did before.\" So what do you make of this?</p><p/><p>LARRY WINGET, \"GROW A PAIR\" AUTHOR: Well, I wouldn't find it especially alarming if they're pouring big percentages into it if you're a retiree and you're counting on this to be your retirement fund to live on because it's pure speculation what these tech startups are going to be worth. They value them but that value is not based on publicly-released financial statements. They've never been traded anywhere before. These are privately-held companies. And from a guy like me, it would just be a made-up number. When I look at some of the stuff that's out there -- look at Uber, for instance. In mid-2013, it was supposedly worth $3.5 billion. Now, the valuation is over $40 billion. A thousand percent when the S&amp;P 500 is up 28 percent. How did they come up with a 1,000 percent growth in less than two years? That would bother me.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: All right. Well, they could also move on to the government, if that's -- if they don't make (INAUDIBLE). But do you think they shouldn't invest in this (INAUDIBLE), that it shouldn't' be part of any portfolio or do you think when it comes to people and their retirement money -- 'cause a lot (INAUDIBLE), this is multiyear, multi-decade money, that there shouldn't be a little bit of aggressive investment in there anyway.</p><p/><p>WINGET: I have no problem with there being a very small percentage and some of them are saying -- some of the mutual funds are saying you will only be a very small percentage. The good side is if it's very small, you're not going to lose a lot of money. But the bad side is even if they make a lot of money and -- for instance, Uber is worth a thousand times more than it was a couple of years ago, you're probably not going to make a lot of money either. It all comes down to how old you are (INAUDIBLE). If you're 40 years old, you could -= and you have most of your earning years ahead of you, you could afford to be a little more risky. If you're in your 60s, you can't afford that kind of risk. Yes, there's a lot of money to be made but there's always the other side of that -- there's a lot of money to be lost and I don't want any of that money as I approach retirement to be mine when it comes to losing it.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, not everyone can write an incredible bestseller one after the other like you. People have to hedge their beds.</p><p/><p>Larry Winget, thank you very, very much.</p><p/><p>WINGET: Thank you.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, holy moly. With Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee and Ben Carson likely carving up the Christian vote, are you starting to think that Rick Santorum doesn't have a prayer?</p><p/><p>Rick's here to say \"You don't have a clue.\"</p><p/><p>And you think making cakes is about as far as 3D printers can go? Then this just takes the cake. Now, they're printing construction guys right of their jobs.</p><p/><p>What the Tech?! What do we do when tech turns on us?</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p/><p>Well, who needs an architect or construction expert if a 3D printer can spit out what they do and in a fraction of the time. What the tech?! What just happened?</p><p/><p>Up first in the segment that is taking the nation by storm, the storm over these cool 3D printers that came in peace but are now apparently peacefully printing out pink slips for many in the building industry. I warned you, America.</p><p/><p>To tech watcher Shama Hyder on what this is all about.</p><p/><p>Shana, what's going -- what can these printers do that's got so many in the construction industry going nuts?</p><p/><p>SHAMA HYDER, MARKETING ZEN CEO: Well, these printers are pretty cool in a lot of ways because they do have the capability of building an entire building. I mean, they're -- they -- they can -- they're stackable. You -- so if you have a job in the construction industry which involves hitting a nail with a hammer over and over again, you should be scared because chances are, some of the printers are going to take that over. But really, if you're.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: And do that as well?</p><p/><p>HYDER: They're going to do that but they're really good at repetitive tasks. But when it comes to strategically building something, you still need human minds behind it. So this is the whole (INAUDIBLE) we've been hearing for so long -- is technology replacing humans? No. It's really not.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I saw \"2001 Space Odyssey.\" I remember how a certain pod bay door wasn't opened so I know how this ends. Where's this all going?</p><p/><p>HYDER: This has a different ending though.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Oh, really?</p><p/><p>HYDER: Yes, it does and I'll tell you -- because technology (INAUDIBLE) can really assist people. I think we'll see homes becoming cheaper in many ways which would -- I mean, I'd appreciate that. That'd be great. But also imagine in.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: If you had a job to buy the home.</p><p/><p>HYDER: That's right. But imagine in places where it's war-torn or a storm comes through and totally demolishes that community. Having something like this could mean that people have shelter within days, within hours, and that's powerful.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: All right. As long as they don't advance into the TV news business (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>All right. Next up, a workout suit that will intensify your workout. Forget three hours sweating up a storm, they say you put this thing on, 20 minutes, you have the same effect and you're done. Now, if they can get that puppy down to 20 seconds, sign me up. But in the meantime, Shama, how does this thing even work?</p><p/><p>HYDER: So it's pretty neat. It's got electrodes that go on your skin essentially through this body suit which looks just like a normal gym suit, something you might wear to workout. But essentially, it works with the muscles so they work out harder. This really neat (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, how is it -- is it telling you \"You're not working hard enough\", or is it just dragging your hand to the punching bag?</p><p/><p>HYDER: No, you do have to put in the motion. You do have to put in the work, right, but it essentially.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Oh, so I actually have to work-out.</p><p/><p>HYDER: You do -- you do -- you do have to get up. You do have to work- out but it amplifies it.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, that's the problem. All right. All right.</p><p/><p>HYDER: Right. So there's no -- there's no magic here but it will amplify the effects you get.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: In other words, you get a lot more done in a shorter period.</p><p/><p>HYDER: Absolutely. But are you going to see like the normal mom going to do this after dropping the kids off and going to gym? No. But for athletes, for people in the sports industry where every little edge counts, this is going to be huge.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, apparently, I'll have more time on my hands after a 3D printer takes my place. It just might work out.</p><p/><p>Meanwhile, this is incredible because after that airbus crash in the south of France, for rival Boeing, it's an announcement that might be eerily time because the company has now uncovered two black boxes in the French Alps. That is, the company behind this crash. The problem is one is very badly damaged. The other is missing its memory card.</p><p/><p>But what Boeing has come up with might make black boxes themselves obsolete, totally unnecessary. The airplane maker just patented a force field of lasers. What that would do is make a plane impenetrable to missiles or outside forces. So let me be clear here, it wouldn't prevent the kind of crash we saw this week in France but it might have stopped that Malaysian jet from being shotdown over the Ukraine last year.</p><p/><p>So Shama, I guess the only issue here would be the expense for this, right?</p><p/><p>HYDER: Yes. I mean, this is going to be expensive but innovation generally is until it's not, right? But anytime you're talking electromagnetic fields, you're talking about new technology that the U.S. government uses now that can see through concrete walls. And so, this isn't necessarily new technology.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: And it doesn't interrupt to them -- and that static field doesn't' interrupt with the cockpit controls or any of the device.</p><p/><p>HYDER: And so, I mean, this is all the stuff that they're going to have to work out, obviously. It's very, very early stages but yes. It's good. It's going to be a huge expense but as they -- as they tinker with it, as they play with it, it'll obviously get cheaper and hopefully make the world safer.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Yes. There was a big push -- I mean -- after this shoot-down that \"Hey, we have to help or retrofit airlines with this sort of technology.\" Now, again, to your point, it depends on the expense. But I kind of think something like this is just a matter of time.</p><p/><p>HYDER: It is. It's absolutely a matter of time. And once they test it out, they'll get better and better with it. There's certain things that'll make technology overall cheaper like battery life. That's something Google's working very hard right now on. If they can figure out a way for batteries to be cheaper, last longer, all of this technology becomes easier, cheaper, faster.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: All right. We'll watch closely, Shama. Thank you very, very much.</p><p/><p>HYDER: My pleasure.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, saints preserve us. We've got a lot of saints in this presidential race. Men of God who have no problem talking about God. Now, four years ago, only Rick Santorum was doing that. Now, a fee other presidential wannabees art harping in. Harp. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>Anyway, think Rick is losing the religious right? Why don't I ask Rick myself? Because he's here and only here, next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Boy, this just boils me.</p><p/><p>Remember when I was chatting with Mitt Romney yesterday about this likely very crowded Republican presidential field? Now, I said it is so crowded, good luck, Republicans, deciding on a nominee by convention time, like they did back with him, back 2012. Come 2016, it's not going to happen. Now, he scoffed.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: If there s potion by vote -- primaries -- falling out, you could get to a situation which begs the issue, would you entertain the party coming to you and saying, \"Governor, we're at a draw here.\"</p><p/><p>MITT ROMNEY, (R) 2012 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: First, that's not going to happen. Two, I'm not.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: It's happened before.</p><p/><p>ROMNEY: Two, I'm not an entertainer. And three, that was a long time ago that happened. Look, we're going to have our nominee and I'm one of those people.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, he may say never, never, never. But girls told me that all the time in high school before my mother finally said yes and we went to the prom together.</p><p/><p>Anyway, my point is this -- there are going to be a lot of Republicans vying for this presidential nomination. I'm thinking at least a dozen, probably more. Let's say half of them -- half of them -- stick it out right to the spring. And so many of these primaries (INAUDIBLE) delegates based on your portion of the vote. That means they're all competing for the same number of delegates being portioned out. It gets to be mathematically impossible for any one man or woman to amass the delegates necessary by the time the convention gets to Cleveland.</p><p/><p>So consider just those vying for the evangelical vote. Back in 2008, it was just Mike Huckabee. Four years later, it was pretty much just Rick Santorum. But this time, it'll be Rick and Mike and Ted Cruz and maybe Ben Carson and maybe Marco Rubio making his Roman Catholic claim to Christian conservatives. You get the picture? It's a crowded picture. It's a crowded race.</p><p/><p>To Rick Santorum who joins us on the phone whether he's praying a little bit more these days.</p><p/><p>Senator, what do you think?</p><p/><p>RICK SANTORUM, (R) FMR. PENNSYLVANIA SENATOR (ON THE PHONE): I can always use a few more prayers, Neil. Thank you.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well.</p><p/><p>SANTORUM: Look, I don't -- I think that it's way too early. I mean, if you go back to four years ago, there were a whole lot of other people who were considering -- you talk about Rick Santorum being the only person (INAUDIBLE)I think Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain and Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich, there're a whole lot of people who were trying to appeal to those voters that we eventually did very well with. That's -- it's going to be a --it's office competitive. It has been competitive in the past and this thing will winnow itself down. There isn't -- there isn't enough air in the -- in the chamber for 12 or 13 candidates to make it for a few weeks. It will -- it will narrow down in the first few weeks and the first few primaries.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: All right. I know you're a very religious guy but I'm married to math. I am a numbers geek although I try to be decent and the numbers just don't add up. I mean, in other words, just to get to the 1200, 1300 delegates, you're going to need ultimately what the states decide on how much is a portion in each state. It's going to be an uphill climb and if someone stays in, even a significant group through April or May -- which is an (INAUDIBLE) possibility, it gets to be prohibitive. Does that make you think there is a possibility because as you know, Senator, when you're a good historian, this used to be more than norm -- multiple balance and recent history where it's a single ballot - where that could happen again?</p><p/><p>SANTORUM: I think -- it certainly, it could've happened last time and there was -- there was several candidates who (INAUDIBLE) but as you know, if we go back and look at the last time, there were several candidates and it narrowed down after a few weeks. It narrowed down to really two who had a possibility of winning. And that is likely to happen this time also. But if it doesn't happen, as I said last time around, it's not the end of the world. The bottom line is that the primary process -- let it work, let the competition work, and if there is a real division, then we'll go to something that I'm certainly not worried about. I think an interesting -- a convention where we have ideas out there and we have candidates pretty (INAUDIBLE) the different visions for the country in a dynamic way that -- and captivate a nation. I mean, we haven't had a competitive Republican or Democratic primary convention and in a couple of generations. This would be -- I think it would exciting (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, I'm not ready to bet with you. I think it's going to happen. You could very well be in that mix. But enough about me. Back to you and the guest I had on with me talking about you, including Foster Friess -- big friend of yours, big backer of yours. And I raised with him the fact that he also likes some other guys in the Party.</p><p/><p>This is Foster Friess from a few days ago.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Now, I know you placed your bets and your support behind Rick Santorum but you also have been seen in the company of Senator Cruz. Were you hedging your bets?</p><p/><p>FOSTER FRIESS, GOP FUNDRAISER: I'm a Rick Santorum guy and I'm just so impressed with our entire field and Ted Cruz is one amazing human being but the challenge that all of us face is how do we get the establishment and the tea party to kiss and make up because if that doesn't happen, we're dead in the water as Republicans.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Senator, is he leaving you?</p><p/><p>SANTORUM: Is he what, Neil? (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Was he hinting he could drop you?</p><p/><p>SANTORUM: No. I mean, I just talked to Foster today, as a matter of fact. No. No. Foster's a good friend and a great supporter. And by the way, we've got -- we're building a very strong team. I mean, it's really exciting to see so many people who are encouraging us to get into this race. We haven't made any decisions of that yet (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But he hasn't said anything to you, Senator, where he says, \"I love you dearly, Rick. You're an honorable great man but at the first sign of stumbling, I'm going to leave you in a heartbeat\"?</p><p/><p>SANTORUM: Oh, my goodness. No, I don't know. Foster and I are very, very close personal friends as well as (INAUDIBLE) in all aspects the same. And so -- now I'm not -- that's the last thing I'm concerned about. I -- what I'm concerned about is making sure that and before we enter into this thing that we've got a big, strong team that we can -- we can run the kind of race that's going to be a winning race, not only in the primary but also in the general--. Do what Foster's--. With Foster, I talked about this a lot.</p><p/><p>We have to have a message that's a unifying message. Not just between the Tea Party and the establishment, but you know reaching out, and bridging this country together. I think so many people are sick of the division that is going on in this country and they are looking for someone with a fresh message to bring us together.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: All right, we'll watch closely, Senator. It's always a pleasure. Thank you very, very much.</p><p/><p>SANTORUM: Thank you, Neil.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Rick Santorum.</p><p/><p>In the meantime, I want you to think quick. Taylor Swift, RadioShack, one is buying up porn sites with all of their nasty stuff. The other is selling off anything that is not nailed down, including your personal stuff. Which one is sexy and which one is just sad? We shake it up, you decide.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Maybe it's just me, but I think this is RadioShack's version of looking under couch cushions for some spare change, only it's customer data the bankrupt retailers cashing in and I bet you have no idea it's even going on.</p><p/><p>Well, it is going on. Apparently, it is all perfectly legal like selling mailing list to companies even though RadioShack is on the verge of no longer even being a company. Well, Kennedy is worried RadioShack is not alone, not a fan of this sort of thing, right?</p><p/><p>KENNEDY \"KENNEDY\" HOST ON FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Neil, very good to be here with you today. RadioShack --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Why do you sound like you don't mean that?</p><p/><p>KENNEDY: I so mean that. You know that I'm --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Continue.</p><p/><p>KENNEDY: -- I baked you a ham loaf not long ago out of deep adoration and affection.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Yes, so what is this? Everyone has a list, right?</p><p/><p>KENNEDY: They do. Everyone has a list and if you are dumb enough to go to a store, and give them your address and your email address, and your phone number and your name because you want to be a part of their gift club, and the fan club, and everything else.</p><p/><p>That's on you because what do you think they are doing with it. Do you think they are just going to luck into a safe?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But when you order stuff online, someone is scarfing that up information.</p><p/><p>KENNEDY: Of course, they are.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Not just the company you're --</p><p/><p>KENNEDY: No, I mean, that is the price of doing business in an electronic age. I get that. I accept that responsibility as a consumer. I am not wild about it. Whatever --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: So RadioShack, it's selling everything but the kitchen sink, right?</p><p/><p>KENNEDY: Do you know why? My husband pointed this out this weekend because they were dismantling a RadioShack sign where we live in the west side of Los Angeles. He said, of course, they are going out of business. It is called RadioShack, what is the last time you bought a radio?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Internet shack or something.</p><p/><p>KENNEDY: Well, it's so fashion backward.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You know, it is legal, lawyers tell me, legal what they are doing, not their cup of tea, but it is legal. But you --</p><p/><p>KENNEDY: Attorneys general in Texas and Tennessee actually disagree with that because in Texas, it violates some of the privacy laws there. So it will be up to --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: So companies that sells these as back and forth, they can't do that.</p><p/><p>KENNEDY: And depending on the state, and that is what a republic is, that is fine 92. If you want to live in a state of Texas --</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: That is us. There you go.</p><p/><p>KENNEDY: Indeed, you are a 100 percent correct as per usual, <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto.</nameText></person></p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Thank you very much. So, I think RadioShack will do it someone will buy the list, and I don't know who because it is a dwindling list, some of the names go back to 1980s. I thought many of them are dead.</p><p/><p>KENNEDY: Yes, and some of those people don't even have a 19 in front of their birth year if you know what I'm saying.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Is that right?</p><p/><p>KENNEDY: Yes, they've done a lot of civil war era.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I think we have all their Social Security cards. I mean, that was a big -- yes.</p><p/><p>KENNEDY: AT&amp;T actually has a vested interest in this because they have done some brand sharing and partnering with RadioShack trying to sell their devices and they might be we are owed that list by virtue of our co-investment and co-branding together.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But as an update, how do you advice -- you are big on this sort of stuff, word -- either on internet, limit what you share, right?</p><p/><p>KENNEDY: I think you should limit what you share. I think you should have one e-mail address for all of your online purchases.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Wouldn't that have saved Hillary Clinton a lot of trouble?</p><p/><p>KENNEDY: And then you should get your own server and have someone named Huma be your wolf dog.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Isn't that great that she has her own server?</p><p/><p>KENNEDY: It's very luxurious. It used to be a 300 foot luxury yachts, and those are just for Russian billionaires that's very boring, so 2004, but your own server, like Martha Stewart used to have her own brand. But she doesn't even have her own server.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You have a server?</p><p/><p>KENNEDY: Yes, exactly.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Kennedy, thank you very much.</p><p/><p>KENNEDY: You got served, Neil. I like you.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: She is on fire. All right, the taxes you leave your heirs will have you wants to save them will trouble, you might want to hear this next Republican out. He is the only one in the Senate not running for president. John Thune is going to tell you how he is on a mission from God.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, raising death tax very much alive and well. To the Republican senator who wants to kill off the estate tax itself before, well, any Democrats including the president get any more bright ideas about hiking it.</p><p/><p>South Dakota Senator John Thune joins us with something called the Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015. Senator, always good to see you. What is this about?</p><p/><p>SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD), SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE MEMBER: Great to be with you, Neil. Thank you. Well, look, we think that the death tax is punitive. The farmers and ranchers and small business people, family businesses and operations. You want to pass it on to next generation.</p><p/><p>The Congressional Budget Office in 2009 said a third of businesses who owe the death tax owe more in taxes than what their assets are worth. So, what typically happens is they have to liquidate the business in order to pay IRS.</p><p/><p>It is a tax that is inefficient and it hurts. It hurts jobs and the economy in this country, and we think it is time for it to go. And so we have a bill that would repeal it and end the death tax once and for all.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Now what kind of support do you have?</p><p/><p>THUNE: Well, we have, we got good support obviously among Republicans. We have been reaching out to some Democrats. There are some Democrats in the past, who have expressed support for getting rid of the death tax.</p><p/><p>We hope that they will there be some bipartisan support in Congress. Kevin Brady is introducing the bill in the House of Representatives. We are going to hold a news conference tomorrow to talk about why it's important that Congress take the steps that are necessary to do away with this very burdensome, very punitive tax.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You know, the administration, I am sure you are aware of this, Senator, comes out and says I don't know what Thune is arguing about. The fact of the matter is very few pay this tax because very few really fit the criteria or the means by which to have to pay it. What do you say? I think they say it's closer to 2 percent at that?</p><p/><p>THUNE: Right, well, if you look at run-up, Neil, in land values in state like South Dakota over past decade, we have seen land value increase to point now that about a third of the farms in South Dakota are actually over the exemption amount.</p><p/><p>So they would be liable to pay the tax. This is a very big issue in farm and ranch country where people are land rich and cash poor, but it also hits a lot of small businesses in this country. Douglas (inaudible) did a study here recently that suggested that ending the death tax would add a million and a half jobs to our economy.</p><p/><p>So, we think it is about jobs. It is about growth and you think about how much money people spend to avoid the taxes well, and you know, this isn't something that in our economy we really don't need.</p><p/><p>We want to encourage people to pass that family farm or business on to the next generation and getting rid of the death tax would help make that possible.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: As of right now, Senator, you are one of only Republican senators presently not planning to run for president that I know of. So I wonder when you hear and out of your colleagues this idea for simplified tax code and some of these other stuff, they seemed to be very unified. The approach is different. Will that be a Republican rallying cry in 2016 because we're a long way from anything that approaches a simpler tax code?</p><p/><p>THUNE: I agree, and it should be a rallying cry. The tax code is way too complicated. It is way too costly to comply with. If we could broaden tax base in this country and lower rates, I think would unleash a period of economic growth unlike anything we've seen in a long time and included in that should be getting rid of the death tax.</p><p/><p>You got an administration in Washington right now that very much likes to raise taxes, take from some people and give it to others, and we just think that the best way to get growth in the economy is to get the tax rate down at the lowest level possible.</p><p/><p>There were people who are making decisions based up what's best for a return as opposed to tax consequences and so, you know, my hope would be that our candidates in 2016 are out there aggressively talking about their plans to reform tax code to make it more simple, more fair, and lower rates, and focus on economic growth.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Senator Thune, always a pleasure.</p><p/><p>THUNE: Thank you.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: If you decide to run or join your other colleagues, just please let us know, but it's always --</p><p/><p>THUNE: You will be first to know, Neil.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: All right. Senator Thune, great seeing you again. Thank you.</p><p/><p>THUNE: You too.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Well, Taylor sure has been swifted, buying up all these porn sites, the skinny on what this rock star is really doing.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: All right, a Fox Biz alert for you, Taylor Swift is buying up all the porn, no, not this porn, dot-porn, grabbing, Taylorswift.porn, what am I thinking? And Taylorswift.adult before the dirty domains go up on sale on the public market this summer.</p><p/><p>\"STRANGE INHERITANCE\" star, Jamie Colby, said nothing strange about it, if she does not do this now, she could facing legal hurdles later. She is not alone. A lot of stars, actresses are trying to do this kind of thing, why?</p><p/><p>JAMIE COLBY, FBN HOST, \"STRANGE INHERITANCE\": It happened to me, someone took my name, and web site, and probably taking <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto </nameText></person>dot whatever, except porn would be a profitable proposition.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Although I've run into this myself, but --</p><p/><p>COLBY: The things that it takes to be you, Neil.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: And you, you know, we know.</p><p/><p>COLBY: It is becoming more difficult to be me, but it's a hell of a lot of fun. I have to tell you that there is no legal case. As you know, I'm the illegal smarty pants and almost every state in America. It is not illegal to take somebody's name and buy a web site with their name with the hope of profiting later.</p><p/><p>If you put something on that web site that is disparaging or you make some profit from having that web site, you got to share the profits and you might get sued for saying something wrong.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: So what if she is taking these sites with her name, and they are still being used for porn, can they still be used?</p><p/><p>COLBY: No, not. Once she buys them she owns them. She has a proprietary right to whatever goes on them.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: But images of her can pop up on sites where her name is not in it.</p><p/><p>COLBY: Well, that she has a right to sue especially if they are used in disparaging way.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: OK, so legally, buying up the names does not shield you from this type of stuff coming up anyway.</p><p/><p>COLBY: Well, it is smart of her to buy the name, but I thought question you were posing was if someone else buys the name with her name, is there a suit in ex and of itself there isn't.</p><p/><p>I wanted to tell you this could happen to anybody. I went with Rick Ritemoth, our weather dude. He said, you have to come down the street to the deli. You are not going to believe it.</p><p/><p>Your face is on an ad for a male healthful product and I said, wait a minute now, we went over there. He saw it hanging over the cash register. You have to come here, your face on an ad for a male health product, it was my picture, I seek legal remedy to get it stopped.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Did they take it off the deli wall?</p><p/><p>COLBY: It is gone. I do not have it any more. If Taylor Swift did not buy the sites, someone else did and they made money, and put something unflattering of Hershey would have a suit, but who whether or not you there was a dot-porn.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: She is a smart lady as of you, how is the show?</p><p/><p>COLBY: Great, tonight, if you love \"STRANGE INHERITANCE,\" so many people do. If you love animals, a sanctuary that was left with lions, tigers and bears and that baboon. I met him personally. The way to their heart is through their stomach.</p><p/><p>They are rescues, she inherited them, a beautiful story of survival a family that wants to continue a great gesture of taking care of the animal, second one a rancher did not inherit enough land to ranch. He found a surprise of his lifetime. He turned down $5 million for a dinosaur a species that scientists did not know existed.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Was it a prehistoric?</p><p/><p>COLBY: Like this, like this.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Are you surprised at the success of the show?</p><p/><p>COLBY: This is real stuff, this is not reality. This is real families.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I want to string together your reaction stocks when scary people, you talk to scary people, it seems, find me a window where is the door.</p><p/><p>COLBY: Sometimes my chair rolls back.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Look at the time.</p><p/><p>COLBY: That is Dr. Keith Ablow does, I see we're ought of time.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: It's a great show.</p><p/><p>COLBY: Thank you.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: She made it because --</p><p/><p>COLBY: Tonight at 9 p.m. on Fox Business Network.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: You got it done.</p><p/><p>COLBY: But it's a power to prosper and enjoy.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: The idea is to not promote.</p><p/><p>COLBY: Excuse me?</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Look at the time. We'll have more right after this.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: And what's the deal with all of this constant Ted Cruz bashing, too brash, too young, too extreme? To a lot of you too much, Dennis in Ohio, \"May we point out that Hillary, Biden and Dodd, all the Democratic candidates for president in 2008 told us how inexperienced Obama was, yet they got behind him, when they saw an opportunity to gain power.\" Such is politics.</p><p/><p>Jim emails \"Day one of Cruz and the Democrats already spewing hate and lies. And the GOP still have 12 more presidential candidates to come out.\"</p><p/><p>Al emails, \"There is no doubt that Cruz is a very bright guy, but I don't see him as having charisma to beat Hillary. He is just not that likable. In addition, I saw his stand on repealing Obamacare, as less than heroic. He knew he was fighting a losing battle yet he was willing to fight until he was the last Republican left standing.\"</p><p/><p>Well, Al, I just say hear him out because he will be part of a very vibrant mix of candidates and ideas that will stimulate and who will stimulate the debate.</p><p/><p>Russ and Cathy email, \"Hi, Neil, unfortunately, I think you are correct. What a fabulous Cabinet it would be if the Republicans became a team instead of having the blood-letting even if they just played, \"Rock, paper, scissors.\" We would have a great president.</p><p/><p>Then Mitt Romney insist that it might be a crowded field, but by convention time, it will be down to one nominee. I disagree. We will not have a nominee by convention time, and that is when Republican seek him out, as maybe a consensus candidate.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: There are a lot of those guys were bummed out when you said you were not going to run. So I'm wondering now, you say never?</p><p/><p>MITT ROMNEY, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is not going to happen, I'm sorry, Neil.</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: That is never, never.</p><p/><p>ROMNEY: It's not going to happen.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: I don't know, never, never sounds like maybe to me. Stacy emails, \"I just watched your interview with Mr. Romney, it was good, I sure wish he would have made it into office.\"</p><p/><p>Tony in Vermont, \"My comment on your Facebook post about Mitt Romney had 600 likes, in first 30 minutes, did I just go viral?\" No, you are just hitching along for ride.</p><p/><p>Meanwhile, Henry via centurylink.net, \"Neil, for a long time, several times, I have written you about criticism about your constant interruptions and also your stupid laugh.</p><p/><p>Today, your interview with Governor Mitt Romney was the latest in your annoying actions. So I have designated you as the newest on my list of men a carried for a long time as the least admirable three men in the world, the title you are now on is jerk.\"</p><p/><p>Well, at least, you didn't call me fat. By the way, you got to tell me, who are other two? Buffalo businessman, Karl Paladino weighing in on 2016 and Mitt Romney.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>CARL PALADINO (R), FORMER NEW YORK GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: We need a guy who can create jobs that understands means of creating jobs does not side with 1 percent against the 99 percent. The Republican base, that is there, many of them did not come out for Romney, they done vote. That hurt him.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>CAVUTO: Tommy in North Carolina, not a fan of Carl's, \"Alan Grayson is a very good businessman. That does not mean he is sane. Grayson, Donald Trump, and Carl Paladino should form a club.\" That would be a wealthy club.</p><p/><p>Russ emails, \"Good to see Paladino back. Good ideas as always.\" Finally, this from Jim, \"Neil, I see on the news that Hillary has a new e-mail account. Since she isn't using the old one, can we see the server?\"</p><p/><p>You know, well, I guess, she is not using it.

I'm <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto. </nameText></person>Glad to have you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And who knew Google has its own fast pass to the White House? I'm talking very fast, fast pass and apparently, one that never expires. You should be so lucky with yours at Disney because Google employees get on a lot of rides at this White House park -- try 230 of them since the president first took office.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, that roughly (INAUDIBLE) about one a week and apparently, they weren't all going for the ride. Many of these meetings came as the government was wrapping up its antitrust investigation into Google. So awkward.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, I don't know. But here's what I do know. The Federal Trade Commission eventually closed that investigation. Google agreed to make some voluntary changes to its business practices. But you needn't Google the term \"quid pro quo\" to know something doesn't smell right because I don't know about you but this kind of stuff doesn't happen to us. Taxpayers don't get these kind of breaks or fast passes. In fact, for most businesses, it is far more common to be shut out of the White House than ever get so much as a kind word from the White House.</p><p>But again, that is just me.</p><p>Steve Moore wants to shut this ride down. But Basil Smikle says it is (INAUDIBLE), I should say it's not such a bad ride.</p><p>You don't like the sound of any of it?</p><p>STEVE MOORE, HERITAGE CHIEF ECONOMIST: I'm old enough to remember when Google and Apple and Microsoft and Netflix didn't even have lobbying operations in Washington, you know? And the high tech community in Silicon Valley just said, \"Leave us alone. We'll do our thing and you do your thing.\" And now, they have these massive lobbying operations in Washington. And it's basically the Google administration right now. I mean, they (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: But they're not alone, I guess, because their sheer size, the - - it looks a little more obvious.</p><p>BASIL SMIKLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I think to your point exactly, tech -- the government and our legislature always lags behind technology. And right now, these companies are sort of ruling the world. It's not surprising.</p><p>MOORE: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: So why wasn't he meeting with these Google guys before the launch of the Affordable Care Act (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>SMIKLE: Well, it's not surprising that he's meeting with them now. Look at all (INAUDIBLE) that we've been talking about in the last year. We talked about.</p><p>CAVUTO: The sheer number of meetings, (INAUDIBLE), come on.</p><p>SMIKLE: .we've talked about -- we've talked about immigration and they're certainly going to lobby for high school workers.</p><p>CAVUTO: One a week.</p><p>SMIKLE: We talked about net neutrality. That's going to be a key issue.</p><p>CAVUTO: I know, I know. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SMIKLE: The problem is -- the point is that they have a lot of stuff to talk about and (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MOORE: They have. (INAUDIBLE) problem.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>SMIKLE: I don't begrudge them but using their resources in trying to push (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MOORE: The interesting thing about the net neutrality issue is that Google was on the side of net neutrality at the beginning and then -- then saw the government got their fangs.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, it evolved. They evolved as they've been getting bigger. (INAUDIBLE). If George Bush were doing this with defense contractors every week, you would be -- flip a gasket, as would I.</p><p>SMIKLE: I probably would but I would -- instead of pointing to George Bush, I'd point to Ronald Reagan. Think about the coziness that he had with some of the media companies 'cause they -- he actually sparked a lot of this sort of consolidation in media under his watch. You had more companies than ever before in history and the mergers and acquisitions. So that's (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: I think it's fair to say during that time though, he did not have a cozy relationship with the media. They were blistering him every day.</p><p>SMIKLE: But he did with big business and we forgave him that or others forgave him that. So.</p><p>CAVUTO: Not the Washington Post.</p><p>MOORE: This is the most (INAUDIBLE) situation of all though. You have big - $4 trillion government and you have these massive companies like Google -- I think Google's the biggest company in the world right now in terms of revenues -- and you put them together and bad things happen. We want big government and big business to stay on top.</p><p>CAVUTO: See, but I agree, Basil, but I think it's fine for a CEO -- CEOs -- to meet at the White House. I think he gets a little problematic when it turns into like \"Skip the pass, you can just walk in through the front gate.\"</p><p>SMIKLE: Well, I don't know if it was that -- if they had that kind of access. But the reality.</p><p>CAVUTO: It all comes back to bite you. Remember what happened to JPMorgan Chase. Jamie Dimon could just waltz into the Oval Office anytime he wanted. As soon as he started getting attacked critical, not only did they take the fast pass away, before you know it, the firm was facing billions of dollars (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SMIKLE: So are you saying that the Bush administration shouldn't have allowed him in as much as they should've?</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm saying not every week. That's what I'm saying. I just think that that gets a little weird.</p><p>SMIKLE: Well, I think as businesses grow, as industries go, I would imagine that this occurred with the auto industry at some point -- that as they become such huge (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: Talk to others. Talk to others. Talk to others.</p><p>SMIKLE: When they have such a huge role in our business, in our industry, they're going to be meeting with government officials (INAUDIBLE) all the time.</p><p>CAVUTO: But it's the same thing I said at this president (INAUDIBLE) meeting with the likes of Al Sharpton (INAUDIBLE) the racial issue -- meet with other representatives from points of view. But be fair and balanced. He is now choosing \"I'm going to be fair if I focus on Google, I focus on Apple, and I kind of ignore everyone else.\"</p><p>SMIKLE: But who else is driving our conversations about technology (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, those guys will never get the chance. Those guys will never get the chance.</p><p>MOORE: There are thousands and thousands of small businesses in the technology industry, by the way, biting at the heels of Google and I guarantee you, most of them do not have a lobbyist. I'm sure they don't have a (INAUDIBLE). But that's -- I have a little bit take on this thing. You, Neil. I mean, I just think when the government tries to regulate the high tech industry, as you said, you put it very well. There are three generations behind where this industry is at.</p><p>CAVUTO: But what did I say about regulating technology? I didn't (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MOORE: No, no. I just -- I just mean -- I think the problem.</p><p>CAVUTO: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MOORE: .of course, Google's going to have all these lobbyists because the government is sticking its fingers in everything that they do.</p><p>SMIKLE: But I agree the small businesses should have a role at the table.</p><p>MOORE: No. No, no. That's not my point.</p><p>SMIKLE: I know but I do (INAUDIBLE) -- I do think -- I do think that small businesses (INAUDIBLE) -- should have -- should have (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MOORE: The government -- there's too many of them. There are millions of small businesses. There's not enough Lincoln Bedrooms.</p><p>CAVUTO: He makes more sense than you do. That's scary, right there.</p><p>SMIKLE: That's scary, wow.</p><p>CAVUTO: Guys, seriously, thank you both very, very much.</p><p>In the meantime, no wonder so many want to (INAUDIBLE) Google. With connections like those, who wouldn't?</p><p>Now, add Ruth Porat onto that growing list of eager Google recruits. But Ms. Porat isn't just any recruit, is she? She's the chief financial officer of investment bank Morgan Stanley, one of the most powerful women -- actually, one of the most powerful anyone on Wall Street. And now, she's going to become CFO of Google.</p><p>Add her to a growing list of Wall Streeters going to tech including a top Goldman strategist to Twitter or -- continuing with this revolving door thing -- former Obama advisor David Plouffe to Uber and Jay Carney to Amazon.</p><p>Forget what this means to tech. What does this mean to what's left of Wall Street?</p><p>Scott Martin says not much but given the way the White House, he says, has been bashing Wall Street, not much we can do to stop it.</p><p>The allure, I think, for a lot of them is technology's cool, there's actually even more money in it which is hard to believe because you're sinfully rich enough but what's going on here?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, UNITED ADVISORS CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST: Sinfully rich. Yes, that's why I describe myself on Twitter--. Neil, it's tough. I mean, the dreaded brain drain in the financial industry is upon us. I mean, the financial industry, the markets couldn't even keep around a nice lady like Veronica Vain -- look her up -- sports fans being interesting because the allure is not there anymore, Neil. Really, I mean, it is the technology sector. It is all these cool things that are going on outside of this once-big structural firm that was Wall Street, that where all the banks are (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: I think it's money, Scott. I really do think it's money because as much as the financial industry pays, it's chump change in comparison to the stake you take when a technology company does well, goes well, between options and advances and stock, I mean you become a gazilionaire a lot quicker there than you ever could on Wall Street.</p><p>MARTIN: You do. I think Wall Street tough too, Neil, also thanks to the administration, thanks to the financial crisis, has a little bit of an image problem still. In fact, I'd argue that the financial crisis, our financial situation, for a lot of thee banks is not near what it was before the crisis. So you have the perception on both Main Street and some of the certainly people in D.C. that say, \"You know what? The banks are still doing things wrong and to your point about the financials of them, Dodd-Frank, (INAUDIBLE) regulations, all things that are out there now -- Elizabeth Warren being a big party in the Democrats' side of.</p><p>CAVUTO: No, I think the bloom is off the rose. You're absolutely right on that as you are in these issues. And I think the latest telltale sign, college graduates, MBA graduates used to be by overwhelmingly flock to the -- Wall Street. Now, it's half and half and that other half is going to technology.</p><p>MARTIN: And here's the ironic thing, right? Now, the only reason that you probably like your bank or that you can deal with them is because the technology behind it allows you to do what you want to do. But if you work at that bank, if you have that high-paying job on Wall Stree which isn't as high-paying as it once was, that doesn't hold its same mustard as it did, say, five, 10 years ago,.</p><p>CAVUTO: You're right. Scott, you will be the last guy standing and all the money will be yours.</p><p>All right. Scott.</p><p>MARTIN: That's a scary thought. See you later.</p><p>CAVUTO: That is scary. Thank you, my friend.</p><p>In the meantime, Wall Street's not the only one with a Silicon Valley problem. You might have one.</p><p>It's true because Fidelity and other money managers are striking deals with tech startups like Uber and Pinterest who load up your retirement portfolio. And I bet you didn't even know it.</p><p>And what's even scary to Larry Winget is they're doing it in companies that don't have any money or (INAUDIBLE) of making money anytime soon.</p><p>Larry, the argument for this is that, \"Hey, we're spreading our bets. We're giving you a more diversified portfolio. We don't know the percentage that they pour in to these kind of companies but we know they never did before.\" So what do you make of this?</p><p>LARRY WINGET, \"GROW A PAIR\" AUTHOR: Well, I wouldn't find it especially alarming if they're pouring big percentages into it if you're a retiree and you're counting on this to be your retirement fund to live on because it's pure speculation what these tech startups are going to be worth. They value them but that value is not based on publicly-released financial statements. They've never been traded anywhere before. These are privately-held companies. And from a guy like me, it would just be a made-up number. When I look at some of the stuff that's out there -- look at Uber, for instance. In mid-2013, it was supposedly worth $3.5 billion. Now, the valuation is over $40 billion. A thousand percent when the S&amp;P 500 is up 28 percent. How did they come up with a 1,000 percent growth in less than two years? That would bother me.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Well, they could also move on to the government, if that's -- if they don't make (INAUDIBLE). But do you think they shouldn't invest in this (INAUDIBLE), that it shouldn't' be part of any portfolio or do you think when it comes to people and their retirement money -- 'cause a lot (INAUDIBLE), this is multiyear, multi-decade money, that there shouldn't be a little bit of aggressive investment in there anyway.</p><p>WINGET: I have no problem with there being a very small percentage and some of them are saying -- some of the mutual funds are saying you will only be a very small percentage. The good side is if it's very small, you're not going to lose a lot of money. But the bad side is even if they make a lot of money and -- for instance, Uber is worth a thousand times more than it was a couple of years ago, you're probably not going to make a lot of money either. It all comes down to how old you are (INAUDIBLE). If you're 40 years old, you could -= and you have most of your earning years ahead of you, you could afford to be a little more risky. If you're in your 60s, you can't afford that kind of risk. Yes, there's a lot of money to be made but there's always the other side of that -- there's a lot of money to be lost and I don't want any of that money as I approach retirement to be mine when it comes to losing it.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, not everyone can write an incredible bestseller one after the other like you. People have to hedge their beds.</p><p>Larry Winget, thank you very, very much.</p><p>WINGET: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, holy moly. With Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee and Ben Carson likely carving up the Christian vote, are you starting to think that Rick Santorum doesn't have a prayer?</p><p>Rick's here to say \"You don't have a clue.\"</p><p>And you think making cakes is about as far as 3D printers can go? Then this just takes the cake. Now, they're printing construction guys right of their jobs.</p><p>What the Tech?! What do we do when tech turns on us?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>Well, who needs an architect or construction expert if a 3D printer can spit out what they do and in a fraction of the time. What the tech?! What just happened?</p><p>Up first in the segment that is taking the nation by storm, the storm over these cool 3D printers that came in peace but are now apparently peacefully printing out pink slips for many in the building industry. I warned you, America.</p><p>To tech watcher Shama Hyder on what this is all about.</p><p>Shana, what's going -- what can these printers do that's got so many in the construction industry going nuts?</p><p>SHAMA HYDER, MARKETING ZEN CEO: Well, these printers are pretty cool in a lot of ways because they do have the capability of building an entire building. I mean, they're -- they -- they can -- they're stackable. You -- so if you have a job in the construction industry which involves hitting a nail with a hammer over and over again, you should be scared because chances are, some of the printers are going to take that over. But really, if you're.</p><p>CAVUTO: And do that as well?</p><p>HYDER: They're going to do that but they're really good at repetitive tasks. But when it comes to strategically building something, you still need human minds behind it. So this is the whole (INAUDIBLE) we've been hearing for so long -- is technology replacing humans? No. It's really not.</p><p>CAVUTO: I saw \"2001 Space Odyssey.\" I remember how a certain pod bay door wasn't opened so I know how this ends. Where's this all going?</p><p>HYDER: This has a different ending though.</p><p>CAVUTO: Oh, really?</p><p>HYDER: Yes, it does and I'll tell you -- because technology (INAUDIBLE) can really assist people. I think we'll see homes becoming cheaper in many ways which would -- I mean, I'd appreciate that. That'd be great. But also imagine in.</p><p>CAVUTO: If you had a job to buy the home.</p><p>HYDER: That's right. But imagine in places where it's war-torn or a storm comes through and totally demolishes that community. Having something like this could mean that people have shelter within days, within hours, and that's powerful.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. As long as they don't advance into the TV news business (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>All right. Next up, a workout suit that will intensify your workout. Forget three hours sweating up a storm, they say you put this thing on, 20 minutes, you have the same effect and you're done. Now, if they can get that puppy down to 20 seconds, sign me up. But in the meantime, Shama, how does this thing even work?</p><p>HYDER: So it's pretty neat. It's got electrodes that go on your skin essentially through this body suit which looks just like a normal gym suit, something you might wear to workout. But essentially, it works with the muscles so they work out harder. This really neat (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, how is it -- is it telling you \"You're not working hard enough\", or is it just dragging your hand to the punching bag?</p><p>HYDER: No, you do have to put in the motion. You do have to put in the work, right, but it essentially.</p><p>CAVUTO: Oh, so I actually have to work-out.</p><p>HYDER: You do -- you do -- you do have to get up. You do have to work- out but it amplifies it.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, that's the problem. All right. All right.</p><p>HYDER: Right. So there's no -- there's no magic here but it will amplify the effects you get.</p><p>CAVUTO: In other words, you get a lot more done in a shorter period.</p><p>HYDER: Absolutely. But are you going to see like the normal mom going to do this after dropping the kids off and going to gym? No. But for athletes, for people in the sports industry where every little edge counts, this is going to be huge.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, apparently, I'll have more time on my hands after a 3D printer takes my place. It just might work out.</p><p>Meanwhile, this is incredible because after that airbus crash in the south of France, for rival Boeing, it's an announcement that might be eerily time because the company has now uncovered two black boxes in the French Alps. That is, the company behind this crash. The problem is one is very badly damaged. The other is missing its memory card.</p><p>But what Boeing has come up with might make black boxes themselves obsolete, totally unnecessary. The airplane maker just patented a force field of lasers. What that would do is make a plane impenetrable to missiles or outside forces. So let me be clear here, it wouldn't prevent the kind of crash we saw this week in France but it might have stopped that Malaysian jet from being shotdown over the Ukraine last year.</p><p>So Shama, I guess the only issue here would be the expense for this, right?</p><p>HYDER: Yes. I mean, this is going to be expensive but innovation generally is until it's not, right? But anytime you're talking electromagnetic fields, you're talking about new technology that the U.S. government uses now that can see through concrete walls. And so, this isn't necessarily new technology.</p><p>CAVUTO: And it doesn't interrupt to them -- and that static field doesn't' interrupt with the cockpit controls or any of the device.</p><p>HYDER: And so, I mean, this is all the stuff that they're going to have to work out, obviously. It's very, very early stages but yes. It's good. It's going to be a huge expense but as they -- as they tinker with it, as they play with it, it'll obviously get cheaper and hopefully make the world safer.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes. There was a big push -- I mean -- after this shoot-down that \"Hey, we have to help or retrofit airlines with this sort of technology.\" Now, again, to your point, it depends on the expense. But I kind of think something like this is just a matter of time.</p><p>HYDER: It is. It's absolutely a matter of time. And once they test it out, they'll get better and better with it. There's certain things that'll make technology overall cheaper like battery life. That's something Google's working very hard right now on. If they can figure out a way for batteries to be cheaper, last longer, all of this technology becomes easier, cheaper, faster.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. We'll watch closely, Shama. Thank you very, very much.</p><p>HYDER: My pleasure.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, saints preserve us. We've got a lot of saints in this presidential race. Men of God who have no problem talking about God. Now, four years ago, only Rick Santorum was doing that. Now, a fee other presidential wannabees art harping in. Harp. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>Anyway, think Rick is losing the religious right? Why don't I ask Rick myself? Because he's here and only here, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Boy, this just boils me.</p><p>Remember when I was chatting with Mitt Romney yesterday about this likely very crowded Republican presidential field? Now, I said it is so crowded, good luck, Republicans, deciding on a nominee by convention time, like they did back with him, back 2012. Come 2016, it's not going to happen. Now, he scoffed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: If there s potion by vote -- primaries -- falling out, you could get to a situation which begs the issue, would you entertain the party coming to you and saying, \"Governor, we're at a draw here.\"</p><p>MITT ROMNEY, (R) 2012 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: First, that's not going to happen. Two, I'm not.</p><p>CAVUTO: It's happened before.</p><p>ROMNEY: Two, I'm not an entertainer. And three, that was a long time ago that happened. Look, we're going to have our nominee and I'm one of those people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, he may say never, never, never. But girls told me that all the time in high school before my mother finally said yes and we went to the prom together.</p><p>Anyway, my point is this -- there are going to be a lot of Republicans vying for this presidential nomination. I'm thinking at least a dozen, probably more. Let's say half of them -- half of them -- stick it out right to the spring. And so many of these primaries (INAUDIBLE) delegates based on your portion of the vote. That means they're all competing for the same number of delegates being portioned out. It gets to be mathematically impossible for any one man or woman to amass the delegates necessary by the time the convention gets to Cleveland.</p><p>So consider just those vying for the evangelical vote. Back in 2008, it was just Mike Huckabee. Four years later, it was pretty much just Rick Santorum. But this time, it'll be Rick and Mike and Ted Cruz and maybe Ben Carson and maybe Marco Rubio making his Roman Catholic claim to Christian conservatives. You get the picture? It's a crowded picture. It's a crowded race.</p><p>To Rick Santorum who joins us on the phone whether he's praying a little bit more these days.</p><p>Senator, what do you think?</p><p>RICK SANTORUM, (R) FMR. PENNSYLVANIA SENATOR (ON THE PHONE): I can always use a few more prayers, Neil. Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well.</p><p>SANTORUM: Look, I don't -- I think that it's way too early. I mean, if you go back to four years ago, there were a whole lot of other people who were considering -- you talk about Rick Santorum being the only person (INAUDIBLE)I think Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain and Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich, there're a whole lot of people who were trying to appeal to those voters that we eventually did very well with. That's -- it's going to be a --it's office competitive. It has been competitive in the past and this thing will winnow itself down. There isn't -- there isn't enough air in the -- in the chamber for 12 or 13 candidates to make it for a few weeks. It will -- it will narrow down in the first few weeks and the first few primaries.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. I know you're a very religious guy but I'm married to math. I am a numbers geek although I try to be decent and the numbers just don't add up. I mean, in other words, just to get to the 1200, 1300 delegates, you're going to need ultimately what the states decide on how much is a portion in each state. It's going to be an uphill climb and if someone stays in, even a significant group through April or May -- which is an (INAUDIBLE) possibility, it gets to be prohibitive. Does that make you think there is a possibility because as you know, Senator, when you're a good historian, this used to be more than norm -- multiple balance and recent history where it's a single ballot - where that could happen again?</p><p>SANTORUM: I think -- it certainly, it could've happened last time and there was -- there was several candidates who (INAUDIBLE) but as you know, if we go back and look at the last time, there were several candidates and it narrowed down after a few weeks. It narrowed down to really two who had a possibility of winning. And that is likely to happen this time also. But if it doesn't happen, as I said last time around, it's not the end of the world. The bottom line is that the primary process -- let it work, let the competition work, and if there is a real division, then we'll go to something that I'm certainly not worried about. I think an interesting -- a convention where we have ideas out there and we have candidates pretty (INAUDIBLE) the different visions for the country in a dynamic way that -- and captivate a nation. I mean, we haven't had a competitive Republican or Democratic primary convention and in a couple of generations. This would be -- I think it would exciting (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, I'm not ready to bet with you. I think it's going to happen. You could very well be in that mix. But enough about me. Back to you and the guest I had on with me talking about you, including Foster Friess -- big friend of yours, big backer of yours. And I raised with him the fact that he also likes some other guys in the Party.</p><p>This is Foster Friess from a few days ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, I know you placed your bets and your support behind Rick Santorum but you also have been seen in the company of Senator Cruz. Were you hedging your bets?</p><p>FOSTER FRIESS, GOP FUNDRAISER: I'm a Rick Santorum guy and I'm just so impressed with our entire field and Ted Cruz is one amazing human being but the challenge that all of us face is how do we get the establishment and the tea party to kiss and make up because if that doesn't happen, we're dead in the water as Republicans.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Senator, is he leaving you?</p><p>SANTORUM: Is he what, Neil? (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: Was he hinting he could drop you?</p><p>SANTORUM: No. I mean, I just talked to Foster today, as a matter of fact. No. No. Foster's a good friend and a great supporter. And by the way, we've got -- we're building a very strong team. I mean, it's really exciting to see so many people who are encouraging us to get into this race. We haven't made any decisions of that yet (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: But he hasn't said anything to you, Senator, where he says, \"I love you dearly, Rick. You're an honorable great man but at the first sign of stumbling, I'm going to leave you in a heartbeat\"?</p><p>SANTORUM: Oh, my goodness. No, I don't know. Foster and I are very, very close personal friends as well as (INAUDIBLE) in all aspects the same. And so -- now I'm not -- that's the last thing I'm concerned about. I -- what I'm concerned about is making sure that and before we enter into this thing that we've got a big, strong team that we can -- we can run the kind of race that's going to be a winning race, not only in the primary but also in the general--. Do what Foster's--. With Foster, I talked about this a lot.</p><p>We have to have a message that's a unifying message. Not just between the Tea Party and the establishment, but you know reaching out, and bridging this country together. I think so many people are sick of the division that is going on in this country and they are looking for someone with a fresh message to bring us together.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we'll watch closely, Senator. It's always a pleasure. Thank you very, very much.</p><p>SANTORUM: Thank you, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Rick Santorum.</p><p>In the meantime, I want you to think quick. Taylor Swift, RadioShack, one is buying up porn sites with all of their nasty stuff. The other is selling off anything that is not nailed down, including your personal stuff. Which one is sexy and which one is just sad? We shake it up, you decide.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Maybe it's just me, but I think this is RadioShack's version of looking under couch cushions for some spare change, only it's customer data the bankrupt retailers cashing in and I bet you have no idea it's even going on.</p><p>Well, it is going on. Apparently, it is all perfectly legal like selling mailing list to companies even though RadioShack is on the verge of no longer even being a company. Well, Kennedy is worried RadioShack is not alone, not a fan of this sort of thing, right?</p><p>KENNEDY \"KENNEDY\" HOST ON FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Neil, very good to be here with you today. RadioShack --</p><p>CAVUTO: Why do you sound like you don't mean that?</p><p>KENNEDY: I so mean that. You know that I'm --</p><p>CAVUTO: Continue.</p><p>KENNEDY: -- I baked you a ham loaf not long ago out of deep adoration and affection.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, so what is this? Everyone has a list, right?</p><p>KENNEDY: They do. Everyone has a list and if you are dumb enough to go to a store, and give them your address and your email address, and your phone number and your name because you want to be a part of their gift club, and the fan club, and everything else.</p><p>That's on you because what do you think they are doing with it. Do you think they are just going to luck into a safe?</p><p>CAVUTO: But when you order stuff online, someone is scarfing that up information.</p><p>KENNEDY: Of course, they are.</p><p>CAVUTO: Not just the company you're --</p><p>KENNEDY: No, I mean, that is the price of doing business in an electronic age. I get that. I accept that responsibility as a consumer. I am not wild about it. Whatever --</p><p>CAVUTO: So RadioShack, it's selling everything but the kitchen sink, right?</p><p>KENNEDY: Do you know why? My husband pointed this out this weekend because they were dismantling a RadioShack sign where we live in the west side of Los Angeles. He said, of course, they are going out of business. It is called RadioShack, what is the last time you bought a radio?</p><p>CAVUTO: Internet shack or something.</p><p>KENNEDY: Well, it's so fashion backward.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, it is legal, lawyers tell me, legal what they are doing, not their cup of tea, but it is legal. But you --</p><p>KENNEDY: Attorneys general in Texas and Tennessee actually disagree with that because in Texas, it violates some of the privacy laws there. So it will be up to --</p><p>CAVUTO: So companies that sells these as back and forth, they can't do that.</p><p>KENNEDY: And depending on the state, and that is what a republic is, that is fine 92. If you want to live in a state of Texas --</p><p>CAVUTO: That is us. There you go.</p><p>KENNEDY: Indeed, you are a 100 percent correct as per usual, <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto.</nameText></person></p><p>CAVUTO: Thank you very much. So, I think RadioShack will do it someone will buy the list, and I don't know who because it is a dwindling list, some of the names go back to 1980s. I thought many of them are dead.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes, and some of those people don't even have a 19 in front of their birth year if you know what I'm saying.</p><p>CAVUTO: Is that right?</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes, they've done a lot of civil war era.</p><p>CAVUTO: I think we have all their Social Security cards. I mean, that was a big -- yes.</p><p>KENNEDY: AT&amp;T actually has a vested interest in this because they have done some brand sharing and partnering with RadioShack trying to sell their devices and they might be we are owed that list by virtue of our co-investment and co-branding together.</p><p>CAVUTO: But as an update, how do you advice -- you are big on this sort of stuff, word -- either on internet, limit what you share, right?</p><p>KENNEDY: I think you should limit what you share. I think you should have one e-mail address for all of your online purchases.</p><p>CAVUTO: Wouldn't that have saved Hillary Clinton a lot of trouble?</p><p>KENNEDY: And then you should get your own server and have someone named Huma be your wolf dog.</p><p>CAVUTO: Isn't that great that she has her own server?</p><p>KENNEDY: It's very luxurious. It used to be a 300 foot luxury yachts, and those are just for Russian billionaires that's very boring, so 2004, but your own server, like Martha Stewart used to have her own brand. But she doesn't even have her own server.</p><p>CAVUTO: You have a server?</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes, exactly.</p><p>CAVUTO: Kennedy, thank you very much.</p><p>KENNEDY: You got served, Neil. I like you.</p><p>CAVUTO: She is on fire. All right, the taxes you leave your heirs will have you wants to save them will trouble, you might want to hear this next Republican out. He is the only one in the Senate not running for president. John Thune is going to tell you how he is on a mission from God.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, raising death tax very much alive and well. To the Republican senator who wants to kill off the estate tax itself before, well, any Democrats including the president get any more bright ideas about hiking it.</p><p>South Dakota Senator John Thune joins us with something called the Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015. Senator, always good to see you. What is this about?</p><p>SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD), SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE MEMBER: Great to be with you, Neil. Thank you. Well, look, we think that the death tax is punitive. The farmers and ranchers and small business people, family businesses and operations. You want to pass it on to next generation.</p><p>The Congressional Budget Office in 2009 said a third of businesses who owe the death tax owe more in taxes than what their assets are worth. So, what typically happens is they have to liquidate the business in order to pay IRS.</p><p>It is a tax that is inefficient and it hurts. It hurts jobs and the economy in this country, and we think it is time for it to go. And so we have a bill that would repeal it and end the death tax once and for all.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now what kind of support do you have?</p><p>THUNE: Well, we have, we got good support obviously among Republicans. We have been reaching out to some Democrats. There are some Democrats in the past, who have expressed support for getting rid of the death tax.</p><p>We hope that they will there be some bipartisan support in Congress. Kevin Brady is introducing the bill in the House of Representatives. We are going to hold a news conference tomorrow to talk about why it's important that Congress take the steps that are necessary to do away with this very burdensome, very punitive tax.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, the administration, I am sure you are aware of this, Senator, comes out and says I don't know what Thune is arguing about. The fact of the matter is very few pay this tax because very few really fit the criteria or the means by which to have to pay it. What do you say? I think they say it's closer to 2 percent at that?</p><p>THUNE: Right, well, if you look at run-up, Neil, in land values in state like South Dakota over past decade, we have seen land value increase to point now that about a third of the farms in South Dakota are actually over the exemption amount.</p><p>So they would be liable to pay the tax. This is a very big issue in farm and ranch country where people are land rich and cash poor, but it also hits a lot of small businesses in this country. Douglas (inaudible) did a study here recently that suggested that ending the death tax would add a million and a half jobs to our economy.</p><p>So, we think it is about jobs. It is about growth and you think about how much money people spend to avoid the taxes well, and you know, this isn't something that in our economy we really don't need.</p><p>We want to encourage people to pass that family farm or business on to the next generation and getting rid of the death tax would help make that possible.</p><p>CAVUTO: As of right now, Senator, you are one of only Republican senators presently not planning to run for president that I know of. So I wonder when you hear and out of your colleagues this idea for simplified tax code and some of these other stuff, they seemed to be very unified. The approach is different. Will that be a Republican rallying cry in 2016 because we're a long way from anything that approaches a simpler tax code?</p><p>THUNE: I agree, and it should be a rallying cry. The tax code is way too complicated. It is way too costly to comply with. If we could broaden tax base in this country and lower rates, I think would unleash a period of economic growth unlike anything we've seen in a long time and included in that should be getting rid of the death tax.</p><p>You got an administration in Washington right now that very much likes to raise taxes, take from some people and give it to others, and we just think that the best way to get growth in the economy is to get the tax rate down at the lowest level possible.</p><p>There were people who are making decisions based up what's best for a return as opposed to tax consequences and so, you know, my hope would be that our candidates in 2016 are out there aggressively talking about their plans to reform tax code to make it more simple, more fair, and lower rates, and focus on economic growth.</p><p>CAVUTO: Senator Thune, always a pleasure.</p><p>THUNE: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: If you decide to run or join your other colleagues, just please let us know, but it's always --</p><p>THUNE: You will be first to know, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Senator Thune, great seeing you again. Thank you.</p><p>THUNE: You too.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, Taylor sure has been swifted, buying up all these porn sites, the skinny on what this rock star is really doing.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, a Fox Biz alert for you, Taylor Swift is buying up all the porn, no, not this porn, dot-porn, grabbing, Taylorswift.porn, what am I thinking? And Taylorswift.adult before the dirty domains go up on sale on the public market this summer.</p><p>\"STRANGE INHERITANCE\" star, Jamie Colby, said nothing strange about it, if she does not do this now, she could facing legal hurdles later. She is not alone. A lot of stars, actresses are trying to do this kind of thing, why?</p><p>JAMIE COLBY, FBN HOST, \"STRANGE INHERITANCE\": It happened to me, someone took my name, and web site, and probably taking <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto </nameText></person>dot whatever, except porn would be a profitable proposition.</p><p>CAVUTO: Although I've run into this myself, but --</p><p>COLBY: The things that it takes to be you, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: And you, you know, we know.</p><p>COLBY: It is becoming more difficult to be me, but it's a hell of a lot of fun. I have to tell you that there is no legal case. As you know, I'm the illegal smarty pants and almost every state in America. It is not illegal to take somebody's name and buy a web site with their name with the hope of profiting later.</p><p>If you put something on that web site that is disparaging or you make some profit from having that web site, you got to share the profits and you might get sued for saying something wrong.</p><p>CAVUTO: So what if she is taking these sites with her name, and they are still being used for porn, can they still be used?</p><p>COLBY: No, not. Once she buys them she owns them. She has a proprietary right to whatever goes on them.</p><p>CAVUTO: But images of her can pop up on sites where her name is not in it.</p><p>COLBY: Well, that she has a right to sue especially if they are used in disparaging way.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK, so legally, buying up the names does not shield you from this type of stuff coming up anyway.</p><p>COLBY: Well, it is smart of her to buy the name, but I thought question you were posing was if someone else buys the name with her name, is there a suit in ex and of itself there isn't.</p><p>I wanted to tell you this could happen to anybody. I went with Rick Ritemoth, our weather dude. He said, you have to come down the street to the deli. You are not going to believe it.</p><p>Your face is on an ad for a male healthful product and I said, wait a minute now, we went over there. He saw it hanging over the cash register. You have to come here, your face on an ad for a male health product, it was my picture, I seek legal remedy to get it stopped.</p><p>CAVUTO: Did they take it off the deli wall?</p><p>COLBY: It is gone. I do not have it any more. If Taylor Swift did not buy the sites, someone else did and they made money, and put something unflattering of Hershey would have a suit, but who whether or not you there was a dot-porn.</p><p>CAVUTO: She is a smart lady as of you, how is the show?</p><p>COLBY: Great, tonight, if you love \"STRANGE INHERITANCE,\" so many people do. If you love animals, a sanctuary that was left with lions, tigers and bears and that baboon. I met him personally. The way to their heart is through their stomach.</p><p>They are rescues, she inherited them, a beautiful story of survival a family that wants to continue a great gesture of taking care of the animal, second one a rancher did not inherit enough land to ranch. He found a surprise of his lifetime. He turned down $5 million for a dinosaur a species that scientists did not know existed.</p><p>CAVUTO: Was it a prehistoric?</p><p>COLBY: Like this, like this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Are you surprised at the success of the show?</p><p>COLBY: This is real stuff, this is not reality. This is real families.</p><p>CAVUTO: I want to string together your reaction stocks when scary people, you talk to scary people, it seems, find me a window where is the door.</p><p>COLBY: Sometimes my chair rolls back.</p><p>CAVUTO: Look at the time.</p><p>COLBY: That is Dr. Keith Ablow does, I see we're ought of time.</p><p>CAVUTO: It's a great show.</p><p>COLBY: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: She made it because --</p><p>COLBY: Tonight at 9 p.m. on Fox Business Network.</p><p>CAVUTO: You got it done.</p><p>COLBY: But it's a power to prosper and enjoy.</p><p>CAVUTO: The idea is to not promote.</p><p>COLBY: Excuse me?</p><p>CAVUTO: Look at the time. We'll have more right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: And what's the deal with all of this constant Ted Cruz bashing, too brash, too young, too extreme? To a lot of you too much, Dennis in Ohio, \"May we point out that Hillary, Biden and Dodd, all the Democratic candidates for president in 2008 told us how inexperienced Obama was, yet they got behind him, when they saw an opportunity to gain power.\" Such is politics.</p><p>Jim emails \"Day one of Cruz and the Democrats already spewing hate and lies. And the GOP still have 12 more presidential candidates to come out.\"</p><p>Al emails, \"There is no doubt that Cruz is a very bright guy, but I don't see him as having charisma to beat Hillary. He is just not that likable. In addition, I saw his stand on repealing Obamacare, as less than heroic. He knew he was fighting a losing battle yet he was willing to fight until he was the last Republican left standing.\"</p><p>Well, Al, I just say hear him out because he will be part of a very vibrant mix of candidates and ideas that will stimulate and who will stimulate the debate.</p><p>Russ and Cathy email, \"Hi, Neil, unfortunately, I think you are correct. What a fabulous Cabinet it would be if the Republicans became a team instead of having the blood-letting even if they just played, \"Rock, paper, scissors.\" We would have a great president.</p><p>Then Mitt Romney insist that it might be a crowded field, but by convention time, it will be down to one nominee. I disagree. We will not have a nominee by convention time, and that is when Republican seek him out, as maybe a consensus candidate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: There are a lot of those guys were bummed out when you said you were not going to run. So I'm wondering now, you say never?</p><p>MITT ROMNEY, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is not going to happen, I'm sorry, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: That is never, never.</p><p>ROMNEY: It's not going to happen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: I don't know, never, never sounds like maybe to me. Stacy emails, \"I just watched your interview with Mr. Romney, it was good, I sure wish he would have made it into office.\"</p><p>Tony in Vermont, \"My comment on your Facebook post about Mitt Romney had 600 likes, in first 30 minutes, did I just go viral?\" No, you are just hitching along for ride.</p><p>Meanwhile, Henry via centurylink.net, \"Neil, for a long time, several times, I have written you about criticism about your constant interruptions and also your stupid laugh.</p><p>Today, your interview with Governor Mitt Romney was the latest in your annoying actions. So I have designated you as the newest on my list of men a carried for a long time as the least admirable three men in the world, the title you are now on is jerk.\"</p><p>Well, at least, you didn't call me fat. By the way, you got to tell me, who are other two? Buffalo businessman, Karl Paladino weighing in on 2016 and Mitt Romney.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARL PALADINO (R), FORMER NEW YORK GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: We need a guy who can create jobs that understands means of creating jobs does not side with 1 percent against the 99 percent.

That hurt him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Tommy in North Carolina, not a fan of Carl's, \"Alan Grayson is a very good businessman. That does not mean he is sane. Grayson, Donald Trump, and Carl Paladino should form a club.\" That would be a wealthy club.</p><p>Russ emails, \"Good to see Paladino back. Good ideas as always.\" Finally, this from Jim, \"Neil, I see on the news that Hillary has a new e-mail account. Since she isn't using the old one, can we see the server?\"</p><p>You know, well, I guess, she is not using it.

I'm Neil Cavuto.  Glad to  have you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And who knew Google has its own fast pass to the White House?  I'm  talking very fast, fast pass and apparently, one that never expires.   You should be so lucky with yours at Disney because Google employees get  on a lot of rides at this White House park -- try 230 of them since the  president first took office.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Now, that roughly (INAUDIBLE) about one a week and apparently, they  weren't all going for the ride.  Many of these meetings came as the  government was wrapping up its antitrust investigation into Google.  So  awkward.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Now, I don't know.  But here's what I do know.  The Federal Trade  Commission eventually closed that investigation.  Google agreed to make  some voluntary changes to its business practices.  But you needn't  Google the term \"quid pro quo\" to know something doesn't smell right  because I don't know about you but this kind of stuff doesn't happen to  us.  Taxpayers don't get these kind of breaks or fast passes.  In fact,  for most businesses, it is far more common to be shut out of the White  House than ever get so much as a kind word from the White House.</p><p> But again, that is just me.</p><p> Steve Moore wants to shut this ride down.  But Basil Smikle says it is  (INAUDIBLE), I should say it's not such a bad ride.</p><p> You don't like the sound of any of it?</p><p> STEVE MOORE, HERITAGE CHIEF ECONOMIST:  I'm old enough to remember when  Google and Apple and Microsoft and Netflix didn't even have lobbying  operations in Washington, you know?  And the high tech community in  Silicon Valley just said, \"Leave us alone.  We'll do our thing and you  do your thing.\"  And now, they have these massive lobbying operations in  Washington.  And it's basically the Google administration right now.  I  mean, they (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> CAVUTO:  But they're not alone, I guess, because their sheer size, the - - it looks a little more obvious.</p><p> BASIL SMIKLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, I think to your point  exactly, tech -- the government and our legislature always lags behind  technology.  And right now, these companies are sort of ruling the  world.  It's not surprising.</p><p> MOORE:  (INAUDIBLE). </p><p> CAVUTO:  So why wasn't he meeting with these Google guys before the  launch of the Affordable Care Act (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p> SMIKLE:  Well, it's not surprising that he's meeting with them now.   Look at all (INAUDIBLE) that we've been talking about in the last year.   We talked about.</p><p> CAVUTO:  The sheer number of meetings, (INAUDIBLE), come on.</p><p> SMIKLE:  .we've talked about -- we've talked about immigration and  they're certainly going to lobby for high school workers.</p><p> CAVUTO:  One a week.</p><p> SMIKLE:  We talked about net neutrality.  That's going to be a key  issue.</p><p> CAVUTO:  I know, I know.  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> SMIKLE:  The problem is -- the point is that they have a lot of stuff to  talk about and (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> MOORE:  They have.  (INAUDIBLE) problem.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p> SMIKLE:  I don't begrudge them but using their resources in trying to  push (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> MOORE:  The interesting thing about the net neutrality issue is that  Google was on the side of net neutrality at the beginning and then --  then saw the government got their fangs.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, it evolved.  They evolved as they've been getting bigger.   (INAUDIBLE).  If George Bush were doing this with defense contractors  every week, you would be -- flip a gasket, as would I.</p><p> SMIKLE:  I probably would but I would -- instead of pointing to George  Bush, I'd point to Ronald Reagan.  Think about the coziness that he had  with some of the media companies 'cause they -- he actually sparked a  lot of this sort of consolidation in media under his watch.  You had  more companies than ever before in history and the mergers and  acquisitions.  So that's (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p> CAVUTO:  I think it's fair to say during that time though, he did not  have a cozy relationship with the media.  They were blistering him every  day.</p><p> SMIKLE:  But he did with big business and we forgave him that or others  forgave him that.  So.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Not the Washington Post.</p><p> MOORE:  This is the most (INAUDIBLE) situation of all though.  You have  big - $4 trillion government and you have these massive companies like  Google -- I think Google's the biggest company in the world right now in  terms of revenues -- and you put them together and bad things happen.   We want big government and big business to stay on top.</p><p> CAVUTO:  See, but I agree, Basil, but I think it's fine for a CEO --  CEOs -- to meet at the White House.  I think he gets a little  problematic when it turns into like \"Skip the pass, you can just walk in  through the front gate.\"  </p><p> SMIKLE:  Well, I don't know if it was that -- if they had that kind of  access.  But the reality.</p><p> CAVUTO:  It all comes back to bite you.  Remember what happened to  JPMorgan Chase.  Jamie Dimon could just waltz into the Oval Office  anytime he wanted.  As soon as he started getting attacked critical, not  only did they take the fast pass away, before you know it, the firm was  facing billions of dollars (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> SMIKLE:  So are you saying that the Bush administration shouldn't have  allowed him in as much as they should've?</p><p> CAVUTO:  I'm saying not every week.  That's what I'm saying.  I just  think that that gets a little weird.</p><p> SMIKLE:  Well, I think as businesses grow, as industries go, I would  imagine that this occurred with the auto industry at some point -- that  as they become such huge (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> CAVUTO:  Talk to others.  Talk to others.  Talk to others.  </p><p> SMIKLE:  When they have such a huge role in our business, in our  industry, they're going to be meeting with government officials  (INAUDIBLE) all the time.</p><p> CAVUTO:  But it's the same thing I said at this president (INAUDIBLE)  meeting with the likes of Al Sharpton (INAUDIBLE) the racial issue --  meet with other representatives from points of view.  But be fair and  balanced.  He is now choosing \"I'm going to be fair if I focus on  Google, I focus on Apple, and I kind of ignore everyone else.\" </p><p> SMIKLE:  But who else is driving our conversations about technology  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, those guys will never get the chance.  Those guys will  never get the chance.</p><p> MOORE:  There are thousands and thousands of small businesses in the  technology industry, by the way, biting at the heels of Google and I  guarantee you, most of them do not have a lobbyist.  I'm sure they don't  have a (INAUDIBLE).  But that's -- I have a little bit take on this  thing.  You, Neil.  I mean, I just think when the government tries to  regulate the high tech industry, as you said, you put it very well.   There are three generations behind where this industry is at.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  But what did I say about regulating technology?  I didn't  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> MOORE:  No, no.  I just -- I just mean -- I think the problem.</p><p> CAVUTO:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> MOORE:  .of course, Google's going to have all these lobbyists because  the government is sticking its fingers in everything that they do.</p><p> SMIKLE:  But I agree the small businesses should have a role at the  table.  </p><p> MOORE:  No.  No, no.  That's not my point.</p><p> SMIKLE:  I know but I do (INAUDIBLE) -- I do think -- I do think that  small businesses (INAUDIBLE) -- should have -- should have (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> MOORE:  The government -- there's too many of them.  There are millions  of small businesses.  There's not enough Lincoln Bedrooms.</p><p> CAVUTO:  He makes more sense than you do.  That's scary, right there.  </p><p> SMIKLE:  That's scary, wow.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Guys, seriously, thank you both very, very much.</p><p> In the meantime, no wonder so many want to (INAUDIBLE) Google.  With  connections like those, who wouldn't?  </p><p> Now, add Ruth Porat onto that growing list of eager Google recruits.   But Ms. Porat isn't just any recruit, is she?  She's the chief financial  officer of investment bank Morgan Stanley, one of the most powerful  women -- actually, one of the most powerful anyone on Wall Street.  And  now, she's going to become CFO of Google.</p><p> Add her to a growing list of Wall Streeters going to tech including a  top Goldman strategist to Twitter or -- continuing with this revolving  door thing -- former Obama advisor David Plouffe to Uber and Jay Carney  to Amazon.</p><p> Forget what this means to tech.  What does this mean to what's left of  Wall Street?  </p><p> Scott Martin says not much but given the way the White House, he says,  has been bashing Wall Street, not much we can do to stop it.</p><p> The allure, I think, for a lot of them is technology's cool, there's  actually even more money in it which is hard to believe because you're  sinfully rich enough but what's going on here?</p><p> SCOTT MARTIN, UNITED ADVISORS CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST:  Sinfully rich.   Yes, that's why I describe myself on Twitter--.  Neil, it's tough.  I  mean, the dreaded brain drain in the financial industry is upon us.  I  mean, the financial industry, the markets couldn't even keep around a  nice lady like Veronica Vain -- look her up -- sports fans being  interesting because the allure is not there anymore, Neil.  Really, I  mean, it is the technology sector.  It is all these cool things that are  going on outside of this once-big structural firm that was Wall Street,  that where all the banks are (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> CAVUTO:  I think it's money, Scott.  I really do think it's money  because as much as the financial industry pays, it's chump change in  comparison to the stake you take when a technology company does well,  goes well, between options and advances and stock, I mean you become a  gazilionaire a lot quicker there than you ever could on Wall Street.</p><p> MARTIN:  You do.  I think Wall Street tough too, Neil, also thanks to  the administration, thanks to the financial crisis, has a little bit of  an image problem still.  In fact, I'd argue that the financial crisis,  our financial situation, for a lot of thee banks is not near what it was  before the crisis.  So you have the perception on both Main Street and  some of the certainly people in D.C. that say, \"You know what?  The  banks are still doing things wrong and to your point about the  financials of them, Dodd-Frank, (INAUDIBLE) regulations, all things that  are out there now -- Elizabeth Warren being a big party in the  Democrats' side of.</p><p> CAVUTO:  No, I think the bloom is off the rose.  You're absolutely right  on that as you are in these issues.  And I think the latest telltale  sign, college graduates, MBA graduates used to be by overwhelmingly  flock to the -- Wall Street.  Now, it's half and half and that other  half is going to technology.</p><p> MARTIN:  And here's the ironic thing, right?  Now, the only reason that  you probably like your bank or that you can deal with them is because  the technology behind it allows you to do what you want to do.  But if  you work at that bank, if you have that high-paying job on Wall Stree  which isn't as high-paying as it once was, that doesn't hold its same  mustard as it did, say, five, 10 years ago,.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You're right.  Scott, you will be the last guy standing and all  the money will be yours.  </p><p> All right.  Scott.</p><p> MARTIN:  That's a scary thought.  See you later.</p><p> CAVUTO:  That is scary.  Thank you, my friend.</p><p> In the meantime, Wall Street's not the only one with a Silicon Valley  problem.  You might have one.  </p><p> It's true because Fidelity and other money managers are striking deals  with tech startups like Uber and Pinterest who load up your retirement  portfolio.  And I bet you didn't even know it.  </p><p> And what's even scary to Larry Winget is they're doing it in companies  that don't have any money or (INAUDIBLE) of making money anytime soon.</p><p> Larry, the argument for this is that, \"Hey, we're spreading our bets.   We're giving you a more diversified portfolio.  We don't know the  percentage that they pour in to these kind of companies but we know they  never did before.\"  So what do you make of this?</p><p> LARRY WINGET, \"GROW A PAIR\" AUTHOR:  Well, I wouldn't find it especially  alarming if they're pouring big percentages into it if you're a retiree  and you're counting on this to be your retirement fund to live on  because it's pure speculation what these tech startups are going to be  worth.  They value them but that value is not based on publicly-released  financial statements.  They've never been traded anywhere before.  These  are privately-held companies.  And from a guy like me, it would just be  a made-up number.  When I look at some of the stuff that's out there --  look at Uber, for instance.  In mid-2013, it was supposedly worth $3.5  billion.  Now, the valuation is over $40 billion.  A thousand percent  when the S&amp;P 500 is up 28 percent.  How did they come up with a 1,000  percent growth in less than two years?  That would bother me.  </p><p> CAVUTO: All right.  Well, they could also move on to the government, if  that's -- if they don't make (INAUDIBLE).  But do you think they  shouldn't invest in this (INAUDIBLE), that it shouldn't' be part of any  portfolio or do you think when it comes to people and their retirement  money -- 'cause a lot (INAUDIBLE), this is multiyear, multi-decade  money, that there shouldn't be a little bit of aggressive investment in  there anyway.</p><p> WINGET:  I have no problem with there being a very small percentage and  some of them are saying -- some of the mutual funds are saying you will  only be a very small percentage.  The good side is if it's very small,  you're not going to lose a lot of money.  But the bad side is even if  they make a lot of money and -- for instance, Uber is worth a thousand  times more than it was a couple of years ago, you're probably not going  to make a lot of money either.  It all comes down to how old you are  (INAUDIBLE).  If you're 40 years old, you could -= and you have most of  your earning years ahead of you, you could afford to be a little more  risky.  If you're in your 60s, you can't afford that kind of risk.  Yes,  there's a lot of money to be made but there's always the other side of  that -- there's a lot of money to be lost and I don't want any of that  money as I approach retirement to be mine when it comes to losing it.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, not everyone can write an incredible bestseller one after  the other like you.  People have to hedge their beds.</p><p> Larry Winget, thank you very, very much.</p><p> WINGET:  Thank you.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, holy moly.  With Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee and Ben  Carson likely carving up the Christian vote, are you starting to think  that Rick Santorum doesn't have a prayer?  </p><p> Rick's here to say \"You don't have a clue.\"</p><p> And you think making cakes is about as far as 3D printers can go?  Then  this just takes the cake.  Now, they're printing construction guys right  of their jobs.</p><p> What the Tech?!  What do we do when tech turns on us?</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p> Well, who needs an architect or construction expert if a 3D printer can  spit out what they do and in a fraction of the time.  What the tech?!   What just happened?</p><p> Up first in the segment that is taking the nation by storm, the storm  over these cool 3D printers that came in peace but are now apparently  peacefully printing out pink slips for many in the building industry.  I  warned you, America.</p><p> To tech watcher Shama Hyder on what this is all about.</p><p> Shana, what's going -- what can these printers do that's got so many in  the construction industry going nuts?</p><p> SHAMA HYDER, MARKETING ZEN CEO:  Well, these printers are pretty cool in  a lot of ways because they do have the capability of building an entire  building.  I mean, they're -- they -- they can -- they're stackable.   You -- so if you have a job in the construction industry which involves  hitting a nail with a hammer over and over again, you should be scared  because chances are, some of the printers are going to take that over.   But really, if you're.</p><p> CAVUTO:  And do that as well?</p><p> HYDER:  They're going to do that but they're really good at repetitive  tasks.  But when it comes to strategically building something, you still  need human minds behind it.  So this is the whole (INAUDIBLE) we've been  hearing for so long -- is technology replacing humans?  No.  It's really  not.</p><p> CAVUTO:  I saw \"2001 Space Odyssey.\"  I remember how a certain pod bay  door wasn't opened so I know how this ends.  Where's this all going?</p><p> HYDER:  This has a different ending though.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Oh, really?</p><p> HYDER:  Yes, it does and I'll tell you -- because technology (INAUDIBLE)  can really assist people.  I think we'll see homes becoming cheaper in  many ways which would -- I mean, I'd appreciate that.  That'd be great.   But also imagine in.</p><p> CAVUTO:  If you had a job to buy the home.</p><p> HYDER:  That's right.  But imagine in places where it's war-torn or a  storm comes through and totally demolishes that community.  Having  something like this could mean that people have shelter within days,  within hours, and that's powerful.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  As long as they don't advance into the TV news  business (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p> All right.  Next up, a workout suit that will intensify your workout.   Forget three hours sweating up a storm, they say you put this thing on,  20 minutes, you have the same effect and you're done.  Now, if they can  get that puppy down to 20 seconds, sign me up.  But in the meantime,  Shama, how does this thing even work?</p><p> HYDER:  So it's pretty neat.  It's got electrodes that go on your skin  essentially through this body suit which looks just like a normal gym  suit, something you might wear to workout.  But essentially, it works  with the muscles so they work out harder.  This really neat (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, how is it -- is it telling you \"You're not working hard  enough\", or is it just dragging your hand to the punching bag?</p><p> HYDER:  No, you do have to put in the motion.  You do have to put in the  work, right, but it essentially.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Oh, so I actually have to work-out.</p><p> HYDER:  You do -- you do -- you do have to get up.  You do have to work- out but it amplifies it.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, that's the problem.  All right.  All right.</p><p> HYDER:  Right.  So there's no -- there's no magic here but it will  amplify the effects you get.</p><p> CAVUTO:  In other words, you get a lot more done in a shorter period.</p><p> HYDER:  Absolutely.  But are you going to see like the normal mom going  to do this after dropping the kids off and going to gym?  No.  But for  athletes, for people in the sports industry where every little edge  counts, this is going to be huge.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, apparently, I'll have more time on my hands after a 3D  printer takes my place.  It just might work out.</p><p> Meanwhile, this is incredible because after that airbus crash in the  south of France, for rival Boeing, it's an announcement that might be  eerily time because the company has now uncovered two black boxes in the  French Alps.  That is, the company behind this crash.  The problem is  one is very badly damaged.  The other is missing its memory card.  </p><p> But what Boeing has come up with might make black boxes themselves  obsolete, totally unnecessary.  The airplane maker just patented a force  field of lasers.  What that would do is make a plane impenetrable to  missiles or outside forces.  So let me be clear here, it wouldn't  prevent the kind of crash we saw this week in France but it might have  stopped that Malaysian jet from being shotdown over the Ukraine last  year. </p><p> So Shama, I guess the only issue here would be the expense for this,  right?</p><p> HYDER:  Yes.  I mean, this is going to be expensive but innovation  generally is until it's not, right?  But anytime you're talking  electromagnetic fields, you're talking about new technology that the  U.S. government uses now that can see through concrete walls.  And so,  this isn't necessarily new technology.</p><p> CAVUTO:  And it doesn't interrupt to them -- and that static field  doesn't' interrupt with the cockpit controls or any of the device.</p><p> HYDER:  And so, I mean, this is all the stuff that they're going to have  to work out, obviously.  It's very, very early stages but yes.  It's  good.  It's going to be a huge expense but as they -- as they tinker  with it, as they play with it, it'll obviously get cheaper and hopefully  make the world safer.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  There was a big push -- I mean -- after this shoot-down  that \"Hey, we have to help or retrofit airlines with this sort of  technology.\"  Now, again, to your point, it depends on the expense.  But  I kind of think something like this is just a matter of time.</p><p> HYDER:  It is.  It's absolutely a matter of time.  And once they test it  out, they'll get better and better with it.  There's certain things  that'll make technology overall cheaper like battery life.  That's  something Google's working very hard right now on.  If they can figure  out a way for batteries to be cheaper, last longer, all of this  technology becomes easier, cheaper, faster.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  We'll watch closely, Shama.  Thank you very, very  much.</p><p> HYDER:  My pleasure.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, saints preserve us.  We've got a lot of saints in this  presidential race.  Men of God who have no problem talking about God.   Now, four years ago, only Rick Santorum was doing that.  Now, a fee  other presidential wannabees art harping in.  Harp.  (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p> Anyway, think Rick is losing the religious right?  Why don't I ask Rick  myself?  Because he's here and only here, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Boy, this just boils me.  </p><p> Remember when I was chatting with Mitt Romney yesterday about this  likely  very crowded Republican presidential field?  Now, I said it is  so crowded, good luck, Republicans, deciding on a nominee by convention  time, like they did back with him, back 2012.  Come 2016, it's not going  to happen.  Now, he scoffed. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  If there s potion by vote -- primaries -- falling out, you  could get to a situation which begs the issue, would you entertain the  party coming to you and saying, \"Governor, we're at a draw here.\"</p><p> MITT ROMNEY, (R) 2012 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  First, that's not going  to happen.  Two, I'm not.</p><p> CAVUTO:  It's happened before.</p><p> ROMNEY:  Two, I'm not an entertainer.  And three, that was a long time  ago that happened.  Look, we're going to have our nominee and I'm one of  those people.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, he may say never, never, never.  But girls told me that  all the time in high school before my mother finally said yes and we  went to the prom together.</p><p> Anyway, my point is this -- there are going to be a lot of Republicans  vying for this presidential nomination.  I'm thinking at least a dozen,  probably more.  Let's say half of them -- half of them -- stick it out  right to the spring.  And so many of these primaries (INAUDIBLE)  delegates based on your portion of the vote.  That means they're all  competing for the same number of delegates being portioned out.  It gets  to be mathematically impossible for any one man or woman to amass the  delegates necessary by the time the convention gets to Cleveland.  </p><p> So consider just those vying for the evangelical vote.  Back in 2008, it  was just Mike Huckabee.  Four years later, it was pretty much just Rick  Santorum.  But this time, it'll be Rick and Mike and Ted Cruz and maybe  Ben Carson and maybe Marco Rubio making his Roman Catholic claim to  Christian conservatives.  You get the picture?  It's a crowded picture.   It's a crowded race.  </p><p> To Rick Santorum who joins us on the phone whether he's praying a little  bit more these days. </p><p> Senator, what do you think?</p><p> RICK SANTORUM, (R) FMR. PENNSYLVANIA SENATOR (ON THE PHONE):  I can  always use a few more prayers, Neil.  Thank you.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well.   </p><p> SANTORUM:  Look, I don't -- I think that it's way too early.  I mean, if  you go back to four years ago, there were a whole lot of other people  who were considering -- you talk about Rick Santorum being the only  person (INAUDIBLE)I think Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain and Rick  Perry and Newt Gingrich, there're a whole lot of people who were trying  to appeal to those voters that we eventually did very well with.  That's  -- it's going to be a --it's office competitive. It has been competitive  in the past and this thing will winnow itself down.  There isn't --  there isn't enough air in the -- in the chamber for 12 or 13 candidates  to make it for a few weeks.  It will -- it will narrow down in the first  few weeks and the first few primaries.  </p><p> CAVUTO:    All right.  I know you're a very religious guy but I'm  married to math.  I am a numbers geek although I try to be decent and  the numbers just don't add up.  I mean, in other words, just to get to  the 1200, 1300 delegates, you're going to need ultimately what the  states decide on how much is a portion in each state.  It's going to be  an uphill climb and if someone stays in, even a significant group  through April or May -- which is an (INAUDIBLE) possibility, it gets to  be prohibitive.  Does that make you think there is a possibility because  as you know, Senator, when you're a good historian, this used to be more  than norm -- multiple balance and recent history where it's a single  ballot - where that could happen again?</p><p> SANTORUM:  I think -- it certainly, it could've happened last time and  there was -- there was several candidates who (INAUDIBLE) but as you  know, if we go back and look at the last time, there were several  candidates and it narrowed down after a few weeks.  It narrowed down to  really two who had a possibility of winning.  And that is likely to  happen this time also.  But if it doesn't happen, as I said last time  around, it's not the end of the world.  The bottom line is that the  primary process -- let it work, let the competition work, and if there  is a real division, then we'll go to something that I'm certainly not  worried about.  I think an interesting -- a convention where we have  ideas out there and we have candidates pretty (INAUDIBLE) the different  visions for the country in a dynamic way that -- and captivate a nation.   I mean, we haven't had a competitive Republican or Democratic primary  convention and in a couple of generations.  This would be -- I think it  would exciting (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, I'm not ready to bet with you.  I think it's going to  happen.  You could very well be in that mix.  But enough about me.  Back  to you and the guest I had on with me talking about you, including  Foster Friess -- big friend of yours, big backer of yours.  And I raised  with him the fact that he also likes some other guys in the Party.  </p><p> This is Foster Friess from a few days ago.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Now, I know you placed your bets and your support behind Rick  Santorum but you also have been seen in the company of Senator Cruz.   Were you hedging your bets?</p><p> FOSTER FRIESS, GOP FUNDRAISER:  I'm a Rick Santorum guy and I'm just so  impressed with our entire field and Ted Cruz is one amazing human being  but the challenge that all of us face is how do we get the establishment  and the tea party to kiss and make up because if that doesn't happen,  we're dead in the water as Republicans.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Senator, is he leaving you?</p><p> SANTORUM:  Is he what, Neil?  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> CAVUTO:  Was he hinting he could drop you?</p><p> SANTORUM:  No.  I mean, I just talked to Foster today, as a matter of  fact.  No.  No.  Foster's a good friend and a great supporter.  And by  the way, we've got -- we're building a very strong team.  I mean, it's  really exciting to see so many people who are encouraging us to get into  this race.  We haven't made any decisions of that yet (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> CAVUTO:  But he hasn't said anything to you, Senator, where he says, \"I  love you dearly, Rick.  You're an honorable great man but at the first  sign of stumbling, I'm going to leave you in a heartbeat\"?</p><p> SANTORUM:  Oh, my goodness.  No, I don't know.  Foster and I are very,  very close personal friends as well as (INAUDIBLE) in all aspects the  same.  And so -- now I'm not -- that's the last thing I'm concerned  about.  I -- what I'm concerned about is making sure that and before we  enter into this thing that we've got a big, strong team that we can --  we can run the kind of race that's going to be a winning race, not only  in the primary but also in the general--.  Do what Foster's--.  With  Foster, I talked about this a lot.  </p><p> We have to have a message that's a unifying message.  Not just between  the Tea Party and the establishment, but you know reaching out, and  bridging this country together.  I think so many people are sick of the  division that is going on in this country and they are looking for  someone with a fresh message to bring us together.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, we'll watch closely, Senator.  It's always a  pleasure.  Thank you very, very much.</p><p> SANTORUM:  Thank you, Neil.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Rick Santorum.</p><p> In the meantime, I want you to think quick.  Taylor Swift, RadioShack,  one is buying up porn sites with all of their nasty stuff.  The other is  selling off anything that is not nailed down, including your personal  stuff.  Which one is sexy and which one is just sad?  We shake it up,  you decide.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Maybe it's just me, but I think this is RadioShack's version of  looking under couch cushions for some spare change, only it's customer  data the bankrupt retailers cashing in and I bet you have no idea it's  even going on.</p><p> Well, it is going on.  Apparently, it is all perfectly legal like  selling mailing list to companies even though RadioShack is on the verge  of no longer even being a company.  Well, Kennedy is worried RadioShack  is not alone, not a fan of this sort of thing, right?</p><p> KENNEDY \"KENNEDY\" HOST ON FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  Neil, very good to be  here with you today.  RadioShack -- </p><p> CAVUTO:  Why do you sound like you don't mean that?</p><p> KENNEDY:  I so mean that.  You know that I'm -- </p><p> CAVUTO:  Continue.</p><p> KENNEDY:  -- I baked you a ham loaf not long ago out of deep adoration  and affection.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes, so what is this?  Everyone has a list, right?</p><p> KENNEDY:  They do.  Everyone has a list and if you are dumb enough to go  to a store, and give them your address and your email address, and your  phone number and your name because you want to be a part of their gift  club, and the fan club, and everything else.</p><p> That's on you because what do you think they are doing with it.  Do you  think they are just going to luck into a safe?</p><p> CAVUTO:  But when you order stuff online, someone is scarfing that up  information.</p><p> KENNEDY:  Of course, they are.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Not just the company you're -- </p><p> KENNEDY:  No, I mean, that is the price of doing business in an  electronic age.  I get that.  I accept that responsibility as a  consumer.  I am not wild about it.  Whatever -- </p><p> CAVUTO:  So RadioShack, it's selling everything but the kitchen sink,  right?</p><p> KENNEDY:  Do you know why?  My husband pointed this out this weekend  because they were dismantling a RadioShack sign where we live in the  west side of Los Angeles.  He said, of course, they are going out of  business.  It is called RadioShack, what is the last time you bought a  radio?</p><p> CAVUTO:  Internet shack or something.</p><p> KENNEDY:  Well, it's so fashion backward.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You know, it is legal, lawyers tell me, legal what they are  doing, not their cup of tea, but it is legal.  But you -- </p><p> KENNEDY:  Attorneys general in Texas and Tennessee actually disagree  with that because in Texas, it violates some of the privacy laws there.   So it will be up to -- </p><p> CAVUTO:  So companies that sells these as back and forth, they can't do  that.</p><p> KENNEDY:  And depending on the state, and that is what a republic is,  that is fine 92.  If you want to live in a state of Texas -- </p><p> CAVUTO:  That is us.  There you go.</p><p> KENNEDY:  Indeed, you are a 100 percent correct as per usual, Neil  Cavuto.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Thank you very much.  So, I think RadioShack will do it someone  will buy the list, and I don't know who because it is a dwindling list,  some of the names go back to 1980s.  I thought many of them are dead.</p><p> KENNEDY:  Yes, and some of those people don't even have a 19 in front of  their birth year if you know what I'm saying.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Is that right?</p><p> KENNEDY:  Yes, they've done a lot of civil war era.</p><p> CAVUTO:  I think we have all their Social Security cards.  I mean, that  was a big -- yes.</p><p> KENNEDY:  AT&amp;T actually has a vested interest in this because they have  done some brand sharing and partnering with RadioShack trying to sell  their devices and they might be we are owed that list by virtue of our  co-investment and co-branding together.</p><p> CAVUTO:  But as an update, how do you advice -- you are big on this sort  of stuff, word -- either on internet, limit what you share, right?</p><p> KENNEDY:  I think you should limit what you share.  I think you should  have one e-mail address for all of your online purchases.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Wouldn't that have saved Hillary Clinton a lot of trouble?</p><p> KENNEDY:  And then you should get your own server and have someone named  Huma be your wolf dog.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Isn't that great that she has her own server?</p><p> KENNEDY:  It's very luxurious.  It used to be a 300 foot luxury yachts,  and those are just for Russian billionaires that's very boring, so 2004,  but your own server, like Martha Stewart used to have her own brand.   But she doesn't even have her own server.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You have a server?</p><p> KENNEDY:  Yes, exactly.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Kennedy, thank you very much.</p><p> KENNEDY:  You got served, Neil.  I like you.</p><p> CAVUTO:  She is on fire.  All right, the taxes you leave your heirs will  have you wants to save them will trouble, you might want to hear this  next Republican out.  He is the only one in the Senate not running for  president.  John Thune is going to tell you how he is on a mission from  God.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, raising death tax very much alive and well.  To the  Republican senator who wants to kill off the estate tax itself before,  well, any Democrats including the president get any more bright ideas  about hiking it.</p><p> South Dakota Senator John Thune joins us with something called the Death  Tax Repeal Act of 2015.  Senator, always good to see you.  What is this  about?</p><p> SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD), SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE MEMBER:  Great to be  with you, Neil.  Thank you.  Well, look, we think that the death tax is  punitive.  The farmers and ranchers and small business people, family  businesses and operations.  You want to pass it on to next generation.</p><p> The Congressional Budget Office in 2009 said a third of businesses who  owe the death tax owe more in taxes than what their assets are worth.   So, what typically happens is they have to liquidate the business in  order to pay IRS.</p><p> It is a tax that is inefficient and it hurts.  It hurts jobs and the  economy in this country, and we think it is time for it to go.  And so  we have a bill that would repeal it and end the death tax once and for  all.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Now what kind of support do you have?</p><p> THUNE:  Well, we have, we got good support obviously among Republicans.   We have been reaching out to some Democrats.  There are some Democrats  in the past, who have expressed support for getting rid of the death  tax.</p><p> We hope that they will there be some bipartisan support in Congress.   Kevin Brady is introducing the bill in the House of Representatives.  We  are going to hold a news conference tomorrow to talk about why it's  important that Congress take the steps that are necessary to do away  with this very burdensome, very punitive tax.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You know, the administration, I am sure you are aware of this,  Senator, comes out and says I don't know what Thune is arguing about.   The fact of the matter is very few pay this tax because very few really  fit the criteria or the means by which to have to pay it.  What do you  say?  I think they say it's closer to 2 percent at that?</p><p> THUNE:  Right, well, if you look at run-up, Neil, in land values in  state like South Dakota over past decade, we have seen land value  increase to point now that about a third of the farms in South Dakota  are actually over the exemption amount.</p><p> So they would be liable to pay the tax.  This is a very big issue in  farm and ranch country where people are land rich and cash poor, but it  also hits a lot of small businesses in this country.  Douglas  (inaudible) did a study here recently that suggested that ending the  death tax would add a million and a half jobs to our economy.</p><p> So, we think it is about jobs.  It is about growth and you think about  how much money people spend to avoid the taxes well, and you know, this  isn't something that in our economy we really don't need.</p><p> We want to encourage people to pass that family farm or business on to  the next generation and getting rid of the death tax would help make  that possible.</p><p> CAVUTO:  As of right now, Senator, you are one of only Republican  senators presently not planning to run for president that I know of.  So  I wonder when you hear and out of your colleagues this idea for  simplified tax code and some of these other stuff, they seemed to be  very unified.  The approach is different.  Will that be a Republican  rallying cry in 2016 because we're a long way from anything that  approaches a simpler tax code?</p><p> THUNE:  I agree, and it should be a rallying cry.  The tax code is way  too complicated.  It is way too costly to comply with.  If we could  broaden tax base in this country and lower rates, I think would unleash  a period of economic growth unlike anything we've seen in a long time  and included in that should be getting rid of the death tax.</p><p> You got an administration in Washington right now that very much likes  to raise taxes, take from some people and give it to others, and we just  think that the best way to get growth in the economy is to get the tax  rate down at the lowest level possible.</p><p> There were people who are making decisions based up what's best for a  return as opposed to tax consequences and so, you know, my hope would be  that our candidates in 2016 are out there aggressively talking about  their plans to reform tax code to make it more simple, more fair, and  lower rates, and focus on economic growth.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Senator Thune, always a pleasure.</p><p> THUNE:  Thank you.</p><p> CAVUTO:  If you decide to run or join your other colleagues, just please  let us know, but it's always -- </p><p> THUNE:  You will be first to know, Neil.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  Senator Thune, great seeing you again.  Thank you.</p><p> THUNE:  You too.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, Taylor sure has been swifted, buying up all these porn  sites, the skinny on what this rock star is really doing.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, a Fox Biz alert for you, Taylor Swift is buying up  all the porn, no, not this porn, dot-porn, grabbing, Taylorswift.porn,  what am I thinking?  And Taylorswift.adult before the dirty domains go  up on sale on the public market this summer.</p><p> \"STRANGE INHERITANCE\" star, Jamie Colby, said nothing strange about it,  if she does not do this now, she could facing legal hurdles later.  She  is not alone.  A lot of stars, actresses are trying to do this kind of  thing, why?</p><p> JAMIE COLBY, FBN HOST, \"STRANGE INHERITANCE\":  It happened to me,  someone took my name, and web site, and probably taking Neil Cavuto dot  whatever, except porn would be a profitable proposition.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Although I've run into this myself, but -- </p><p> COLBY:  The things that it takes to be you, Neil.</p><p> CAVUTO:  And you, you know, we know.</p><p> COLBY:  It is becoming more difficult to be me, but it's a hell of a lot  of fun.  I have to tell you that there is no legal case.  As you know,  I'm the illegal smarty pants and almost every state in America.  It is  not illegal to take somebody's name and buy a web site with their name  with the hope of profiting later.</p><p> If you put something on that web site that is disparaging or you make  some profit from having that web site, you got to share the profits and  you might get sued for saying something wrong.</p><p> CAVUTO:  So what if she is taking these sites with her name, and they  are still being used for porn, can they still be used?</p><p> COLBY:  No, not.  Once she buys them she owns them.  She has a  proprietary right to whatever goes on them.</p><p> CAVUTO:  But images of her can pop up on sites where her name is not in  it.</p><p> COLBY:  Well, that she has a right to sue especially if they are used in  disparaging way.</p><p> CAVUTO:  OK, so legally, buying up the names does not shield you from  this type of stuff coming up anyway.</p><p> COLBY:  Well, it is smart of her to buy the name, but I thought question  you were posing was if someone else buys the name with her name, is  there a suit in ex and of itself there isn't.</p><p> I wanted to tell you this could happen to anybody.  I went with Rick  Ritemoth, our weather dude.  He said, you have to come down the street  to the deli.  You are not going to believe it.</p><p> Your face is on an ad for a male healthful product and I said, wait a  minute now, we went over there.  He saw it hanging over the cash  register.  You have to come here, your face on an ad for a male health  product, it was my picture, I seek legal remedy to get it stopped.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Did they take it off the deli wall?</p><p> COLBY:  It is gone.  I do not have it any more.  If Taylor Swift did not  buy the sites, someone else did and they made money, and put something  unflattering of Hershey would have a suit, but who whether or not you  there was a dot-porn.</p><p> CAVUTO:  She is a smart lady as of you, how is the show?</p><p> COLBY:  Great, tonight, if you love \"STRANGE INHERITANCE,\" so many  people do.  If you love animals, a sanctuary that was left with lions,  tigers and bears and that baboon.  I met him personally.  The way to  their heart is through their stomach.</p><p> They are rescues, she inherited them, a beautiful story of survival a  family that wants to continue a great gesture of taking care of the  animal, second one a rancher did not inherit enough land to ranch.  He  found a surprise of his lifetime.  He turned down $5 million for a  dinosaur a species that scientists did not know existed.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Was it a prehistoric?</p><p> COLBY:  Like this, like this.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Are you surprised at the success of the show?</p><p> COLBY:  This is real stuff, this is not reality.  This is real families.</p><p> CAVUTO:  I want to string together your reaction stocks when scary  people, you talk to scary people, it seems, find me a window where is  the door.</p><p> COLBY:  Sometimes my chair rolls back.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Look at the time.</p><p> COLBY:  That is Dr. Keith Ablow does, I see we're ought of time.</p><p> CAVUTO:  It's a great show.</p><p> COLBY:  Thank you.</p><p> CAVUTO:  She made it because -- </p><p> COLBY:  Tonight at 9 p.m. on Fox Business Network.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You got it done.</p><p> COLBY:  But it's a power to prosper and enjoy.</p><p> CAVUTO:  The idea is to not promote.</p><p> COLBY:  Excuse me?</p><p> CAVUTO:  Look at the time.  We'll have more right after this.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  And what's the deal with all of this constant Ted Cruz bashing,  too brash, too young, too extreme?  To a lot of you too much, Dennis in  Ohio, \"May we point out that Hillary, Biden and Dodd, all the Democratic  candidates for president in 2008 told us how inexperienced Obama was,  yet they got behind him, when they saw an opportunity to gain power.\"   Such is politics.</p><p> Jim emails \"Day one of Cruz and the Democrats already spewing hate and  lies.  And the GOP still have 12 more presidential candidates to come  out.\"</p><p> Al emails, \"There is no doubt that Cruz is a very bright guy, but I  don't see him as having charisma to beat Hillary.  He is just not that  likable.  In addition, I saw his stand on repealing Obamacare, as less  than heroic.  He knew he was fighting a losing battle yet he was willing  to fight until he was the last Republican left standing.\"</p><p> Well, Al, I just say hear him out because he will be part of a very  vibrant mix of candidates and ideas that will stimulate and who will  stimulate the debate.</p><p> Russ and Cathy email, \"Hi, Neil, unfortunately, I think you are correct.   What a fabulous Cabinet it would be if the Republicans became a team  instead of having the blood-letting even if they just played, \"Rock,  paper, scissors.\"  We would have a great president.</p><p> Then Mitt Romney insist that it might be a crowded field, but by  convention time, it will be down to one nominee.  I disagree.  We will  not have a nominee by convention time, and that is when Republican seek  him out, as maybe a consensus candidate.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  There are a lot of those guys were bummed out when you said you  were not going to run.  So I'm wondering now, you say never?</p><p> MITT ROMNEY, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  This is not going to  happen, I'm sorry, Neil.</p><p> CAVUTO:  That is never, never.</p><p> ROMNEY:  It's not going to happen.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  I don't know, never, never sounds like maybe to me.  Stacy  emails, \"I just watched your interview with Mr. Romney, it was good, I  sure wish he would have made it into office.\"</p><p> Tony in Vermont, \"My comment on your Facebook post about Mitt Romney had  600 likes, in first 30 minutes, did I just go viral?\"  No, you are just  hitching along for ride.</p><p> Meanwhile, Henry via centurylink.net, \"Neil, for a long time, several  times, I have written you about criticism about your constant  interruptions and also your stupid laugh.</p><p> Today, your interview with Governor Mitt Romney was the latest in your  annoying actions.  So I have designated you as the newest on my list of  men a carried for a long time as the least admirable three men in the  world, the title you are now on is jerk.\"</p><p> Well, at least, you didn't call me fat.  By the way, you got to tell me,  who are other two?  Buffalo businessman, Karl Paladino weighing in on  2016 and Mitt Romney.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARL PALADINO (R), FORMER NEW YORK GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE:  We need a  guy who can create jobs that understands means of creating jobs does not  side with 1 percent against the 99 percent.  The Republican base, that  is there, many of them did not come out for Romney, they done vote.   That hurt him.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Tommy in North Carolina, not a fan of Carl's, \"Alan Grayson is  a very good businessman.  That does not mean he is sane.  Grayson,  Donald Trump, and Carl Paladino should form a club.\"  That would be a  wealthy club.</p><p> Russ emails, \"Good to see Paladino back.  Good ideas as always.\"   Finally, this from Jim, \"Neil, I see on the news that Hillary has a new  e-mail account.  Since she isn't using the old one, can we see the  server?\"</p><p> You know, well, I guess, she is not using it.  Thanks for watching.   \"STRANGE INHERITANCE\" right now.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

I'm <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto. </nameText></person>Glad to have you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And who knew Google has its own fast pass to the White House? I'm talking very fast, fast pass and apparently, one that never expires. You should be so lucky with yours at Disney because Google employees get on a lot of rides at this White House park -- try 230 of them since the president first took office.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, that roughly (INAUDIBLE) about one a week and apparently, they weren't all going for the ride. Many of these meetings came as the government was wrapping up its antitrust investigation into Google. So awkward.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, I don't know. But here's what I do know. The Federal Trade Commission eventually closed that investigation. Google agreed to make some voluntary changes to its business practices. But you needn't Google the term \"quid pro quo\" to know something doesn't smell right because I don't know about you but this kind of stuff doesn't happen to us. Taxpayers don't get these kind of breaks or fast passes. In fact, for most businesses, it is far more common to be shut out of the White House than ever get so much as a kind word from the White House.</p><p>But again, that is just me.</p><p>Steve Moore wants to shut this ride down. But Basil Smikle says it is (INAUDIBLE), I should say it's not such a bad ride.</p><p>You don't like the sound of any of it?</p><p>STEVE MOORE, HERITAGE CHIEF ECONOMIST: I'm old enough to remember when Google and Apple and Microsoft and Netflix didn't even have lobbying operations in Washington, you know? And the high tech community in Silicon Valley just said, \"Leave us alone. We'll do our thing and you do your thing.\" And now, they have these massive lobbying operations in Washington. And it's basically the Google administration right now. I mean, they (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: But they're not alone, I guess, because their sheer size, the - - it looks a little more obvious.</p><p>BASIL SMIKLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I think to your point exactly, tech -- the government and our legislature always lags behind technology. And right now, these companies are sort of ruling the world. It's not surprising.</p><p>MOORE: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: So why wasn't he meeting with these Google guys before the launch of the Affordable Care Act (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>SMIKLE: Well, it's not surprising that he's meeting with them now. Look at all (INAUDIBLE) that we've been talking about in the last year. We talked about.</p><p>CAVUTO: The sheer number of meetings, (INAUDIBLE), come on.</p><p>SMIKLE: .we've talked about -- we've talked about immigration and they're certainly going to lobby for high school workers.</p><p>CAVUTO: One a week.</p><p>SMIKLE: We talked about net neutrality. That's going to be a key issue.</p><p>CAVUTO: I know, I know. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SMIKLE: The problem is -- the point is that they have a lot of stuff to talk about and (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MOORE: They have. (INAUDIBLE) problem.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>SMIKLE: I don't begrudge them but using their resources in trying to push (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MOORE: The interesting thing about the net neutrality issue is that Google was on the side of net neutrality at the beginning and then -- then saw the government got their fangs.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, it evolved. They evolved as they've been getting bigger. (INAUDIBLE). If George Bush were doing this with defense contractors every week, you would be -- flip a gasket, as would I.</p><p>SMIKLE: I probably would but I would -- instead of pointing to George Bush, I'd point to Ronald Reagan. Think about the coziness that he had with some of the media companies 'cause they -- he actually sparked a lot of this sort of consolidation in media under his watch. You had more companies than ever before in history and the mergers and acquisitions. So that's (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: I think it's fair to say during that time though, he did not have a cozy relationship with the media. They were blistering him every day.</p><p>SMIKLE: But he did with big business and we forgave him that or others forgave him that. So.</p><p>CAVUTO: Not the Washington Post.</p><p>MOORE: This is the most (INAUDIBLE) situation of all though. You have big - $4 trillion government and you have these massive companies like Google -- I think Google's the biggest company in the world right now in terms of revenues -- and you put them together and bad things happen. We want big government and big business to stay on top.</p><p>CAVUTO: See, but I agree, Basil, but I think it's fine for a CEO -- CEOs -- to meet at the White House. I think he gets a little problematic when it turns into like \"Skip the pass, you can just walk in through the front gate.\"</p><p>SMIKLE: Well, I don't know if it was that -- if they had that kind of access. But the reality.</p><p>CAVUTO: It all comes back to bite you. Remember what happened to JPMorgan Chase. Jamie Dimon could just waltz into the Oval Office anytime he wanted. As soon as he started getting attacked critical, not only did they take the fast pass away, before you know it, the firm was facing billions of dollars (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SMIKLE: So are you saying that the Bush administration shouldn't have allowed him in as much as they should've?</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm saying not every week. That's what I'm saying. I just think that that gets a little weird.</p><p>SMIKLE: Well, I think as businesses grow, as industries go, I would imagine that this occurred with the auto industry at some point -- that as they become such huge (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: Talk to others. Talk to others. Talk to others.</p><p>SMIKLE: When they have such a huge role in our business, in our industry, they're going to be meeting with government officials (INAUDIBLE) all the time.</p><p>CAVUTO: But it's the same thing I said at this president (INAUDIBLE) meeting with the likes of Al Sharpton (INAUDIBLE) the racial issue -- meet with other representatives from points of view. But be fair and balanced. He is now choosing \"I'm going to be fair if I focus on Google, I focus on Apple, and I kind of ignore everyone else.\"</p><p>SMIKLE: But who else is driving our conversations about technology (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, those guys will never get the chance. Those guys will never get the chance.</p><p>MOORE: There are thousands and thousands of small businesses in the technology industry, by the way, biting at the heels of Google and I guarantee you, most of them do not have a lobbyist. I'm sure they don't have a (INAUDIBLE). But that's -- I have a little bit take on this thing. You, Neil. I mean, I just think when the government tries to regulate the high tech industry, as you said, you put it very well. There are three generations behind where this industry is at.</p><p>CAVUTO: But what did I say about regulating technology? I didn't (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MOORE: No, no. I just -- I just mean -- I think the problem.</p><p>CAVUTO: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MOORE: .of course, Google's going to have all these lobbyists because the government is sticking its fingers in everything that they do.</p><p>SMIKLE: But I agree the small businesses should have a role at the table.</p><p>MOORE: No. No, no. That's not my point.</p><p>SMIKLE: I know but I do (INAUDIBLE) -- I do think -- I do think that small businesses (INAUDIBLE) -- should have -- should have (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MOORE: The government -- there's too many of them. There are millions of small businesses. There's not enough Lincoln Bedrooms.</p><p>CAVUTO: He makes more sense than you do. That's scary, right there.</p><p>SMIKLE: That's scary, wow.</p><p>CAVUTO: Guys, seriously, thank you both very, very much.</p><p>In the meantime, no wonder so many want to (INAUDIBLE) Google. With connections like those, who wouldn't?</p><p>Now, add Ruth Porat onto that growing list of eager Google recruits. But Ms. Porat isn't just any recruit, is she? She's the chief financial officer of investment bank Morgan Stanley, one of the most powerful women -- actually, one of the most powerful anyone on Wall Street. And now, she's going to become CFO of Google.</p><p>Add her to a growing list of Wall Streeters going to tech including a top Goldman strategist to Twitter or -- continuing with this revolving door thing -- former Obama advisor David Plouffe to Uber and Jay Carney to Amazon.</p><p>Forget what this means to tech. What does this mean to what's left of Wall Street?</p><p>Scott Martin says not much but given the way the White House, he says, has been bashing Wall Street, not much we can do to stop it.</p><p>The allure, I think, for a lot of them is technology's cool, there's actually even more money in it which is hard to believe because you're sinfully rich enough but what's going on here?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, UNITED ADVISORS CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST: Sinfully rich. Yes, that's why I describe myself on Twitter--. Neil, it's tough. I mean, the dreaded brain drain in the financial industry is upon us. I mean, the financial industry, the markets couldn't even keep around a nice lady like Veronica Vain -- look her up -- sports fans being interesting because the allure is not there anymore, Neil. Really, I mean, it is the technology sector. It is all these cool things that are going on outside of this once-big structural firm that was Wall Street, that where all the banks are (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: I think it's money, Scott. I really do think it's money because as much as the financial industry pays, it's chump change in comparison to the stake you take when a technology company does well, goes well, between options and advances and stock, I mean you become a gazilionaire a lot quicker there than you ever could on Wall Street.</p><p>MARTIN: You do. I think Wall Street tough too, Neil, also thanks to the administration, thanks to the financial crisis, has a little bit of an image problem still. In fact, I'd argue that the financial crisis, our financial situation, for a lot of thee banks is not near what it was before the crisis. So you have the perception on both Main Street and some of the certainly people in D.C. that say, \"You know what? The banks are still doing things wrong and to your point about the financials of them, Dodd-Frank, (INAUDIBLE) regulations, all things that are out there now -- Elizabeth Warren being a big party in the Democrats' side of.</p><p>CAVUTO: No, I think the bloom is off the rose. You're absolutely right on that as you are in these issues. And I think the latest telltale sign, college graduates, MBA graduates used to be by overwhelmingly flock to the -- Wall Street. Now, it's half and half and that other half is going to technology.</p><p>MARTIN: And here's the ironic thing, right? Now, the only reason that you probably like your bank or that you can deal with them is because the technology behind it allows you to do what you want to do. But if you work at that bank, if you have that high-paying job on Wall Stree which isn't as high-paying as it once was, that doesn't hold its same mustard as it did, say, five, 10 years ago,.</p><p>CAVUTO: You're right. Scott, you will be the last guy standing and all the money will be yours.</p><p>All right. Scott.</p><p>MARTIN: That's a scary thought. See you later.</p><p>CAVUTO: That is scary. Thank you, my friend.</p><p>In the meantime, Wall Street's not the only one with a Silicon Valley problem. You might have one.</p><p>It's true because Fidelity and other money managers are striking deals with tech startups like Uber and Pinterest who load up your retirement portfolio. And I bet you didn't even know it.</p><p>And what's even scary to Larry Winget is they're doing it in companies that don't have any money or (INAUDIBLE) of making money anytime soon.</p><p>Larry, the argument for this is that, \"Hey, we're spreading our bets. We're giving you a more diversified portfolio. We don't know the percentage that they pour in to these kind of companies but we know they never did before.\" So what do you make of this?</p><p>LARRY WINGET, \"GROW A PAIR\" AUTHOR: Well, I wouldn't find it especially alarming if they're pouring big percentages into it if you're a retiree and you're counting on this to be your retirement fund to live on because it's pure speculation what these tech startups are going to be worth. They value them but that value is not based on publicly-released financial statements. They've never been traded anywhere before. These are privately-held companies. And from a guy like me, it would just be a made-up number. When I look at some of the stuff that's out there -- look at Uber, for instance. In mid-2013, it was supposedly worth $3.5 billion. Now, the valuation is over $40 billion. A thousand percent when the S&amp;P 500 is up 28 percent. How did they come up with a 1,000 percent growth in less than two years? That would bother me.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Well, they could also move on to the government, if that's -- if they don't make (INAUDIBLE). But do you think they shouldn't invest in this (INAUDIBLE), that it shouldn't' be part of any portfolio or do you think when it comes to people and their retirement money -- 'cause a lot (INAUDIBLE), this is multiyear, multi-decade money, that there shouldn't be a little bit of aggressive investment in there anyway.</p><p>WINGET: I have no problem with there being a very small percentage and some of them are saying -- some of the mutual funds are saying you will only be a very small percentage. The good side is if it's very small, you're not going to lose a lot of money. But the bad side is even if they make a lot of money and -- for instance, Uber is worth a thousand times more than it was a couple of years ago, you're probably not going to make a lot of money either. It all comes down to how old you are (INAUDIBLE). If you're 40 years old, you could -= and you have most of your earning years ahead of you, you could afford to be a little more risky. If you're in your 60s, you can't afford that kind of risk. Yes, there's a lot of money to be made but there's always the other side of that -- there's a lot of money to be lost and I don't want any of that money as I approach retirement to be mine when it comes to losing it.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, not everyone can write an incredible bestseller one after the other like you. People have to hedge their beds.</p><p>Larry Winget, thank you very, very much.</p><p>WINGET: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, holy moly. With Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee and Ben Carson likely carving up the Christian vote, are you starting to think that Rick Santorum doesn't have a prayer?</p><p>Rick's here to say \"You don't have a clue.\"</p><p>And you think making cakes is about as far as 3D printers can go? Then this just takes the cake. Now, they're printing construction guys right of their jobs.</p><p>What the Tech?! What do we do when tech turns on us?</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>Well, who needs an architect or construction expert if a 3D printer can spit out what they do and in a fraction of the time. What the tech?! What just happened?</p><p>Up first in the segment that is taking the nation by storm, the storm over these cool 3D printers that came in peace but are now apparently peacefully printing out pink slips for many in the building industry. I warned you, America.</p><p>To tech watcher Shama Hyder on what this is all about.</p><p>Shana, what's going -- what can these printers do that's got so many in the construction industry going nuts?</p><p>SHAMA HYDER, MARKETING ZEN CEO: Well, these printers are pretty cool in a lot of ways because they do have the capability of building an entire building. I mean, they're -- they -- they can -- they're stackable. You -- so if you have a job in the construction industry which involves hitting a nail with a hammer over and over again, you should be scared because chances are, some of the printers are going to take that over. But really, if you're.</p><p>CAVUTO: And do that as well?</p><p>HYDER: They're going to do that but they're really good at repetitive tasks. But when it comes to strategically building something, you still need human minds behind it. So this is the whole (INAUDIBLE) we've been hearing for so long -- is technology replacing humans? No. It's really not.</p><p>CAVUTO: I saw \"2001 Space Odyssey.\" I remember how a certain pod bay door wasn't opened so I know how this ends. Where's this all going?</p><p>HYDER: This has a different ending though.</p><p>CAVUTO: Oh, really?</p><p>HYDER: Yes, it does and I'll tell you -- because technology (INAUDIBLE) can really assist people. I think we'll see homes becoming cheaper in many ways which would -- I mean, I'd appreciate that. That'd be great. But also imagine in.</p><p>CAVUTO: If you had a job to buy the home.</p><p>HYDER: That's right. But imagine in places where it's war-torn or a storm comes through and totally demolishes that community. Having something like this could mean that people have shelter within days, within hours, and that's powerful.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. As long as they don't advance into the TV news business (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>All right. Next up, a workout suit that will intensify your workout. Forget three hours sweating up a storm, they say you put this thing on, 20 minutes, you have the same effect and you're done. Now, if they can get that puppy down to 20 seconds, sign me up. But in the meantime, Shama, how does this thing even work?</p><p>HYDER: So it's pretty neat. It's got electrodes that go on your skin essentially through this body suit which looks just like a normal gym suit, something you might wear to workout. But essentially, it works with the muscles so they work out harder. This really neat (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, how is it -- is it telling you \"You're not working hard enough\", or is it just dragging your hand to the punching bag?</p><p>HYDER: No, you do have to put in the motion. You do have to put in the work, right, but it essentially.</p><p>CAVUTO: Oh, so I actually have to work-out.</p><p>HYDER: You do -- you do -- you do have to get up. You do have to work- out but it amplifies it.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, that's the problem. All right. All right.</p><p>HYDER: Right. So there's no -- there's no magic here but it will amplify the effects you get.</p><p>CAVUTO: In other words, you get a lot more done in a shorter period.</p><p>HYDER: Absolutely. But are you going to see like the normal mom going to do this after dropping the kids off and going to gym? No. But for athletes, for people in the sports industry where every little edge counts, this is going to be huge.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, apparently, I'll have more time on my hands after a 3D printer takes my place. It just might work out.</p><p>Meanwhile, this is incredible because after that airbus crash in the south of France, for rival Boeing, it's an announcement that might be eerily time because the company has now uncovered two black boxes in the French Alps. That is, the company behind this crash. The problem is one is very badly damaged. The other is missing its memory card.</p><p>But what Boeing has come up with might make black boxes themselves obsolete, totally unnecessary. The airplane maker just patented a force field of lasers. What that would do is make a plane impenetrable to missiles or outside forces. So let me be clear here, it wouldn't prevent the kind of crash we saw this week in France but it might have stopped that Malaysian jet from being shotdown over the Ukraine last year.</p><p>So Shama, I guess the only issue here would be the expense for this, right?</p><p>HYDER: Yes. I mean, this is going to be expensive but innovation generally is until it's not, right? But anytime you're talking electromagnetic fields, you're talking about new technology that the U.S. government uses now that can see through concrete walls. And so, this isn't necessarily new technology.</p><p>CAVUTO: And it doesn't interrupt to them -- and that static field doesn't' interrupt with the cockpit controls or any of the device.</p><p>HYDER: And so, I mean, this is all the stuff that they're going to have to work out, obviously. It's very, very early stages but yes. It's good. It's going to be a huge expense but as they -- as they tinker with it, as they play with it, it'll obviously get cheaper and hopefully make the world safer.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes. There was a big push -- I mean -- after this shoot-down that \"Hey, we have to help or retrofit airlines with this sort of technology.\" Now, again, to your point, it depends on the expense. But I kind of think something like this is just a matter of time.</p><p>HYDER: It is. It's absolutely a matter of time. And once they test it out, they'll get better and better with it. There's certain things that'll make technology overall cheaper like battery life. That's something Google's working very hard right now on. If they can figure out a way for batteries to be cheaper, last longer, all of this technology becomes easier, cheaper, faster.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. We'll watch closely, Shama. Thank you very, very much.</p><p>HYDER: My pleasure.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, saints preserve us. We've got a lot of saints in this presidential race. Men of God who have no problem talking about God. Now, four years ago, only Rick Santorum was doing that. Now, a fee other presidential wannabees art harping in. Harp. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>Anyway, think Rick is losing the religious right? Why don't I ask Rick myself? Because he's here and only here, next.</p><p>CAVUTO: Boy, this just boils me.</p><p>Remember when I was chatting with Mitt Romney yesterday about this likely very crowded Republican presidential field? Now, I said it is so crowded, good luck, Republicans, deciding on a nominee by convention time, like they did back with him, back 2012. Come 2016, it's not going to happen. Now, he scoffed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: If there s potion by vote -- primaries -- falling out, you could get to a situation which begs the issue, would you entertain the party coming to you and saying, \"Governor, we're at a draw here.\"</p><p>MITT ROMNEY, (R) 2012 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: First, that's not going to happen. Two, I'm not.</p><p>CAVUTO: It's happened before.</p><p>ROMNEY: Two, I'm not an entertainer. And three, that was a long time ago that happened. Look, we're going to have our nominee and I'm one of those people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, he may say never, never, never. But girls told me that all the time in high school before my mother finally said yes and we went to the prom together.</p><p>Anyway, my point is this -- there are going to be a lot of Republicans vying for this presidential nomination. I'm thinking at least a dozen, probably more. Let's say half of them -- half of them -- stick it out right to the spring. And so many of these primaries (INAUDIBLE) delegates based on your portion of the vote. That means they're all competing for the same number of delegates being portioned out. It gets to be mathematically impossible for any one man or woman to amass the delegates necessary by the time the convention gets to Cleveland.</p><p>So consider just those vying for the evangelical vote. Back in 2008, it was just Mike Huckabee. Four years later, it was pretty much just Rick Santorum. But this time, it'll be Rick and Mike and Ted Cruz and maybe Ben Carson and maybe Marco Rubio making his Roman Catholic claim to Christian conservatives. You get the picture? It's a crowded picture. It's a crowded race.</p><p>To Rick Santorum who joins us on the phone whether he's praying a little bit more these days.</p><p>Senator, what do you think?</p><p>RICK SANTORUM, (R) FMR. PENNSYLVANIA SENATOR (ON THE PHONE): I can always use a few more prayers, Neil. Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well.</p><p>SANTORUM: Look, I don't -- I think that it's way too early. I mean, if you go back to four years ago, there were a whole lot of other people who were considering -- you talk about Rick Santorum being the only person (INAUDIBLE)I think Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain and Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich, there're a whole lot of people who were trying to appeal to those voters that we eventually did very well with. That's -- it's going to be a --it's office competitive. It has been competitive in the past and this thing will winnow itself down. There isn't -- there isn't enough air in the -- in the chamber for 12 or 13 candidates to make it for a few weeks. It will -- it will narrow down in the first few weeks and the first few primaries.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. I know you're a very religious guy but I'm married to math. I am a numbers geek although I try to be decent and the numbers just don't add up. I mean, in other words, just to get to the 1200, 1300 delegates, you're going to need ultimately what the states decide on how much is a portion in each state. It's going to be an uphill climb and if someone stays in, even a significant group through April or May -- which is an (INAUDIBLE) possibility, it gets to be prohibitive. Does that make you think there is a possibility because as you know, Senator, when you're a good historian, this used to be more than norm -- multiple balance and recent history where it's a single ballot - where that could happen again?</p><p>SANTORUM: I think -- it certainly, it could've happened last time and there was -- there was several candidates who (INAUDIBLE) but as you know, if we go back and look at the last time, there were several candidates and it narrowed down after a few weeks. It narrowed down to really two who had a possibility of winning. And that is likely to happen this time also. But if it doesn't happen, as I said last time around, it's not the end of the world. The bottom line is that the primary process -- let it work, let the competition work, and if there is a real division, then we'll go to something that I'm certainly not worried about. I think an interesting -- a convention where we have ideas out there and we have candidates pretty (INAUDIBLE) the different visions for the country in a dynamic way that -- and captivate a nation. I mean, we haven't had a competitive Republican or Democratic primary convention and in a couple of generations. This would be -- I think it would exciting (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, I'm not ready to bet with you. I think it's going to happen. You could very well be in that mix. But enough about me. Back to you and the guest I had on with me talking about you, including Foster Friess -- big friend of yours, big backer of yours. And I raised with him the fact that he also likes some other guys in the Party.</p><p>This is Foster Friess from a few days ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, I know you placed your bets and your support behind Rick Santorum but you also have been seen in the company of Senator Cruz. Were you hedging your bets?</p><p>FOSTER FRIESS, GOP FUNDRAISER: I'm a Rick Santorum guy and I'm just so impressed with our entire field and Ted Cruz is one amazing human being but the challenge that all of us face is how do we get the establishment and the tea party to kiss and make up because if that doesn't happen, we're dead in the water as Republicans.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Senator, is he leaving you?</p><p>SANTORUM: Is he what, Neil? (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: Was he hinting he could drop you?</p><p>SANTORUM: No. I mean, I just talked to Foster today, as a matter of fact. No. No. Foster's a good friend and a great supporter. And by the way, we've got -- we're building a very strong team. I mean, it's really exciting to see so many people who are encouraging us to get into this race. We haven't made any decisions of that yet (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: But he hasn't said anything to you, Senator, where he says, \"I love you dearly, Rick. You're an honorable great man but at the first sign of stumbling, I'm going to leave you in a heartbeat\"?</p><p>SANTORUM: Oh, my goodness. No, I don't know. Foster and I are very, very close personal friends as well as (INAUDIBLE) in all aspects the same. And so -- now I'm not -- that's the last thing I'm concerned about. I -- what I'm concerned about is making sure that and before we enter into this thing that we've got a big, strong team that we can -- we can run the kind of race that's going to be a winning race, not only in the primary but also in the general--. Do what Foster's--. With Foster, I talked about this a lot.</p><p>We have to have a message that's a unifying message. Not just between the Tea Party and the establishment, but you know reaching out, and bridging this country together. I think so many people are sick of the division that is going on in this country and they are looking for someone with a fresh message to bring us together.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we'll watch closely, Senator. It's always a pleasure. Thank you very, very much.</p><p>SANTORUM: Thank you, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Rick Santorum.</p><p>In the meantime, I want you to think quick. <person><nameText>Taylor Swift, </nameText></person>RadioShack, one is buying up porn sites with all of their nasty stuff. The other is selling off anything that is not nailed down, including your personal stuff. Which one is sexy and which one is just sad? We shake it up, you decide.</p><p>CAVUTO: Maybe it's just me, but I think this is RadioShack's version of looking under couch cushions for some spare change, only it's customer data the bankrupt retailers cashing in and I bet you have no idea it's even going on.</p><p>Well, it is going on. Apparently, it is all perfectly legal like selling mailing list to companies even though RadioShack is on the verge of no longer even being a company. Well, Kennedy is worried RadioShack is not alone, not a fan of this sort of thing, right?</p><p>KENNEDY \"KENNEDY\" HOST ON FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Neil, very good to be here with you today. RadioShack --</p><p>CAVUTO: Why do you sound like you don't mean that?</p><p>KENNEDY: I so mean that. You know that I'm --</p><p>CAVUTO: Continue.</p><p>KENNEDY: -- I baked you a ham loaf not long ago out of deep adoration and affection.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, so what is this? Everyone has a list, right?</p><p>KENNEDY: They do. Everyone has a list and if you are dumb enough to go to a store, and give them your address and your email address, and your phone number and your name because you want to be a part of their gift club, and the fan club, and everything else.</p><p>That's on you because what do you think they are doing with it. Do you think they are just going to luck into a safe?</p><p>CAVUTO: But when you order stuff online, someone is scarfing that up information.</p><p>KENNEDY: Of course, they are.</p><p>CAVUTO: Not just the company you're --</p><p>KENNEDY: No, I mean, that is the price of doing business in an electronic age. I get that. I accept that responsibility as a consumer. I am not wild about it. Whatever --</p><p>CAVUTO: So RadioShack, it's selling everything but the kitchen sink, right?</p><p>KENNEDY: Do you know why? My husband pointed this out this weekend because they were dismantling a RadioShack sign where we live in the west side of Los Angeles. He said, of course, they are going out of business. It is called RadioShack, what is the last time you bought a radio?</p><p>CAVUTO: Internet shack or something.</p><p>KENNEDY: Well, it's so fashion backward.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, it is legal, lawyers tell me, legal what they are doing, not their cup of tea, but it is legal. But you --</p><p>KENNEDY: Attorneys general in Texas and Tennessee actually disagree with that because in Texas, it violates some of the privacy laws there. So it will be up to --</p><p>CAVUTO: So companies that sells these as back and forth, they can't do that.</p><p>KENNEDY: And depending on the state, and that is what a republic is, that is fine 92. If you want to live in a state of Texas --</p><p>CAVUTO: That is us. There you go.</p><p>KENNEDY: Indeed, you are a 100 percent correct as per usual, <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto.</nameText></person></p><p>CAVUTO: Thank you very much. So, I think RadioShack will do it someone will buy the list, and I don't know who because it is a dwindling list, some of the names go back to 1980s. I thought many of them are dead.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes, and some of those people don't even have a 19 in front of their birth year if you know what I'm saying.</p><p>CAVUTO: Is that right?</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes, they've done a lot of civil war era.</p><p>CAVUTO: I think we have all their Social Security cards. I mean, that was a big -- yes.</p><p>KENNEDY: AT&amp;T actually has a vested interest in this because they have done some brand sharing and partnering with RadioShack trying to sell their devices and they might be we are owed that list by virtue of our co-investment and co-branding together.</p><p>CAVUTO: But as an update, how do you advice -- you are big on this sort of stuff, word -- either on internet, limit what you share, right?</p><p>KENNEDY: I think you should limit what you share. I think you should have one e-mail address for all of your online purchases.</p><p>CAVUTO: Wouldn't that have saved Hillary Clinton a lot of trouble?</p><p>KENNEDY: And then you should get your own server and have someone named Huma be your wolf dog.</p><p>CAVUTO: Isn't that great that she has her own server?</p><p>KENNEDY: It's very luxurious. It used to be a 300 foot luxury yachts, and those are just for Russian billionaires that's very boring, so 2004, but your own server, like Martha Stewart used to have her own brand. But she doesn't even have her own server.</p><p>CAVUTO: You have a server?</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes, exactly.</p><p>CAVUTO: Kennedy, thank you very much.</p><p>KENNEDY: You got served, Neil. I like you.</p><p>CAVUTO: She is on fire. All right, the taxes you leave your heirs will have you wants to save them will trouble, you might want to hear this next Republican out. He is the only one in the Senate not running for president. John Thune is going to tell you how he is on a mission from God.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, raising death tax very much alive and well. To the Republican senator who wants to kill off the estate tax itself before, well, any Democrats including the president get any more bright ideas about hiking it.</p><p>South Dakota Senator John Thune joins us with something called the Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015. Senator, always good to see you. What is this about?</p><p>SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD), SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE MEMBER: Great to be with you, Neil. Thank you. Well, look, we think that the death tax is punitive. The farmers and ranchers and small business people, family businesses and operations. You want to pass it on to next generation.</p><p>The Congressional Budget Office in 2009 said a third of businesses who owe the death tax owe more in taxes than what their assets are worth. So, what typically happens is they have to liquidate the business in order to pay IRS.</p><p>It is a tax that is inefficient and it hurts. It hurts jobs and the economy in this country, and we think it is time for it to go. And so we have a bill that would repeal it and end the death tax once and for all.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now what kind of support do you have?</p><p>THUNE: Well, we have, we got good support obviously among Republicans. We have been reaching out to some Democrats. There are some Democrats in the past, who have expressed support for getting rid of the death tax.</p><p>We hope that they will there be some bipartisan support in Congress. Kevin Brady is introducing the bill in the House of Representatives. We are going to hold a news conference tomorrow to talk about why it's important that Congress take the steps that are necessary to do away with this very burdensome, very punitive tax.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, the administration, I am sure you are aware of this, Senator, comes out and says I don't know what Thune is arguing about. The fact of the matter is very few pay this tax because very few really fit the criteria or the means by which to have to pay it. What do you say? I think they say it's closer to 2 percent at that?</p><p>THUNE: Right, well, if you look at run-up, Neil, in land values in state like South Dakota over past decade, we have seen land value increase to point now that about a third of the farms in South Dakota are actually over the exemption amount.</p><p>So they would be liable to pay the tax. This is a very big issue in farm and ranch country where people are land rich and cash poor, but it also hits a lot of small businesses in this country. Douglas (inaudible) did a study here recently that suggested that ending the death tax would add a million and a half jobs to our economy.</p><p>So, we think it is about jobs. It is about growth and you think about how much money people spend to avoid the taxes well, and you know, this isn't something that in our economy we really don't need.</p><p>We want to encourage people to pass that family farm or business on to the next generation and getting rid of the death tax would help make that possible.</p><p>CAVUTO: As of right now, Senator, you are one of only Republican senators presently not planning to run for president that I know of. So I wonder when you hear and out of your colleagues this idea for simplified tax code and some of these other stuff, they seemed to be very unified. The approach is different. Will that be a Republican rallying cry in 2016 because we're a long way from anything that approaches a simpler tax code?</p><p>THUNE: I agree, and it should be a rallying cry. The tax code is way too complicated. It is way too costly to comply with. If we could broaden tax base in this country and lower rates, I think would unleash a period of economic growth unlike anything we've seen in a long time and included in that should be getting rid of the death tax.</p><p>You got an administration in Washington right now that very much likes to raise taxes, take from some people and give it to others, and we just think that the best way to get growth in the economy is to get the tax rate down at the lowest level possible.</p><p>There were people who are making decisions based up what's best for a return as opposed to tax consequences and so, you know, my hope would be that our candidates in 2016 are out there aggressively talking about their plans to reform tax code to make it more simple, more fair, and lower rates, and focus on economic growth.</p><p>CAVUTO: <person><nameText>Senator Thune, </nameText></person>always a pleasure.</p><p>THUNE: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: If you decide to run or join your other colleagues, just please let us know, but it's always --</p><p>THUNE: You will be first to know, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. <person><nameText>Senator Thune, </nameText></person>great seeing you again. Thank you.</p><p>THUNE: You too.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, Taylor sure has been swifted, buying up all these porn sites, the skinny on what this rock star is really doing.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, a Fox Biz alert for you, <person><nameText>Taylor Swift </nameText></person>is buying up all the porn, no, not this porn, dot-porn, grabbing, Taylorswift.porn, what am I thinking? And Taylorswift.adult before the dirty domains go up on sale on the public market this summer.</p><p>\"STRANGE INHERITANCE\" star, Jamie Colby, said nothing strange about it, if she does not do this now, she could facing legal hurdles later. She is not alone. A lot of stars, actresses are trying to do this kind of thing, why?</p><p>JAMIE COLBY, FBN HOST, \"STRANGE INHERITANCE\": It happened to me, someone took my name, and web site, and probably taking <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto </nameText></person>dot whatever, except porn would be a profitable proposition.</p><p>CAVUTO: Although I've run into this myself, but --</p><p>COLBY: The things that it takes to be you, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: And you, you know, we know.</p><p>COLBY: It is becoming more difficult to be me, but it's a hell of a lot of fun. I have to tell you that there is no legal case. As you know, I'm the illegal smarty pants and almost every state in America. It is not illegal to take somebody's name and buy a web site with their name with the hope of profiting later.</p><p>If you put something on that web site that is disparaging or you make some profit from having that web site, you got to share the profits and you might get sued for saying something wrong.</p><p>CAVUTO: So what if she is taking these sites with her name, and they are still being used for porn, can they still be used?</p><p>COLBY: No, not. Once she buys them she owns them. She has a proprietary right to whatever goes on them.</p><p>CAVUTO: But images of her can pop up on sites where her name is not in it.</p><p>COLBY: Well, that she has a right to sue especially if they are used in disparaging way.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK, so legally, buying up the names does not shield you from this type of stuff coming up anyway.</p><p>COLBY: Well, it is smart of her to buy the name, but I thought question you were posing was if someone else buys the name with her name, is there a suit in ex and of itself there isn't.</p><p>I wanted to tell you this could happen to anybody. I went with Rick Ritemoth, our weather dude. He said, you have to come down the street to the deli. You are not going to believe it.</p><p>Your face is on an ad for a male healthful product and I said, wait a minute now, we went over there. He saw it hanging over the cash register. You have to come here, your face on an ad for a male health product, it was my picture, I seek legal remedy to get it stopped.</p><p>CAVUTO: Did they take it off the deli wall?</p><p>COLBY: It is gone. I do not have it any more. If <person><nameText>Taylor Swift </nameText></person>did not buy the sites, someone else did and they made money, and put something unflattering of Hershey would have a suit, but who whether or not you there was a dot-porn.</p><p>CAVUTO: She is a smart lady as of you, how is the show?</p><p>COLBY: Great, tonight, if you love \"STRANGE INHERITANCE,\" so many people do. If you love animals, a sanctuary that was left with lions, tigers and bears and that baboon. I met him personally. The way to their heart is through their stomach.</p><p>They are rescues, she inherited them, a beautiful story of survival a family that wants to continue a great gesture of taking care of the animal, second one a rancher did not inherit enough land to ranch. He found a surprise of his lifetime. He turned down $5 million for a dinosaur a species that scientists did not know existed.</p><p>CAVUTO: Was it a prehistoric?</p><p>COLBY: Like this, like this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Are you surprised at the success of the show?</p><p>COLBY: This is real stuff, this is not reality. This is real families.</p><p>CAVUTO: I want to string together your reaction stocks when scary people, you talk to scary people, it seems, find me a window where is the door.</p><p>COLBY: Sometimes my chair rolls back.</p><p>CAVUTO: Look at the time.</p><p>COLBY: That is Dr. Keith Ablow does, I see we're ought of time.</p><p>CAVUTO: It's a great show.</p><p>COLBY: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: She made it because --</p><p>COLBY: Tonight at 9 p.m. on Fox Business Network.</p><p>CAVUTO: You got it done.</p><p>COLBY: But it's a power to prosper and enjoy.</p><p>CAVUTO: The idea is to not promote.</p><p>COLBY: Excuse me?</p><p>CAVUTO: Look at the time. We'll have more right after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: And what's the deal with all of this constant Ted Cruz bashing, too brash, too young, too extreme? To a lot of you too much, Dennis in Ohio, \"May we point out that Hillary, Biden and Dodd, all the Democratic candidates for president in 2008 told us how inexperienced Obama was, yet they got behind him, when they saw an opportunity to gain power.\" Such is politics.</p><p>Jim emails \"Day one of Cruz and the Democrats already spewing hate and lies. And the GOP still have 12 more presidential candidates to come out.\"</p><p>Al emails, \"There is no doubt that Cruz is a very bright guy, but I don't see him as having charisma to beat Hillary. He is just not that likable. In addition, I saw his stand on repealing Obamacare, as less than heroic. He knew he was fighting a losing battle yet he was willing to fight until he was the last Republican left standing.\"</p><p>Well, Al, I just say hear him out because he will be part of a very vibrant mix of candidates and ideas that will stimulate and who will stimulate the debate.</p><p>Russ and Cathy email, \"Hi, Neil, unfortunately, I think you are correct. What a fabulous Cabinet it would be if the Republicans became a team instead of having the blood-letting even if they just played, \"Rock, paper, scissors.\" We would have a great president.</p><p>Then Mitt Romney insist that it might be a crowded field, but by convention time, it will be down to one nominee. I disagree. We will not have a nominee by convention time, and that is when Republican seek him out, as maybe a consensus candidate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: There are a lot of those guys were bummed out when you said you were not going to run. So I'm wondering now, you say never?</p><p>MITT ROMNEY, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is not going to happen, I'm sorry, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: That is never, never.</p><p>ROMNEY: It's not going to happen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: I don't know, never, never sounds like maybe to me. Stacy emails, \"I just watched your interview with Mr. Romney, it was good, I sure wish he would have made it into office.\"</p><p>Tony in Vermont, \"My comment on your Facebook post about Mitt Romney had 600 likes, in first 30 minutes, did I just go viral?\" No, you are just hitching along for ride.</p><p>Meanwhile, Henry via centurylink.net, \"Neil, for a long time, several times, I have written you about criticism about your constant interruptions and also your stupid laugh.</p><p>Today, your interview with Governor Mitt Romney was the latest in your annoying actions. So I have designated you as the newest on my list of men a carried for a long time as the least admirable three men in the world, the title you are now on is jerk.\"</p><p>Well, at least, you didn't call me fat. By the way, you got to tell me, who are other two? Buffalo businessman, Karl Paladino weighing in on 2016 and Mitt Romney.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARL PALADINO (R), FORMER NEW YORK GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: We need a guy who can create jobs that understands means of creating jobs does not side with 1 percent against the 99 percent. The Republican base, that is there, many of them did not come out for Romney, they done vote. That hurt him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Tommy in North Carolina, not a fan of Carl's, \"Alan Grayson is a very good businessman. That does not mean he is sane. Grayson, Donald Trump, and Carl Paladino should form a club.\" That would be a wealthy club.</p><p>Russ emails, \"Good to see Paladino back. Good ideas as always.\" Finally, this from Jim, \"Neil, I see on the news that Hillary has a new e-mail account. Since she isn't using the old one, can we see the server?\"</p><p>You know, well, I guess, she is not using it. Thanks for watching. \"STRANGE INHERITANCE\" right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAVUTO-2015032501cb223</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAVUTO2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FKV-T6T1-JB20-G202-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">347932</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7511\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CAVUTO</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"03\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>March 25, 2015 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00028J5</classCode><className>RADIOSHACK CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>AAPL (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Google</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Wall Street</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Finance</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Housing</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health &amp;

The deal could put Google in the sights of antitrust authorities. </p><p>While Google\u2019s cash offer represents a 19 per cent premium to Fitbit\u2019s closing price on Thursday, it prices <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/4995d60a-dbd1-495d-b446-3afcb40fad2b\"> Fitbit</url> at little more than half of the $4bn valuation at which it went public four years ago. </p><p>\u201cFitbit has been a true pioneer in the industry and has created terrific products, experiences and a vibrant community of users,\u201d said Rick Osterloh, senior vice-president of devices and services at Google. </p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to working with the incredible talent at Fitbit, and bringing together the best hardware, software and AI to build wearables to help even more people around the world.\u201d</p><p>The deal, which is conditional on shareholder and regulatory approval, will test Fitbit customers\u2019 willingness to hand over their health and fitness data to Google. The two companies on Friday promised that Fitbit users\u2019 data \u201cwill not be used for Google ads\u201d and customers will be able to \u201creview, move or delete their data\u201d. </p><p>Nonetheless, some Fitbit owners may be concerned by the prospect of Google owning intimate information about their weight, sleep and menstrual cycles, as well as their heart rate and daily step count. Often these data are coupled with precise location information, which Fitbit uses to map its users\u2019 workouts, as well as links to social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. </p><p>Google\u2019s move is a bold one, at a time when regulators in the US and Europe are on high alert for anti-competitive behaviour, data concentration and privacy abuses by big tech companies. Some US presidential candidates have threatened to break up tech companies such as Google, Amazon and Facebook or reverse their previous acquisitions. </p><p>David Cicilline, chairman of the antitrust subcommittee in the US House of Representatives, called for antitrust enforcers to investigate the planned merger.</p><p>\u201cGoogle\u2019s proposed acquisition of Fitbit would give the company deep insights into Americans\u2019 most sensitive information\u2014such as their health and location data\u2014threatening to further entrench its market power online,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThis proposed transaction is a major test of antitrust enforcers\u2019 will and ability to enforce the law and halt anti-competitive concentrations of economic power. It deserves an immediate and thorough investigation.\u201d</p><p>Reflecting the heightened risk of intervention, Google has agreed to pay Fitbit a $250m termination fee if it fails to obtain antitrust approval for the deal. </p><p>James Park, co-founder and chief executive of Fitbit, said Google was an \u201cideal partner\u201d. \u201cWith Google\u2019s resources and global platform, Fitbit will be able to accelerate innovation in the wearables category, scale faster and make health even more accessible to everyone,\u201d he said. </p><p>Google\u2019s offer of $7.35 a share for Fitbit compares with its $20 initial public offering price in June 2015. After closing at a high of $47.49 soon after the IPO, Fitbit\u2019s shares have languished during the past two years as it has attempted to refocus its business away from low-cost fitness trackers towards smartwatches amid intensifying competition from Apple\u2019s Watch. </p><p>Google has greatly expanded its hardware portfolio in recent years to include Pixel smartphones, smart speakers, Nest thermostats and security cameras, and various entertainment devices. But it is yet to release its own smartwatch to rival Apple directly. </p><p>Nonetheless, Fitbit appears to duplicate many of Google\u2019s existing software platforms. In 2014 Google launched Android Wear, an operating system for smartwatches that was rebranded to Wear OS last year. It also offers a health tracking service, Google Fit. </p><p>Despite being used in smartwatches made by the likes of Samsung, Huawei and Fossil, Wear OS has failed to gain real traction in the market. Google said it \u201cremains committed to Wear OS\u201d. </p><p>\u201cThis is a pure data play,\u201d said Nilesh Chandra, a partner focused on healthcare strategy at PA Consulting, noting tech companies\u2019 broader push into the health industry. </p><p>The deal, if approved, is expected to close next year. Qatalyst and Fenwick &amp; West advised Fitbit on the transaction. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Additional reporting by Kiran Stacey in Washington</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-f6a710b4fca511e9a35436acbbb0d9b6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XD9-X181-JB77-K2WC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"765\"/><timeReceived>10:13 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 1, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Other discussion points were \"the value exchange in relation to news content\"; \"the presentation of news content\"; \"dispute resolution and enforcement mechanisms\"; \"code administration, review and amendment mechanisms\"; and \"current and potential mechanisms to support the broader news industry\".</p><p>Ms Silva did not offer any of Google's opinions on the subjects. However, the Google Australia boss previously has accused the ACCC of overlooking the clicks from its search engine that it delivers to Australian media groups.</p><p>Media companies have criticised Facebook and Google for not allowing them ways to make money on the platforms so they can fund high-quality content. Mr Miller said the best solution for the industry was for tech companies to enter into arrangements to pay a premium for high-quality journalism.</p><p>\"Australians need a strong media able to support the journalism that informs a nation, holds the powerful to account, scrutinises how our taxes are spent, exposes corruption, campaigns for good causes and justice, gives a voice to the disadvantaged and celebrates our country's successes,\" he said.</p><p>\"The current situation, sadly, is unsustainable - and the government and ACCC have recognised this fact.\"</p><p>Facebook Australia and New Zealand director Mia Garlick said the social media platform was committed to establishing a set of common standards for all news publishers that provided transparency around the distribution of news, protected consumers and encouraged innovation.</p><p>\"While we have concerns with the underlying analysis for this recommended code, we proposed a version that will address the policy concerns about the role algorithms play in the distribution of digital news,\" she said.</p><p>\"The goal here is to foster trust among Australians that news content is treated fairly and avoid distorting the industry by entrenching the market power of one news organisation over another.\"</p><p>Ms Garlick said Facebook would work with the publishers and government on the code and also invest in its publisher partnerships.</p><p>Mr Sims has made clear that a code of conduct between the big tech groups such as Facebook and Google and local media companies was the ACCC's most important recommendation from its 18-month digital platforms inquiry.</p><p>He said there was a clear imbalance of bargaining power between the tech and media companies, which were unavoidable business partners.</p><p>In December, the federal government said if a voluntary code could not be agreed, it would mandate one.</p><p>In October, Facebook launched its Facebook News tab in the US alongside News Corp chief executive and long-time critic Robert Thomson. The new tab has 200 \"trusted\" publishers participating, and some receive between $US1 million ($1.45 million) and $US3 million for sharing news content.</p><p>In August, a week after the ACCC's final report was released, Facebook signed short-term deals with Nine, Seven West Media, Network Ten, Sky News, Junkee Media and Pedestrian TV for exclusive news programming for its video service Facebook Watch. The timing of these announcements has drawn scepticism in the media industry as the tech giants continue to argue against a code.</p><p>However, Google has softened its stance, with vice-president of news Richard Gingras calling it a sensible idea.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc797m1c8x3o7nm8264xb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y69-4621-JD34-V3PN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"934\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The two probes widen the antitrust scrutiny of big tech companies beyond sweeping federal and congressional investigations and enforcement action by European regulators. Nebraska attorney general Doug Peterson, a Republican, said at a press conference held in Washington that 50 attorneys general joining together sends a \"strong message to Google.\" </p><p>California and Alabama are not part of the investigation, although it does include the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Tara Gallegos, a spokeswoman for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, declined to confirm or deny any state investigation and would not comment on the announcement by the other states. Mike Lewis, a spokesman for Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, also said the state's legal team had no comment on the probe. The news conference featured a dozen Republican attorneys general plus the Democratic attorney general of Washington, D.C. Google's parent company, Alphabet, has a market value of more than $820 billion and controls so many facets of the internet that it's fairly impossible to surf the web for long without running into at least one of its services. Google's dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data. Google expects the state authorities will ask the company about past similar investigations in the U.S. and internationally, senior vice president of global affairs Kent Walker wrote in a blog post Friday. Critics often point to Google's 2007 acquisition of online advertising company DoubleClick as pivotal to its advertising dominance. Europe's antitrust regulators slapped Google with a $1.7 billion fine in March for unfairly inserting exclusivity clauses into contracts with advertisers, disadvantaging rivals in the online ad business. One outcome antitrust regulators might explore is forcing Google to spin off search as a separate company, experts say. Regulators also could focus on areas such as Google's popular video site YouTube, an acquisition Google scored in 2006. Joining Paxton, a Republican, in the investigation are the attorneys general of almost all U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Google has long argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. \"Google is one of America's top spenders on research and development, making investments that spur innovation,\" Walker wrote. \"Things that were science fiction a few years ago are now free for everyone - translating any language instantaneously, learning about objects by pointing your phone, getting an answer to pretty much any question you might have.\" But federal and state regulators and policymakers are growing more concerned not just with the company's impact on ordinary internet users, but also on smaller companies striving to compete in Google's markets. \"On the one hand, you could just say, 'well Google is dominant because they're good,'\" said Jen King, the director of privacy at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society. \"But at the same time, it's created an ecosystem where people's whole internet experience is mediated through Google's home page and Google's other products.\" Experts believe the probe could focus on at least one of three areas that have caught regulators' eyes. A good first place to look might be online advertising. Google will control 31.1% of global digital ad dollars in 2019, according to eMarketer estimates, crushing a distant second-place Facebook. And many smaller advertisers have argued that Google has such a stranglehold on the market that it becomes a system of whatever Google says, goes - because the alternative could be not reaching customers. \"There's definitely concern on the part of the advertisers themselves that Google wields way too much power in setting rates and favoring their own services over others,\" King said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN70536704</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1C-9BB1-DYRV-43TB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"694\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

Google is expected to rake in more than $48 billion in U.S. digital ad revenue this year, far outperforming its peers, while capturing 75 per cent of all spending on U.S. search ads, according to eMarketer.</p><p>\"They dominate the buyer side, the seller side, the auction side and the video side with YouTube,\" he said during a news conference alongside officials from 11 states and the District of Columbia.</p><p>Karl Racine, District of Columbia attorney general, center left, speaks as Ken Paxton, Texas attorney general, center right, listens during a news conference outside the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Monday, Sept. 9, 2019.</p><p>Some of those attorneys general appeared to raise additional complaints about Google, ranging from the way the company processes and ranks search results to the extent to which it may not fully protect users' personal information. Their early rebukes raised the stakes for Google, threatening top-to-bottom scrutiny of its sprawling business beyond just ads. Paxton promised the probe would go wherever the facts lead.</p><p>\"There's nothing wrong with being a dominant player when it's done fairly,\" said Sean Reyes, the Republican attorney general of Utah. He said there is a \"presumption\" of innocence in such an investigation but still said there is a \"pervasiveness\" to complaints about Google's business practices.</p><p>Jeff Landry, a Republican from Louisiana, added: \"We're here because there's an absolutely existential threat to our virtual marketplace.\"</p><p>Google declined to comment, pointing to its previous statements saying it will work with state officials.</p><p>The probe marks the latest regulatory headache for Google and the rest of Silicon Valley, which have faced growing criticism - and widening state and federal scrutiny - into whether they've grown too big and powerful, undermining rivals and resulting in costlier or worse service for web users. The Washington Post first reported the states' plans for a Google probe last week.</p><p>For Google, though, the states' investigation comes more than six years after federal watchdogs wrapped up an antitrust investigation into its search and advertising practices and opted against bringing major penalties against the company, including breaking it up. Regulators around the world, meanwhile, have been more skeptical of Google: The European Union has issued the company $9 billion in competition-related fines over the past three years.</p><p>The states' investigation is led by Texas' Paxton and seven other attorneys general, four Democrats and four Republicans in total. Every state except Alabama and California, the home of Silicon Valley, so far has signed onto the bipartisan effort, as have Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. A spokeswoman for California's attorney general did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Huawei faces loss of some Google services after US ban( <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalpost.com/news/world/google-says-services-on-huawei-phone-still-will-function\">https://nationalpost.com/news/world/google-says-services-on-huawei-phone-still-will-function</url> )</p><p>Google tends to push stories for left-leaning readers, study shows( <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalpost.com/news/world/google-tends-to-push-stories-for-left-leaning-readers-study-shows\">https://nationalpost.com/news/world/google-tends-to-push-stories-for-left-leaning-readers-study-shows</url> )</p><p>Lateness of changes to federal election bill behind decision to ban Canadian political advertising, Google says( <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/lateness-of-changes-to-federal-election-bill-behind-decision-to-ban-canadian-political-advertising-google-says\">https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/lateness-of-changes-to-federal-election-bill-behind-decision-to-ban-canadian-political-advertising-google-says</url> )</p><p>Already, state officials have sent official legal demands for documents to the tech giant related to the investigation of online ads, Paxton told reporters.</p><p>Ashley Moody, the Republican attorney general of Florida, said the states' Google probe starts with the company's vast data stores. \"Google monitors our online behavior, and captures data on every one of us as we navigate the internet,\" she said. \"This investigation will initially focus on capture of that information and whether Google embedded itself on every level of the online market [for] ad sales to monopolize this industry.\"</p><p>Leslie Rutledge, a Republican attorney general from Arkansas, described Google as an \"online search engine juggernaut,\" raising her concern that searches for businesses, including doctors, are colored by the way the tech giant's algorithms and advertising systems work.</p><p>\"I want the best advice, from the best doctors - not the doctor, not the clinic who can spend the most on advertising,\" she said.</p><p>The states' investigation arrives as the Department of Justice and FTC also are scrutinizing Big Tech, and DOJ has taken early interest in Google. The agency issued its first legal demand for records at the end of August, according to a securities filing Google made Friday.</p><p>Another group of 11 state attorneys general - led by New York's Letitia James - has begun their own probe against Facebook, exploring whether it violates competition laws and mishandles consumers' personal information.</p><p>Some state leaders said they are working closely with their federal counterparts as these investigations unfold. But Karl Racine, the Democratic attorney general for Washington, D.C., and a participant in both the Facebook and Google probes, said he and his peers wouldn't hesitate to forge ahead if Washington once again opts against taking action against the tech giants.</p><p>\"The state attorneys general, they are an independent bunch, and they can be quite tenacious,\" he said . \"So I'm very confident that this bipartisan group is going to be led by the facts, and not be swayed by any conclusion, that may fall short, if you will, if it's inconsistent with our facts, on the [federal] side.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Google is expected to rake in more than $48 billion in U.S. digital ad revenue this year, far outperforming its peers, while capturing 75 per cent of all spending on U.S. search ads, according to eMarketer.</p><p>\"They dominate the buyer side, the seller side, the auction side and the video side with YouTube,\" he said during a news conference alongside officials from 11 states and the District of Columbia.</p><p>Karl Racine, District of Columbia attorney general, center left, speaks as Ken Paxton, Texas attorney general, center right, listens during a news conference outside the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Monday, Sept. 9, 2019.</p><p>Some of those attorneys general appeared to raise additional complaints about Google, ranging from the way the company processes and ranks search results to the extent to which it may not fully protect users' personal information. Their early rebukes raised the stakes for Google, threatening top-to-bottom scrutiny of its sprawling business beyond just ads. Paxton promised the probe would go wherever the facts lead.</p><p>\"There's nothing wrong with being a dominant player when it's done fairly,\" said Sean Reyes, the Republican attorney general of Utah. He said there is a \"presumption\" of innocence in such an investigation but still said there is a \"pervasiveness\" to complaints about Google's business practices.</p><p>Jeff Landry, a Republican from Louisiana, added: \"We're here because there's an absolutely existential threat to our virtual marketplace.\"</p><p>Google declined to comment, pointing to its previous statements saying it will work with state officials.</p><p>The probe marks the latest regulatory headache for Google and the rest of Silicon Valley, which have faced growing criticism - and widening state and federal scrutiny - into whether they've grown too big and powerful, undermining rivals and resulting in costlier or worse service for web users. The Washington Post first reported the states' plans for a Google probe last week.</p><p>For Google, though, the states' investigation comes more than six years after federal watchdogs wrapped up an antitrust investigation into its search and advertising practices and opted against bringing major penalties against the company, including breaking it up. Regulators around the world, meanwhile, have been more skeptical of Google: The European Union has issued the company $9 billion in competition-related fines over the past three years.</p><p>The states' investigation is led by Texas' Paxton and seven other attorneys general, four Democrats and four Republicans in total. Every state except Alabama and California, the home of Silicon Valley, so far has signed onto the bipartisan effort, as have Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. A spokeswoman for California's attorney general did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Huawei faces loss of some Google services after US ban( <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalpost.com/news/world/google-says-services-on-huawei-phone-still-will-function\">https://nationalpost.com/news/world/google-says-services-on-huawei-phone-still-will-function</url> )</p><p>Google tends to push stories for left-leaning readers, study shows( <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalpost.com/news/world/google-tends-to-push-stories-for-left-leaning-readers-study-shows\">https://nationalpost.com/news/world/google-tends-to-push-stories-for-left-leaning-readers-study-shows</url> )</p><p>Lateness of changes to federal election bill behind decision to ban Canadian political advertising, Google says( <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/lateness-of-changes-to-federal-election-bill-behind-decision-to-ban-canadian-political-advertising-google-says\">https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/lateness-of-changes-to-federal-election-bill-behind-decision-to-ban-canadian-political-advertising-google-says</url> )</p><p>Already, state officials have sent official legal demands for documents to the tech giant related to the investigation of online ads, Paxton told reporters.</p><p>Ashley Moody, the Republican attorney general of Florida, said the states' Google probe starts with the company's vast data stores. \"Google monitors our online behavior, and captures data on every one of us as we navigate the internet,\" she said. \"This investigation will initially focus on capture of that information and whether Google embedded itself on every level of the online market [for] ad sales to monopolize this industry.\"</p><p>Leslie Rutledge, a Republican attorney general from Arkansas, described Google as an \"online search engine juggernaut,\" raising her concern that searches for businesses, including doctors, are colored by the way the tech giant's algorithms and advertising systems work.</p><p>\"I want the best advice, from the best doctors - not the doctor, not the clinic who can spend the most on advertising,\" she said.</p><p>The states' investigation arrives as the Department of Justice and FTC also are scrutinizing Big Tech, and DOJ has taken early interest in Google. The agency issued its first legal demand for records at the end of August, according to a securities filing Google made Friday.</p><p>Another group of 11 state attorneys general - led by New York's Letitia James - has begun their own probe against Facebook, exploring whether it violates competition laws and mishandles consumers' personal information.</p><p>Some state leaders said they are working closely with their federal counterparts as these investigations unfold. But Karl Racine, the Democratic attorney general for Washington, D.C., and a participant in both the Facebook and Google probes, said he and his peers wouldn't hesitate to forge ahead if Washington once again opts against taking action against the tech giants.</p><p>\"The state attorneys general, they are an independent bunch, and they can be quite tenacious,\" he said . \"So I'm very confident that this bipartisan group is going to be led by the facts, and not be swayed by any conclusion, that may fall short, if you will, if it's inconsistent with our facts, on the [federal] side.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Texas leads the group of 30-plus attorneys general, which plans to announce the probe on Sept. 9, the source said. </p><p>Google said that it was cooperating with the state officials. \"We continue to work constructively with regulators, including attorneys general, in answering questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector,\" Google representative Jose Castaneda said. The probe is focused on the intersection of privacy and antitrust, according to the source, who did not elaborate. Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, filed comments along with 42 other state officials in June that urged the Federal Trade Commission to focus on privacy and data collection in investigating potential violations of antitrust law. In the comment, the state officials argued that the big tech firms have so much user data that it is hard for newcomers to compete. Another Texas official, Assistant Attorney General Jeff Mateer, alleged in an FTC hearing in June that Google and other big tech companies were misleading in representing themselves as neutral, citing Google's balking at carrying an ad about \"what it means to be an American, the Texas attorney general's office said in a statement in June. Google eventually relented on the ad, the statement said. The tech giants, among the richest and most powerful companies in the world, are facing increasing antitrust scrutiny from Congress, federal agencies and now state attorneys general. The Justice Department said in July that it was opening a broad investigation of major digital technology firms, focusing on whether they engage in anticompetitive practices. The investigation is believed to be aimed at Google, Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc , and potentially Apple Inc . Separately, the Federal Trade Commission, which also enforces antitrust law, is also probing Amazon and Facebook to determine if they abused their massive market power in retail and social media, respectively. The Washington Post was the first to report the development on Tuesday.

Will regulators view the deal as a relatively small acquisition by Google in terms of valuation, especially when netting out the $565 million in cash on Fitbit's books at the end of the second quarter?

The first key date is at the end of April, when GoogleAustralia usually files its results for calendar 2016. This is the first year for Australia's Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL), also known as the GoogleTax, which came into operation on January 1 last year. The second date is in June, when tax commissioner Chris Jordan has forecast tax assessments totalling $2 billion will be issued to seven global businesses. Almost all of these cases grew out of an international collaboration that Mr Carmody proposed at a meeting of the OECD's Forum on Tax Administration (FTA)inOctober 2013, to targetbig tech companies. </p><p>The collaboration became the model to investigate the Panama Papers files last year. While the tech companies have never been identified, they are believed to include Apple and Google. GoogleAustralia appeared to refer to the tax audit in its 2015 annual report release last April: ''From time to time the company is subject to legal claims or reviews by regulatory authorities in the normal course of business. ''At 31 December 2015, the directors do not believe the status of any of these claims or reviews results in a significant contingent liability.'' In the same report GoogleAustralia noted in response to MAAL: ''Effective 1 January 2016, GoogleAustralia Pty Ltd restructured its business such that it will recognise revenue from the marketing and selling of certain services and products to Australianbased customers.'' While GoogleAustralia reported $502 million in revenue in 2015, this was dwarfedby the $2 billioninGoogle ad sales thatis paid directly to its Singapore arm from Australian customers, on which it pays $5 million Singaporean tax (at least, it was said to be $2 billion two years go but Google's non-US sales are up 30 per cent since then). MAAL targets some of this Singapore income. GoogleAustralia noted: ''Given the preliminary stage of the restructure, we are unable to reliably estimate the financial effect of this chance as at the date of signing the financial report.'' Google's parent company Alphabet Inc has already filed its 2016 annual report and Australia didn't get a mention. In the previous two years it had cited Australian currency changes as affecting the earnings,but notthis year. In summary then, Googleexpects to pay zero on the current tax audit, and when it comes to paying MAAL it doesn't see a significant effect. GoogleAustralia remains a quirky company. From 2010 to 2015 it lifted revenue from $151 million to $502 million, but its pre-tax earnings only rose from a $2 million loss toa$50 million profit. Where has all that revenue gone? The biggest rise in costs has been employee benefits, which rose by $124 million to $235 million in the five years to 2015 - largely from the higher headcount, Googlesays. Of that cost, a quarter was sharebased payments to employees. In return for issuing the performance rightsonAlphabet shares toAustralian employees, GoogleAustralia paid its parent $60 million. ThispaymenttoAlphabetmore than halved its Australian taxable income. In 2015, the world's largest media/ advertising company spent $56 million on ''advertising and promotional expense''. Was that payments to other Googlearms? A spokesman said the $56 million ''related to marketing of Googleservices to Australian customers; it includes a number [of] marketing channels''. How much of the marketing and bonuses and share-based payments related to Googlead revenue that ended up in Singapore is unclear. That seems to be one of the issues with the tax audi</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc6txcm2qy2iagtk3xvo</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N17-HB41-F0J6-J2Y6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"630\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The issue \"goes to the heart of the Internet and how it acts as an extraordinary platform for innovation and fair competition,\" the Googledocument says.</p><p>\"The fight is just beginning and the battle lines are being drawn now that we have the world's top Internet brand taking a side,\" said Kaan Yigit of telecom consultancy Solutions Research Group Inc.</p><p>\"Google's involvement immediately brings a new dimension to this and legitimizes the issue -- it's not just ISPs [such as Bell] versus a number of underfunded consumer groups or independents, but ISPs versus content providers.\"</p><p>Iain Grant, managing director of telecom consultant The Seaboard Group, said Googleentering the fray illustrates a sharp difference of opinion among large tech firms.</p><p>\"Google's entire business model is based on the idea of a boundless Internet. \u2026 They are the ranchers of the 19th-century American West [and] their cows should be free to graze wherever,\" he said.</p><p>By contrast, big tech companies such as Cisco Systems Inc. do not oppose traffic throttling, Mr. Grant said. \"Cisco knows that there are real costs involved in meeting traffic demands.\"</p><p>The throttling issue first landed at the feet of the Canada's telecommunications regulator in April, when a group of independent Internet service providers who run their services on the big networks filed a complaint.</p><p>The dust-up that is now in front of the CRTC is somewhat limited, but it should prompt a wider look at telecommunications laws in Canada, said Alan Sawyer, a media strategist at Two Solitudes Consulting.</p><p>\"A formal net neutrality hearing by the commission is much needed and, if existing laws are not in keeping with the realities of the 21st century, they need to be changed,\" he said.</p><p>\"The reality is that responsible network management may very well, at times, include traffic prioritization,\" Mr. Sawyer said. \"Network capacity is never infinite and like any resource it must be managed -- but it must be managed in a fair and responsible manner that best serves the needs of the majority of consumers.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FPINV-200807090001NTPFP</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FPINV2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4SYD-2RC0-TWD4-11HN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257989</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"557\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 National Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>National Post's Financial Post &amp;

The project will see the search giant offer checking accounts to consumers in the U.S. in conjunction with Citigroup and the Stanford Federal Credit Union. </p><p>A Google spokesman says that the search giant is exploring how to partner with banks and credit unions in the States.The smart checking accounts would be offered via Google Pay[1], and customers at the partner banks would be able to benefit from useful checking insights and budgeting tools. By partnering with the banks, the account holders would be able to keep their money in an FDIC or NCUA-insured account.The Google[2] spokesman noted that the company looked forward to sharing more details in the coming months, and that it has no intention of selling customer data. A Google executive has stated that if the search giant can help people \"do more stuff in a digital way online,\" that it is good for Google and the internet in general.Google is certainly not the first major tech firm to look to step into banking and financial industries. Facebook had several credit card companies and banks on board with Libra before all its partners pulled out[3]. And Apple recently launched its Apple Card, which is a digital-centric credit card that further ties customers into its walled garden. Google plans to brand its checking accounts with the financial institution names, not its own. Google has offered no hard details on how its services will benefit the users, but more is expected closer to launch.At least one U.S. senator is calling for regulations to be put in place for big tech companies entering into new fields. Sen Mark Warner says that he is concerned about the tech firms entering the new fields ahead of regulations being in place because once they enter the new field, it will be \"virtually impossible\" to get them out.

To this point, the search giant has prohibited ads for largely illicit activities such as selling guns, explosives and drugs, and limited those that are sexually explicit or graphic in nature, for example.</p><p>Critics of payday lenders say they hope the move by Google and other tech companies might undercut the business which finds huge numbers of willing customers on the Internet.</p><p>In Canada, anti-poverty group ACORN, which is campaigning against predatory lending, celebrated that the influential tech giant is drawing attention to a problem that plagues mainly low-income Canadians, the Star's Sunny Freeman reports.</p><p>\"Sometimes I think people go to these places just out of desperation so quickly that they don't even think about it and doing it online makes it even easier for people,\" said spokeswoman Donna Borden.</p><p>\"A lot of people that we talk to say 'I should have waited and thought it out.'\"</p><p>However, Borden said she was disappointed that a further Google U.S. ban on ads for loans with an annual interest rate of 36 per cent or higher does not apply in Canada, where high-interest instalment loans, are largely unregulated.</p><p>Banning payday loan ads from Google is an encouraging start in reducing harm to consumers who often fall prey to payday loan companies, usually those who are underbanked, heavily debt-burdened and financially vulnerable, said Jeffrey Schwartz, executive director, Consolidated Credit Counseling Services of Canada.</p><p>\"Payday loans can create a harmful cycle of debt, especially for those who are the most vulnerable in society. This decision will help to protect susceptible consumers online.\"</p><p>The Canadian Payday Loan Association, which represents licensed payday lenders, did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Still, Google's move shows the willingness of big tech companies to weigh in on critical policy issues - and exert their power as the gateways for the internet.

But all too often, borrowers get caught in a vicious cycle where fees quickly mount and annual interest rates can be in the triple-digits.</p><p>In many cases, this debt drama plays out online - and starts with a search query.</p><p>Google itself had previously taken some steps to limit payday loan ads. The decision to ban them outright came, in part, after pressure from a coalition of civil liberties, consumer protection, and privacy groups that reached out to the search giant about the issue late last year.</p><p>To enforce the policy, those seeking to market financial products through Google's sprawling advertising network will be required to disclose the length of the loan and the annual interest rate before they will be allowed to place ads. The same standards will apply to sites that serve as middlemen who connect distressed borrowers to those lenders.</p><p>Google, of course, has also profited from those ads. Although they likely make up only a small fraction of the company's staggering online advertising revenues - which were more than $18 billion (U.S.) in the first quarter of this year - banning them will mean the company is leaving dollars on the table.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2016051238048556</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JRW-9PM1-JBTY-W20R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"844\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"05\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>May 12, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>GOOG (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

But all too often, borrowers get caught in a vicious cycle where fees quickly mount and annual interest rates can be in the triple-digits.</p><p>  Debt drama  </p><p>In many cases, this debt drama plays out online -- and starts with a search query.</p><p>\"You search the internet when you need help -- and as a result you may give search engines some really sensitive information about your finances,\" explained Alvaro Bedoya, the executive director of Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy &amp; Technology. When those desperate searches return targeted ads for payday loans, lenders end up profiting from the weaknesses those people have shared, he said.</p><p>But once a borrower has committed to an online payday loan, they may end up facing unexpected financial risks. According to a recent US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau analysis, half of borrowers who took out online payday loans were later hit with an average of $US185 ($252) worth of bank fees or penalties when a lender submitted automatic repayment requests they couldn't afford.</p><p>The CFPB is working on a proposed rule targeting the industry which it expects to unveil later this spring. The agency is considering rules that would limit the number of times consumers could roll over a loan, capping them at two or three loans total. The rules might also require lenders to verify consumers' income and borrowing history to gauge their ability to pay back the loan. </p><p>Google itself had previously taken some steps to limit payday loan ads. The decision to ban them outright came in part after pressure from a coalition of civil liberties, consumer protection, and privacy groups that reached out to the search giant about the issue late last year.</p><p>  Longstanding concerns  </p><p>The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights was one of those groups. \"This new policy addresses many of the longstanding concerns shared by the entire civil rights community about predatory payday lending,\" Wade Henderson, the group's president and chief executive, said in a statement. \"Low-income people and people of colour have long been targeted by slick advertising and aggressive marketing campaigns to trap consumers into outrageously high interest loans.\"</p><p>To enforce the policy, those seeking to market financial products through Google's sprawling advertising network will be required to disclose the length of the loan and the annual interest rate before they will be allowed to place ads. In addition to the broad payday loan ad ban, Google will not display ads from lenders who charge annual interest rates of 36 per cent or more in the United States. The same standards will apply to sites that serve as middlemen who connect distressed borrowers to those lenders.</p><p>That's important because banning ads for payday loans themselves may not be enough, according to some advocates. \"If you type in a search term that indicates financial distress, most of the ads you'll see will be for websites that are not the payday lenders themselves, but marketing companies who collect leads then auction them off to the lenders,\" said Aaron Rieke, one of the authors of a report on online payday lending advertisements released by consulting firm Upturn last year.</p><p>Google, of course, has also profited from those ads. Although they likely make up only a small fraction of the company's staggering online advertising revenues -- which were more than $US18 billion in the first quarter of this year -- banning them will mean the company is leaving dollars on the table.</p><p>To advocates like Bedoya, that's a good thing.</p><p>\"Google is taking a principled stance here,\" he said. \"Hopefully, it's one that will help set a new standard for search engines.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Washington Post</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1009133364</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JRV-JYB1-DY19-C03M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1089\"/><timeReceived>12:42 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

But the decisions by tech giants Facebook and Google - the two biggest websites on the planet - might have as much impact as any single regulation in restricting access to payday lenders.</p><p>Industry officials, speaking generally of advertising restrictions placed on payday lenders, called the policies \"discriminatory,\" adding that some consumers may need access to the short-term loans if they can't get credit them through a traditional bank.</p><p>\"Facebook and others are making a blanket assessment about the payday lending industry rather than discerning the good actors from the bad actors,\" the Community Financial Services Association of America, a payday lending trade group, said in a statement. \"This is unfair towards those that are legal, licensed lenders.\"</p><p>Millions of low-income Americans use the short-term loans to get cash quickly while planning to repay their balance once they get their next paycheck.

When those desperate searches return targeted ads for payday loans, lenders end up profiting from the weaknesses those people have shared, he said.</p><p>But once a borrower has committed to an online payday loan, they may end up facing unexpected financial risks. According to a recent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau analysis, half of borrowers who took out online payday loans were later hit with an average of $185 worth of bank fees or penalties when a lender submitted automatic repayment requests they couldn't afford.</p><p>And payday loans taken out online can also be more expensive than those borrowed from storefronts. For example, borrowers taking out the average payday loan of $375 would pay a $95 fee online compared with $55 at a store, according to Pew Charitable Trust.</p><p>While the total amount of payday loans taken out each year has declined slightly in recent years, online payday lenders are making up a bigger share of the market. About 40 percent of the roughly $40 billion issued in payday loans in 2015 were taken out online, according to estimates from Jefferies.</p><p>The move could make it more difficult, though not impossible, for online payday lenders to find new customers, said\u00a0John Hecht, an analyst at Jefferies.</p><p>\"Certainly when Google modifies or limits advertising or search results it can have a definite impact on an industry right away,\" Hecht said.

To this point, the search giant has prohibited ads for largely illicit activities such as selling guns, explosives and drugs, and limited those that are sexually explicit or graphic in nature, for example. Critics of payday lenders say they hope the move by Google and other tech companies might undercut the business which finds huge numbers of willing customers on the internet.</p><p>The move also shows the willingness of big tech companies to weigh in on critical policy issues -- and exert their power as the gateways for the internet. Facebook also does not display ads for payday loans. But others, such as Yahoo, still do.</p><p>Consumers will still be able to find payday lenders from a Google search. But the ads that appear on the top and right-hand side of a search results page will not show marketing from the payday lending industry beginning on July 13.</p><p>\"We'll continue to review the effectiveness of this policy, but our hope is that fewer people will be exposed to misleading or harmful products,\" Google global product policy director <url normalizedValue=\"http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com.au/2016/05/an-update-to-our-adwords-policy-on.html?_sm_au_=iVV8ZsWZrbDsVj9Q\">David Graff said in a blog post</url> about the change.</p><p>In Australia, the payday industry and <url normalizedValue=\"/business/consumer-affairs/online-payday-lenders-under-scrutiny-following-nimble-investigation-20160324-gnq3kz#ixzz48P1LxTYA\">online lenders using algorithms to assess consumer creditworthiness have come into the spotligh</url>t following action by the corporate watchdog against payday lender Nimble, which had been forced to refund $1.6 million to more than 7000 customers after it was found to engage in irresponsible lending.<br/><br/> In the US, regulators and a handful of states have been trying to limit the activities of payday lenders by capping how much they can charge consumers in an interest rate. But the decisions by tech giants Facebook and Google - the two biggest websites on the planet - might have as much impact as any single regulation in restricting access to payday lenders.</p><p>Industry officials, speaking generally of advertising restrictions placed on payday lenders, called the policies \"discriminatory,\" adding that some consumers may need access to the short-term loans if they can't get credit through a traditional bank.</p><p>\"Facebook and others are making a blanket assessment about the payday lending industry rather than discerning the good actors from the bad actors,\" the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitpOO849LMAhXGeCYKHR0OAVAQFggdMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcfsaa.com%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNF8ofavkEP8jO2MUxHiwAVnDsbvRw&amp;sig2=ur7By90qiayywPpVLXjiYQ\">Community Financial Services Association of America</url>, a payday lending trade group, said in a statement. \"This is unfair towards those that are legal, licensed lenders.\"</p><p>Millions of low-income earners use the short-term loans to get cash quickly while planning to repay their balance once they get their next paycheck. But all too often, borrowers get caught in a vicious cycle where fees quickly mount and annual interest rates can be in the triple-digits.</p><p>  Debt drama  </p><p>In many cases, this debt drama plays out online -- and starts with a search query.</p><p>\"You search the internet when you need help -- and as a result you may give search engines some really sensitive information about your finances,\" explained Alvaro Bedoya, the executive director of Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy &amp; Technology. When those desperate searches return targeted ads for payday loans, lenders end up profiting from the weaknesses those people have shared, he said.</p><p>But once a borrower has committed to an online payday loan, they may end up facing unexpected financial risks. According to a recent US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau analysis, half of borrowers who took out online payday loans were later hit with an average of $US185 ($252) worth of bank fees or penalties when a lender submitted automatic repayment requests they couldn't afford.</p><p>The CFPB is working on a proposed rule targeting the industry which it expects to unveil later this spring. The agency is considering rules that would limit the number of times consumers could roll over a loan, capping them at two or three loans total. The rules might also require lenders to verify consumers' income and borrowing history to gauge their ability to pay back the loan. </p><p>Google itself had previously taken some steps to limit payday loan ads.

To this point, the search giant has prohibited ads for largely illicit activities such as selling guns, explosives and drugs, and limited those that are sexually explicit or graphic in nature, for example.</p><p>Critics of payday lenders say they hope the move by Google and other tech companies might undercut the business, which finds huge numbers of willing customers on the Internet.</p><p>The move also shows the willingness of big tech companies to weigh in on critical policy issues. Facebook also does not display ads for payday loans. But others, such as Yahoo, still do.</p><p>Consumers will still be able to find payday lenders from a Google search. But the ads that appear on the top and right-hand side of a search results page will not show marketing from the payday lending industry beginning July 13.</p><p>\"We'll continue to review the effectiveness of this policy, but our hope is that fewer people will be exposed to misleading or harmful products,\" Google global product policy director David Graff said in a blog post about the change.</p><p>Washington regulators, as well as a handful of states, have been trying to limit the activities of payday lenders by capping how much they can charge consumers in an interest rate.</p><p>Industry officials, speaking generally of advertising restrictions placed on payday lenders, called the policies \"discriminatory,\" adding that some consumers may need access to the short-term loans if they can't get credit through a traditional bank.</p><p>\"Facebook and others are making a blanket assessment about the payday lending industry rather than discerning the good actors from the bad actors,\" the Community Financial Services Association of America, a payday lending trade group, said in a statement. \"This is unfair towards those that are legal, licensed lenders.\"</p><p>Millions of low-income Americans use the short-term loans to get cash quickly while planning to repay their balance once they get their next paycheck. But all too often, borrowers get caught in a vicious cycle where fees quickly mount and annual interest rates can be in the triple-digits.</p><p>According to a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau analysis, half of borrowers who took out online payday loans were hit with an average of $185 worth of bank fees or penalties when a lender submitted automatic repayment requests they couldn't afford.</p><p>Those seeking to market financial products through Google's advertising network will be required to disclose the length of the loan and the annual interest rate before they will be allowed to place ads. In addition to the broad payday loan ad ban, Google will not display ads from lenders who charge annual interest rates of 36 percent or more in the United States.</p><p>ct16 0018 160512 N S 0000000000 00009449</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: U.S. regulators and some states have been trying to limit payday lenders' activities.
