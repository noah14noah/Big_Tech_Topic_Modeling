I'm Bianca Nobilo. Let's get right to our breaking news. Donald Trump has just thrown fuel on a firestorm of controversy over his racist tweets about four Democratic women of color. Not only is the U.S. president attacking the congresswomen again, but he's also attacking the very ideals of American democracy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Trump just accused the lawmakers, all vocal critics of his government, of hating the United States because, quote, \"All they do is complain.\" He said he's not concerned if people think his tweet was racist. It urges the congresswomen -- all American citizens, three of them born in the United States -- to go back to the, quote, \"broken and crime-infested countries they came from.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's how he put it today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If you're not happy here, then you can leave. As far as I'm concerned, if you hate our country, if you're not happy here, you can leave. And that's what I say all the time. That's what I said in a tweet, which I guess some people think is controversial. A lot of people love it, by the way. A lot of people love it.</p><p>But if you're not happy in the U.S., if you're complaining all the time, very simply, you can leave. You can leave right now. Come back if you want, don't come back. It's OK too. But if you're not happy, you can leave.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO: A handful of Trump's fellow Republicans have criticized his attack on their colleagues. But so far, most of them are remaining silent.</p><p>Let's bring in CNN White House Reporter, Sarah Westwood. We're also joined by Suzanne Malveaux, who's following reaction on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Sarah, let's start with you. It was startling, seeing what the president had to say today. He doubled down. tell us what were the top lines for you?</p><p>SARAH WESTWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, Bianca, sources tell CNN that it was President Trump's decision to go out and address these controversial tweets at an event that was supposed to be showcasing American manufacturing.</p><p>But the president, essentially doubling down on those racist attacks on the four freshman House Democrats, accusing them of hating America, mischaracterizing some past statements -- particularly from Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, falsely claiming, for instance, that she's praised terrorist groups -- to make the argument that, again, as he did in his tweets, if they don't like America, they can leave.</p><p>TEXT: Trump Posts Racist Tweets, says progressive Dems should \"go back\" to the countries they came from: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York, born in New York; Rashida Tlaib, Michigan, born in Detroit; Ilhan Omar, Minnesota, born in Mogadishu, Somalia; Ayanna Pressley, Massachusetts, born in Cincinnati</p><p>WESTWOOD: Now, this comes after the chief of staff for Vice President Mike Pence, earlier today, tried to argue that the president was only referring to Congresswoman Omar, and specifically to statements that Omar has made in the past that critics have characterized as anti-Semitic.</p><p>But President Trump sort of shattered that argument from one of his own senior staffers by also going after Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez from New York for actions she took toward Amazon headquarters, which also had nothing to do with her patriotism.</p><p>The president, sparking a backlash among some Republicans but, again, many on Capitol Hill, staying silent as the president doubles down on those racist attacks despite the wave of criticism -- Bianca.</p><p>NOBILO: Let's go to Capitol Hill now, then, with Suzanne.</p><p>Suzanne, as Sarah was just saying, the response has been predominantly silence. There have been one or two Republicans -- the senator from Pennsylvania and some others -- who have criticized what President Trump said. Talk to us about the mood in Capitol Hill, and what's the perspective on those Republicans and their reaction to this?</p><p>SUZANNE MALVEAUX, CNN U.S. CORRESPONDENT: Sure, Bianca. I mean, it has been very tense here on Capitol Hill, we have basically been canvassing many of the hallways, looking for members of Congress as well as their Twitter feeds, to see how they are responding. Tremendous amount of support from the Democrats, of course, but very little from the Republicans. Radio silence, just a handful of them weighing on this, this morning.</p><p>I had a chance to catch up with Congressman Will Hurd. He represents Texas' 23rd District. It is on the southern border. He is, from time to time, been a critic of the president regarding immigration as well as the child separation policy.</p><p>He is also the only African-American in the House who is a Republican. And so he has a very unique role in the discussion, in the debate over this. He, without question, came out very strong against the president's comments, against his tweets. Here's what he's told me earlier today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. WILL HURD (R-TX): The tweets are racist and xenophobic. They're also inaccurate because the four women he's referring to are folks that have grown -- they are U.S. citizens. It's behavior that's unbecoming of a president of the United States and the leader of the free world. We should be talking about uniting people, not dividing us.</p><p>[14:05:00] And ultimately, politically, it's hurtful. You are having a civil war going on within the Democratic Party, and now they've all encircled the wagons and are protecting one another, right? So that's my thoughts. And unfortunately for someone like me who's the only black Republican in the House of Representatives, this makes it even harder when I go into communities that most Republicans don't show up to. This makes it harder in order to bring our message.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MALVEAUX: Now, Bianca, there were two things that I asked, follow-up questions to the congressman. First of all, whether or not he expects or hopes that his colleagues, Republican colleagues, will speak out about this. He said that he hopes they certainly will, that he expects that they will. But so far, just a handful of people who have acknowledged and said that this is wrong.</p><p>I also asked him if he thought there was additional -- some sort of punishment that could come to the president, or some way that they could express their displeasure here. He did not believe that that was necessary. He said he believed that the president can tweet anything that he wants, but that it does have long-term consequences in terms of the long-term hurt he addressed (ph).</p><p>Speaker Pelosi, however, said that they will be introducing a resolution on the House floor, and that she certainly hopes that the Republicans join the Democrats in condemning the president's remarks.</p><p>And, Bianca, I have to tell you, the Democrats feel very unified over this. They feel that this is a rallying cry. Whereas last week there was some tension, even some conflict between the House speaker, Pelosi, and these four freshman congresswomen. Now they are all on the same page -- Bianca.</p><p>NOBILO: Suzanne Malveaux on Capitol Hill and Sarah Westwood at the White House, thank you both.</p><p>Meanwhile, President Trump says planned raids to round up as many undocumented immigrants as possible got off to a great start on Sunday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The ICE raids were very successful. People came into our country illegally, illegally. Many were felons, many were convicted of crimes. Many, many were taken out on Sunday. You just didn't know about it --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How many?</p><p>TRUMP: -- in fact, I went to -- I spoke to the head of ICE. I spoke to a couple of people. We had many people. It was a very successful day.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO: Agents were to target some 2,000 immigrants under deportation orders in nine cities. But activists say, for the most part, it's been quiet. \"The New York Times\" reports agents opted for a series of smaller- scale arrests over the weekend. The paper says media coverage sent many immigrants into hiding.</p><p>For the latest, let's bring in CNN's Polo Sandoval. He joins us from New York.</p><p>Polo, you spent yesterday in (ph) amongst (ph) some of New York's most vibrant migrant communities. What was the mood there?</p><p>POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, there certainly is this fear, Bianca, right? Among many migrants. For example, we spent some time there in Queens, which is one of the most culturally diverse places on the planet here, speaking to not just migrants, but also some of those who support those migrants.</p><p>They say that they have seen very little to no sign of these kinds of operations. So it's interesting, what we hear from the White House -- President Trump, today, calling these operations successful -- when just a little while ago, we heard from the New York City Mayor's Office of Immigrants Rights, saying that they have no confirmed reports of any ICE encounters.</p><p>It doesn't necessarily mean that they did not happen, of course. Oftentimes, they may not necessarily coordinate -- federal authorities may not necessarily coordinate with local and state authorities. But from what we have heard from some of those here in the city of New York, there have been no obvious raids, no obvious operations here.</p><p>And then when you hear from some of those legal aid assistant centers, they say that a bulk of their phone calls have been more people wanting to know their rights, wanting to really understand what they can and can't do, should ICE come knocking on their door.</p><p>So it's really more those calls, versus people who need immediate legal representation because federal agents are potentially going to deport them at any moment. So that's really what we're seeing, not just here in New York City but in many communities across the country as well.</p><p>NOBILO: Polo, I referenced in the introduction, the fact that \"The New York Times\" is reporting that some of these raids have been scaled back. What do we know about the reasons why that would have happened?</p><p>SANDOVAL: Well, we know that the administration has said that one of the main reasons for that was because that -- some information had leaked to the general public, that obviously there would be a concern for officer safety.</p><p>But let's keep in mind, Bianca, that some of the first public reports of these kinds of operations came straight from the commander in chief when he tweeted to his 62 million followers on social media, that these mass deportations would be happening. That was last month. Fast-forward to today. Now, we're still trying to get a better understanding of the scope of these so-called ICE round-ups here.</p><p>I'll tell you what we should be looking out for, though, in the next couple of days, the next couple of months, really -- or weeks, perhaps. Is exactly who are the people that are listed in those statistics, right? The president today said that these operations were successful, that there were many people who were contacted by federal officers.</p><p>[14:10:02] But now, the main question, were those people -- those criminal undocumented immigrants, those people who have committed felonies, perhaps, that have been prioritized by not just this administration but previous ones, or are they actual family units? Which would indicate that Immigration and Customs Enforcement essentially broadening their scope under the president's direction.</p><p>So that's something we're going to have to see, moving forward. Again, perhaps the next few days, perhaps the next few weeks, when ICE releases some of their stats.</p><p>NOBILO: We know you'll keep an eye on it for us. Polo Sandoval in New York, thank you.</p><p>SANDOVAL: Thanks, Bianca.</p><p>NOBILO: For more on the Trump administration's policy on undocumented immigrants and the uproar over the president's tweets, let's bring in political analyst Anushay Hossain, as well as CNN political commentator and Republican strategist Doug Heye.</p><p>Thank you both for being with us.</p><p>Anushay, let's start with you. The reaction from the Republican Party has obviously been muted. There's been silence, there's been a few who have come out to condemn the president's remarks. Who is he directing these remarks at and why are they resonating?</p><p>ANUSHAY HOSSAIN, POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, they're resonating because Trump isn't the president of every single American or all of America. He's the president of his base. And Trump is deploying an old, you know, playground tactic. \"Go back to your country,\" is something that he says to strong women of color who oppose him.</p><p>And this isn't new news. This is a pattern. This is a -- being racist is a part of the Trump presidency brand, and it's something that is the feature and not a bug of this Trump administration.</p><p>NOBILO: You mentioned -- you mentioned, there, the exact phrasing, the \"Go back where you came from.\" And it's difficult to sort of conceptualize how that resonates with certain people.</p><p>I was talking to my team today -- I'm not born in this country -- and because I look a certain way and sound a certain way, I would never be told to go back home. So that brings us back to the inescapable racial and ethnocultural element to this.</p><p>HOSSAIN: Exactly, exactly.</p><p>NOBILO: How do you think most Americans would react to that?</p><p>HOSSAIN: Well, it -- first of all, the discussion of whether this or not is racist, is not what the discussion should be. It should be, \"Are we going to continue tolerating it?\" Because Donald Trump, to his credit, has -- this is the way he's -- this has been a part of his strategy of his presidency since before he became president. Let's not forget that he entered the political arena with a massive racist strategy, which was questioning where Barack Obama, the first black president in America, was born.</p><p>And also, it's important to remember that saying things like, \"If you don't like how immigrants are being treated here, go back to where you come from,\" has huge racial implications, but also it suggests that America is only meant for white Americans, not anybody else, people of color.</p><p>NOBILO: Doug, let's go to you next. It seems that as long as the president's popularity amongst his base remains fairly stable, that this pattern is likely to continue, the fact that he is happy to wade into issues that are often avoided by other politicians. Do you agree?</p><p>DOUG HEYE, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes, absolutely. And his base -- the base support that he has isn't just broad, it's very intense. So members of Congress, Republican members, when they're back in their states and their districts, they don't just hear their voters saying that they approve of Donald Trump, they hear it loudly and they hear it often, everywhere they go.</p><p>I was talking to a member of Congress last week, who told me they were accosted three times as a supermarket while they were grocery-shopping with their wife, for not supporting the president enough. And this is somebody who's a supporter of the president.</p><p>So this is what they hear all the time. So unfortunately, politically, there's not much motivation for them to speak out. You're hearing a few -- Will Hurd, the only African-American Republican member of Congress, was one of the first people to speak up. You'll hear more. But it won't be broad because the party is in fear of what happens to people who cross Donald Trump.</p><p>NOBILO: And speaking of somebody who did not condemn the president today, Lindsey Graham. Let's take a listen to what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): We all know that AOC and this crowd are a bunch of communists, they hate Israel, they hate our own country, they're calling the guards along our border, the Border Patrol agents, \"concentration camp guards.\" They accuse people who support Israel of doing it \"for the Benjamins.\" They're anti-Semitic, they're anti-America. Don't get to (ph) aim higher? We don't need to know anything about them personally. Talk about their policies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO: Doug, do you think that in the lead-up to 2020, especially with the Democratic race, you're seeing candidates trying to one-up each other in terms of their policy. Do you think that that is -- do you think that's helping the president in a sense, is their moving further and further to left in some of these debates?</p><p>HEYE: Sure. If you talk to folks who are working at the Republican National Committee or the Trump campaign, they would tell you that those two debates that they -- that the Democrats recently had, were great for the Trump administration, were great for the re-election effort.</p><p>[14:15:09] When every member of Congress is raising their hands on things that are very divisive issues or calling for private health care insurance to be eliminated, that's what Donald Trump wants to be talking about. And it sets up the comparison that would be very favorable for him. He has a very tough re-elect. It's a very narrow path. But what I saw at the previous two debates, makes that path easier for him.</p><p>NOBILO: Anushay, it seems that because politicians, whether in the United Kingdom, where I am, or in the United States, discussing the issue of migration and how to best handle it, is sensitive. And it can be uncomfortable for a lot of politicians in the center, so they do tend to avoid it.</p><p>Now, of course, that presents lots of fertile ground for President Trump and some of his allies, to capitalize on that. Do you think that's an issue, the fact that there isn't much reasoned moderate evidence-based debate when it comes to migration because it isn't a topic that politicians feel that they can wade into without inflaming passions on both sides?</p><p>HOSSAIN: I think that's giving them way too much credit. And, you know, the Lindsey Graham segment that we just saw, I mean, he probably got his talking points straight from the president's mouth.</p><p>Things are so polarized here now, Bianca. They're more polarized than they've ever been in America, and especially over issues such as immigration and race. So I think it's really important to remember that we can't see these as just isolated incidents, we have to see them in the large political strategy of the Trump presidency.</p><p>And now, naturally, an extension of his re-election strategy. We have to see this, the attack on these women of color, U.S. lawmakers, U.S. congresswomen, OK? Who were born in America, I think, all except for Ilhan Omar, who became, you know, a citizen here when she was 17.</p><p>We have to see this, coupled with the raids on immigration communities, with the children in cages, with the women and children who are dying in U.S. detention centers, with the men who were rounded up, not being allowed to shower. I mean, it goes on and on. Children in the same diapers for months.</p><p>I mean, this is a larger part and strategy to dehumanize people of color and immigrants. And you know what, Donald Trump has to count on his base to show up at the voting polls. That is a key part of him coming back and returning to staying in the White House. And so he's flaming the fans of the race card, starting from now. Because he knows that's what he has to rely on.</p><p>NOBILO: It's a very important point on the context there, that this is all developing in. Thank you both, Anushay Hossain and Doug Heye. Appreciate it. Thank you.</p><p>HEYE: Thank you.</p><p>NOBILO: Still to come tonight, it was the stuff of dreams for sports fans. We'll discuss a day of sport here in London that had millions on the edge of their seats as two colossal finals made history.</p><p>It's the world's second-largest economy and its growth has slowed to its lowest level since the early '90s. We'll examine what China's latest GDP figures mean for the world.</p><p>[14:20:18] NOBILO: Welcome back. Sometimes, we need a break from stories of tragedy, conflict and political turmoil, which so often dominate the news agenda. And you can sometimes rely on sport to provide that very relief.</p><p>Sunday saw a day of sport that defied the expectations of even the most ardent fans. And London was certainly the place to be on Sunday, playing host to two record-breaking finals playing out simultaneously.</p><p>While Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, two of the greatest tennis players ever to play, battled it out in the longest Wimbledon singles final in history, across the city, England and New Zealand's cricketers produced a once-in-a-lifetime Cricket World Cup Final. The England won by the narrowest of margins.</p><p>It's all anyone can talk about today, and our team is covering both incredible stories from here in London. Christina MacFarlane is at the most famous club in tennis where that epic final took place. But first, Alex Thomas is at The Oval cricket ground, where England have been celebrating that hard-to-believe victory.</p><p>ALEX THOMAS, CNN WORLD SPORTS: Well, Bianca, they used to say cricket's boring. Not on Sunday, when England and New Zealand produced such a spectacular game of cricket, it's been called the greatest match of all time.</p><p>And in fact, one British broadcaster said it attracted more website traffic then even the last general election in this country. So no wonder the victorious England cricket team have been invited to 10 Downing Street to meet the British prime minister. That hasn't happened since their Ashes success over Australia back in 2005.</p><p>Whereas New Zealand, the losers, also had their prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, chip in, joking that it was a traumatic event for the country after a real nail-biter left England as men's Cricket World Cup winners for the first time in their history, 44 years after this event started.</p><p>That happened at Lord's across London. We're here at The Oval, where 6.5 weeks ago, England started their campaign by beating South Africa. And earlier on Monday, a day after their victory over New Zealand, they had friends and family and hundreds of school kids here, cheering them on and joining in the celebrations as they paraded the World Cup trophy around.</p><p>It was an extraordinary sporting Sunday because while that finale was happening at Lord's in northwest London, across town, something equally extraordinary was also taking place.</p><p>CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CNN WORLD SPORT: At the very point the Cricket World Cup was reaching its climax, so, too, was the men's final here at Wimbledon. After four hours and 57 minutes -- the longest men's final in history -- one mishit from Federer at 12-12, deep into the tiebreak fifth set, not only sealed the match for Novak Djokovic, but could also become a defining moment for the future of men's tennis.</p><p>With this fifth win at the All England Club and his 16th Grand Slam overall, Djokovic now moves within four slams of Roger Federer's Grand Slam record, for the first time with Rafael Nadal sandwiched right in the middle on 18.</p><p>Federer may have missed his chance to become the oldest Grand Slam champion on Sunday, but he proved that at almost 38 years of age, he is still able to compete for the biggest titles in the game. And with just six weeks to go until the U.S. Open, we could well see these two rivals face off again in New York, where Djokovic will be the favorite to seal his third major title this year. Back to you, Bianca.</p><p>NOBILO: Thanks to Christina and Alex there.</p><p>So cricket fans here in England definitely have a lot of celebrating to do -- unless you were born in New Zealand, like me -- including one of their biggest fans, Theresa May.</p><p>The prime minister may be out of a job in just a couple of weeks, but she isn't letting that stop her from enjoying the victory. She busted out these now-famous dance moves on Sunday night.</p><p>And in just the last few minutes, Mrs. May welcomed the cricket team to Downing Street for a victory party. Earlier, she said the World Cup win will live forever in our sporting history.</p><p>Now, let's get a check on Wall Street this hour. Here's how the Dow is tracking, slightly lower in afternoon trading. This after China announced its economic growth slumped to its lowest level in almost three decades. Growth of 6.2 percent, the world's second-largest economy apparently feeling the effects of the trade war with the United States.</p><p>CNN's Business Editor-at-Large and anchor of \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS,\" Richard Quest, is here in London and he joins us live now to break this story down for us.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN EDITOR AT LARGE: Right.</p><p>NOBILO: So, Richard, what are the main reasons that we're seeing this slowdown in growth?</p><p>QUEST: Do you know, we know that the Chinese economy has problems. Debt, slowdowns, left, right and center. So a poor situation has been made much worse by the trade battle with the United States, which is why Donald Trump tweeted -- or wasted no time, basically saying, \"I'm winning and I'm causing them pain and they should do a deal that they don't want to do.\"</p><p>[14:25:19] But I think that's telling only half the story. Because China, if you look underneath the headline numbers, you do see room for some optimism. There's a lot more consumption in China. It's not all based on government growth. It's not all based on exports. People are starting to build. The Chinese are building a middle class, unfortunately just too slowly.</p><p>NOBILO: And can we trust the data? Because there's always --</p><p>QUEST: Oh, no (ph). Oh, no (ph).</p><p>NOBILO: -- question marks over that.</p><p>QUEST: No, absolutely not.</p><p>NOBILO: So is it likely to be much worse than this?</p><p>QUEST: Yes, yes, is the short answer. I mean, they say 6.2 percent. Well, bearing in mind President Xi gave a range of 6.1 to 6.8, and he's just come in at the end of the range on the lower end, I mean, is it 5.9, 5.5? I don't think it's anything disastrously lower, or you would have certainly seen that elsewhere in the Chinese numbers. But I would not take this number to the bank and put it on the 3-30 (ph) at Newmarket.</p><p>NOBILO: Is this going to have any impact on how China continues to conduct these trade negotiations with the U.S.? Because they have the luxury of looking far longer-term (INAUDIBLE) the U.S.</p><p>QUEST: That's the -- well -- who, the Chinese?</p><p>NOBILO: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: Yes. And the question, of course, is how much pain will they suffer and how -- unlike -- I mean, the harsh reality is, unlike President Trump, that faces an electorate --</p><p>NOBILO: Exactly.</p><p>QUEST: -- next year, President Xi, as best I can tell, is not about to face the voters. What he is, though, going to have to do is keep regional governors happy and a rural angry (ph) elite (ph) happy as well. If he can't do that, then he will have to sue (ph) for peace in terms of a trade deal. But at the moment, it seems like he can contain it and he's able to say to President Trump, \"Fine.\"</p><p>NOBILO: At the moment, will we see any ripple effects from this around the world?</p><p>QUEST: Inevitably. If China's slowing down, all those economies in Southeast Asia that rely on -- Australia, for example, which buys -- China buys raw materials, iron ore and the like, that's going to have an effect. ASEAN countries will have an effect. If China's slowing down, it will not be buying things from other countries.</p><p>Let's remember, China is now an important part of the global economy. Not as important as the U.S. by any means, but it is a significant cog in the wheel, and that cog now has sand in it.</p><p>NOBILO: And what can the Chinese government do to try and lubricate the cog?</p><p>QUEST: Right. Stimulus. That's what you do. You try and do some stimulus. Well, they did in the beginning of the quarter. And you can change the reserve ratios, which is exactly what they're going to try and do again.</p><p>But they can't do too much of that because they have a banking crisis on their doors. They have a lending crisis. They've got a bad debt crisis. So whilst they can certainly have room for maneuverability, the levers that they can pull are by no means as sophisticated or well-oiled -- to use your analogy -- as it would be, for example, in the United States with monetary policy.</p><p>NOBILO: Will you be talking about this more on \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS\"?</p><p>QUEST: Well, we thought we might ignore it for the whole program. Yes.</p><p>NOBILO: -- whether or not that's true.</p><p>QUEST: Yes.</p><p>NOBILO: Tune in for \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS\" in half an hour.</p><p>[14:28:20] Still to come tonight, more on Donald Trump's racist tweets. Is the outrage and anger just what the president wanted all along?</p><p>[14:30:55] NOBILO: Welcome back. Returning to our top story, the fallout over Donald Trump's racist tweets and his refusal to back down even one inch from his controversial comments. Rather than continue to rehash the back and forth over what the president said and the reaction to it, we've already done that, we want to take a look at a different angle.</p><p>Is the media frenzy, over all of this, exactly what Donald Trump wants? Is it all the talk about the president's tweets distracting our attention from other more substantive issues?</p><p>Joining me now is CNN's chief media correspondent, Brian Stelter, the host of CNN's \"RELIABLE SOURCES.\" Brian, do you think that's what the president's trying to achieve here? Does he realize that his rhetoric is inflammatory, that it's going to cause all of this debate and are we just falling right into the trap?</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Well, this would be the 3D chess theory that many political analysts like to subscribe to the idea that the president is calculated in his day-to-day maneuvers, in his tweet storms, that it's all designed to dominate the media economy, to maximize attention onto him and that all press is good press.</p><p>I generally do not subscribe to that theory, Bianca. I look at this and I think the president just reacts every day, every minute, to whatever he sees, whatever he reads, whatever he's angry about, he reacts impulsively, and then tries to spin it in a way that's advantageous.</p><p>So he may look around now and look for political advantages as a result of his angry tweet storm, his racist tweets yesterday. I generally think these are usually not calculated. But that is the grand debate in Washington and in New York and all across the U.S. these days, it has been for two years, how calculated are these rants?</p><p>Often times, I think these rants end up undermining the president and certainly hurting the United States on the world stage, so there's not 3D chess going on.</p><p>But to the extent that he does distract from, let's say, conditions at the border and other scandals and controversies like that, then it can, in some cases, be a win for him. I think the press, however, has learned to walk and chew many pieces of gum at the same time, you know.</p><p>NOBILO: Yes. And, Brian, we had -- have a quote here from the L.A. Times saying, we shouldn't rise to his bait, but how can we not? If we ignore him --</p><p>STELTER: Right.</p><p>NOBILO: We normalize his reckless behavior, and that's even worse. So, Brian, my final question --</p><p>STELTER: This is exactly the issue, yes.</p><p>NOBILO: Exactly. So, it does put the media in a difficult position. We're always walking this tightrope. We don't want to wade willy-nilly into issues that are -- that have moral dimensions. But when there is a clear line crossed, what do you think the moral imperative is for the press?</p><p>STELTER: Right. I think the L.A. Times gets it exactly right. If we are to ignore what he's doing, that contributes to, you know, then that's a problem. If we cover it extensively, that's also a challenge. If every single day, it's raining BS from the sky and we start covering the rain, because we get used to the smell, we get used to the stench, then we are part of the problem.</p><p>The press has to continually point out that Trump is not living up to American values, is not acting presidential on the world stage. It's a daily story for us in the American media and in the international media, even though it can seem repetitive, and even though we end up talking a lot about Trump.</p><p>He is bringing up basic issues about American values and morality. Today, he's talking about what it means to be American, saying to somebody's congresswoman hate America. To him I would say to him what Edward R. Murrow said during the McCarthy scare, he said, we must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. Those words ring really true today.</p><p>NOBILO: Let's leave it there. Thanks, Brian Stelter. Really appreciate it.</p><p>STELTER: Thank you.</p><p>NOBILO: We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. I like it.</p><p>Well, we've covered a lot about what President Trump has said. Now, we want to examine what he's actually trying to do. The Trump administration filed documents that could dramatically limit the ability of migrants to apply for asylum in the U.S.</p><p>Nick Paton Walsh joins us now live from Mexico City. Nick, we have been focusing on the president's rhetoric. There's been more of it in the last couple of hours. But tell us more from the perspective of the people where you are about how these new policy ideas are going to affect migrants.</p><p>[14:35:06] NICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, they're going to affect tomorrow. So this is action immediate, possibly, which will have an impact, obviously, on the hundreds of thousands, and thousands, certainly, of people who have tried to leave Central America and head north through Mexico, where I'm standing, up into the United States.</p><p>This will be published tomorrow in the Federal Register. A change to the rules, which basically says, if you're trying to get into the United States and claim asylum, well, you can't do that if you're from Central America, because you've transited through Mexico and really in their belief, you probably should have applied for asylum in Mexico instead.</p><p>They believe, this is legal, the Department of Justice, it will face legal challenges, certainly. But what it really means in practical terms is the Trump administration has got Mexico and to some degree Guatemala as well to put up as many practical challenges as they can for the path of migrants from Central America, where a combination of climate change, massive corruption, and violence leaves many people looking for a better life, well, frankly leaving out of desperation further north.</p><p>They've done all they can to practically slow them down by putting the Mexican National Guard down on the Guatemalan border and slowing the rate at which they listen to asylum cases certainly on border posts as well.</p><p>What this does, this legal change does, if it holds, is essentially say, the trip is pointless. Because once you get to the United States, we simply won't hear your asylum claim, because, frankly, they believe you've transited through a country where you could have claimed asylum instead. So there will be legal challenges, as I say, but essentially, this is about trying to use the Department of Justice's interpretation of U.S. law to basically mean that people trying to get to the U.S. from Central America are wasting their journey, Bianca.</p><p>BIANCA: And, Nick, is there a reason to believe that that will be a very effective deterrent?</p><p>PATON WALSH: Well, what's extraordinary is you've seen the lengths people will go to get to a better life, to get to in their mind safety in the United States. Now, you may possibly see people trying to use sea routes to go from Central America around Mexico and into the U.S. coast. Would that possibly mean this rule doesn't apply to them?</p><p>We know the desperate lengths people will go to. There have been reports of terrible instances in the past week or so, in which people trying to cross from Guatemala to Mexico, went onwards having the fact had to use drug cartels to facilitate that passage and being double crossed, a father found with his throat slit.</p><p>It's clear people will take, basically, any measures they need to, to try and get their families to a better life in the United States. And these increased number of instructions put up, human rights activists and advocates say simply push people into more desperate, dangerous measures. That's really the fear many have from this kind of rule, rather than it will suddenly stop people's need to get out of Central America where they face many deep economic and physical perils, too, simply by erecting another legal barrier. Bianca?</p><p>NOBILO: Nick Paton Walsh in Mexico City for us. Thank you.</p><p>Now, to New York, where federal prosecutors have laid out the reasons why multi-millionaire and accused sex trafficker, Jeffrey Epstein, should be detained before his trial. Prosecutors say Epstein kept a safe locked in his Manhattan home that contained a foreign passport. The passport was issued in the 1980s and it appeared to have Epstein's photo inside next to a fake name. It also listed his residence as Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Prosecutors say this expired foreign passport and Epstein's wealth make him a flight risk. The judge said he will decide on Thursday whether or not Epstein is released on bail.</p><p>Now, the United Nations is desperately asking for more money to tackle Ebola, as the virus has now spread to a major city on the border of Congo and Rwanda. The U.N. says a big scale up is needed to properly respond to the outbreak. The city of Goma reported its first case Sunday.</p><p>Goma is a major transit hub and home to more than a million people. Health experts are working around the clock to prevent the virus from spreading any further. This is the world's second largest outbreak. It began in August and has killed almost 1,700 people in Congo.</p><p>One young man who survived Ebola spoke to CNN. He tells our David McKenzie the fear around the virus is making the outbreak so much worse. But there is hope that a new treatment center will finally break the cycle of mistrust.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): When Ebola latched on to Roger's Wasakundi's (ph) family, denial came with it.</p><p>\"My sister got it first,\" he says. \"We didn't want to believe it was Ebola. She stayed at home and we buried her.\"</p><p>Through the intimacy of family, the virus spread to his aunt, to his mother, father, to him. It took days to persuade them to seek treatment at a center like this, where doctors told Roger that his father and aunt had died. So when they told me I had Ebola, he says, \"I thought I would die, too.\"</p><p>[14:40:08] In medical terms, stopping the spread of Ebola should be simple. Identify patients quickly, isolate them, trace their contacts. But halting this outbreak has been anything but.</p><p>The epicenter is anchored in a conflict zone, where authority often comes through violence, which breeds fear. \"This fear makes it difficult to stop the chain of transmission,\" says Sylvester Zhongwe (ph). What we needed was to break that fear.</p><p>Zhongwe, a health worker for French medical NGO, ALIMA, says that in the city of Butembo, they wouldn't let outsiders in. \"When responders came to take the sick from their homes, he says, they didn't know who they were. They believed they would take them over there to die. That's what created resistance.\"</p><p>Earlier this year, unknown assailants burnt down two treatment centers. All told, there have been more than 130 attacks on health outposts. ALIMA's solution, integrate an Ebola reception center in something people already knew, an existing clinic.</p><p>MCKENZIE (on-camera): So we're at a center where they receive patients who could have Ebola. But what's incredible about this, it's right inside a hospital. They negotiate with the community, they're hiring youth from the community, and this could be one of the answers.</p><p>MCKENZIE (voice-over): But it's still the only center of its kind. Many victims still die in their homes, refusing to seek treatment. And survivors return to a fearful community.</p><p>\"Many people don't believe Ebola even exists,\" says Roger. \"If people can accept this crisis, then we can end it.\"</p><p>David McKenzie, CNN, Butembo DRC.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NOBILO: E.U. foreign ministers held crisis talks on the Iran nuclear deal today and said they aren't ready to trigger an official dispute mechanism just yet. The ministers decided to give diplomacy another chance. Even as Britain warns the small window to save the deal is closing.</p><p>Iran says it won't resume full compliance until Europe honors its commitments to shielding Tehran from U.S. sanctions. The E.U. foreign policy chief says Iran's breaches of the deal, so far, are not considered significant.</p><p>Still to come on the program tonight, Amazon Prime Day. There's a lot more than just some bargains going on here. A look at what protesters say Amazon is doing wrong. Stay with us.</p><p>NOBILO: This is one of the biggest shopping days of the year, with bunches of fabulous sales and deals. But if you go to your local store, you won't see any of that, because the shopping and the sales only exist online.</p><p>[14:45:00] Amazon's Prime Day has turned into a multi-billion-dollar global event. And it has also turned into a time for protesters to show their disgust with some of Amazon's policies.</p><p>With more on this, let's bring in CNN Business Correspondent, Clare Sebastian, in New York. So, Clare, it's not just a day for big deals, but it's also a day for protests. Talk us through those. What is it that people object to the most?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Bianca, we've seen protests on Prime Day before, but this year, it's starting to look even bigger. This is really starting to look like some kind of Amazon-specific May Day. A lot of different groups are out, a lot of different grievances, everything from workers' rights to conditions, and the fulfillment centers to Amazon's alleged involvement with the immigration and customs enforcement. Even climate change.</p><p>We're seeing for the first time in the U.S. workers are about to walk off the job, that's starting at the top of the next hour. And we're seeing globally as well, in Germany, 2,000 fulfillment center workers have walked off the job. More were expected to join today. There are protests over where you are over in the U.K.</p><p>And look, this is still expected to be a record-breaking Prime Day for Amazon. It's not like these protests are expected to disrupt the sheer number of purchasing dollars that are going to be spent online. But this was not the kind of marketing the company was looking for.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): When it came to marketing, this year's Prime Day, Amazon did not shop around for the cheapest options.</p><p>TAYLOR SWIFT, AMERICAN SINGER: I want to say thank you so much to Amazon for having us all.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Taylor Swift headlining the live streamed Prime Day concert, celebrities like Will Smith and Mark Wahlberg appearing in ads.</p><p>MARK WAHLBERG, AMERICAN ACTOR: You don't need to go shopping anymore, you just go to Amazon Prime.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Does the day work as an event?</p><p>CEM SIBAY, VICE PRESIDENT, AMAZON PRIME: Absolutely, absolutely. That's why we keep growing it.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Prime Day is now five years old and has grown to a full 48 hours. The deals are exclusive to Prime members, of which there are already more than 100 million across 18 countries.</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, MARKETING PROFESSOR, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY: More people are now in a monogamous relationship, if you will, with Amazon vis-a-vis prime than voted in the 2016 election or attend church.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Prime Day is now Amazon's biggest sales event of the year, bigger than Black Friday or Cyber Monday. But this year, it's not just about the many, many items getting shipped out of centers like this, the company is facing backlash on a number of fronts from its treatment of workers to concerns it's simply gotten too big.</p><p>Give me a sense of how you view that the regulations questions around the company at the moment?</p><p>SIBAY: I don't spend a lot of time thinking about it.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: One thing they are thinking about, this Prime Day brings the first-ever walkout at a U.S. Fulfillment Center. This group of workers in Minnesota, which has protested in the past that employees have set unrealistic targets, leading to stress and injury.</p><p>SIBAY: We have a lot of redundancy in place. We have over 175 fulfillment centers globally to make sure that Prime member experiences are not disrupted during this event, as well. But we take, you know, concerns of our employees, obviously, very, very seriously, as well. But I'm really actually proud of the working conditions in our fulfillment centers.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: So why do these concerns keep coming up?</p><p>SIBAY: Most of these are from outside conditions. It's obviously a very hot work environment as well.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: And the backlash is also coming from the competition, even as they launch their own sales to rival Prime Day. Target is advertising summer deal days, emphasizing no membership required. And eBay has gone a step further with a tongue and cheek ad featuring a teenager called --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Alexa?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Even calling their event a crush sale, promising extra deals if Amazon's website crashes, as happened in 2018.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They mostly have deals on a bunch of random stuff nobody really wants.</p><p>BRADFORD SHELLHAMMER, VICE PRESIDENT, EBAY: Unlike some of the other competitors, this time of year, the sales and deals that we are feature are not products that are sitting on our warehouses that are collecting dust that we have to liquidate.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: In an e-commerce market where one company controls almost half of all sales, Amazon's annual shopping festival has made it a pretty big target.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NOBILO: Clare, you were just saying that by the conveyor belt, you were remarking about Amazon's size. The fact that it is so big. Tech companies are in the spotlight at the moment for that very reason. At what point do you think Amazon's giant size will start to work against it, if any?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Well, I think it's certainly telling, Bianca, that on the second day of Prime Day, which is tomorrow, Tuesday, Amazon's general counsel will be testifying on Capitol Hill to the House Judiciary Committee, a hearing entitled, online platforms and market power. We are seeing the drumbeat when it comes to potential regulation of this company growing louder.</p><p>We know that last month that the U.S. agencies kind of divvied up control of the big tech companies, Amazon reportedly falling under the federal trade commission. That raised the specter of more regulation. The stock has proved really sensitive to this. We know the company employs a lot of lobbyists in Washington.</p><p>We know that that rumored to be one of the reasons behind choosing Arlington, Virginia, just across the river from Capitol Hill, as the site for their second headquarters. So the company is acutely aware of this, but the drumbeat is growing a lot louder. We're seeing a lot of political pressure when it comes to this.</p><p>[14:50:05] NOBILO: Clare Sebastian in New York, thank you.</p><p>Now, to a long-overdue recognition for a man who was persecuted in life, but celebrated in death. The Bank of England has unveiled its new 50-pound note, with mathematician Alan Turing on the bill. Turing was instrumental in cracking German codes during World War II, inventing a device that many consider the precursor of the modern computer.</p><p>Despite his great contributions to science, Turing was ostracized for being homosexual and took his own life in 1954. Today, the Bank of England described him as a giant who was the father of computer science and artificial intelligence.</p><p>More to come tonight, including months after a devastating fire, there's still anxiety about the future of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. We'll take a rare look inside the restoration of this beloved landmark.</p><p>NOBILO: Welcome back. An unusual-looking pyramid is now open for visitors in Egypt. The bent pyramid is a 4,600-year-old structure. You can see here, how it got its name from those inclines. The pyramid had been closed for repair since 1965. Archaeologists found hidden tombs as well as mummies and mosques during a nearby excavations that began last year.</p><p>Repairing Notre Dame Cathedral is a painstaking process. Just three months after fire damaged this world treasure, engineers and antiquities experts are still sifting through the rubble.</p><p>Our Jim Bittermann got rare access to the early efforts of this massive restoration process.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Tourists still make their way to Notre Dame in Paris, but these days, their holiday snapshots might look like they visited a construction site. Whether from an overabundance of caution or because those overseeing Notre Dame's rise from the ashes has never dealt with anything quite like this before, the work site is a high security zone. Few are let in. And given the high concentration of lead from the melted roof, all are required to wear special protective jumpsuits.</p><p>And the roof, a gaping hole where the fire burned most fiercely three months ago. The lead and other debris still litter the parts of the vaulted ceiling which did not give way, leading to worries the extra weight could still bring down parts of the building.</p><p>For the most, the chief architect is concerned about shoring up the flying buttresses, which support the walls and vaulted ceiling. Huge, precisely engineered wooden braces have been put in place beneath the ancient stonework to prevent it from shifting. No one is talking about rebuilding just yet.</p><p>In fact, the restoration of Notre Dame has not yet started. It could be another nine months or more before that gets underway. Right now, the chief architect says the building is in such fragile condition, it could still possibly collapse. And so work proceeds very slowly.</p><p>Debris still remains in the central nave area of the cathedral. The engineer on site says studies need to be made when the walls of Notre Dame are thoroughly dried out to determine how much weight they can bear. Still, he believes President Macron's 2024 deadline for rebuilding Notre Dame is possible.</p><p>[14:55:08] JEAN-MICHEL GUILMENT, PROJECT ENGINEER (through translator): I think by mobilizing everyone and by really committing large teams and major companies, it's doable. It's absolutely doable, but we mustn't waste time.</p><p>BITTERMANN: Meanwhile, the treasures of Notre Dame, like the religious relics which were rescued during and after the fire are safely stored away, many at the Louvre Museum. The stained glass windows are gone, taken away for cleaning and protection. The cultural ministry's conservator on the project says the cathedral's paintings survived surprisingly well.</p><p>MARIE-HELENE DIDIER, CONSERVATOR, FRENCH MINISTRY OF CULTURE (through translator): What reassured us when we made a thorough inspection, we saw the master pieces were all intact. There, we were, delighted, especially compared with the state of the building.</p><p>BITTERMANN: So given the state of the building, Notre Dame's rescue is cautious and slow. The cultural conservator says it's like working on an archaeological dig. Indeed, everything, burnt timber or scorched stone, everything brought out of the cathedral is marked with a grid number to indicate where it was found.</p><p>Even the conservators aren't sure where it will all end up. But they and everyone else working to save Notre Dame, know that from a religious, cultural, and historical point of view, they are part of a monumental project unlike any before.</p><p>Jim Bittermann, CNN, Paris.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NOBILO: Before we leave you tonight, we just have to show you this image.

Congressional lawmakers finally got a chance Wednesday to grill the CEOs of Big Tech over their dominance and allegations of monopolistic practices that stifle competition. But it\u2019s not clear how much they advanced their goal of bringing some of the world\u2019s largest companies to heel.   Invective flew as legislators questioned Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai of Google and Tim Cook of Apple at a hearing of the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. For the last year, that panel has probed the business practices of the Silicon Valley giants with an eye to determining if they need to be regulated more heavily, or even broken up.   In nearly five hours of testimony and questioning, however, there were few startling revelations or striking confrontations. While the executives faced hostile questioning and frequent interruptions from lawmakers of both parties, little seemed to land more than glancing blows.   The CEOs testified via video to lawmakers, at times appearing together on the committee room display as tiny individual figures in a mostly empty array of squares. Most committee members were seated, masks on, in the hearing room in Washington.   The execs provided lots of data purporting to show how much competition they face and just how valuable their innovation and essential services are to consumers. But they sometimes struggled to answer pointed questions about their business practices. They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on U.S. democracy and their role in China.   The panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, said each platform controlled by Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple \u201cis a bottleneck for a key channel of distribution.\u201d   \u201cWhether they control access to information or to a marketplace, these platforms have the incentive and ability to exploit this power,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can charge exorbitant fees, impose oppressive contracts, and extract valuable data from the people and businesses that rely on them.\u201d   \u201cSimply put: They have too much power.\u201d   The four CEOs command corporations whose products are woven into the fabric of everyday life, with millions or even billions of customers, and a combined market value greater than the entire German economy. One of them, Bezos, is the world\u2019s richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourth-ranked billionaire.   And they had a few rough moments. Pichai and Zuckerberg, for instance, appeared discomfited when pressed about unsavory aspects of their companies\u2019 businesses, but got respites when their inquisitors ran out of time. Bezos also acknowledged that alleged misdeeds at Amazon \u2014 such as reports that the company has used data generated by independent sellers on its platform to compete against them \u2014 would be \u201cunacceptable\u201d if proven to be true.   Outside observers were able to draw radically different conclusions from the event. Richard Hamilton Jr., a former Justice Department antitrust lawyer, said that everyone on the committee seemed to be in agreement on the need for tougher regulation of all four companies \u2014 an \u201cominous\u201d sign, he said. But Stephen Beck, CEO of the management consulting firm cg42, said the tech companies and their brands emerged relatively unscathed.   In particular, he said, Cook was particularly polished and well prepared, enabling the Apple CEO to put on what Beck called \u201ca master class in terms of how to handle these situations.\u201d Cook drew less attention from lawmakers than did the other CEOs after arguing that Apple isn\u2019t dominant in any of its markets.   Among the toughest questions for Google and Amazon involved accusations that they used their dominant platforms to scoop up data about competitors in a way that gave them an unfair advantage.   Bezos, who was appearing before Congress for the first time, said he couldn\u2019t guarantee that the company had not accessed seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives have previously denied.   \u201cWe have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\u201d Bezos said in a response to a question from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat. \u201cBut I can\u2019t guarantee to you that that policy hasn\u2019t been violated.\u201d   Pichai deployed an old Washington trick \u2014 appealing to the specific interests of legislators. In his opening remarks, he touted Google\u2019s value to mom-and-pop businesses in Bristol, Rhode Island, and Pewaukee, Wisconsin, which just happen to be located in the home districts of Cicilline and Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, the panel\u2019s senior Republican.   But the Google executive struggled as Cicilline accused the company of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.   Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline\u2019s attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day in an effort to keep them coming back instead of defecting to a rival service, such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing.   As Democrats largely focused on market competition, several Republicans aired longstanding grievances, claiming the tech companies are censoring conservative voices and questioning their business activities in China. \u201cBig Tech is out to get conservatives,\u201d insisted Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.   In its bipartisan investigation, the Judiciary subcommittee collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies. A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding are needed.   Cicilline has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. While forced breakups may appear unlikely, the wide scrutiny of Big Tech points toward possible new restrictions on its power.   The companies face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies\u2019 practices.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42717846257</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G8-4681-JCSC-J0N7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1149\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Hong Kong Standard Finance</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Hong Kong</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Eastern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos testifies remotely during a House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, July 29,  in Washington.     Previous     Next   Congressional lawmakers finally got a chance Wednesday to grill the CEOs of Big Tech over their dominance and allegations of monopolistic practices that stifle competition. But it\u2019s not clear how much they advanced their goal of bringing some of the world\u2019s largest companies to heel.   Invective flew as legislators questioned Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai of Google and Tim Cook of Apple at a hearing of the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. For the last year, that panel has probed the business practices of the Silicon Valley giants with an eye to determining if they need to be regulated more heavily, or even broken up.   In nearly five hours of testimony and questioning, however, there were few startling revelations or striking confrontations. While the executives faced hostile questioning and frequent interruptions from lawmakers of both parties, little seemed to land more than glancing blows.   The CEOs testified via video to lawmakers, at times appearing together on the committee room display as tiny individual figures in a mostly empty array of squares. Most committee members were seated, masks on, in the hearing room in Washington.   The execs provided lots of data purporting to show how much competition they face and just how valuable their innovation and essential services are to consumers. But they sometimes struggled to answer pointed questions about their business practices. They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on U.S. democracy and their role in China.   The panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, said each platform controlled by Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple \u201cis a bottleneck for a key channel of distribution.\u201d   \u201cWhether they control access to information or to a marketplace, these platforms have the incentive and ability to exploit this power,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can charge exorbitant fees, impose oppressive contracts, and extract valuable data from the people and businesses that rely on them.\u201d   \u201cSimply put: They have too much power.\u201d   The four CEOs command corporations whose products are woven into the fabric of everyday life, with millions or even billions of customers, and a combined market value greater than the entire German economy. One of them, Bezos, is the world\u2019s richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourth-ranked billionaire.   And they had a few rough moments. Pichai and Zuckerberg, for instance, appeared discomfited when pressed about unsavory aspects of their companies\u2019 businesses, but got respites when their inquisitors ran out of time. Bezos also acknowledged that alleged misdeeds at Amazon \u2014 such as reports that the company has used data generated by independent sellers on its platform to compete against them \u2014 would be \u201cunacceptable\u201d if proven to be true.   Outside observers were able to draw radically different conclusions from the event. Richard Hamilton Jr., a former Justice Department antitrust lawyer, said that everyone on the committee seemed to be in agreement on the need for tougher regulation of all four companies \u2014 an \u201cominous\u201d sign, he said. But Stephen Beck, CEO of the management consulting firm cg42, said the tech companies and their brands emerged relatively unscathed.   In particular, he said, Cook was particularly polished and well prepared, enabling the Apple CEO to put on what Beck called \u201ca master class in terms of how to handle these situations.\u201d Cook drew less attention from lawmakers than did the other CEOs after arguing that Apple isn\u2019t dominant in any of its markets.   Among the toughest questions for Google and Amazon involved accusations that they used their dominant platforms to scoop up data about competitors in a way that gave them an unfair advantage.   Bezos, who was appearing before Congress for the first time, said he couldn\u2019t guarantee that the company had not accessed seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives have previously denied.   \u201cWe have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\u201d Bezos said in a response to a question from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat. \u201cBut I can\u2019t guarantee to you that that policy hasn\u2019t been violated.\u201d   Pichai deployed an old Washington trick \u2014 appealing to the specific interests of legislators. In his opening remarks, he touted Google\u2019s value to mom-and-pop businesses in Bristol, Rhode Island, and Pewaukee, Wisconsin, which just happen to be located in the home districts of Cicilline and Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, the panel\u2019s senior Republican.   But the Google executive struggled as Cicilline accused the company of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.   Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline\u2019s attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day in an effort to keep them coming back instead of defecting to a rival service, such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing.   As Democrats largely focused on market competition, several Republicans aired longstanding grievances, claiming the tech companies are censoring conservative voices and questioning their business activities in China. \u201cBig Tech is out to get conservatives,\u201d insisted Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.   In its bipartisan investigation, the Judiciary subcommittee collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies. A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding are needed.   Cicilline has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. While forced breakups may appear unlikely, the wide scrutiny of Big Tech points toward possible new restrictions on its power.   The companies face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies\u2019 practices.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42717849747</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G8-4681-JCSC-J0N8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1180\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Hong Kong Standard Finance</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Hong Kong</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Eastern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Facebook may also face an antitrust probe by the U.S. Justice Department.</p><p>Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat who arranged a dinner for Zuckerberg with other senators Wednesday night, told Fox Business Network, \"Facebook leadership realizes that failure to have federal legislation (on internet issues) is actually going to hurt them and the whole platform industry in the long run.\"</p><p>After the dinner, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said he had brought up Facebook's \"repeated failures\" in election security and consumer privacy. \"We had (a) serious, substantive conversation even when we may have differed,\" he said in a statement.</p><p>Another critic was Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican who has accused Facebook of suppressing conservative speech. After meeting with the Facebook founder Thursday, Hawley said discussions had been \"frank,\" often a euphemism for contentious.</p><p>Hawley urged Zuckerberg to sell Facebook's Instagram and WhatsApp units, which would limit how much information it could compile about an individual.</p><p>\"Safe to say he was not receptive to those suggestions,\" Hawley said dryly.</p><p>Zuckerberg was in no mood to talk to reporters between meetings, refusing over and over again to offer even the barest assessment of the discussions.</p><p>Also on Friday, Facebook said it had suspended tens of thousands of apps on the social networking platform, its first major update on an ongoing app developer audit it began in March 2018 to prevent a repeat of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline, chair of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, said Friday that Zuckerberg pledged cooperation with the panel's probe into online markets.</p><p>The House of Representatives Judiciary Committee opened an investigation into competition in digital markets in June, one of a series of investigations facing big tech companies like Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google.</p><p>Last week, the panel demanded emails, detailed financial information and other company records from the four companies' top executives. They have until Oct. 14 to produce the documents.</p><p>While lawmakers like Hawley and Blumenthal seemed unsatisfied with Zuckerberg's responses, Senator Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, took a milder tack.</p><p>\"I encouraged him to come to the table, help us out - and this is not an adversarial role from my perspective,\" Collins said, noting they did not discuss whether Facebook will comply with the document requests. \"I think with their involvement you are going to see a lot more participation.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRDECO-3121770</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRDECO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3G-6711-JBMJ-348W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345568</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"622\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT +4</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Trend News Agency All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Trend Daily Economic News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61541\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 21, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Facebook may also face an antitrust probe by the U.S. Justice Department.</p><p>Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat who arranged a dinner for Zuckerberg with other senators Wednesday night, told Fox Business Network, \"Facebook leadership realizes that failure to have federal legislation (on internet issues) is actually going to hurt them and the whole platform industry in the long run.\"</p><p>After the dinner, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said he had brought up Facebook's \"repeated failures\" in election security and consumer privacy. \"We had (a) serious, substantive conversation even when we may have differed,\" he said in a statement.</p><p>Another critic was Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican who has accused Facebook of suppressing conservative speech. After meeting with the Facebook founder Thursday, Hawley said discussions had been \"frank,\" often a euphemism for contentious.</p><p>Hawley urged Zuckerberg to sell Facebook's Instagram and WhatsApp units, which would limit how much information it could compile about an individual.</p><p>\"Safe to say he was not receptive to those suggestions,\" Hawley said dryly.</p><p>Zuckerberg was in no mood to talk to reporters between meetings, refusing over and over again to offer even the barest assessment of the discussions.</p><p>Also on Friday, Facebook said it had suspended tens of thousands of apps on the social networking platform, its first major update on an ongoing app developer audit it began in March 2018 to prevent a repeat of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline, chair of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, said Friday that Zuckerberg pledged cooperation with the panel's probe into online markets.</p><p>The House of Representatives Judiciary Committee opened an investigation into competition in digital markets in June, one of a series of investigations facing big tech companies like Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google.</p><p>Last week, the panel demanded emails, detailed financial information and other company records from the four companies' top executives. They have until Oct. 14 to produce the documents.</p><p>While lawmakers like Hawley and Blumenthal seemed unsatisfied with Zuckerberg's responses, Senator Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, took a milder tack.</p><p>\"I encouraged him to come to the table, help us out - and this is not an adversarial role from my perspective,\" Collins said, noting they did not discuss whether Facebook will comply with the document requests. \"I think with their involvement you are going to see a lot more participation.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNCAEN-3121770</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TNCAEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3H-BCP1-JBMJ-314Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">432763</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"622\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM GMT +4</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Trend News Agency All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Trend News Agency - Central Asia (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"26477\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 22, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Facebook may also face an antitrust probe by the U.S. Justice Department.</p><p>Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat who arranged a dinner for Zuckerberg with other senators Wednesday night, told Fox Business Network, \"Facebook leadership realizes that failure to have federal legislation (on internet issues) is actually going to hurt them and the whole platform industry in the long run.\"</p><p>After the dinner, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said he had brought up Facebook's \"repeated failures\" in election security and consumer privacy. \"We had (a) serious, substantive conversation even when we may have differed,\" he said in a statement.</p><p>Another critic was Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican who has accused Facebook of suppressing conservative speech. After meeting with the Facebook founder Thursday, Hawley said discussions had been \"frank,\" often a euphemism for contentious.</p><p>Hawley urged Zuckerberg to sell Facebook's Instagram and WhatsApp units, which would limit how much information it could compile about an individual.</p><p>\"Safe to say he was not receptive to those suggestions,\" Hawley said dryly.</p><p>Zuckerberg was in no mood to talk to reporters between meetings, refusing over and over again to offer even the barest assessment of the discussions.</p><p>Also on Friday, Facebook said it had suspended tens of thousands of apps on the social networking platform, its first major update on an ongoing app developer audit it began in March 2018 to prevent a repeat of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline, chair of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, said Friday that Zuckerberg pledged cooperation with the panel's probe into online markets.</p><p>The House of Representatives Judiciary Committee opened an investigation into competition in digital markets in June, one of a series of investigations facing big tech companies like Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google.</p><p>Last week, the panel demanded emails, detailed financial information and other company records from the four companies' top executives. They have until Oct. 14 to produce the documents.</p><p>While lawmakers like Hawley and Blumenthal seemed unsatisfied with Zuckerberg's responses, Senator Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, took a milder tack.</p><p>\"I encouraged him to come to the table, help us out - and this is not an adversarial role from my perspective,\" Collins said, noting they did not discuss whether Facebook will comply with the document requests. \"I think with their involvement you are going to see a lot more participation.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRNDBR-3121770</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRNDBR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X4S-1CR1-DY3K-T3W2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">376078</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"622\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM GMT +4</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Trend News Agency All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Trend Business Review - Azerbaijan</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13734\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 27, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Facebook may also face an antitrust probe by the U.S. Justice Department.</p><p>Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat who arranged a dinner for Zuckerberg with other senators Wednesday night, told Fox Business Network, \"Facebook leadership realizes that failure to have federal legislation (on internet issues) is actually going to hurt them and the whole platform industry in the long run.\"</p><p>After the dinner, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said he had brought up Facebook's \"repeated failures\" in election security and consumer privacy. \"We had (a) serious, substantive conversation even when we may have differed,\" he said in a statement.</p><p>Another critic was Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican who has accused Facebook of suppressing conservative speech.

Anne Rabbitte made her comments as senior Cabinet member Eoghan Murphy admitted that his views on regulating smartphone use by children have changed as a result of the ongoing debate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This has followed on from a concerted campaign by the Irish Daily Mail to restrict the age limit on smartphone ownership.</p><p>Ms Rabbitte said: 'There is no need for any child to be bringing a smartphone into a national school.' She said Fianna F\u00e1il would now consult on the question of a minimum age for possession of an internet-capable device.</p><p>Fianna F\u00e1il is to establish a Spewould cial Working Group on Child Internet Safety. Party spokesman on mental health, TD James Browne, warned that the dangers of smartphone dependence were now well established.</p><p>'They include depression, anxiety, body dysmorphia - a long list. And there has been very little action by the State. Children are having silent conversations with strangers and we are not regulating what is taking place online.' He added: 'In 2012, ownership of a smartphone passed 50% of the population and since that time mental health problems associated with their use has increased exponentially.' The party wants the office of a Digital Safety Commissioner established as a matter of urgency, noting that the idea appeared to have been kicked into the long grass by the Taoiseach last autumn, only to be brought back to the fore by a string of horror court cases, culminating in the conviction of 26-year-old paedophile Matthew Horan last week. The predator preyed on children as young as nine from his bedroom, blackmailing them into sending him nude photographs and threatening to post them to their friends, even though the children said they kill themselves if he did so. Ms Rabbitte said it had been 16 months since the Law Reform Commission had urged action to better protect minors online. 'There should be a Digital Safety Commissioner now to protect our youth and to give some comfort to parents,' she said.</p><p>'We have to keep our kids safe from trolls and shocking instances of predators. At the moment our children are not being protected by the industry.' She added: 'The big platforms don't engage at the moment because they don't have to. There are no controls.' She instanced the case of the CEO of Snapchat declining to come before an Oireachtas committee late last year, even though Facebook had already done so.</p><p>Ms Rabbitte said: 'Social media companies are setting their own rules and regulations because there's a void there. The State needs to get involved.' She said the working group within the party would be asking what particular powers and 'teeth' people wanted a digital safety watchdog to have, but certainly there should be instant take-down where someone requested the removal of a compromising photograph or image.</p><p>Children as young as six are accessing apps, she said, adding that there is also an issue surrounding inappropriate advertising that can be on app pages. Mr Browne said bullying had been part of the human condition since 'year zero' but with cyberbullying there was now no escape and it followed children home.</p><p>Ms Rabbitte said both Government and the industry had a duty of care to young Irish citizens and she hoped that political proximity to Big Tech - which has been wooed by the IDA and which provides a lot of employment in Ireland - did not play a part in delaying the establishment of a new watchdog, or on the age of internet accounts being set at 13, rather than 16.</p><p>Meanwhile, Housing Minister Eoghan Murphy has said hearing from experts such as Dr Mary Aiken - who told the Mail last week that she wants children under the age of 14 to be prevented from using the devices - had changed his view on the Government introducing legislation on the matter. Asked by the Mail if he would support introducing age restrictions on smartphones, he replied: 'My views on this are kind of changing actually.</p><p>'The more I hear people who are experts in the field talk about this, the more I hear Dr Mary Aiken speak about this and the need for us to give some guidance to parents as to smartphone usage, the more I tend to agree with her to be honest. But we're still having this discussion as a government and there is a summit now scheduled for March which will be quite important.' The minister also revealed that the issue had been discussed by the Government at Cabinet level, but he said he was speaking in a personal capacity.</p><p>Ms Rabbitte has also spoken about the online abuse she is regularly subjected to by 'nasty individuals', sometimes on a daily basis. She told the Mail that she is the target of 'shocking' comments on social media, and was labelled a 'murderer' by online trolls during her time on the committee that discussed repealing the Eighth Amendment.</p><p>'I spend half an hour every night sitting down blocking people and trying to figure out who are really interested, who really care, who really want to engage, who are interested in what I say or do, or who is there just waiting for the next swipe,' she said.</p><p>'There is no level of humanity in some of these people. The anger, the aggression, is shocking.'

Presenting will be Brent Bickett. For those of you who aren't familiar, he's been part of the FNF family for a long time running the M&amp;A business, both FNF and FIS. He's now the President of FNF. I'm also joined by Tony Park, the CFO, and we've got <person><nameText>Dan Murphy </nameText></person>in the back of the room.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FNF was our top pick going into the year. It's been a pretty strong performer despite significant headwinds in the mortgage origination business. I think, in large part, one, because the stock has been cheap, but also because there's a lot of positive aspects to the story, particularly the acquisition of LPS, the synergies they're realizing there and also the spinoff of noncore assets, which I'm sure they'll get into in great detail.</p><p>With that, I'm going to hand it off.</p><p>BRENT BICKETT, PRESIDENT, FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC.: -- Thank you, appreciate it. I also appreciate all of you being here. It's always fun to come overseas to see people who want to invest in a US-centric company. But we think we have a very interesting story for you and are very excited to tell it.</p><p>So here's the overview of our company. As was alluded to, we have, really, two businesses. What we're calling our core business is our title insurance and then our real estate settlement services business and then our technology businesses. Again, we're the number-one franchise for title insurance and then real estate settlement services in the country. And that's what we're now calling our core business.</p><p>In January, we announced that we're going to form a tracking stock. We have a series of investments, the aggregate, about US$1.35 billion worth of value that we're going to basically give to our shareholders in the form of a stock distribution of an entity -- well, it's not really an entity, it's really just a -- you'll be publicly traded shares that track the performance of these underlying investments.</p><p>Now, we made that decision because there's substantial value in these investments, and I'll talk about them a little bit more at length later on, that wasn't, we felt, fully reflected in our share price. And subsequent to the announcement, our stock price did, in fact, advance and go forward. It's about $4.71 a share of value. That's on our books, that's not necessarily fair market value. And when we get to that point of the presentation, I will kind of give you some indications of where potential fair market value might be for that business.</p><p>We were favorable with the SEC. We got through the SEC without a review, so we're going to be 90 days sooner than our projected timeline. The shareholder vote for the tracking stock is in June, and then assuming we get affirmation from our shareholders, we'll distribute the shares of FNFV, which will be a ticker symbol shortly thereafter.</p><p>Important is, in a post-tracker world, if you own a share of FNF, you will just own our core business, which is, again, the market-leading franchise for processing real estate transactions and mortgages in the United States. If you then own FNFV you'll realize the benefit as we monetize these investments that we have and, again, I'll give you more color on that later on. You'll get the benefit of that.</p><p>Future cash flows that we generate, and we're moving into an interesting cycle for FNF as our cash flow should start accelerating over the next several years as our claims paid over prior-year policies, particularly in the mid-2000s, like 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008. As those tail off, we'll start generating a lot more free cash flow. All the free cash flows that we generate on a go-forward basis will be invested in our core business. What I mean by investing -- repaying debt, paying dividends, buying other core assets to complement what we have, and potentially repurchasing shares.</p><p>Our organizational structure -- Bill Foley is our Chairman and CEO. He's also the founder of the Company. I report to him. We have our CEO, Randy Quirk. Randy's functional responsibilities are running our title business. We are organized in three functional groups -- our Fidelity National Title Group, and we have -- Roger Jewkes runs the left, Erica runs our agency operations, and Mike Nolan runs the East, all reporting up to Randy.</p><p>Black Knight Holdings, I'll get in more detail on what that business is. The Technology side is run by a gentleman named Tom Sanzone, a new manager. We replaced, in the LPS transaction, the former senior management of that business, so now Tom runs it. And then Chris Azur runs what we call our ServiceLink business. Both of those report up to Randy.</p><p>We have shared services, so we try to -- we're very cost-efficient. Tony runs all of our financial operations, Peter Sadowski runs all of our legal and claims. Then on the corporate side, contracts and things like that, Mike Gravelle runs it.</p><p>As was mentioned, I'm President of the Company. My functional responsibilities are all strategic investments, corporate strategy, mergers and acquisitions, and I've been doing that for more than 15 years. And I also oversee every one of the portfolio Company investments.</p><p>Black Knight -- in January we closed on the purchase of LPS as a $3.4 billion transaction. We funded that with $2.5 billion in cash and 26 million shares of FNF. For those of us that followed us, we originally targeted $100 million in cost synergies. We increased that target to $225 million in February and further increased it to $290 million when we had our earnings call late in April.</p><p>For those, again, that know us, we're very experienced acquirers of businesses. We've done that our whole corporate life, and we are very good about getting cost synergies. We make the decisions early, we closed in January, we're largely done in terms of the integration. So now we could focus going forward and then growing the revenue base. The margins, obviously, will be flowing through in Q2, Q3 as we realize the benefits of those synergies.</p><p>Why did we buy it? Well, interestingly, we used to own LPS back in the day. I ran mergers and acquisitions for them back in 2000 -- when we formed it back in 2000. It was part of a big tech processor called FIS, so as some of you might know, it's the largest [Sintec] processor in the world. And then we spun FIS out of FNF back in 2006. They then spun LPS out of it in 2008, and then we repurchased it back in 2014. So I know we know the business well.</p><p>Why did we buy it? They have some core assets in the real estate and mortgage business that we think are critical to how we sell our core title insurance and real estate settlement service products. They have a mortgage servicing platform that processes over 55% of the US mortgages, and it's very recurring revenue, which we need, because we're in a cyclical business in our core. We get paid per loan per month.</p><p>But, more than that, we are a trusted vendor. We're running a mission-critical system on behalf of our banking clients. They can't get rid of it. It is a heart-and-lung transplant to deconvert off the system but enables us to have conversations at a much different level than any of our competitors. We're talking to the CEO, the Risk Compliance Officer, the head of legal, a completely different level than our competitors are.</p><p>So when we start trying to cross-sell, it's important to have the relationships at the top of the house as well as the strong relationships that we had lower in the organization.</p><p>We also have a leading loan origination system, and we think that there is some systemic demand for loan originators in the United States to update their system. Many of them are custom, many of them are non-compliant with current rules and regulations. We have an industry-standard platform that is compliant. We have the alphabet soup of the regulatory bodies including the FFIEC, the CFPB, the OCC -- they all come through and vet our systems, and we welcome that because, again, that differentiates us from the competition.</p><p>FNF highlights -- as I mentioned, we're the largest provider of title insurance, technology, and transaction services to the real estate and mortgage industries in the United States. We do have some business in Canada. We're the nation's largest title insurance company, about 35% national market share. We are the dominant provider of mortgage loan origination and servicing technologies, we are also the largest provider of centralized mortgage settlement services.</p><p>That's where, typically, the large lenders in the United States where they are able to control the orders, like, typically, on refinance transactions, that they can control who they use their settlement service. We have a special group that targets those folks. And we have now, particularly with the former LPS business, we renamed it Black Knight. We now have a good mix of cyclical encounter, cyclical services business.</p><p>The real estate market in the US is still recovering, but if you look at our performance in 2011, 2012, 2013, it has been very strong despite a sluggish market. The first quarter had more seasonal noise than we've experienced in years. Last year, in Q1 of 2013, there were still a lot of federal programs like HARP and HAMP trying to help homeowners that are under water on their mortgages, and the refinancing market was still real strong.</p><p>In the first quarter of 2014, those volumes dropped off significantly -- about 70% on those on that re-fi-heavy segment. But the purchase market is remaining strong, and we're experiencing more. March was better than February, and January/April was about like March. So we're starting to get into a more normalized segment.</p><p>Our balance sheet is strong. We have a very nice cash dividend that we can easily pay. We have a collection of businesses that generates lots of cash so we could repay debt and continue our dividend. We have enough money to make further investments to complement what we just bought in terms of LPS. And, if appropriate, we should have enough funds down the road to consider repurchasing shares, if that warrants.</p><p>And for those of us that have noticed for a long time, we're very shareholder-friendly. That's my largest holding that I have personally, is shares of FNF, and it's been very lucrative to own those shares over the many years.</p><p>Going into our core business -- again, we have two segments that's our title group. We have four main underwriters on the left-hand side. It's Fidelity National Title, Chicago Title, Commonwealth, and Alamo. In almost every market, we hold either a number-one or number-two position. If we're number-two, we're number-two by not much. It's run like a machine. We have the best-in-class management. Our margins are typically significantly higher than all of our competitors and only one competitor is a close second, and it's not even that close in terms of our margin capability.</p><p>It's not an easy business to manage. It's very cyclical, and we're very metric-driven, and we'll get into that a little bit more. On the right-hand side of the page, we have what we're calling Black Knight Holdings, with two businesses -- Black Knight Financial Services, that's the technology arm that I described earlier that has the number-one mortgage servicing system, and then it also has what we think is a leading loan-origination system. And then ServiceLink, which is our leading provider of mortgage processing services, default solutions and centralized settlement services. This is our core business.</p><p>This is a list of our product offerings. Basically, if you look at the real estate lifecycle, we try to fill in every product and services that can be possibly consumed when a mortgages originator or when a real estate transaction in the United States is originated. That includes the title insurance businesses, it includes the technology assets that I mentioned in terms of loan origination technology, mortgage servicing technology assets, default management assets. We have a data and analytics business, and that's a potential area of substantial growth for us. We didn't have that before we picked that up in the LPS acquisition. We have lots of customers that we could sell that. That's going to be an important revenue growth area for us.</p><p>And then down at the bottom is transaction services, which -- if you look at us versus all of our competitors, we clearly check more boxes. But that's not to say that we continually -- what we have as our strength is customer relationships, so we keep trying to find more products that we could deliver to those customers. Our customers, typically, are larger institutions, and so if there's complementary things that we could get that brings us smaller clients, we'll look at those as well. But we have the most rounded product offering of any of our competitor set.</p><p>What's our operating strategy? It's to extend and leverage our technology-enabled solutions in the real estate industry. We believe that we have terrific growth opportunities in our real estate transaction services, so we look at what our share of wallet is at Wells Fargo. If we're not getting enough appraisal business, we push to get more appraisal business. If we're weak in a product area, we have the relationships to push to try to get more business. So it's getting greater share of wallet across that spectrum.</p><p>As I mentioned on the loan technology -- origination technology solutions, there's, we think, systemic demand. These people need a change, and we have a great solution that, really, nobody else has, particularly when you link it with our servicing platform, which nobody else has.</p><p>We'll continue to run the default management. There's always going to be defaults. Obviously, those are trended down as the wave of defaults have stabilized, but there's still always people that have issues, and loans will always -- a small segment of them -- will always have issues, and we have products and services to manage them on behalf of our clients. And then the data and analytics, again, we think that's a big growth area for us.</p><p>We've already taken out the cost, now it's really pursuing growth initiatives, and we're looking to -- we are a cyclical business in our core title insurance. We need a real estate transaction to happen, and that's when all of our products and services kick in and, importantly, it doesn't matter if it's a refinance transaction, a resell of a residential property or commercial. It doesn't matter if you pay cash. 40% of the market in the first quarter was cash transactions in the United States. Our products will kick in even under those conditions.</p><p>So we want to pursue growth initiatives, get more recurring revenue so we can make it a little bit more predictable so when you guys look at our stock, we could give you a little bit more visibility into the power of cash flow that we can generate.</p><p>We want to bring to market new innovative solutions. I mean, we already have mapped out the whole mortgage lifecycle, and now that we have LPS back in the fold, this has given us a lot more opportunities to create new solutions that the market needs. And, really, a good example of that is sort of in the servicing area where our servicing platform, we think, when you look at a Wells Fargo, who is one of our big clients, we might have 20% of their technology spend in the servicing side.</p><p>Well, what's the other 80%? The other 80% is the 300 custom systems that they have surrounding our servicing platform. So we could target and make modules that are fully integrated into MSP, we can get a greater share of wallet. When we do those, what we'll do is work with -- and we are working with Wells Fargo, and identify each one. So they're our beta client. Once we implement it for them, then we could roll it out to all of our other 100 MSP clients.</p><p>We want to expand customer relationships in its cross-sell. I mean, again, our greatest strength are customer relationships, sell more to them. And we're best-in-class at aggressively managing our costs, and our management team in the title side and manage the cyclical business better than anybody else in our industry.</p><p>Looking at the market share overview -- on the bottom, I'll go there first -- we have 35% national market share, but if you take a closer look at that, we conduct our business in two fashion -- one is what we call direct. This is where it's our office. We have over 1,200 of them across the United States, and it's our people so we pay -- on every dollar of premium, we get to keep the dollar. But then we pay our people costs, we pay our real estate leasing costs and other variable costs, but it's a more profitable segment for us because, on a gross basis, we get more cash per dollar on our direct share.</p><p>And, importantly, if you look at our number-two which is First American, we're 60% larger than them on the direct side.</p><p>(dial tone)</p><p>That enables us when purchases come back up, that's where we'll benefit more from having a larger footprint to capture the resale transactions, and our customers there are realtors. And so as the purchase market -- if you're bullish on the purchase market stabilizing and growing in the US, we're going to derive more benefit from that than our competition.</p><p>(telephone dialing)</p><p>Also, it helps on small commercial because we do have national commercial centers that handle hotels and office buildings and significant properties, but there's a lot of smaller commercial three-unit apartment buildings -- that's commercial -- and those flow through our local operations. So it's a very key competitive advantage, and it's very, very expensive for competitors to -- there's nothing [Stewart] can do to really move their market share into (inaudible).</p><p>(presentation interrupted by background noise)</p><p>First American can, maybe by acquisition, but it's very tough to move market share under direct site. Easier would be the agency site on the right. We have 28% market share in agency. However, in that situation, for every dollar of premium, the agent keeps, on average, $0.80. To us, they keep $0.75 because we aggressively manage the splits better than our competitors. So we're working with $0.24 dollars upon which we pay premium tax of $0.02 on the dollar, and we pay -- set up a loss reserve. We have G&amp;A, and then the rest is gross margin.</p><p>So on a gross margin basis, actually not so bad, but on a gross dollar basis, we'd rather have $1.00 of direct revenue. And then on a combined basis, we have 35% market share.</p><p>As I mentioned, we're either number-one or number-two across the country. We're number-one in every important state that we'd like to be. In those areas, where we're number-two, we're number-two by -- I think First American in Arizona, which is 31 -- I'm not sure if you know your geography in the United States, but they're at 32, we're at 31. In Nevada, they're at 36, we're at 35. So it's neck-and-neck. And then where we're number-one, we're typically number-one by a long, long margin.</p><p>And, as I mentioned, our title team is the best in the business. It is a tough business, and we are very metric-driven. We look at our inventory -- we're not worried. We're trying to project, and a lot of people have asked us today, well, where do you think originations are going to go? Where do you think purchase -- our crystal ball is really no clearer than anybody else. But we don't have our managers worry about something that they can't control.</p><p>We look at our current inventories, we look at our staffing, we look at our metrics, and it's open orders per employees, closed orders per employees, order counts, and we make changes on the fly based upon the volumes that we're seeing. We're slow to add headcount when volumes improve because we're always pessimistic that it's going to go back down again. So we'll probably do -- undo margins as volumes improve, but we're very aggressive when the counts go down. And you can imagine, when the markets drop and significantly going towards the end of last year and into this year, our team was hard at work doing what they do best, which is managing our business.</p><p>We say that we can get to a normalized pretax margin of 15% to 20%. When we use the word \"normalized,\" we think $1.4 billion market would be great if $1 billion of it was purchase. And we could probably get to the low end of the 15%. We'd probably need that purchase market to go up a little bit higher than that to get to above 15% pretax. But it would be a very pleasant place to be. And this is nowhere near, by the way, what the markets used to be back in the early 2000s. These are still a fraction of what they were back earlier in the decade.</p><p>And this is an example of -- I mentioned that we feel that that we've -- and we do -- run the best title business. So despite the revenue slowing and moving with the market, you can see a high correlation with originations on the left-hand side and with our revenue and pretax margins on the right-hand side.</p><p>We really did ride a good wave -- as you look at 2009 and 2010, we were still reducing our cost structure from the heydays of 2006 and 2007. But then you started seeing our margins expand on the right-hand side from 6.6% in 2009 to 7.7% in 2010, getting to the double-digit of 10.9% and 11%, 14% in 2012, and then 13.7% in 2013.</p><p>If Randy Quirk, who, again, runs our title operations this year, even in this type of market, he feels that we, at minimum, we should do 10% pretax profit on our title business if not more. But we've been a very strong performer in a pretty volatile industry.</p><p>And, again, just further evidence of our ability to manage costs through origination cycles. Our biggest expense is people. And so the first thing we do is adjust staffing on our people. Our second-largest cost is our real estate costs of our footprint, harder to adjust, although we've taken advantage of reducing our footprint. I think we're up at our peak, almost 2,000 offices, consolidated down to the 1,200 that we have now. Lowering our rental rates, taking advantage of when the markets were weaker, lowering the amount of square footage that we rent. But you could see that we very, very aggressively manage headcount, which is the green bar, over the cycles, an event depending upon our order volume.</p><p>And this is our margin profile, over time, versus our competitors. As you can see in every single year, we've significantly outpaced our industry. Oftentimes, we make more pretax than the rest of the industry combined.</p><p>We're sort of an oligopoly. We're the largest player, and then in a typical oligopoly, the second tier, and then it really drops off in number 3, 4, and 5. But usually the large-scale players make the undue process, and that's our position.</p><p>We're real excited, again, about the Black Knight and ServiceLink business. I mean, this is going to be, we think, one of our biggest value drivers, going forward. We own 65% of it. We needed -- we did not have the financial strength to buy it on our own because the seller demanded more cash, and we have to maintain our investment-grade rating, so we brought in a partner to help us buy it. So we own 65% in a private equity firm on 35%.</p><p>We both have the technology side, which, again, is that mortgage servicing platform, the default processing -- well, it's the default technology platform called Desktop. Really see, in the loan origination platforms, they did just under $200 million in revenue, EBITDA margins in the mid-30s. You'll see those margins expand up into the 40s as the benefits of the cost synergies start rolling through to the balance of the year.</p><p>They have not really been fully reflected yet. We've made a lot of cost savings, but you'll start to see them in our numbers in Q2, Q3, and Q4. We think that there's terrific growth opportunities in this business. As I mentioned, there's high demand in the customer conversations that we're having about them moving off of custom expensive platforms and moving to ours is compelling. They want to reduce cost, they want to improve quality, and they want to reduce their risk -- their compliance risk. And we answer all three of those questions.</p><p>So this business is a technology business, highly, highly predictable. Our objective is to try to grow at high single digits. Again, get its EBITDA margins into the high 40s, and it's an extremely, extremely valuable asset. If you annualize it, it's around $800 million of revenue. Mid-40s EBITDA margins once the synergies are realized, and if you can growth that high single-digit, you guys probably know some companies that are like that that trade at very attractive premiums.</p><p>And then the second piece, again, is ServiceLink. It's the number-one franchise. It did $215 million in revenue in the first quarter. It's focused, though, squarely on the re-fi side. We're trying to extend its product suite into more purchase-oriented products like appraisal because even a purchase order needs an appraisal.</p><p>There's flood certificates, which is on any type of loan that's originated. We do vendor management for third-party appraisal companies for lenders that want their own appraisal, and we'll manage that on behalf of the lenders, and we get paid for that. And we're also the largest, still, default processor in the country. Even though defaults are down significantly, there's still a good market there, and we're, by far, the largest in that field.</p><p>And what's our operating strategy? I kind of touched on this already. Technology solutions that deliver value. We're in a hot spot right now. All of our customers on that side, they're under extreme and -- you're probably meeting with some of them these next few days. The banks are under a lot of regulatory duress. And we're providing solutions that are helping them out.</p><p>They also need to reduce costs. They're not making as much fee income as they used to, so our value prop to the banks is very, very compelling, and that's why we're confident about getting that mid single-digit organic revenue growth. Perhaps we can even do better.</p><p>But, again, I can't stress it enough. We had our mortgage servicing conference about a month ago, and the number-one thing we heard from all of the clients is it's unquantifiable litigation and regulatory risk. And so we're hitting them with solutions that help mitigate that problem. It's a very -- no one else has what we have, so there's no other servicing platform that can do what ours does. So we're in a very strong competitive position to continue to grow that business.</p><p>As I mentioned, on our ServiceLink side, just take more share of wallet. Our clients there are still the large banks, and the same story -- and this is kind of important for ServiceLink. If you look at the real estate settlement business in the United States, there's still lots of competitors. If you're a bank, now the regulators are forcing the banks to vet their vendors. And we want that because that trend will benefit the large providers like ourselves, and there's still -- for example, we go to Chase, they use 20 different settlement service providers, and Chris Azur, that runs this business, will talk to banks as they listen.</p><p>We have the FFIEC, the CFPB, we've been vetted as number 18, had anybody in there. What happens if there's a problem? Do they have a balance sheet that they could stand up behind the risk that they're taking? So we think, over time, this regulatory cloud is benefiting us and other large vendors because we will push that story. There is no reason why Chase should do business with 20 vendors. It's too risky for them.</p><p>The problem is is that they have a vendor manager, and if you took away all the vendors for him to manage, he'd lost a job. So that's why those relationships up at the CFO and with the head attorneys and the risk and compliance people, that's who you talk to. Then they force down the decisions to reduce the 18 to 20 that Chase is using, down to three. And we would pick up more share of wallet in that regard.</p><p>We are best-in-class. I mean, if you talk to any of our customers, and you stay on this settlement service side, they will say ServiceLink, when we get our surveys back, we think that we're number one, and our clients would say that we're number-one.</p><p>We're the only ones, too, that really try to mix in the technology assets with our products. And a lot of our competitors don't have those technology assets. For example, when we sell a loan origination platform to one of our clients, we'll embed [releasee]. Releasee is this electronic hub that connects all the lenders to all of these settlement service providers, including ourselves, but we get a click fee. Every time a lender orders any settlement service that was on the network, we get a fee. So we'll make sure that our LOS system has that attached to it.</p><p>We also make sure that it's easy to order our product. It's right into their workflow system. So if they want to order a Fidelity product, they just click -- boom -- it's in their workflow. If they want to order somebody else, that's fine, but it might be a little bit harder to order somebody else's. That's the advantage of having the technology and embedding your products into that technology.</p><p>This is a very volatile business because of the re-fi oriented. So, again, we always push our managers to monitor their operating metrics to reduce staff and do what they can in volatile markets, and particularly this segment of the market was down 70% Q1'13 to Q1'14, yet we still made a profit. Most competitors in that division, they lost a lot of money. And you'll see the benefits of the synergies start really flowing through in Q2 and Q3.</p><p>US real estate market overview -- I'm not predicting anything. Existing home sales -- this is just all factual stuff. We're at about 5.1 million existing home sales in 2013. Certainly, substantially lower than what happened at the peak. Right now, as we look at headwinds for that business in 2014, lending standards are tough. I mean, the banks are being forced to make loans to strong credit-quality borrowers.</p><p>Well, as you can appreciate, not everybody has strong credit. So we need credit standards to loosen and, historically, they do. Other headwinds is their inventory, on the right-hand side of this page. It's at 1.9 million units. That's historically low. We need more people to put their homes on the market. So when you have low inventory, you will experience in certain markets spikes and prices, simple supply and demand. So we need more inventory out there.</p><p>But, typically, prices then will lead to more inventory, and then we think the federal government, typically, is very friendly to US consumers on buying houses. So we need credit standards to ease, and then that should be the catalyst then to get the 5.1 million units of something substantially higher.</p><p>Now, interestingly, at the bottom half of the page, in 2013, 2012 we experienced a market that was 70% refinanced and 30% purchased. So 70% of the market was people just getting a lower rate and refinancing their mortgages; 30% was people buying a newer existing home.</p><p>Our average fee per file was about $1,300 because we make about $1,000 per refinance transaction and about $2,000, on average, on a purchase deal. If you flip to the right-hand side of the page, we think the markets now move to more of a 70% purchase market, 30% re-fi, just given the bump-up in rates. But our fee per file, on a blended basis, using the same math, would increase with 1,300 to 1,700. So we could withstand a drop yet still make very good margins because we're getting more fee-per-file. And you saw that in the first quarter versus our fee-per-file was substantially higher in our first quarter of 2014 versus the prior year. So we could withstand some drop-off in the mortgage market and still make good money.</p><p>And we don't have a cost accounting system, but we make more raw dollars on $2,000 per order even though there's more labor associated with processing a purchase order, it's more money in our pocket versus a refinance on an order-by-order basis.</p><p>Now talking about our tracking stock. Again, these shares will be distributed to FNF shareholders following an affirmative vote at the end of June. If you own these shares, you will get the value of our noncore investments, what we call our \"portfolio company\" investments. And at the time of distribution, it will be about -- our book value is $1.350 billion, about $4.72 per share.</p><p>That is not fair market value, and I'll give you some more detail on that in a second. We said that for every three shares of FNF you own, you'll get one share of the tracker. So the share price will be closer to -- just south of 15, so 3x $4.72 if it trades near our book value. The only other difference is that we'll still manage these businesses the same way that we do today. It's not a separate company, so I'll still oversee, on a day-to-day basis, the performance of the business. It still reports up to our Board of Directors.</p><p>We're not going to experience any incremental costs other than some modest accounting, because we'll have separate supplemental financial statements for our core business, FNF, and then for FNFV. So there will be a little bit more accounting going on. We'll have our consolidated statements, which won't be relevant anymore. We'll have FNF, which will be relevant for our core investors and FNFV, which will be relevant for the FNFV investors.</p><p>When we have shareholder votes, they're going to treat -- basically, we're issuing, like, 90 new million shares, but when we vote on Board of Directors, on anything that shareholders have the right to vote on, all those shares will be aggregated. So FNFV shareholders will vote on matters affecting all of FNF.</p><p>What's our strategy? We believe, as we look at our history and what we've been able to do, we've -- under Bill Foley's leadership, we grew from, really, nothing to be the largest title insurance company in the country. We grew a company called FIS, which is publicly traded, to be the largest Sintec processor in the world. Its enterprise value is over $20 billion.</p><p>We know how to build businesses, and what we're good at is finding good management, putting money behind good management, and aggressively growing businesses. So what do we do with these portfolio company investments? We try to take significant ownership stake. So we sit on the Board, we help direct strategy, we make sure that the leadership is doing the right thing. If not, we'll change leadership. We direct M&amp;A strategies, and then we'll direct disposition strategies.</p><p>Operations -- we just use our track record. I mean, we do view that we're good drivers of business, so we try to leverage our operational expertise. We have a lot of talent in our business. When we find a new company, I'll bring in our key ops guys that are relevant for that business and make sure, particularly on the cost side, that their accounting is in order, their legal is in order, their IT infrastructure is in order, and et cetera.</p><p>Governance -- we're on the Board, and we help direct that strategy. And then monetization, we've done almost every transaction that you can imagine -- spinoffs, splitoffs, recaps. We know how to properly dispose of businesses. We could take them public, we could spin them out, and all of those strategies are still available to us to get the most for our shareholders.</p><p>Here is a quick overview of some of the companies in our -- that are in our portfolio. We have Remy, which is an auto -- starters and alternators, electronic motors, hybrid motors company. It deals both in the aftermarket space. So if you have an older car, and it needs a new starter and alternator, we sell those.</p><p>On the OEM side, the big clients are General Motors, Hyundai. On the heavy-duty side, Caterpillar, et cetera. It's a great company, publicly traded. It's on our books for $19.25 a share. It's publicly traded right now, and it's at over $24 a share. We have 16.3 million shares. So the difference between what it's currently trading at, what it's on our books. You can kind of do that math there. It's actually -- it's doing well. We feel that this is the most mature investment and probably be the first that we've looked at to figure out the right strategy to monetize.</p><p>The second company I'll highlight is American Blue Ribbon Holdings. It's about $1.2 billion of revenue. We have it on our books right now for about $150 million, and it's really about 4x EBITDA. Comparable companies trade between 8x to 11x EBITDA. So, clearly, what we have it on the books, fair market value would suggest there's a lot of upside there. It trades in the casual and family dining segments -- 640 restaurants, great management led by [Hawson Lewis]. This guy is incredible.</p><p>We -- originally, it was a $400 million revenue business. We bought two other companies. This guy is just one of the best operators that we've seen. And, again, when we find good operators, we know how rare they are, we'll put money behind them and help them grow their businesses. This one, we think, would be a good candidate to take public.</p><p>On the J. Alexander side, it's more upscale dining. It's on our books for about $100 million, 6x EBITDA, comparable companies trade at double that.</p><p>Digital Insurance is on our books for $130 million. It's about 8x EBITDA, comparable companies are kind of in the 12x range. It's the nation's leading employee benefits brokerage company, so helping employers manage through the health care stuff and provide plans. We bought it at a perfect time. There was a lot of noise surrounding Obamacare, the American Affordability Care Act, and we bought it at a very attractive price, and this one has terrific growth opportunities.</p><p>Two other ones that we have on our books are Ceridian and ComData. Ceridian is a payroll processing company. It also has a very attractive workforce management software, and it helps -- it's called Dayforce, and it helps -- not only does it do payroll, but it also schedules employees to be most cost-efficient given the nature of business that the company uses it for.</p><p>ComData is a payments processor. It is a jewel of a company. It's in the long haul trucking industry in the United States, but it's one of the largest prepaid companies, corporate payments companies, and then in the long haul segment they have all the -- substantially, all of the long haul companies -- the truckers and the truck stops, and it's like an ecosystem with a payments card that tracks -- they use it for fuel, they use it for their salaries, they use it for their per diem. All the information is reloaded into the trucking company's accounting systems to track. It's a terrific, terrific company. It's on our books for $331 million, which is about on the aggregate. Both these companies combined, about 10x EBITDA.</p><p>EDP Paychex on the payroll side, and some softwares of service, workforce companies, they trade between 12x to 20x. And that Dayforce business is growing like a weed.</p><p>And then on the payment side, again, there's Fleetcorp, Wright Express, and they trade at 12x to 20x EBITDA, too. So we think we have some room for some nice value creation opportunity there.</p><p>And, with that, I'll turn it over to Tony to quickly go over the financial highlights.</p><p>TONY PARK, CFO, FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC.: Thanks, Brent. I don't know how much time I have. I don't think I have a lot, so I'll go quickly.</p><p>Consolidated financial highlights -- you can see a three-year trend here -- $4.8 billion back in 2011, grew to $7.2 billion in 2012, and $8.6 billion in 2013. Clearly, a nice trajectory there. A big part of that, though, relates to the consolidation of Remy and the Restaurant Group that Brent mentioned. We consolidated the Restaurant Group in the early part of 2012 when we took a controlling interest in ABRH, and then later that year in August of 2012, when we took a controlling interest in Remy, we consolidated that business. So that's why you see a large jump in revenue in other revenue and also in pretax earnings we had about $200 million in pretax gains associated with the consolidation of those two businesses.</p><p>Let me jump over to FNF core business for a moment and, again, core is separate from FNFV. Our core business represents our title business as well as our Black Knight business and our ServiceLink business, and ServiceLink is combined within our title segment in our financials.</p><p>And, again, you can see a nice growth trajectory in the core segment. We don't -- we acquired LPS in January of 2014, so those results aren't in any of the prior-year periods. But if you look at the adjusted EBITDA, you see $179 million in the first quarter of 2013 up against $148 million in the first quarter of 2014.</p><p>Pretax earnings, you see a big negative of $100 million and, really, that reflects a lot of merger-related items that we incurred in the first quarter as we closed the LPS transaction, including merger costs of about $41 million, severance expenses of about $39 million, synergy bonus accrual of $32 million, and purchase price amortization of $75 million. That's why you see adjusted earnings are far different than what we show on our reported basis. Adjusted net earnings were $74 million, or $0.26 per share.</p><p>FNFV revenue -- you see it jump from $18 million in 2011. We consolidated those businesses in 2012, so that jumped up to $1.5 billion in 2012 and then the full year is reflected in 2013, $2.6 billion in total revenue.</p><p>On an adjusted EBITDA basis, we have $58 million in the first quarter of 2014. The difference between our adjusted net earnings of $10 million and our GAAP net earnings of a $16 million loss relates to a settlement at ComData. There was a litigation case settled in that business, and we took a hit on that one-time settlement.</p><p>Turning quickly to the balance sheet, we have total assets in our core business of $12.1 billion after the acquisition of LPS, total liabilities of $6.9 billion, equity including non-controlling interests of $5.2 billion. You can see debt in our core segment is at $3 billion, which reflects the borrowing that we had of about $2 billion for the acquisition of LPS.</p><p>And then, finally, just to recap the highlights that Brent touched on -- we are the largest provider of title insurance, technology and transaction services to the real estate and mortgage industries. We have a 35% market share in the title business with leading margins. We're the biggest in loan origination and servicing technology solutions as well as data and analytics.</p><p>Through ServiceLink, we're the largest centralized mortgage settlement services provider, and we do have a mix of both cyclical and counter-cyclical real estate businesses. We've demonstrated over many years a very strong performance especially in times when they're very difficult. That's when we do our best work.</p><p>We've talked about this is a clear way -- FNF is a clear way to benefit from an investment in a recovering real estate market. We're in every market, residential purchase, residential refinance, commercial purchase, commercial refinance, direct agency, default, and loan growth. So we feel like it's a great place to participate in that recovery.</p><p>And, as Brent mentioned, we have a track record of creating significant value for shareholders over a long period of time.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

Boston-based Fidelity owned about 4 percent of Buffalo Wild Wings' stock at the end of March, down from 15 percent three months earlier, according to a regulatory filing made late Thursday. Fidelity portfolio managers Steven Wymer and Gavin Baker, currently crushing rival managers returns with big tech stock bets, led the way as the mutual fund giant sold 1.85 million shares in Buffalo Wild Wings during the first quarter. </p><p>Activist hedge fund Marcato Capital Management, which owns 6 percent of Buffalo Wild Wings, has been courting big shareholders as it seeks to replace the company's chief executive officer, Sally Smith, and win board seats. Wymer's US$36 billion Fidelity Growth Company Fund owned no Buffalo Wild Wings shares at the end of March, according to the regulatory filing. At the end of February, the fund owned 368,831 shares; it had reported owning 600,000 shares at the end of 2016. The fund's year-to-date total return of 15.75 percent is double the S&amp;P 500's 7.74 percent gain, according to Morningstar Inc data, as of Thursday. Wymer has beat 83 percent of his peers during that period. Baker's US$14.8 billion Fidelity OTC Portfolio also held no Buffalo Wild Wings shares at the end of March, the filing shows. At the end of 2016, the fund owned 255,600 shares. The OTC Portfolio's year-to-date total return of 19.78 percent is beating 99 percent of actively managed large-cap growth funds. A Fidelity spokesman declined to comment. Marcato last month ratcheted up the pressure on Buffalo Wild Wings by calling on Smith, who's held the top job since 1996, to retire and urging fellow shareholders to vote for its slate of four directors at the June 2 annual meeting. The hedge fund wants management to franchise more of its stores, increase sales and raise profit margins. Buffalo Wild Wings' shares traded at US$156.30 on Friday afternoon, up 1 percent for the year-to-date. Marcato has said that the share price could top US$400 in the next four years if its plans for improvement are implemented. Not all Fidelity managers have a negative view. Patrick Venanzi's US$2.9 billion Small Cap Growth Fund built a new position of 205,200 shares during the first quarter. Buffalo Wild Wings accounted for 1.2 percent of the fund's assets.

He suspects this Dimon has lost its sparkle. And to heat other banks worldwide.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The heat coming down on bankers around the world but nothing is compared to the scorcher blistering parts of the United States and triggering deadly storms. Millions waking up this morning without electricity and temperatures in some places are over 100 degrees.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Chinese economy anything but hot and continues to cool down. The latest PMI reading indicates that factory production and exports continues to plunge as investors wonder what happens when the world global engine begins to stall.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And what's old is new again in Mexico where voters hand power to the political party that ruled for 70 years but was swept from office more than a decade ago only to return on this Monday, July the 2nd, 2012.</p><p>Good morning, everybody. Well, I'm back from vacation. Connell is not here. He runs for the hills when he knows he has to be with me. I'm Dagen McDowell everybody. This is BEST OF IMUS.</p><p>And we've got some incredible interviews that the I-man did recently. Coming up this hour, Jose Rodriguez. And also Imus on Imus, not blonde on blonde. Deirdre, Imus and Wyatt Imus go head to head. I missed that last week and I cannot wait to see that.</p><p>Meantime, let's bring you up to date on what is happening in the global markets. And first, we start with Asia. The Hong Kong market was closed for a holiday today. And we had some mixed reaction there. Again, that reading on Chinese factory activity did come in better than expected, somewhat better than expected. The Nikkei was lower, one with the Kospi and South Korea. But the Shanghai managed to tick up just a bit. But the ASX 200 index was also higher.</p><p>We have gains across the board, potentially we follow a reaction to what happened with European leaders and the changes in that bailout facility to help Italy and Spain. We'll see if that lasts. Coming up, we'll talk to a guest from Europe, from London.</p><p>Let's take a look at the futures here in the U.S. It looks like a positive start. Again, the markets closed early tomorrow. Off on Wednesday. Very busy week for data with that critical jobs report coming out on Friday. And we have essentially flat lines there. Not flat but down. Oil and gold with gold falling almost one percent. Oil is down two percent this morning.</p><p>For more on the European markets, let's go live to London where we're joined by Jane Foley, senior foreign currency strategist for Rabobank. Jane, how long does the euphoria from that deal struck by European leaders last? Do you think that we can even get a couple more days out of this in terms of gains?</p><p>JANE FOLEY, RABOBANK SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST: Well, that's really the big question and that will be the question that prevail over the next few weeks. It is quite likely that we'll get decent support from this over the next few weeks, perhaps over the next few months. But I think as we've already been seen, there was already some skepticism entering in here and there's still a lot of pit holes thrown up by what was agreed last week. And a lot of uncertainty about the details too.</p><p>You've already mentioned the banking supervisions. How long is it going to take for Europe to get a single banking supervisor? And what exactly, what should have shaken this at going to be? And there's also about the ESM too. There's been some complaints in some European countries about the seniority the announcement last week, that the ESM would not be seen here to -- holders of Spanish government debt. So, again some confusion today and therefore some backtracking. More consultative tone I think we should say in some markets in Europe this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What is the next great hurdle for the European markets? What is the next meeting, piece of news that you were looking to that we can count on -- give us some direction in these markets?</p><p>FOLEY: Well, of course, we do have the ECB policy meeting on Thursday. Many people expecting a rate cut there because of course the very slow growth conditions in Europe. Beyond that, we have a finance ministers meeting on July the ninth. But that will be important because the market is expecting more detail about the purchase that were announced last week.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What also is the reaction to the resignation to the chairman of Barclays, the livewire scandal there, what it means for other banks not just in Europe but around the globe?</p><p>FOLEY: Well, of course, Barclays is one of the first banks to come through and pay the fine and be fully investigated in the scandal. But I think many people in many parts of the world are waiting for what else is going to come. And there could be further bad news ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jane, thank you so much. Jane Foley, senior foreign currency strategist for Rabobank.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at the Asian markets. And for that, we go to FOX Business contributor Katie Sargent. She joins us on the phone from Singapore. Hey, Katie, reaction to that factory report from China.</p><p>KATIE SARGENT, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: That seems to be something that's taking the markets, taking the wind out of the market sails today, Dagen. Most of the markets in the region started the day pretty strong, still kind of riding that wave of euphoria on the agreement from last week over the European banks. But that quickly waned when we started looking at PMI numbers.</p><p>We saw more evidence of a slowdown in China over the weekend. The official Purchasing Managers Index for June came out showing a drop from May. It was better than expected but still showed a drop. And there was a private PMI report released today that also showed activities shrank in June. They are a little bit in disagreement over the final number but both are showing a slowdown.</p><p>So, the session started quite positive for the region. Australia's benchmark ASX 200 was up nearly one percent. But then as I say, things slowdown, the Nikkei in Japan hit a two-month in today high before faltering and finishing the day little changed. Not much movement in the rest of the markets either -- Dagen.</p><p>MACEDO: Thank you so much, Katie. Katie Sargent on the phone from Singapore. Thank you so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Now, for a closer look at the U.S. markets and a preview of how things will shape up today, we go to our very own Lauren Simonetti from the Newsroom. Good morning, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Good morning. The fireworks were lit early on Wall Street with stellar gains for the major averages. The Dow rocketing 277 points on Friday. June, great months too with gains of at least 3.8 percent for the three major averages. This first trading day of July will be a busy one and an equally busy week. National manufacturing figures on tap. Auto sales tomorrow. And that key government jobs report for June is out on Friday.</p><p>Speaking of jobs, they are moving off of Wall Street. The trend is called near shoring. It's where big financial tightened higher and relocated workers to cities like Salt Lake, City, Utah. And Jacksonville, Florida where rent, taxes and labor all cost less.</p><p>Silicon Valley is seeing a similar exodus. That's the big tech giant find saving in other U.S. cities. And how do you read it? \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" laying off bookstore shelves. EL James' erotic novel became the nation's fastest selling paper back to reach one million sales.</p><p>Nelson book scan (ph) finds that it took 11 weeks to reach that mark, that was 25 weeks faster than the previous record holder, \"The Vinci Code.\" Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Lauren, thank you so much. I will say nothing about that book since I have not read it and have no plans to read it. Now, we go to our Newsroom and Diane Macedo who has a look at more business news for you this morning. Hey, Diane.</p><p>DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: I will say nothing about the book because my mother is watching.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p><person><nameText>Barclays Chairman Marcus Agius </nameText></person>has resigned in the wake of the bank's interest rate raging scandal. Agius who has been the chairman for more than five years says, the scandal has dealt a devastating blow to Barclays' reputation. And at the buck stops with him, he will stay in the position until a succession plan is in place.</p><p>You might remember the bank was fined more than $450 million last week by a British and U.S. regulators for submitting false documents on the London interbank offered interest rate, which the rate at which banks lend unsecured funds to each other. Barclays has admitted that some of its traders attempted to manipulate that rate. Agius' resignation is seen as an attempt to take some pressure off CEO Bob Dimon who along with Agius also is facing calls to resign.</p><p>Airbus is set to unveil plans for its first U.S. factory today. The company's parent, European Aeronautic Defense and Space plans to spend $600 million to build a facility in Mobile, Alabama. Once it opens in 2015, the plant is expected to create 1,000 jobs and will reportedly produce four planes a month by 2017. The move also puts the facility on the home turf of U.S. rival Boeing which has 2700 employees in Alabama as well.</p><p>Bristol-Myers Squibb is buying diabetes drug maker Amylin Pharmaceuticals for $5.3 billion. That breakdown to $31 dollars a share, nine dollars higher. And the offer Bristol-Myers reportedly made back in March. Now, if you include debt, the deal is worth a total of $7 billion.</p><p>In addition, Bristol-Myers will enter into an alliance with British drug maker Astra Zeneca to developed and commercialize Amylin's diabetes drugs. Astra Zeneca will pay Bristol-Myers $3.4 billion in that deal, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Diane. Following attacks on 9/11, the CIA was instructed to protect Americans by any means necessary. Some of the agency's methods were later questioned but a new book by former CIA operative Jose Rodriguez defends the tactics used to fight the terrorists. Rodriguez was on recently to discuss it all with the I-man.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DON IMUS, HOST, \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\": Please welcome to the program Jose Rodriguez, has got a book called \"The Hard Measures: How Aggressive CIA Actions after 9/11 Saved Americans Lives.\" Mr. Rodriguez, sits here and listening to me. Juan use vial language to try and apologize for it.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And two, scream and swear at the recorded commercials which makes me pretty much a mental patient. Anyway, first of all, good morning, Mr. Rodriguez.</p><p>JOSE RODRIGUEZ, \"HARD MEASURES\" AUTHOR: Thank you.</p><p>IMUS: How are you?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Thank you for inviting me on the show.</p><p>IMUS: I saw you on \"60 Minutes.\" How did that go?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: That went well. You know, it was my first time out doing this. I was a 31-year CIA veteran and clandestinity was my thing. And coming out in the open like that was a new one for me. So, far so good.</p><p>IMUS: Were you covert operations for the entire 31 years?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: I was covert operative for 31 years.</p><p>IMUS: OK. So, were you at the University of Florida? Is that where you went to school?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Yes, I did.</p><p>IMUS: And you were recruited there?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: No. I left the university and I sent an application. And it takes awhile but a couple of years later, I was recruited.</p><p>IMUS: You sent an application to the CIA?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Yes.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Why did you want do that?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: I have lived in Latin America all my life, had traveled overseas, was interested in foreign affairs, was interested in that type of life. And, you know, I was always interested in the CIA. So, when it came to time, I was very fortunate to get recruited.</p><p>IMUS: What did you tell people you do?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Well, usually you know, I was assigned overseas for 17 years, so I had State Department cover, so I was a State Department official forever.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So, that's what you -- they didn't know you were in the CIA?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Well, you know, it's kind of a game. I think most people know who you are, you know. And then when you become chief of station, you become declared to that country.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: So, the official, the local service, knows who you are. And, you know, they can tell anybody else. So, it's one of those things that you do but it doesn't matter much. You still have to do your job.</p><p>IMUS: Now, the secrets you reveal, I guess they are, in this book and the techniques, methods and all that stuff, why did you do this? Was it a good idea or?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: No, I did not reveal any secrets.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: I mean, they were already exposed. As a matter of fact, President Obama released the legal opinion that has all these techniques. He did it in 2009 against the advice of a couple of CIA directors because he was concerned that he would give away to the enemy exactly the outer limits of what was permissible under U.S. law, so.</p><p>IMUS: Permissible in terms of interrogation?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: In terms of the law, what our law permits for how far we can go, yes, in interrogating prisoners.</p><p>IMUS: OK. And so, you decided to do the book for what reason?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: I decided to write the book to set the record straight because to me, it is unbelievable the amount of misinformation that has been out there regarding our programs after 9/11. I wrote the book because I was the subject of a criminal investigation for three years for destroying some tapes and I never got the chance to say my side of the story.</p><p>And I wrote the book because there are a lot of people who are still caught up in investigations that are very unfair and are suffering a lot because of it, because they did what our government asked them to do.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, paramount at the top tier of misinformation, what would be the biggest misconception that the general public, people like me and others, would be embracing?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: That the enhanced interrogation techniques were torture.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: That's the top.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, it sounds to me -- of course it's just me -- but like it could have been fun but just me, but people think -- I've got a couple of people a little while ago, one of whom thought that we never got any good information, water boarding people.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Tat is such --</p><p>IMUS: Nonsense.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Can I say crap in radio?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Because we got thousands of intelligence reports. We were able to disrupt plots. We were able to capture high-level terrorists. We were able to destroy the al-Qaeda organization that attacked us on 9/11 because of the work that we did.</p><p>IMUS: So, the people say, well, when you torture people, they'll simply tell you what they think you want to hear but --</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Well, first of all, this is not torture.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: And second of all, we're smarter than that. You know, we have people who are world experts on al-Qaeda and actually know quite a bit about these individuals already. So, we've vetted them very closely and check it. And, you know, these people eventually come through with a lot of really good stuff.</p><p>IMUS: Of course, one of you guys are lawyers. And like lawyers, you already know the answer to the question before you ask it. You just want to see if they're willing to give it to you, so.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Yes, I think the key is knowledge. I mean, the key to a good interrogation is knowledge. How much knowledge do you know of the target? Because if you do, then they can't fool you.</p><p>IMUS: So, leading up to the murder of -- murder, assassination, whatever of Osama -- the killing of Osama bin Laden, what led up to that?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: As you know, it was a ten-year effort. We started to look --</p><p>IMUS: A lot of people don't know that.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Yes. Well, it was a ten-year effort. We started looking for Bin Laden the day after 9/11.</p><p>IMUS: Right. Well, I guess they knew that but they didn't know that it was a concentrated effort in intelligence gathering and so on. So, walk me through that if you can.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Yes. Interestingly, because if you had asked me in 2002, how long it would take to get Bin Laden, I would take you 18 months, two years perhaps. Because I figured eventually, we would find him. But he took himself out of the day-to-day running of al-Qaeda, and he decided he would become the symbolic figure. So, he gave up his day-to-day duties and moved to a compound in Pakistan and communicated with al-Qaeda central via courier.</p><p>And the courier would go by every two or three months to deliver messages from him to the principals of the organization. So until we found the courier, we would not be able to find Bin Laden. And finding the courier took a long time because it's one person. And we started to get some information in 2004 about the courier. We got the pseudonym of the courier...</p><p>IMUS: How did you get that? Through enhance interrogation.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: We got that from interrogating at one of our black sites, a facilitator that we had captured.</p><p>IMUS: What is a black site?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: A black site is the location where we would take this terrorist to, to interrogate.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: And it was a secure location. It was secure and secret, and we hid in plain sight in different parts of the world so that we could have total access, unrestricted access that we controlled to the detainee.</p><p>IMUS: Were you all at the agency and you and everybody, were you surprised that you turned up in Pakistan?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: No. We always thought he was in Pakistan. So, I'm not surprised.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Were you surprised that -- it seemed like a relatively easy -- I mean once they decided to go ahead and storm the compound, it seemed like a fairly easy operation. Maybe I'm just na[ve or --</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: No, I think, you know, we got the best Special Forces in the world, and I'm sure that they do this and do it very well. So, I think that once, you know, the hardest part is to find the guy, in my view. I think that once you have the target, our special operators can plan it and with the precision and the fire power and their skill, you know, I don't think there's anybody better in the world.</p><p>IMUS: So, what impact on the whole global terror operation did killing him have?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: He was a symbolic figure. As I said before, he was not running operations day to day. He was sending pronouncements, I would like to attack America. I would like to, you know, do this and the other. But he had no direct impact on the day-to-day planning of operations, but he was still a symbolic figure and it was important to kill him.</p><p>IMUS: What did they -- did the CIA have to sign off on your book or?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Yes, they had to review it. You know, the manuscript is turned over to them. And they go through the publication review board. And they take some stuff out. And we know we discussed with them some things and take some things out. And agree on others. So, yes, it's a process.</p><p>IMUS: Congratulations. \"60 Minutes\" and all these other programs. You can't help but have a bestseller. I hope you do, so.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Thank you so much. Thanks for inviting me.</p><p>IMUS: By the way, thanks for your service to our country.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Thank you so much.</p><p>IMUS: Jose Rodriguez, \"Hard Measures.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: When we come back, everybody, we'll have more news for you business and otherwise.

They battle it out on some very interesting topics.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAL)</p><p>MCDOWELL: We take you around the world at a look at Asian markets. First, mixed markets there but very, very slight losses in Japan and South Korea. A slight gain on the Shanghai. But again, Hong Kong closed for holiday. Gains across the board in Europe.</p><p>Again, follow on euphoria from that European agreement, effort to bail out the banks in that country. Flat futures here in the U.S. but after those gains last week and then take a look at oil and gold. Oil, however, continued to tumble down almost two percent. I kind of like that.</p><p>And now, some of the news stories making headlines this morning. Utility crews working in blistering heat trying to restore power to hundreds of thousands along the northeast corridor. A violent storm causing damage from Indiana to New Jersey. And authorities confirming at least 13 deaths as a result.</p><p>FOX News correspondent Elizabeth Prann had the latest from Charleston,, West Virginia.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ELIZABETH PRANN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Among those killed in the severe weather, two young boys in New Jersey. They were camping and crushed by a downed tree.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Fifty foot tall pine tree snapped. It fell on a tent that was occupied by two boys, a 7-year-old and 2-year-old.</p><p>PRANN: Powerful winds and frequent lightning whipped through the Mid- Atlantic States Friday night.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: It sounds like the fourth of July. There was a major late show, I mean, the lightning didn't stop for about 90 minutes.</p><p>PRANN: An Amtrak train traveling from New York to Chicago waylaid in West Virginia by downed trees.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I heard the weather and heard the stuff hitting inside of the train.

Governor Rick Scott saying, the state will not comply with the Supreme Court ruling to expand medicaid and implement insurance exchanges. Wisconsin and Louisiana to other states with republican governors also opting out of the two provisions last week. The health care law will take full effect in January 2014 but republican lawmakers are vowing to repeal it before then.</p><p>A fiesta of democracy, that is what Enrique Pena Nieto is calling his victory in Mexico's presidential election. The official preliminary count gives Pena Nieto about 38 percent of the vote. Pena Nieto is part of the institutional revolutionary party which was voted out of office in 2000 after 71 years in power. The president-elect is promising Mexicans a government that is democratic, modern and open to criticism. The PRI, the party as it's known, was long accused of ruling the country through authoritarian and corrupt practices.</p><p>And Spain does it again beating Italy four to nothing in the European championship last night. It is Spain's third straight major soccer title. Tens of thousands of fans gathering in central Madrid to see the team win. Fireworks and celebrations give temporary relief to the country's economic crisis.</p><p>Apparently, you can still play soccer if you're a broke nation. The team becomes the first to win a euro and then a world cup and then another euro. Cheers all around.</p><p>Let's go up to Diane Macedo who has a look at business news this morning. Diane, did you watch any of it?</p><p>MACEDO: I didn't actually. I didn't get a chance to. But I do love watching soccer. I heard it was a great game.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yap. Indeed.</p><p>MACEDO: Busy working. But Facebook executives have decided to keep the company stock listed on the NASDAQ despite issues surrounding its IPO. This is according to the \"Wall Street Journal\" which says, the company had considered moving its shares off the NASDAQ in the days following its trading debut, but now feel that would erode confidence in the shares even further.</p><p>Facebook's executives have quietly blamed the NASDAQ for the glitches in the IPO. But officials say that -- officials at the exchange that is are working to repair the relationship. Dow is closely wrapping up its efforts to buy quest software. According to reports, the deal could be announced as early as today.</p><p>There's still no word on a final price but last week Dell offered roughly $2.3 billion for quest which offered software to help businesses manage their data bases. Dell's latest offer was better than the one made by a private equity group led by inside ventures partners which is also have been bidding on quest for the last few months. If Dell does finalizes the deal, it will mark the company's latest effort to expand beyond its core business of personal computers.</p><p>And a movie about a foul-mouthed teddy bear was the top ticket at the box office this weekend. Ted took in more than $50 million in North America beating Channing Tatum's steamy role as a male stripper in \"Magic Mike.\" Walt Disney's animated fairy tale brave which was last week's number one fell to third place.</p><p>Tyler Perry's new film \"Madea's Witness Protection\" and \"Madagascar 3\" round out the top 5 -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: If you're going to talk about \"Magic Mike,\" we got to role some video, I'm sorry (INAUDIBLE) at the full screen -- but just Dagen, thanks Diane.</p><p>Right now, we want to get a look at the business travelers' forecast for you. And we go to Maria Molina who is standing by in the FOX Business Weather Center. Maria, what do you know?</p><p>MARIA MOLINA, METEOROLOGIST: Hey, Dagen. And we're looking at some showers and thunderstorms still rolling through portions of the Carolinas, Georgia, the State of Alabama and also the Florida panhandle but nothing like what we saw last night or in the overnight hours when we saw over 800 reports of severe weather, a lot of them coming from this region where we're still dealing with some lingering showers across parts of the Carolinas down into Florida.</p><p>Now we're still going to be seeing very hot temperatures. So our heat wave is going to continue not just for today but even over most of this work week. So 90 will be your high in New York City; 96 in Chicago and Atlanta; and upper 90's in the city of Denver. So it's going to be another scorcher. And of course Dagen when you factor in the humidity, it feels even hotter during the afternoon.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you. Maria Molina, our meteorologist in Fox Business.</p><p>Coming up after the break, we'll check on the markets for you. And stay tuned for an Imus family interview as the I-man gives both Deirdre Imus and his son Wyatt an opportunity to battle it out over the air waves. Stick around as this best of Imus on the Fox Business Network continues.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: The live, more scandal cost <person><nameText>Barclays chairman Marcus Agius </nameText></person>his job, puts CEO Bob Dimon in the sights of politician who thinks Dimon has lost his sparkle and also threatens to hit other banks worldwide.</p><p>The heat coming down on bankers, but it's nothing compared to the scorcher blistering parts of the U.S. and triggering deadly storms. Millions wake up this morning without electricity while temperatures in some places top 100 degrees.</p><p>Welcome back everybody. I'm Dagen McDowell here on this Best of Imus in the Morning. We've got your markets for you and so much more. Some incredible guests coming up in the next couple of hours include Dana Perena (ph). And we'll show you a special little new addition to her family if you haven't been watching The Five. Well, shame on you if you haven't been watching The Five.</p><p>In the meantime, we'll take you around the world and look at stocks in Asia. First we had a mixed market with just slight losses in Japan and South Korea, slight gain on the Shanghai. Hong Kong closed.</p><p>But European markets are up across the board, up nearly 1 percent in Germany and then in France as well. Again, more positive reaction to the bailout decision from those European leaders last week.</p><p>We had incredible numbers on the stock market here. Stocks are essentially flat. It's going to be kind of a funny week, if you will, with the markets closed for July 4 on Wednesday. And then nothing funny about a drop in oil. We kind of love that. Oil is off its lows in the session so far, but still down about $1.50 a barrel.</p><p>For more on the European markets, let's go live to London. Where we're joined by Mike Ingram, market analyst for BGC Partners.</p><p>Mike, great of you to be here this morning. How long does this excitement last, do you think?</p><p>MARK INGRAM, BGC PARTNERS: Well, I think this market probably has a bit of legs to it. I mean, the other thing that's likely to further support the market during the course of the week is the ECB decision on Thursday. And there there's wide expectation that we will see a rate cut and they might even fiddle around with the deposit rates to try to get some of that commercial banking cash off the central bank's balance sheet.</p><p>But yeah, I mean, there is clearly a lot of analysis out of what came out of Brussels on Friday. And we're putting it on Monday still feeling pretty perky.</p><p>MCDOWELL: In terms of fixing the financial problems that have plagued Europe and the nations there, when do you think a final fix is in? How many years are we looking at to have true kind of fiscal unity across the continent?</p><p>INGRAM: Well, if you can consider that it took something like 12 years to get the single currency up and running in the first place, we are certainly talking about months and years rather than weeks and months. And in fact, if you go back back to what was actually agreed on, on Friday -- and I wrote on this -- there are a lot of unanswered questions. For instance, everybody is saying Spain's bank is going to get cash up front it'll get directly in the banks. But none of that can happen until the European central bank, the ECB is there as a regulator. That's probably six months away.</p><p>So, yeah, this is going to be a long and torturous road. I guess we're all going to be commenting on it for a good long time yet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And then of course Spain, you know, wins the euro, the championship, yay, I guess. Thank you, Mike.</p><p>INGRAM: Yeah, there a lot of people suddenly Spanish over here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Exactly. We get that a lot here. Mike, thanks so much. Mike Ingram from BGC Partners.</p><p>INGRAM: It's my pleasure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Help may be just around the corner for struggling homeowners. A new government program is in the works even though previous ones have had little to no impact on the housing market.</p><p>Fox Business's Peter Barnes is in Washington, D.C. with the details -- Peter.</p><p>PETER BARNES, FOX BUSINESS sources say the White House is planning a big push this month to expand government mortgage refinance programs. The president announced this idea in his State of the Union Address in January, but now Senate Democrats produced three bills that the administration says would offer millions more homeowners lower interest rates on their mortgages. The refinances would be done through the FHA, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p><p>In recent weeks, Obama economic aides have been ramping up the push online and through social media.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We need congress to act to put this plan into action for real.</p><p>So we've talked about why we think refinancing is important. But we want to hear from you. We want to hear your stories.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARNES: Expect to see the president follow up at campaign events this month to put pressure on Republicans to support the legislation. And administration official says the White House and Senate Democrats are trying to work out a compromise with Senate Republicans to move the bills, but Democratic leaders are expected to bring them to a vote by the end of this month even if they can't get a deal.</p><p>But with no support for the measures in the Republican-controlled House, critics see this as an election-year play, a ploy for votes in key battle ground states hard hit by the housing crisis.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TERRY HAINES, POTOMAC RESEARCH GROUP: Sounds like something that is - - achieves their legislative goals, but at the same time is not something that in a practical sense is going to be able to have much impact before the election on homeowner refinancing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARNES: The Obama official says the Senate bills would be paid for mainly through higher closing costs and fees for borrowers, though one program would require $4 billion in funding from congress.</p><p>Back to you in New York.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, Peter. Peter Barnes in D.C.</p><p>Let's go to our news room and Diane Macedo who has a look at more business headlines.</p><p>Hey, Diane.</p><p>MACEDO: Hi Dagen.</p><p>So <person><nameText>Barclays chairman Marcus Agius </nameText></person>has resigned in the wake of the bank's interest rate rigging scandal. Agius who has been the chairman for more than five years says the scandal has dealt a devastating blow to Barclays reputation and the buck stops with him.</p><p>He will stay in position, though, until a succession plan is in place. The bank was fined more than $450 million last week by British and U.S. regulators for submitting false documents on a London Interbank Offered Interest Rate which is the rate at which banks lend unsecured funds to each other. Barclays admitted some of its trader attempted to manipulate that rate. The resignation is scene as an attempt to take the pressure off CEO Bob Dimon who is also facing calls to resign.</p><p>Germany's Linde is buying U.S.-based home oxygen provider Lincare Holdings for $4.6 billion. The deal breaks down to $41.50 a share, a 22 percent premium on its closing price Friday. Linde's main customers are in the steel and chemical sectors, but it also provides gases used to process solar cells and make LCD TV's.</p><p>Dagen, back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, Diane.</p><p>Usually it's Deirdre Imus versus Lis Wiehl squaring off on blonde on blonde, but this time it was Wyatt Imus who debated the issues with his mother Deirdre. And things did get a little heated. Here's some of that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DON IMUS: It's time for Blonde on Blonde with Deirdre Imus and ordinarily Lis Wiehl, But here filling in for Lis Wiehl, 13-year-old Wyatt Imus. Good morning, Mr. mus.</p><p>WYATT IMUS, DON IMUS' SON: Hey dad.</p><p>DON IMUS: How are you?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: I'm fine.</p><p>DON IMUS: Are you up to filling in for Lis?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Oh, yes. I think if I just don't get hammered by mom like Lis does, I'll be fine.</p><p>DON IMUS: Good morning, Ms. Imus.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS, DON IMUS' WIFE: Good morning.</p><p>DON IMUS: OK. So time for another addition of Blonde on Blonde.</p><p>So, what were you two bickering about?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Before, we were discussing what would you do without all your stuff surrounding you.</p><p>DON IMUS: What are you talking about?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: All your stuff.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Everywhere you go, you have like this stuff around you.</p><p>DON IMUS: I have a clock here.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: No, Dad. You have piles.</p><p>DON IMUS: Of what?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Of stuff.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Like your tissues, your baby wipes, your humidifier, your inhaler, your oxygen, your little markers.</p><p>DON IMUS: Fine, that is our first question. Where are my Q-tips.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: It's like day-care.</p><p>DON IMUS: Bernard, you dope.</p><p>There's the first question. Start with you, Deirdre.</p><p>How old do you think people should be before they have sex?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: 20's.</p><p>DON IMUS: Wyatt, what do you think?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: 13.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Oh, my god.</p><p>MCGUIRK: The apple didn't fall far from the tree.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: I think however responsible someone is to be able to have sex with another person. Some 30-year olds or 20-year olds aren't responsible enough.</p><p>DON IMUS: No.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: But if you're 16 or 17 and you can be responsible.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: What does responsible mean?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Mean, you use right protection, you're not stupid. You don't just do it with anybody like he did in the 60's.</p><p>DON IMUS: Wyatt, let me explain something to you. Leave me out of this.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: You mean in the 40's.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Well, he was born in the 40's.</p><p>DON IMUS: Leave me out of this.</p><p>So you think 16?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: I think whenever you're responsible enough to have sex with someone else.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Well, you know, he actually -- I want to add to that even in your 20's you have to be responsible.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: I mean, like we don't know, I may be responsible enough.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: No, 13 is not responsible, darling. 14 isn't, 15 isn't. 16 isn't.</p><p>No, you have to be in your 20's at least.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Mom, what if a 17-year-old is more responsible than a 22- year-old? Sometimes that happens.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Well, that does happen. And same with a 30-year-old.</p><p>DON IMUS: Well, how old is Austin?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Austin is 18.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: 18.</p><p>DON IMUS: Isn't Austin having sex with his girlfriend?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Probably.</p><p>DON IMUS: Yeah, probably.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: I wouldn't know.</p><p>DON IMUS: But what do you think, Wyatt?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Well, let's bring him in and ask him.</p><p>DON IMUS: Well, no I'm not going to bring in Austin and ask him. Austin is one of the kid wranglers here at the ranch.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: And he's a great kid, a responsible kid.</p><p>DON IMUS: Let's not get hysterical.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: I don't know. I mean, see his girlfriend so probably.</p><p>DON IMUS: so you don't agree?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Agree to what?</p><p>DON IMUS: With Wyatt, that 16 would be old enough.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Absolutely not. Absolutely not. It's too young. You don't know enough. There's too many diseases, even gonorrhea now is at an all-time high. There's too much even with protected sex that things happen, pregnancies and other diseases. I absolutely don't agree.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Not to mention the emotional peril.</p><p>DON IMUS: Yes.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Right. Actually people change their course in life. This is a very important time between high school and college. Boys and girls will actually not go to the college they want to go to, not pursue what their dreams are because of a girlfriend or boyfriend and they don't realize it ruins their life later in life. Even if you tell them right now stay on course, they don't and they can't see that. They're blind-sided.</p><p>DON IMUS: OK, how about that, Wyatt?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Are you going to do that with your rodeo career, have some girl blind side you so then you forever ruin your rodeo career and your schooling with college and everything else because all of a sudden some girl comes along?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: No. I wouldn't lose focus. I'm definitely going to bring one home to you, though, because you'll freak out. Won't she, dad?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: I won't freak out.</p><p>DON IMUS: Of course not.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: No, If you're in college, you know...</p><p>WYATT IMUS: If I'm in college</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: And all of sudden you're really interested in a girl and you bring one home, I'll check her out and make sure everything is good, but I'm not going to say that's great honey.</p><p>DON IMUS: Speaking of rodeo career, what's the fastest you've ever roped and tied a cow?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: On record or in practice?</p><p>DON IMUS: In practice.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: 8.8.</p><p>DON IMUS: 8.8 seconds.</p><p>OK, what's the fastest in a rodeo?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: The world record?</p><p>DON IMUS: No, you.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Oh, 10.3.</p><p>DON IMUS: OK, so if I told you what's the world record?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: 6.3.</p><p>DON IMUS: OK, if I told you you could rope and tie a calf in junior rodeo coming up this fall in 6.2 seconds if you took a harmless but nevertheless helpful performance-enhancing drug, would you take it?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Do you know what that means?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Yeah, I know...</p><p>DON IMUS: Just a steroid or something.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Probably not.</p><p>DON IMUS: Yeah, but you seem reluctant to answer that question.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Well, I was thinking about it. They don't drug test in rodeo.</p><p>DON IMUS: No, they don't.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: But that 6.2 seconds wouldn't be true. I wouldn't be able to do it if I wasn't on the drug. I wouldn't just be able to do it by myself.</p><p>DON IMUS: Right.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: So, no, I'd try to work towards that 6.2 without drugs.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Yeah, he's my man.</p><p>DON IMUS: So you realize a lot of kids would do it.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Would dope?</p><p>DON IMUS: Yes.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Right, but...</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Yeah, a lot of kids would be like Lance Armstrong.</p><p>DON IMUS: But a lot of people -- let's leave one of the great American sports heroes in my lifetime...</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Well, his whole sport of cycling is corrupt. And he's the only one that doesn't blood dope? Come on?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Stop. Stop. Time out.</p><p>What about -- if they are all drug doping and you do it, all you're doing is leveling out the playing field.</p><p>DON IMUS: Right.</p><p>DEIDRE IMUS: Like they do in baseball too, unfortunately.</p><p>DON IMUS: So if...</p><p>WYATT IMUS: So really you would only be trying to compete with your peers. So, I really don't know how bad it would be.</p><p>DON IMUS: It would be immoral.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: And unethical.</p><p>DON IMUS: And perhaps illegal.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: But you would be getting beat every week.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: That's why it's a great question, because could you live with yourself and would you actually do that? You would go that far and be unethical, illegal and wrong just for the sake of saying I won and did the fastest time in the world at the NFR?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Now we're at the NFR? I thought we were in junior high.</p><p>DON IMUS: We're tying 6.2 in junior high.</p><p>DEIDRE IMUS: Oh, he's a phenom then.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: But I'm tying 6.2 in junior high but I'm drug doping that's the only way I can do it?</p><p>DON IMUS: Right.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Well, no, because it wouldn't mean anything.</p><p>DON IMUS: You being a fanatical rodeo mom -- and I've seen you at the rodeos -- you don't wish well to the other children. You want all the other kids roping against Wyatt to come in second, which is fine.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: My philosophy is like Mrs. Bonnie Beaver, I want everyone to do well. I want Wyatt to win. And everyone else to come in second and third.</p><p>DON IMUS: OK, if you knew he could set the world record in junior high rodeo at 6.2 seconds, would you be for him...</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: You mean if he had to do steroids of blood dope or whatever -- absolutely not. I would not be for that. No, because it's not worth it. That's not worth it because you're cheating and it's not genuine. Like Wyatt just said he really didn't do the 6.2 seconds, it wouldn't inauthentic.</p><p>DON IMUS: Do you think you have, Deirdre, good number sense?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: I do, yes.</p><p>DON IMUS: Do you think she does, Wyatt?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: There's no way to tell.</p><p>DON IMUS: What do you mean?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: I'll give you an example, she always does the opposite of what I'll say so she has a way to prove me wrong.</p><p>DON IMUS: About numbers?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: About numbers. We'll be in the grocery store and we'll be done shopping because I have to help her buy a bunch of hideous things. And we'll be standing and there will be a line here and line here. And any logical person can see one line is shorter and one is longer. I want to go to that line, most of the time -- now this isn't all the time, she'll throw a fit and say, no, you're stupid let's go to the other line.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Well, I don't say you're stupid. But you know what I do, it's not necessarily by the number of people in each line.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: That's what number sense is, though, being able to...</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: No, I look at it more scientifically, what I'll do is how many pieces of groceries does each person have in that line. Because there can be 10 in one line and 15 in another, but the people with 15, the line is going to move much faster because they only have two items each. So I kind of calculate that quickly so I get a more comprehensive numbers sense than the average person.</p><p>DON IMUS: If they only have two items each, why aren't they in the seven or less?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Exactly. I don't know what she's talking about. We never have ten items or less. We're never in a group of people with less than 80 items to buy 46 kale chips.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Very adult young man. We should leave it at that.</p><p>Coming up, we'll have the I-man's interview with the author of the Blood Sugar Solution, Dr. Mark Hyman. And also professor Peter Morici will be coming up to discuss how the health care law will impact this economy. Help or hurt? You guess. Don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: So many questions surrounding the health care law that was upheld by the Supreme Court last week, but what does it mean for the future of this economy? We're joined by university of Maryland economic professor Peter Morici.</p><p>Good morning, Peter. Good to see you. I point to the top read story on the Wall Street Journal website and it is get ready for the new investment tax. And I'm talking about that 3.8% surtax on investment income for people making more than $200,000 a year thanks to the health care law. What does that do in the short run to the stock market and the economy?</p><p>PETER MORICI, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND: Well, in the short run it won't have much of an effect, but longer term it means people are going to have to get higher returns on their stock or they're not going to invest in them and they'll look for other alternatives. It's going to take money out of the market and essentially make the value of stocks lower.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't think people realize if the Bush tax cuts are not extended at the end of the year because everything goes away unless congress acts, you're going to have a top rate on dividends, the top rate on capital gains will go up to 23.8 percent and the top rate on dividends will go to 43.4 percent. That is crazy.</p><p>MORICI: You put on top of that state and local taxes, I mean people in New York City, for example, they're facing taxes of close to 60 percent in some cases. That's absurd. This president simply wants to put the private sector out of business.</p><p>You know, he wrote in a book about some time spent in the private sector, it was very brief, in which he said he felt like an enemy behind private sector lines. The president simply doesn't understand how markets work, the importance of incentives for innovation and to get people to create jobs. This is a jobs killer.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What does it do for health care costs in your estimation that is one of the greatest concerns for the economy is the increasing amount of money that we spend on health care versus everything else.</p><p>MORICI: There will be the seen and unseen. The seen is the health care will go up even higher taking money away from working people to subsidize health care will drive up the price. On top of that, it's going to impose lots of unseen costs, more bureaucrats in Washington and bureaucrats in your doctor's office to comply with the mountain of regulations coming down on them. This is going to be what happened with Dodd-Frank and the banks. Small banks can't make loans. Now you'll call up a doctor maybe at 3:00 and he'll say sorry, I've got to finish filing out my paper work today.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Now, I don't know which doctor you're going to, but I haven't gotten a doctor on the phone whether 10:00 in the morning or 3:00 in the afternoon ever. Come on, Peter.</p><p>MORICI: Professors are smart guys. I know how to get my doctor on the phone.</p><p>MCDOWELL: OK. And I'm sure they really love you for that.</p><p>Let's talk about what the states are doing, however, that was a critical part of the Supreme Court ruling last week. We have Florida, the governor there now saying Florida will not expand Medicaid and will not participate in health exchanges on top of Louisiana and Wisconsin.</p><p>Now how does that impact the implementation of the law and its effectiveness?</p><p>MORICI: Well, if they don't participate in Medicaid, the expansion of Medicaid, then it will drive up hospital costs, because they were counting on getting more folks with Medicaid not coming in without insurance. And that's going to cause the hospitals themselves to start to lobby for some sort of provision on the rates, the taxes they were to pay and so forth.</p><p>Not participating in the exchange, there's still going to be an exchange in Florida. The federal government is going to implement it if the state government doesn't. And I don't know if I was a governor -- the law is the law. I don't know if I was a governor I'd want to leave it to Washington to implement the exchange in Florida. I think I'd want to do it myself.</p><p>MCDOWELL: All right. Peter, it was great to see. Thank you so much. We'll see you very soon. Peter Morici down in Washington, D.C. weighing in on the health care law.</p><p>Coming up at the top of the hour, much more in store for you, including the I-man's interviews with Dr. Mark Hyman. And also the author of My Two Moms.</p><p>And stick around, Stuart Varney is up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: The (inaudible) scandal caused <person><nameText>Barclays Chairman Marcus Agius </nameText></person>his job. But now CEO Bob Diamond in the sight of politicians who suspect this Diamond has lost his sparkle and it also threatens to hit other banks around the globe.</p><p>The heat coming down on bankers worldwide and that's nothing compared to the scorcher blistering parts of the U.S. and triggering deadly storms. Millions wake up this morning without electricity and temperatures in some places topping over 100 degrees.</p><p>The Chinese economy anything but hot and continuing to cool down; the latest PMI reading indicates factory production and exports continue to plunge as investors wonder what happens when the world's global engine begins to stall.</p><p>And what is old is new again in Mexico where voters hand power to the political party that ruled for 70 years but was swept from office more than a decade ago only to return on this Monday, July 2nd, 2012.</p><p>Good morning. I'm Dagen McDowell in this morning. This BEST OF IMUS IN THE MORNING is in our second hour.</p><p>And coming up, we have Imus's interviews with Dr. Mark Hyman on his book \"The Blood Sugar Solution\", a bestseller in fact; and Zach Wahls on his book \"My Two Moms.\"</p><p>But first let's look on your markets. Starting in Asia we had mixed markets but in South Korea and Japan they were only down just ever so slightly.</p><p>And then let's go to Europe as well. Let's take a look at you're European markets. We have gains across the board. Let's head to Europe we already talked about the Asian market let's head over to Europe we have gains across the board north of one percent on the CAC-40 in France and the DAX in Germany. The futures there in the U.S. have been trying to hang on to some gains but essentially flat so far this morning.</p><p>And then over to commodities, oil and gold are both down. Oil was down a bit more, earlier in the trading session but still down 1.5 percent, losing almost $1.40 almost a barrel -- $1.40 a barrel.</p><p>For more on the European markets let's go live to London where we're joined by David Jones chief market strategist for IG Markets. David, I'm asking everybody the same question so far this morning. How long does the euphoria, the excitement last from that deal that was struck at the end of last week to kind of open up the bailout facility to banks?</p><p>DAVID JONES, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, IG MARKETS: Maybe it will last for a couple more days. We do of course have the -- the central bank, the European Central Bank meeting this week, their normal monthly meeting and the announcement on interest rates.</p><p>So maybe we'll hear from them similar to what we heard from U.S. feds that there will be no QE in the short term, no more stimulus for economies. So, maybe that will be enough to maybe put -- push down some of this optimism.</p><p>But for now at least as you say it is also positive. We're mildly positive here in Europe but still up on the day and feeling the benefits of that announcement from the early hours of Friday morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL: How much of this -- this bit of a rally that we're seeing this Monday is the expectation that the European Central Bank will indeed cut interest rates maybe do something else later this week?</p><p>JONES: I think there's a little bit of that factor there, I think ahead of all of these central bank meetings in recent months we have that expectation that maybe we'll have some sort of more stimulus. We had unemployment figures out of the Euro zone today and they've nudged up again. So I think many people do expect the central bank to act but I think expecting the Europeans to act this week is maybe a bit too soon.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much David. It was great to speak with you this morning. David Jones.</p><p>JONES: Ok.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And for a closer look at the Asian markets let's go to Fox Business contributor, Katie Sargent. Hey Katie, she's on the phone with us from Singapore.</p><p>KATIE SARGENT, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR (via telephone): Hi Dagen. Asian markets today they started strong but they stay this is finish and other things that investors were considering to Purchasing Managers Indexes from China, the official one that tracks the state-backed firms and the private ones that focuses on private companies, now both show that (inaudible) activity shrank in June at the fastest pace in seven months. And it was hurt by weak export demand from Europe and North America.</p><p>Also today the Bank of Japan came out with its Tankan survey and that showed business sentiment improved in the April to June quarter. However that follows up Purchasing Managers Index report from Japan on Friday which showed that manufacturing activity shrank in June. So, investors are kind of having to weigh those too.</p><p>So for today we saw -- well, Hong Kong markets were closed but elsewhere Japan and South Korea gave up their early gains and they finished little changed. Shanghai really an up and down day but at the end it didn't change a whole lot by the end of the day. And Australia's main index one of the better performers adding nearly one percent today -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much Katie good to hear from you. Katie Sargent on the phone with us from Singapore.</p><p>Now for a closer look at the U.S. markets in a preview of how things could shape up today we're joined by Fox Business's Lauren Simonetti from the news room. Good morning, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning. The fires works were lit early on Wall Street with stellar gains for the major averages, the DOW rocketing 277 points on Friday. June great month too with gains of at least 3.8 percent for the three major averages.</p><p>This first trading day of July will be a busy one in an equally busy week. National manufacturing figures on tap. Auto sales tomorrow and that key government jobs support for June is out on Friday.</p><p>Speaking of jobs, they're moving off of Wall Street. The trend is called \"near shoring\", it's where big financial titans hire and relocate workers to cities like Salt Lake City, Utah, and Jacksonville, Florida where rent, taxes and labor all cost less. Silicon Valley is seeing a similar exodus as the big tech giants find savings in other U.S. cities.</p><p>And have you read it, \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" flying off bookstore shelves. E.L. James's erotic novel became the nation's fastest selling paper back to reach one million sales. Milton Books stand finds that it took 11 weeks to reach that market. That was 25 weeks faster than the previous record holder, \"The Da Vinci Code\". Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I was looking for a book to buy over the weekend. I chose \"Wise Guys\" by Nick Pileggi, not that thing. Diane Macedo is in our news room with a look at more business for you this morning. Hi Diane.</p><p>DIANE MACEDO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hi Dagen.</p><p>So <person><nameText>Barclays Chairman Marcus Agius </nameText></person>has resigned in the wake of the bank's interest rate rigging scandal. Agius has been a chairman for more than five year; says the scandal has dealt a devastating blow to Barclay's reputation and that the buck stops with him.</p><p>He will stay in position until a succession plan is in place. The bank was fined more than $450 million last week by British and U.S. regulators for submitting false documents on the London interbank-offered interest rate. That's the rate banks lend unsecured funds to each other.</p><p>And Barclays has admitted that some of its traders attempted to manipulate that rate. Agius's resignation is seen as an attempt to take pressure off CEO Bob Diamond who along with Agius is also facing calls to resign.</p><p>Airbus is set to unveil plans for its first U.S. factory later today. The company's parent European Aeronautic Defensive Space plans to spend $600 million to build a facility in Mobile, Alabama. Once it opens in 2015, the plant is expected to create 1,000 jobs and will reportedly produce four planes a month by 2017. It will also be on the home turf of U.S. rival Boeing which has 2,700 employees in Alabama.</p><p>Micron Technology is purchasing failed Japanese D-Ram manufacturer Elpida Memory for $750 million.

Over to Europe, we have gains, a follow on to that deal made at the end of last week among European leaders to expand the bailout facilities for banks, but really, it will be (inaudible), if you take a look at the reaction there.</p><p>And then, we've got some gains here, it looks like they're in the making. We've got some better than expected news out of China on factory activity. Even though it has been slowing recently and you have gains across the board. Big jobs report out on Friday, it's going to be a weird week though with the markets closed Wednesday.</p><p>Oil and gold -- oil is down, not as much as it was earlier, only down 99 cents a barrel right now.</p><p>And now, some of the news stories making headlines this morning; utility crews working in blistering heat trying to restore power to hundreds of thousands along the northeast corridor; a violent storm causing damage from Indiana to New Jersey as authorities confirming at least 13 deaths as a result.</p><p>Fox News correspondent Elizabeth Prann last has the latest from Charleston, West Virginia.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELIZABETH PRANN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Among those killed in the severe weather, two young boys in New Jersey; they were camping and crushed by a downed tree.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A 50-foot tall pine tree snapped.

Hey Diane.</p><p>MACEDO: Hey, Dagen.</p><p>States are reportedly proposing new rules to make it harder for banks to foreclose on homes. According to the \"Wall Street Journal\", 25 states have bills that would change various foreclosure laws. The California legislature will vote today on a measure aimed at preventing foreclosures from moving forward while a borrower is trying to modify their mortgage.</p><p>In New York, lawmakers are considering a measure that would criminalize foreclosure paperwork forgery.

On the first Friday of the month, the Labor Department releases its findings on jobs created or lost the month before.

Romney's campaign says it has raised millions since Thursday's court decision declaring the bulk of the President's health care law constitutional. Republicans say the law is unpopular and the only way to get rid of it is to elect them to hold the House, take the Senate and the White House. Democrats say the court has ruled, the law is passed and the Congress should move on.</p><p>The congress in a way has moved on, at least to another week off, both Houses are out this week for the 4th of July.

Good to see you; and good morning everyone.</p><p>Today we're tracking some showers and storms that produced a lot of severe weather in the overnight hours. Over 800 reports of them across areas through south of the Great Lakes and also into the southeast, so you can see them ongoing across portions of the Carolinas, Georgia and also the Florida Panhandle but most of this activity is now very light and just some cloud cover across the region.</p><p>Temperatures will be warming up once again. Take a look at some of these high temperatures for today. Minneapolis, you're expecting a high temperature this afternoon at 99 degrees, 98 over in Denver, a 97 in Kansas City and Chicago on the hot side as well, expecting to see a high temperature at 96 degrees. Our heat wave will continue and we're expecting those hot temperatures to continue in place across the Plains and even as we head into the end of this work week.</p><p>Otherwise, travel across the city of Boston could be tricky later on today and the thunderstorms possible.

I've got Scott Shellady with me, thinking about trades. What is the report that comes out today and why is it so important in the corn, grain, other grain pits?</p><p>SCOTT SHELLADY, CEO, BRADFORD CENTRAL MANAGEMENT: Because it's a crop condition report and the conditions are deteriorating rapidly. If they deteriorate anything like last week on last Monday's numbers we've got more gains on the market to go. And we've got to see what the Government says, it's not good.</p><p>FLOCK: It was a big week last week for all the grains, particularly corn, even though I've got to say, we've got a bearish report in terms of crop acreage and crop stock piles, still the market went up why?</p><p>SHELLADY: Because the condition report is still on everybody's mind and they know what's out there and if we don't have any significant precipitation to rescue the crop by the end of this week, after the holidays we're in big trouble.</p><p>FLOCK: You know what a drought is like. You actually grew up on a farm in addition to trading these markets, you remember 1988. That was a big drought here. Compare what we've got so far this year to that.</p><p>SHELLADY: Well, last week we saw the crop conditions decrease by seven percent. Everybody thought that was huge and you know what? We had this time in 1988 we saw crop conditions come off 16, 17 percent, so, we could have some more of those things down the pipeline. If we're off more than ten percent on Monday, this time in 1988 was a tumultuous period.</p><p>FLOCK: Time to think about putting your money, in maybe things that you can eat. At least if it doesn't go up in price, you take it home and plant it.</p><p>Jeff Flock at the CME, big day today. Stay tuned.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jeff, thank you so much for that.</p><p>Now, let's go to our News Room and Diane Macedo, who has more business news.</p><p>Hey Diane.</p><p>DIANE MACEDO, FBN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Dagen.</p><p>Barclay's Chairman Marcus Agius has resigned in the wake of that bank interest rate rigging scandal. Agius, who has been the Chairman more than five years, says the scandal has dealt a devastating blow to Barclays reputation and that the buck stops with him. He'll stay in the position until a succession plan is in place. You might remember the bank was fined more than 450 million dollars last week by British and U.S. Regulators for submitting false documents on the London Inter-Bank offered interest rate, or libor, which is a rate at which banks lend unsecured funds to each other. Barclays has admitted that some of its traders attempted to manipulate that rate to make it look like the banks borrowing costs were lower than they actually were in an attempt to make the bank and industry in general look healthier than it is. Agius resignation is seen as an attempt to take the pressure off CEO Bob Diamond who also is facing calls to resign.</p><p>Facebook Executives have decided to keep the companies stock listed on the Nasdaq despite problems surrounding it's IPO. That's according to the Wall Street Journal who said the company had considered moving its shares off the Nasdaq in the days following the trading debut, but now feel that would erode confidence in its shares further. Facebook Executives have quietly blamed the Nasdaq for the glitches in the IPO, but officials at the Exchange are working to repair their relationship.</p><p>Dagen, back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Diane.</p><p>The book is called, My Two Moms, author Zach Wahls. He takes a look at same sex marriage and the details of his life, growing up with two mothers. He's stopped by recently to talk about it with the I-Man.</p><p>DON IMUS, FBN IMUS: Zach Wahls along with Bruce Littlefield has written a book called, My Two Moms, lessons of love, strength and what makes a family.</p><p>Please welcome to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program Zach Wahls.</p><p>Good morning Mr Wahls.</p><p>ZACH WAHLS, AUTHOR: Thanks for having me.</p><p>IMUS: You're quite welcome. How are you?</p><p>WAHLS: Doing all right. It's a little earlier than I'm used to, but that's all right.</p><p>IMUS: You'll live through it. We have.</p><p>WAHLS: Yeah.</p><p>IMUS: Tell me, one of these women conceived you, is that the deal.</p><p>WAHLS: That's right, my biological mom, Terry on the left there, in the red got pregnant with me in 1990 using artificial insemination and gave birth to me in '91 and she met Jackie on the right, in 1994, they had a commitment ceremony in '96 and the rest is history.</p><p>IMUS: So, you were raised in that environment and at one point did-- were you aware that you had, you didn't have a dad, you had two moms?</p><p>WAHLS: Yeah, there's never a lightbulb moment where it clicked in my head or whatever.</p><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p>WAHLS: But what happened was that Terry, explaining to me from when I was a little guy, before I could understand how I was conceived that I had, you know, some kids have two moms, two dads, a mom and dad and there was never a moment looking back on my life where I didn't know who I was and who my family was. There was never secretly a moment of realization so for all intents and purposes just like anybody else.</p><p>IMUS: Okay. Just so we can put this conversation in context here and you know where I'm coming from, I support gay marriage. Because I think people love one another and each other and it doesn't make any difference in my view.</p><p>Now, I know a lot of people don't support it, but I don't know why -- I don't understand that. It's never made, never resonated with me.</p><p>I do think that the traditional American family is a father and a mother. Having said that it doesn't make-- it doesn't make your family any less valid than anybody else's in my view.</p><p>WAHLS: I appreciate that, Don and look at a state like Iowa where I grew up. There are a certain amount of people of a different view.</p><p>IMUS: Why do you think they're of a different view?</p><p>WAHLS: I think most of the opposition is certainly rooted in belief, likely that homosexuality is immoral, and probably religious belief picked up at an early point in their life and they can't necessarily wrap their eyes, their mind around the idea that two gay people could ever be in love with each other or successfully be parents and obviously, once you know my parents and set us down and have dinner with our family and get to know us on a personal level, I think it's that misconception falls apart quickly, but for people who haven't had that experience of sitting down and getting to know us, it's easy to stick with these misconceptions.</p><p>IMUS: Do you think it's because it's a threat to them?</p><p>WAHLS: Yeah, I think they feel threatened.</p><p>IMUS: Why?</p><p>WAHLS: It's a good question, I'm not necessarily sure, it seems like a person getting mad at me for eating a donut because he's on a diet and it doesn't necessarily seem the kind of thing that's rational and there were people in Iowa certainly who predicted the apocalypse after this ruling in 2009, but turns out, hell hasn't opened up and swallowed Davenport into the abyss and in fact, divorce rates are falling in Iowa since 2009.</p><p>So, anybody who kind of claimed the doomsday scenario after the ruling in 2009 is proving incorrect.</p><p>IMUS: There are those who think that children raised by gay parents then become gay themselves.</p><p>WAHLS: Yeah, no, that's definitely something that's another myth and another stereo type, but what those people fail to account for is the fact that straight parents have been the leading cause of gay people in this country forever.</p><p>So, no, it's true. You know, and so, in seconds, the only reason that that would ever be thrown out there in the first place is under this misconception that homosexuality is somehow immoral. If you actually know a gay person, odds are awfully good they were raised by straight parents and you know, along my journey I've met some kids who are gay and have been raised by gay parents and if you think it's hard coming out as a gay person with straight parents, try doing it with gay parents and that's harder and that stereo type hurts a lot of people and not just the parents either.</p><p>IMUS: Why would that be? Probably an obvious answer.</p><p>WAHLS: Then all of a sudden, oh, god you proved the opposition right or what have you. So the idea that somehow gay parents are the only ones raising gay kids is simply not true and then further, it kind of seems like nonsensical in my mind.</p><p>IMUS: Talking with Zach Wahls, who along with Bruce Littlefield.</p><p>Who is he and where did you meet him?</p><p>WAHLS: My agent found him. You know, so the way it happened was that, after the video kind of the start of this whole thing.</p><p>IMUS: The You Tube video.</p><p>WAHLS: Exactly. I was contacted by a couple of literary agents and wound up signing with one in Manhattan and she found Bruce and got the book sold.</p><p>IMUS: \"My Two Moms\" it's called. Lessons of love and strength and what makes a family.</p><p>Why did you want to do the book?</p><p>WAHLS: There were two immediate motifs that came about. First, I wanted to speak out to other kids who had LGBD parents and living in a time that's tumultuous, and when I started to write the book the GOP Primary was coming up and there was kind of mudslinging going around on this issue in particular and I wanted to speak to other kids and just reiterate, to be reminded all the time, despite what you might hear on TV and some of those talking heads out there. You are all right and even though we've heard it a lot in the last year and a half, it does get better.</p><p>Second, I thought this was a pretty incredible opportunity to speak to a lot of people who might be on the fence about the issue. People who are like, well, it's a free country and you know, I'm not going to try and infringe on somebody's liberty or freedom, but what are the effects on the kids? I think the single most effective line that the other side uses on the issue is, do we really want to live in a country where I'm thought of as a bigot because I believe all kids have a right to a mother and father? It's a pretty convincing line when you hear it, but when you sit down and walk through it, it's not that simple.</p><p>IMUS: The rational, I would encourage people to use, I was complaining to a doctor of mine about, I have some, I won't get into a lot of boring stuff. You know what old people do, what they do, first thing they do, probably had this experience, they tell you what's the matter with them. So I'm not going to go that far.</p><p>WAHLS: Yeah.</p><p>IMUS: But I was complaining about breathing and the doctor, one of the foremost Pulmonary Specialists in the world and he said it's like golf and I said, I don't play golf. He says you have to play the ball where it lies. So, wherever the ball, you can't move it. But you can, but you're--</p><p>WAHLS: Right.</p><p>IMUS: So, this is the reality. It's a reality.</p><p>WAHLS: Sure.</p><p>IMUS: Of our-- so I remember explaining to Wyatt, our son, one of the things we did say is how inhuman it is to discriminate against anybody.</p><p>WAHLS: That's right.</p><p>IMUS: For any reason and so, that resonated with him more than anything else. Rather than to try to rationalize whether or not anybody thought it was be aberrant behavior or not, which in my view is irrelevant. And then you've mentioned earlier and I think like a 14-year-old anyway about like, I've always said and it's not funny, but I've just always said, you know, I have no problem with women kissing, I just don't want to see men kissing that's an idiot and half joking, but the point being that that's really what it comes down to.</p><p>WAHLS: Yeah, I think a lot of people are uncomfortable with the idea of seeing two people the same sex being intimate with each other and other people for whom the opposite might be true. And I explain, look, homophobia isn't something that's wrong, and we can't control how that goes. The problem with homophobia, the only thing to fear is fear itself and certainly true in this case. I think a lot of people whom I think might think I am a monster for being homophobic or not necessarily thinking about two men kissing or whatever and that's not the case as long as when you get into the voting booth you're not letting that fear dominate your voting practice.</p><p>IMUS: Tedious analogy that I employ is three or four years ago on this program, we decided to book some African-Americans to try to have a conversation about racial relations and race itself for a number of reasons. And one of the things I found is in talking to various African- Americans, blacks, was that there wasn't all that much to talk about and suddenly, you were talking about issues and other things that affected you both as inhabitants of the planet and so once you got past the fear of somebody being different than you were and you discovered that in fact they weren't, it's got to be the same.</p><p>WAHLS: Yeah, definitely, definitely.</p><p>IMUS: Well, you seem pretty squared away to me.</p><p>WAHLS: Thank you very much.</p><p>IMUS: That should put to rest the bigots out there that think oh, my god what's going to happen.</p><p>WAHLS: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Well, good luck with all of this and this sounds like a movie. Anybody talk to you about that.</p><p>WAHLS: Not yet, but I have to agree, a pretty incredible story.</p><p>IMUS: You're going to College or been to College?</p><p>WAHLS: I was going to university of Iowa as a full-time Engineering student when this whole thing happened and since took a brief academic absence and going back to school in 2013.</p><p>IMUS: You're a good looking kid and get you out in Hollywood.</p><p>WAHLS: We'll see.</p><p>IMUS: Good luck.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, a check on your markets around the world and Mr Stuart Varney joins me right here in the studio to talk about the state of the economy.</p><p>Do not go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back, everybody.</p><p>He might not do his Anna Wintour imitation, but he has something to say and say it eloquently, eloquently about the economy. Stuart Varney is joining me, host of VARNEY &amp; COMPANY which starts at nine fifteen, nine twenty.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, HOST OF VARNEY &amp; COMPANY: Close enough.</p><p>That was the nicest introduction, Dagen and I thank you very much indeed.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I didn't even imitate you in the tease, I thought you know what, I'm rested and back from vacation.</p><p>You say this week, all the attention, economically, politically turns back to what's going on in the job market and what can the White House do to fight what is not significant job growth.</p><p>VARNEY: Friday morning, 8:30 eastern time here comes the next Jobs Report. There are only four Jobs Report from now until the election. And this is one of them. And this may be the most important.</p><p>I think the unemployment rate goes up, which is a disastrous headline for the President. And I'm the not sure of this, but in my opinion, it's going up. And the number of new jobs created will be minuscule. I base that on all the indicators that we've received about the general state of the economy in the last two months.</p><p>Would you know that we've actually spent less money in each of the last two months, consumer spending down. In America, that's big news. This is a consumer oriented society. This is a spending society.</p><p>MCDOWELL: In fact--</p><p>VARNEY: But it could--</p><p>MCDOWELL: Big article in the Wall Street Journal about, don't expect the consumer to rescue the economy at this point.</p><p>VARNEY: That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Is that because, I mean, are we in a place where it becomes self-fulfilling and people become more concerned and pull back spending and make the economy worse?</p><p>VARNEY: You're precisely right. It's a vicious circle and it goes round and round and round. No jobs equals lack on confidence and that equals a declining standard of living and that equals less spending and less jobs. You go round and round and round. We've not broken that circle at this point. We could.</p><p>I think if the President made a deliberate and concerted effort to liberate the two trillion dollars, which private enterprise has, in cash, on the sidelines, if you could get that to come into the economy. Give private enterprise a sense of confidence, I think that would be a huge stimulus and I think it would work.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Is there anything the President can do between now and the election that turns things around? Because, again, you were saying that we're shifting from health care to the economy, but from the Republican side, the health care decision is the economy, because that's a tax on many Americans.</p><p>VARNEY: If the President were to say, Obamacare was a mistake, forget it. If he were to say, Dodd Frank Financial Regulation was a mistake, please forget it. If he were to say I don't want any more Government stimulus, I want tax cuts for individuals and private enterprise, I want tax reform. If he were to say things, yeah, I think things would turn around, but you know as well as I do, he's never going to say anything like that at all. This President never changes direction.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I point to the top when I woke up this morning, the top read story in the Wall Street Journal on wsj.com, was the get ready for the new investment tax and three point eight percent, additional tax on investment income for people making more than $200,000 a year, so, I think that if people are focused on not only tax cuts expiring, Washington's not doing anything about that and then what other taxes are you lumping on me, and they're very fixated on health care as a tax from here on out and the President has an even higher hurdle.</p><p>VARNEY: He's in a really tough spot of his own making. Look at the new taxes coming down the pike, because of Obamacare, and because the Supreme Court says, okay, go ahead with Obamacare, and what is it, biotech companies, taxed, medical device makers, taxed. Health insurance, taxed, a new investment, taxed. All of these taxes are going up. We will pay for them. It will squeeze people, squeeze employers to drop health care coverage and put people on to public health care.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm paying a ten percent excise tax on tanning, ten percent, that's a huge tax Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: You didn't get that tan in a salon.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, beach.</p><p>VARNEY: I could tell, there's a difference.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's why I love you more every day.</p><p>Stuart Varney, thank you so much.</p><p>VARNEY: That's all right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It was great to see you.</p><p>VARNEY &amp; COMPANY starts at 9:15 a.m. eastern time, don't miss it.</p><p>In the meantime, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: The libor scandal cost Barclay's Chairman Marcus Agius his job, but now CEO Bob Dimon in the fight of politicians who might think this Dimon has lost its sparkle. These all threatens to hit other banks around the globe.</p><p>The heat coming down on bankers worldwide is nothing compared to the scorcher blistering parts of the U.S. triggering deadly storms.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands waking up this morning without electricity, with temperatures in some places topping 100 degrees.</p><p>The Chinese economy anything, but hot and continuing to cool down.

Over to Asia, first. You look at the -- really unchanged except essentially flat markets except for Australia gaining almost one percent.</p><p>Over to Europe, we've had gains all morning long, all day long, so far in 11:30, when your European markets close, but north of one percent gains in France and in Germany.</p><p>Here in the U.S., the futures have been hanging on to gains as well. And up ten points on the Dow futures, but massive gains last Friday, last week, although, it was a pretty rough quarter for the U.S. markets. And the commodities, oil and gold both down. We like to see oil fall down a buck 32 a barrel right now.</p><p>For more on Europe, let's go live to London where we're joined by James Hughes, chief market analyst for Alpari. James, what is the biggest factor driving the markets higher in Europe today?</p><p>JAMES HUGHES, ALPARI SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST: Well, I think you haven't necessarily got any positive news around these markets. I think it's almost just a rebound from some of the negativity that we've been seeing recently. And of course, we are looking just of the start of the week from after what we saw last week. It was pretty negative.</p><p>So, I think, initially, you have got the story in the U.K. which is Barclays bank, and you've got their shares jumping this morning up around three-and-a-half percent or so just on the mere fact that they have been -- they were down heavily of course last week on the back of the scandal that come out Mr. Agius, Marcus Agius, the chairman of Barclays' lost his job today.</p><p>So, there are those new stories which are helping to push Barclays higher, which is helping to push the financials higher which is why we're getting some of those European, and the U.K. markets higher. And the rest of the stories around Europe are a little bit more sketchy, a little bit more. Of course, you had those Eurozone unemployment numbers out today, 11.1 percent, all time high unemployment for the Eurozone, not necessarily good news but all those markets in Europe, they are managing to post a few gains just on the back of some negativity that we've had over the last couple of weeks.</p><p>MCDOWELL: How critical is that -- what the ECB information does later in the week with expected rate cut on the horizon?</p><p>HUGHES: Well, I think, I mean, it's a big, it's a big story for the week and of course, everyone is looking towards that. I mean, whether it's going to make much difference, you go back to the same stories, which we have been talking about for the last two years or so with this Eurozone and we talk about bailouts, whether they've been helping and of course, we've seen a series of bailouts and everyone tells us that's the new dawn in Europe and that's going to solve the problems and of course, nothing has solved any problems as of yet.</p><p>So, I think it's almost the same sort of thing for the right -- if we do see it. And then of course, we make the markets a little bit of a shot in the arm. Again, it's another step being taken to try and solve this issue. But, the biggest issue is that we just don't know how to solve the issue and I think that's going to go on for a long time.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Years, that's what my gut says, James, thank you so much. James Hughes, chief market analyst for Alpari, be well.</p><p>Now, for a closer look at the U.S. market. A preview of how things might shape up today. We go to our very own Lauren Simonetti live from our Newsroom. Good morning, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Good morning.

National manufacturing figures on tap, auto sales tomorrow and that key government jobs report for June is out on Friday.</p><p>Speaking of jobs, they're moving off of Wall Street.

You have to have the right to say it. But then you also have to realize when you say it, and you are the guy that really got your feet to the fire first for something that I thought was ridiculous. But they also have the right to tell you to get lost. Look, let's not -- let's call a spade a spade. Hank Williams, Jr. is such a mess that he's wearing those dark sunglasses and that steeple-done beard.</p><p>He looked like he was in the witness protection program in that whole interview. And you know, I mean, that was his big joke. It was like Hitler and Netanyahu playing golf together. He probably had like a group of people helping him pronounce Netanyahu. Do we really need to hear that? Are you ready for some football? Like, thank God that's dead.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: This hurts me. Hank is my friend, you can't do this.</p><p>MOHR: Hank's your friend?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MOHR: His father thinks he sucks. Hank Williams, Sr., every Halloween comes out of his grave and goes \"Stop Singing.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Hank Williams, Sr., he's like the Black Eyed Peas of the Williams family.</p><p>IMUS: No, this is --</p><p>MOHR: You're going to look me in the eye and say that Hank Williams, Jr. isn't horrible?</p><p>IMUS: Well, you know, my wife says the same thing.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MOHR: Your wife and I are trying to talk sense to you.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, but -- no, he makes some good records. Hank's made some good records.</p><p>MOHR: Name one.</p><p>IMUS: \"All My Rowdy Friends\" are -- that's good. \"Family Tradition.\" That is a great record.</p><p>MOHR: -- Goose stepping to ESPN right now.</p><p>IMUS: No. Well, Hank fell off a cliff, you know.</p><p>MOHR: He looks it.</p><p>IMUS: No, but I mean, but the reason --</p><p>MOHR: He looks like Evel Knievel after Snake River canyon. Holy smoke. His beard's on crooked. He's got a chin strap for his hat. This guy doesn't know what to do. He doesn't know whether he should pee are go blind.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: This is not working out the way I wanted for my friend Hank.</p><p>MOHR: Well, I think he's terrible. I'm not going to lie to the I- man.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I mean.</p><p>MOHR: What do you want me to tell you? I went to the gym earlier today.</p><p>IMUS: You look good, by the way.</p><p>MOHR: Way too many naked guys at the gym. And I'm a pervert. I look at every guy's package. I want to see what's happening out there in America.</p><p>IMUS: You do?</p><p>MOHR: I do.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MOHR: And I like, here's what you do. If you want guys go into the Jacuzzi at the gym naked which I find disgusting. If you want the Jacuzzi to yourself, just go in and sit facing the Jets.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And just sit there holding the concrete. And by the way, ladies -- because you do have a lot of ladies that watch this show mostly because they all want to have sex with Warner Wolf. Well, I said that like Bob Newhart. They wanted to have sex with Warner Wolf.</p><p>WOLF: Hey, come on, Jay.</p><p>MOHR: Let's go to the videotape!</p><p>IMUS: Are you a Jets fan?</p><p>MOHR: I love the Jets.</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>MOHR: I love them.</p><p>IMUS: And you like Ryan?</p><p>MOHR: I'm going to send Rex Ryan photos of my wife's feet because my wife has perfect feet.</p><p>IMUS: No, but I mean.</p><p>MOHR: Oscar Wilde writes about my wife's feet.</p><p>IMUS: How long have you been a Jets fan?</p><p>MOHR: I've been a Jets fan since -- this one for Warner Wolf. Klecko Abdulsalam, Marty Lions and Mark Gastineau, the Sack Exchange, 1982. I was an 11-year-old boy, sexually ambiguous and I fell in love with them. And Bruce Harper, number 42.</p><p>WOLF: Yes, little Bruce.</p><p>IMUS: When you were 11, you were.</p><p>MOHR: Little Bruce, careful there.</p><p>IMUS: .sexually ambiguous at 11?</p><p>MOHR: Oh, yes. Always.</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>MOHR: I'm in the gym facing the Jets for crying out loud. I was supposed to get a massage later today and I get more angst about going to get a massage because they say to you, lay down, the lady will say, lay down, face down, and I'll be right back. So, you lay down face down naked with your ass in the air. And like two minutes later, someone comes back into the room and you just assume it's the lady that left. For all you know it's like the fetish janitor in a batman mask and he wants to massage the backs of your knees.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: How old is your son now?</p><p>MOHR: I got a nine-year-old and we have six-month-old now who just decided to start kicking our ass on the road.</p><p>IMUS: Is it a boy?</p><p>MOHR: It's a boy. It's a masculine child. Babies cry when they have to poop. Can you imagine having to go to the bathroom so bad that you weep? That's a lot of Vicodin and Imodium and cheese. You sit on the toilet weeping. People come in from other parts of the house in their bath robes. What's going on?</p><p>IMUS: I guess you have to take a Vicodin to get that one right.</p><p>MOHR: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: The nine-year-old, is he starting to ask questions yet?</p><p>MOHR: You know, he doesn't. And it started to bother me. I thought like he should be a little more curious because I don't want his friends. He said to me, did you know if you type in \"sex\" on the computer, all crazy stuff pops up. And I said, you should type in tranny, and see, that's really weird stuff pop. But I didn't tell him that. But I told him -- I said, all right, I'm going to tell him everything how it goes.</p><p>And I told him, you know, the penis and the thing and this and that and this happens and this comes out. And it's fertilized. I told him what the vagina and the hole, every technical term exact. And we were driving to Starbucks in Santa Monica, and we get to the counter and I literally finish the explanation, and the woman gets pregnant and a baby -- she has a baby through her vaginal canal, the birth canal, and that's how it goes.</p><p>And the lady behind the counter, just like a regular-looking gal says, may I help you? And my nine-year-old goes, like Jackie Gleason suddenly is looking at a woman completely differently. I got literally just finished the whole explanation and all the things and all the parts and then a woman saying, how can I help you to my nine-year-old?</p><p>IMUS: My kid is 13. When he was nine like your son, he comes in and he says, dad, I think I discovered masturbation.</p><p>MOHR: At nine?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MOHR: That's young. He's a trailblazer.</p><p>IMUS: First of all, I said, I don't think you discovered it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's one way to end an interview. We'll have more when we come back including more news headlines, business news for you. The latest on those violent storms that struck the northeast.</p><p>Plus, FOX Business' Maria Molina will have your business travelers forecast, as this BEST OF IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right here on FOX Business.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Let's take a look at the markets around the world. Very muted movements over in Asia except for Australia which was up almost one percent. We've had gains of more than one percent in France and Germany if you want to head over to Europe.</p><p>Again, the excitement from the deal that was done last week, among European leaders to help out Spain and Italy and who knows where the country falls in coming weeks and months. The futures here in the U.S. have actually turned negative, but again, it's going to be a strange week, if you will. The markets closed early tomorrow, they're closed completely Wednesday and then we have that major jobs report on Friday.</p><p>But again, the Dow futures have turned lower down six points. And speaking of lower, oil and gold are significantly lower with oil off a buck 30 a barrel, but, we kind of like that. I have the pleasure of being joined by my neighbor.</p><p>But also, one of the co-hosts of the \"THE FIVE,\" Dana Perino, and it's great of you to be here this morning.</p><p>DANA PERINO, CO-HOST, \"THE FIVE\": I'm glad to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Let's start with health care because I.</p><p>PERINO: Well, I thought you were going to start with the dogs which is the most important, I'm kidding.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We can get at the dogs at the end.</p><p>PERINO: Health care.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We save the best for last. And so, let's get the rough stuff out of the way first.</p><p>PERINO: That's how you do it on FOX Business.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But with the health care, I was, maybe I'm foolish to be shocked, but shocked that the White House is still trying to spin this by saying that based on the health care ruling last week from the Supreme Court last that the penalty was not a tax and that the Supreme Court actually didn't come out and say that, but I don't know how you can continue to do that for the next.</p><p>PERINO: It's very disingenuous and it's very insulting to go people across America who've been paying attention to this debate and there's a lot of them. If your new best friend in Washington is going to be Chief Justice Roberts, if you're on the Left, you might-- it would be honorable to quote him accurately. What he said is you are not allowed to do it under the commerce clause, but you are allowed to do it under the tax provision, therefore this can stand, it is a tax. And to try to say anything else is foolish.</p><p>I can understand why the White House doesn't want to, they don't want to be labeled in trying to defend the largest tax increase in American history on top of the other ones that could be coming at the end of the year, but it is what it is. And trying to say otherwise, I think, makes them look foolish and it actually hurts the process going forward. If they do really want to try to reconcile and get people all on the same page, lying about it is not the way to do it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, speaking to reconcile, the talk about the Republicans and what their approach is going to be to fighting against this health care law because there's an article in the Wall Street Journal today about, that on the Senate side, you can deal with some of the budget issues in this health care law through reconciliation.</p><p>PERINO: So, the overall republican position is Obama-care should be repealed, that is what they will be running on going forward. In the meantime, there are different tactics that you can use legislatively, one of them is reconciliation, it is tough to implement, but it's conceivable that it could be done. That basically, you will get together, you only need 51 votes to strike it down. I think that with the current makeup of the Senate, to get to that point after the Supreme Court has ruled would be very difficult.</p><p>However, there might be enough constituent anger calling to members of Congress and to their senators that says, this was passed as an individual mandate. President Obama himself chastised George Stephanopoulos of ABC News to say this was absolutely not a tax. The justice -- Chief Justice Roberts has just said, it is a tax. Therefore, were you deceived Mr. Congressman, when you voted for this, you didn't know it was a tax?</p><p>Should this be re-voted? I don't know if that will -- it's interesting to see, I think the next two weeks will tell us how much that will stand, I will say that Mitt Romney over the past, in the first four hours after the ruling, raised over a million dollars from small donations of people saying, we want this bill thrown out. The only way to do it is to elect a republican president.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, the tax ruling from the Supreme Court, it does fold directly into the Romney campaign strategy of making this election about the economy. And again, like first top read story on the Wall Street Journal this morning is that there's a new investment tax coming because of the health care law on Americans making more than $200,000 a year under capital gains and on your dividends, and that does seem to fold. And if you take apart the health care law, and look at all the additional taxes that are coming, the potential drain on the economy does seem to fold into that strategy. So it doesn't necessarily become about health care versus the economy, that's on the Romney side. That it's all one, one story.</p><p>PERINO: Yes. It's all baked in the cake, you can't separate it out. I think that is a good strategy actually. I was getting very excited about some of the things that the private market could start doing if the law was rejected, fully, not just under the commerce clause, but taken out completely. The things that somewhat, that we could do, is that health insurance was allowed to be sold across state lines.</p><p>If were you were in more control of your health care, so you didn't worry about if you lost your job, if you could take it with you. And the things that you might be able to purchase with that, like, if I wanted to go a chiropractor rather than go to a regular doctor, I would be in charge of the money and I would choose if I wanted to spend that money. And I just feel kind of deflated that what, and what Romney should do, I think, is to say because of this health care bill, we are now going to keep this lead blanket on innovation and on the economy and it's not that people who needed care wouldn't have gotten care.</p><p>It's just that America can and should do a lot better when it comes to the private market and unfortunately, it just now, I think it's going to be chaos for the next six months.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Before you go, I want to show everybody, if you're not watching \"THE FIVE,\" well, you're crazy. But a photo of Dana's new puppy, Jasper, if you watch \"THE FIVE,\" you've seen this, Dana is -- we're actually neighbors and I see the dog more often, I see Jasper more often than I see you. You and your lovely husband and --</p><p>PERINO: Well, and one of our neighbors also is Katharine McPhee, star of \"Smash\" and she came back from Los Angeles last night and Peter was downstairs with Jasper walking and they got to meet and he gave her lost of kisses and tore her earring off her ear but she found him and she's in love with him too. So, we've got a good neighborhood.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's a Vizslas.</p><p>PERINO: What about yours?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, I'll show you photos of our. You've never met. That's Mabel on the left and we think she's part Rat Terrier because she'd like to -- she killed a squirrel yesterday actually. And then Ramon, who is a Puerto Rican street dog.</p><p>PERINO: They've got to meet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They've got to meet. My dogs don't have the new puppy smell, but they do smell good because they got washed yesterday.</p><p>PERINO: That's good. We love our dogs.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, we do.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO: Jasper consoled me after the Supreme Court decision.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know, what? That's where you go.</p><p>PERINO: And actually, I'm not lying.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I know you're not lying. Dana, it was great to see you.</p><p>PERINO: Nice to see you too.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much. Dana Perino, co-host of \"THE FIVE.\" Don't miss it.</p><p>Now, some of the news stories that are making headlines this morning. Utility crews working in blistering heat trying to restore power to hundreds of thousands along the northeast corridor. A violent storm causing damage from Indiana to New Jersey and authorities confirming at least 15 deaths as a result.</p><p>FOX News correspondent Elizabeth Prann has the very latest from Charleston, West Virginia.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ELIZABETH PRANN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Among those killed in the severe weather, two young boys in New Jersey.

Governor Rick Scott saying, the state will not comply with the Supreme Court ruling to expand Medicaid and implement insurance exchanges. Wisconsin and Louisiana two other states with republican governors also opting out of these two provisions last week. The health care law takes full effect by January 2014, but the republican lawmakers are still vowing to repeal it before then.</p><p>A fiesta of democracy, that is what Enrique Pena Nieto is calling his victory in Mexico's presidential election. The official preliminary count gives Pena Nieto about 38 percent of the vote. He is part of the institutional revolutionary party or PRI which was voted out in 2000 after 71 years in power. The president-elect is promising Mexicans a government that is democratic, modern and open to criticism. The PRI was long accused of ruling the country through authoritarian and corrupt practices.</p><p>Now let's go to our news room and Diane Macedo has more business headlines for you this morning. Hi, Diane.</p><p>DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS: Hi, Dagen. So General Electric is selling part of its real estate division owned by GE Capital to Ever Bank Financial for $2.5 billion. The business property unit originates and services commercial real estate loans for properties owned or leased by small and mid-sized businesses.</p><p>So that's a new deal that's out. We'll continue to give you details on it as we get them in. In the meantime, shares of Amylin Pharmaceuticals are climbing in the pre-market after Bristol-Myers Squibb announced its buying the diabetes drug maker for $5.3 billion.</p><p>That breaks down to $31 a share and $9 higher than the offer that Bristol Myers reportedly made back in March and including that the whole deal is worth a total of $7 billion.</p><p>In connection with the buyout, Bristol-Myers also will enter into an alliance with British drug maker Astrazeneca to develop and commercialize Amylin's diabetes drugs.</p><p>Astrazenaco will pay Bristol $3.4 billion in that deal. Briston- Myers says its acquisition of Amyline will hurt earnings in 2012 and 2013 by 3 cents a share.</p><p>But the diabetes market is one of the pharmaceutical industry's faster growing with global sales expected to climb to $58 billion in 2018 according to evaluate so a lot of money to be made there -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Diane. Right now, we want to get a look at business travelers forecast. For that, we go to Maria Molina who is standing by in the Fox Business Weather Center. Hi, Maria.</p><p>MARIA MOLINA, FOXBUSINESS WEATHER: Good morning, Dagen. Good to see you and today we are going to be tracking more showers and storms that are possible across parts of the southeast.</p><p>Yesterday, we saw over 800 reports of severe storms -- or severe weather from some of the storms that fired up in the overnight hours.</p><p>And we still have some lingering showers associated with those same storm systems. You can see them popping up across parts of the state of Alabama and also Georgia.</p><p>But again, much quieter for today until we head into the afternoon hours and also the evening hours, when those stronger storms are up once again.</p><p>High temperatures, it's going to be another hot day, not as bad as what we saw this weekend like on Atlanta where on Saturday you hit a high temperature at 106 degrees, breaking your all-time record for the hottest temperature.</p><p>You've seen today is still warm though, 96 for your high temperature, 96 of as well in Chicago and Minneapolis well above average for this time of year at 99 degrees, factor in the humidity and of course, it's going to feel even a little bit hotter.</p><p>New England, you're a lot cooler today, Boston expecting a high temperature at 79 with some clouds and a spotty shower with a thunderstorm possible.</p><p>I'm not expecting widespread travel delays though with that precipitation in New England. It's going to be more of the hit or miss in nature activity.</p><p>New York City and Philadelphia, expecting some sunshine and another warm day in Philadelphia with a high temperature expected at 90 degrees.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Maria Molina, our meteorologist here at Fox Business.</p><p>We have some breaking news to bring you, a deal on this Monday. Dell is buying Quest Software for $2.4 billion. Quest offered software to help manage business, businesses manages their data bases, that's $28 a share, $2.4 billion.</p><p>But it was a deal that was expected, there have been some reports that this deal was in the works and coming and now, here it is. And we'll be watching Dell stock today as well as Quest.</p><p>Coming up after the break, one of the I-man's favorite business reporters Liz Macdonald would join me in the studio live.</p><p>And later the I-man's interview with Chris and Lorraine Wallace on her latest cookbook, \"Mr. Sunday's Saturday Night Chicken.\" Don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: A scandal caused Barclay's Chairman Marcus Agius' job and put CEO Bob Diamond in the sites of politicians, expecting the Diamond lost its sparkle. Does this scandal threaten to hit other banks worldwide?</p><p>The heat coming down on bankers around the globe, but it's nothing compared to the scorcher blistering parts of the U.S. and triggering deadly storms. Millions waking up this morning without electricity and temperatures soaring over 100 in some places.</p><p>Good morning, everybody. I'm Dagen McDowell. This is \"Best of IMUS IN THE MORNING.\" Let's take a quick look at the markets around the globe before I get to some news on earnings.</p><p>You look at Asia, the markets were essentially flat there except for nice solid gains in Australia. You go over to Europe, you have gains across the board, north of 1 percent gains in Germany and in France, and well, almost 1 percent and on the DAX, given up some gains there, but all three markets there in the green, major markets.</p><p>On the U.S. futures, we have a bit of a loss on the Dow and Nasdaq futures and commodities have been in the tank all morning long. And kind of like that though. Oil is down a buck 50 a barrel, thereabouts, to $83.45.</p><p>And we are getting earnings from Acuity Brands, the maker of an electrical component. Reporting a profit of 82 cents, that beat expectations of 78 cents. Revenue of $487.5 million, it did come up short of revenue expectation for analysts of $491 million.</p><p>But here in the studio with me to talk about foreclosures on homes the state of California, Liz Macdonald, is ready to make it tougher for banks to foreclose, across every single state across this country. Will it do more harm than good do you think?</p><p>LIZ MACDONALD, FOX BUSINESS: Yes, that's the question for bankers. They're saying it could do more harm than good because it could stop the foreclosure process, stop the housing recovery, stop the clearance of the backlog and that inventory.</p><p>And so what we're seeing is California has been fighting for its own set of foreclosure rules for about the last two years and one set of rules is coming to a vote today.</p><p>And what the issue is, what they want is, basically, stop foreclosure if a borrower is in loan modification, that could be extended for a very long time and basically the borrower could strike out that process and extend the payment process without paying anything, without paying any mortgage loan payment.</p><p>So the other issue, too, California notably is basically asking voters to approve the right to sue bankers during the foreclosure process, if they break any of their new foreclosure rules.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What about the other 50 states, Liz? Is this on a state by state basis?</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And how does it fit in with that massive settlement, that foreclosure settlement, the banks?</p><p>MACDONALD: This is what's important. It's on a state by state basis. We have 25 states right now, moving ahead with their own set of foreclosure rules and basically, we didn't expect this.</p><p>And I don't think the banking industry expected it and I don't think the media saw this coming. After the $25 billion foreclosure settlement in February, basically, we thought that that was the end of it.</p><p>But no, the states are saying forget it. Let's set aside the $25 billion foreclosure settlement. That does not stop us from issuing our own foreclosure rules, basically HARP 3.0 or HAMP 3.0, which is a federal program for the states.</p><p>So, you know, the bankers are coming out in the media saying it's going to make it difficult for us and to be able to clear that inventory if they're willy-nilly sets of rules.</p><p>We get it, we want to protect borrowers, but for the bankers, I'm sure they're going to feel like they're chasing a net in a hurricane or a moth in the hurricane, try to follow these different rules.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, but do you -- again, it's the -- do you get to stay in a home when you're not making payments on a home? It's not even your home.</p><p>Yes, if you're underwater on it and if you're underwater and you have no equity in it, it's not your house and you're basically living rent- free and at what point in this country do we say, enough is enough?</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, that's the issue, too. And also with the new rules coming, back to your point, we are going to wait for the rules to kick in, right and see how the rules play out in our own state.</p><p>You know, for example, New York State is talking about criminalizing forgery if there's in a foreclosure document, called a forgery and the issue, too, is will all the bankers out there get state by state rules and if they break the rules, would they be subject to lawsuits, even if they didn't know or had access to, weren't apprised to the rules ahead of time.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What's does it do to lending?</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, you know, the FHA doesn't like it. They've criticized it and they've criticized in the past, similar standards, right, similar ideas. And saying, freeze up credit. You know?</p><p>Banks could become gun shy and separate from that the Mortgage Bankers Association say the cost of thee different rules come down in the foreclosure rules will be passed along to future borrowers.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And makes you not want to live in one of those states or trying to find a home in one of those states.</p><p>Liz, thank you so much. Good to see you. Liz Macdonald on the Fox Business Network. She will be with you all day long. Right now, we want to go to our news room and Diane Macedo who has business headlines for you. Hi, Diane.</p><p>MACEDO: Hi, Dagen. So it's official, Dell is buying Qwest Software for $2.4 billion or $28 a share. Qwest offers software to help businesses manage their data bases. Dell's offer tops the one made by a property equity group led by insight very much partners bidding on Qwest the last few months. The deal marked Dell's latest effort to expand beyond its core business of personal computers.</p><p>And Barclay's Chairman Marcus Agius has resigned in the wake of the bank's interest rage rigging scandal. Agius who's been chairman for more than five years says the scandal has dealt a devastating blow to Barclay's reputation and buck stops with him.</p><p>He will stay on until they find a succession plan there. The bank was fined more than $450 million last week by British and U.S. regulators for submitting false documents on the London Interbank offered interest rate or Libor, which is the rate at which banks lend unsecured funds to each other.</p><p>Barclays had admitted that some of its traders attempted to manipulate that rate to make it look like the bank's borrowing costs look lower than they actually were in an attempt to make the bank and the industry in general look healthier than it actually is.</p><p>Agius' resignation is seen as an attempt to take the pressure off CEO Bob Diamond who is also facing calls to resign. Dagen, back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much. Diane, first, it was Mr. Sunday's soups and now Lorraine and Chris Wallace rejoin the I-man to talk another cookbook, this they're talking chicken. They recently sat down to talk about recipes with the I-man.</p><p>(REPEAT INTERVIEW WITH CHRIS AND LORRAINE WALLACE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Still ahead, we have a market check and some hilarious moments from IMUS IN THE MORNING.

He suspects this Dimon has lost its sparkle.  And to heat  other banks worldwide.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The heat coming down on bankers around the world but nothing is  compared to the scorcher blistering parts of the United States and  triggering deadly storms.  Millions waking up this morning without  electricity and temperatures in some places are over 100 degrees.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Chinese economy anything but hot and continues to cool down.  The  latest PMI reading indicates that factory production and exports continues  to plunge as investors wonder what happens when the world global engine  begins to stall.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And what's old is new again in Mexico where voters hand power to the  political party that ruled for 70 years but was swept from office more than  a decade ago only to return on this Monday, July the 2nd, 2012.  </p><p>Good morning, everybody.  Well, I'm back from vacation.  Connell is  not here.  He runs for the hills when he knows he has to be with me.  I'm  Dagen McDowell everybody.  This is BEST OF IMUS.  </p><p>And we've got some incredible interviews that the I-man did recently.   Coming up this hour, Jose Rodriguez.  And also Imus on Imus, not blonde on  blonde.  Deirdre, Imus and Wyatt Imus go head to head.  I missed that last  week and I cannot wait to see that.  </p><p>Meantime, let's bring you up to date on what is happening in the  global markets.  And first, we start with Asia.  The Hong Kong market was  closed for a holiday today.  And we had some mixed reaction there.  Again,  that reading on Chinese factory activity did come in better than expected,  somewhat better than expected.  The Nikkei was lower, one with the Kospi  and South Korea.  But the Shanghai managed to tick up just a bit.  But the  ASX 200 index was also higher.  </p><p>We have gains across the board, potentially we follow a reaction to  what happened with European leaders and the changes in that bailout  facility to help Italy and Spain.  We'll see if that lasts.  Coming up,  we'll talk to a guest from Europe, from London.  </p><p>Let's take a look at the futures here in the U.S.  It looks like a  positive start.  Again, the markets closed early tomorrow.  Off on  Wednesday.  Very busy week for data with that critical jobs report coming  out on Friday.  And we have essentially flat lines there.  Not flat but  down.  Oil and gold with gold falling almost one percent.  Oil is down two  percent this morning.  </p><p>For more on the European markets, let's go live to London where we're  joined by Jane Foley, senior foreign currency strategist for Rabobank.   Jane, how long does the euphoria from that deal struck by European leaders  last?  Do you think that we can even get a couple more days out of this in  terms of gains? </p><p>JANE FOLEY, RABOBANK SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST:  Well, that's really  the big question and that will be the question that prevail over the next  few weeks.  It is quite likely that we'll get decent support from this over  the next few weeks, perhaps over the next few months.  But I think as we've  already been seen, there was already some skepticism entering in here and  there's still a lot of pit holes thrown up by what was agreed last week.   And a lot of uncertainty about the details too.  </p><p>You've already mentioned the banking supervisions.  How long is it  going to take for Europe to get a single banking supervisor?  And what  exactly, what should have shaken this at going to be?  And there's also  about the ESM too.  There's been some complaints in some European countries  about the seniority the announcement last week, that the ESM would not be  seen here to -- holders of Spanish government debt.  So, again some  confusion today and therefore some backtracking.  More consultative tone I  think we should say in some markets in Europe this morning.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What is the next great hurdle for the European markets?   What is the next meeting, piece of news that you were looking to that we  can count on -- give us some direction in these markets? </p><p>FOLEY:  Well, of course, we do have the ECB policy meeting on  Thursday.  Many people expecting a rate cut there because of course the  very slow growth conditions in Europe.  Beyond that, we have a finance  ministers meeting on July the ninth.  But that will be important because  the market is expecting more detail about the purchase that were announced  last week.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What also is the reaction to the resignation to the  chairman of Barclays, the livewire scandal there, what it means for other  banks not just in Europe but around the globe? </p><p>FOLEY:  Well, of course, Barclays is one of the first banks to come  through and pay the fine and be fully investigated in the scandal.  But I  think many people in many parts of the world are waiting for what else is  going to come.  And there could be further bad news ahead.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jane, thank you so much.  Jane Foley, senior foreign  currency strategist for Rabobank.  </p><p>Let's take a closer look at the Asian markets.  And for that, we go  to FOX Business contributor Katie Sargent.  She joins us on the phone from  Singapore.  Hey, Katie, reaction to that factory report from China.  </p><p>KATIE SARGENT, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  That seems to be something  that's taking the markets, taking the wind out of the market sails today,  Dagen.  Most of the markets in the region started the day pretty strong,  still kind of riding that wave of euphoria on the agreement from last week  over the European banks.  But that quickly waned when we started looking at  PMI numbers.  </p><p>We saw more evidence of a slowdown in China over the weekend.  The  official Purchasing Managers Index for June came out showing a drop from  May.  It was better than expected but still showed a drop.  And there was a  private PMI report released today that also showed activities shrank in  June.  They are a little bit in disagreement over the final number but both  are showing a slowdown.  </p><p>So, the session started quite positive for the region.  Australia's  benchmark ASX 200 was up nearly one percent.  But then as I say, things  slowdown, the Nikkei in Japan hit a two-month in today high before  faltering and finishing the day little changed.  Not much movement in the  rest of the markets either -- Dagen.  </p><p>MACEDO:  Thank you so much, Katie.  Katie Sargent on the phone from  Singapore.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Now, for a closer look at the U.S. markets and a preview of  how things will shape up today, we go to our very own Lauren Simonetti from  the Newsroom.  Good morning, Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Good morning.  The fireworks  were lit early on Wall Street with stellar gains for the major averages.   The Dow rocketing 277 points on Friday.  June, great months too with gains  of at least 3.8 percent for the three major averages.  This first trading  day of July will be a busy one and an equally busy week.  National  manufacturing figures on tap.  Auto sales tomorrow.  And that key  government jobs report for June is out on Friday.  </p><p>Speaking of jobs, they are moving off of Wall Street.  The trend is  called near shoring.  It's where big financial tightened higher and  relocated workers to cities like Salt Lake, City, Utah.  And Jacksonville,  Florida where rent, taxes and labor all cost less.  </p><p>Silicon Valley is seeing a similar exodus.  That's the big tech giant  find saving in other U.S. cities.  And how do you read it?  \"Fifty Shades  of Grey\" laying off bookstore shelves.  EL James' erotic novel became the  nation's fastest selling paper back to reach one million sales.  </p><p>Nelson book scan (ph) finds that it took 11 weeks to reach that mark,  that was 25 weeks faster than the previous record holder, \"The Vinci Code.\"   Back to you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lauren, thank you so much.  I will say nothing about that  book since I have not read it and have no plans to read it.  Now, we go to  our Newsroom and Diane Macedo who has a look at more business news for you  this morning.  Hey, Diane.  </p><p>DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  I will say nothing about the book  because my mother is watching.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Barclays Chairman Marcus Agius has resigned in the wake of the bank's  interest rate raging scandal.  Agius who has been the chairman for more  than five years says, the scandal has dealt a devastating blow to Barclays'  reputation.  And at the buck stops with him, he will stay in the position  until a succession plan is in place.  </p><p>You might remember the bank was fined more than $450 million last  week by a British and U.S. regulators for submitting false documents on the  London interbank offered interest rate, which the rate at which banks lend  unsecured funds to each other.  Barclays has admitted that some of its  traders attempted to manipulate that rate.  Agius' resignation is seen as  an attempt to take some pressure off CEO Bob Dimon who along with Agius  also is facing calls to resign.  </p><p>Airbus is set to unveil plans for its first U.S. factory today.  The  company's parent, European Aeronautic Defense and Space plans to spend $600  million to build a facility in Mobile, Alabama.  Once it opens in 2015, the  plant is expected to create 1,000 jobs and will reportedly produce four  planes a month by 2017.  The move also puts the facility on the home turf  of U.S. rival Boeing which has 2700 employees in Alabama as well.  </p><p>Bristol-Myers Squibb is buying diabetes drug maker Amylin  Pharmaceuticals for $5.3 billion.  That breakdown to $31 dollars a share,  nine dollars higher.  And the offer Bristol-Myers reportedly made back in  March.  Now, if you include debt, the deal is worth a total of $7 billion.  </p><p>In addition, Bristol-Myers will enter into an alliance with British  drug maker Astra Zeneca to developed and commercialize Amylin's diabetes  drugs.  Astra Zeneca will pay Bristol-Myers $3.4 billion in that deal,  Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Diane.  Following attacks on 9/11, the  CIA was instructed to protect Americans by any means necessary.  Some of  the agency's methods were later questioned but a new book by former CIA  operative Jose Rodriguez defends the tactics used to fight the terrorists.   Rodriguez was on recently to discuss it all with the I-man.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DON IMUS, HOST, \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\":  Please welcome to the program  Jose Rodriguez, has got a book called \"The Hard Measures: How Aggressive  CIA Actions after 9/11 Saved Americans Lives.\"  Mr. Rodriguez, sits here  and listening to me.  Juan use vial language to try and apologize for it.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  And two, scream and swear at the recorded commercials which  makes me pretty much a mental patient.  Anyway, first of all, good morning,  Mr. Rodriguez.  </p><p>JOSE RODRIGUEZ, \"HARD MEASURES\" AUTHOR:  Thank you.</p><p>IMUS:  How are you?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Thank you for inviting me on the show.  </p><p>IMUS:  I saw you on \"60 Minutes.\"  How did that go? </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  That went well.  You know, it was my first time out doing  this.  I was a 31-year CIA veteran and clandestinity was my thing.  And  coming out in the open like that was a new one for me.  So, far so good.  </p><p>IMUS:  Were you covert operations for the entire 31 years? </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  I was covert operative for 31 years.  </p><p>IMUS:  OK.  So, were you at the University of Florida?  Is that where  you went to school? </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Yes, I did.  </p><p>IMUS:  And you were recruited there? </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  No.  I left the university and I sent an application.   And it takes awhile but a couple of years later, I was recruited.  </p><p>IMUS:  You sent an application to the CIA?  </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Yes.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Why did you want do that? </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  I have lived in Latin America all my life, had traveled  overseas, was interested in foreign affairs, was interested in that type of  life.  And, you know, I was always interested in the CIA.  So, when it came  to time, I was very fortunate to get recruited.  </p><p>IMUS:  What did you tell people you do? </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Well, usually you know, I was assigned overseas for 17  years, so I had State Department cover, so I was a State Department  official forever.  </p><p>IMUS:  Right.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  So, that's what you -- they didn't know you were in the CIA? </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Well, you know, it's kind of a game.  I think most people  know who you are, you know.  And then when you become chief of station, you  become declared to that country.  </p><p>IMUS:  Right.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  So, the official, the local service, knows who you are.   And, you know, they can tell anybody else.  So, it's one of those things  that you do but it doesn't matter much.  You still have to do your job.  </p><p>IMUS:  Now, the secrets you reveal, I guess they are, in this book  and the techniques, methods and all that stuff, why did you do this?  Was  it a good idea or? </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  No, I did not reveal any secrets.  </p><p>IMUS:  OK.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  I mean, they were already exposed.  As a matter of fact,  President Obama released the legal opinion that has all these techniques.   He did it in 2009 against the advice of a couple of CIA directors because  he was concerned that he would give away to the enemy exactly the outer  limits of what was permissible under U.S. law, so.  </p><p>IMUS:  Permissible in terms of interrogation? </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  In terms of the law, what our law permits for how far we  can go, yes, in interrogating prisoners.  </p><p>IMUS:  OK.  And so, you decided to do the book for what reason? </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  I decided to write the book to set the record straight  because to me, it is unbelievable the amount of misinformation that has  been out there regarding our programs after 9/11.  I wrote the book because  I was the subject of a criminal investigation for three years for  destroying some tapes and I never got the chance to say my side of the  story.  </p><p>And I wrote the book because there are a lot of people who are still  caught up in investigations that are very unfair and are suffering a lot  because of it, because they did what our government asked them to do.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes, paramount at the top tier of misinformation, what would  be the biggest misconception that the general public, people like me and  others, would be embracing? </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  That the enhanced interrogation techniques were torture.  </p><p>IMUS:  Right.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  That's the top.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes, it sounds to me -- of course it's just me -- but like it  could have been fun but just me, but people think -- I've got a couple of  people a little while ago, one of whom thought that we never got any good  information, water boarding people.  </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Tat is such --</p><p>IMUS:  Nonsense.  </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Can I say crap in radio?  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Because we got thousands of intelligence reports.  We  were able to disrupt plots.  We were able to capture high-level terrorists.   We were able to destroy the al-Qaeda organization that attacked us on 9/11  because of the work that we did.  </p><p>IMUS:  So, the people say, well, when you torture people, they'll  simply tell you what they think you want to hear but --   </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Well, first of all, this is not torture.  </p><p>IMUS:  Right.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  And second of all, we're smarter than that.  You know, we  have people who are world experts on al-Qaeda and actually know quite a bit  about these individuals already.  So, we've vetted them very closely and  check it.  And, you know, these people eventually come through with a lot  of really good stuff.  </p><p>IMUS:  Of course, one of you guys are lawyers.  And like lawyers, you  already know the answer to the question before you ask it.  You just want  to see if they're willing to give it to you, so.  </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Yes, I think the key is knowledge.  I mean, the key to a  good interrogation is knowledge.  How much knowledge do you know of the  target?  Because if you do, then they can't fool you.  </p><p>IMUS:  So, leading up to the murder of -- murder, assassination,  whatever of Osama -- the killing of Osama bin Laden, what led up to that? </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  As you know, it was a ten-year effort.  We started to  look -- </p><p>IMUS:  A lot of people don't know that.  </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Yes.  Well, it was a ten-year effort.  We started looking  for Bin Laden the day after 9/11.  </p><p>IMUS:  Right.  Well, I guess they knew that but they didn't know that  it was a concentrated effort in intelligence gathering and so on.  So, walk  me through that if you can.  </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Yes.  Interestingly, because if you had asked me in 2002,  how long it would take to get Bin Laden, I would take you 18 months, two  years perhaps.  Because I figured eventually, we would find him.  But he  took himself out of the day-to-day running of al-Qaeda, and he decided he  would become the symbolic figure.  So, he gave up his day-to-day duties and  moved to a compound in Pakistan and communicated with al-Qaeda central via  courier.  </p><p>And the courier would go by every two or three months to deliver  messages from him to the principals of the organization.  So until we found  the courier, we would not be able to find Bin Laden.  And finding the  courier took a long time because it's one person.  And we started to get  some information in 2004 about the courier.  We got the pseudonym of the  courier...  </p><p>IMUS:  How did you get that?  Through enhance interrogation.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  We got that from interrogating at one of our black sites, a  facilitator that we had captured.  </p><p>IMUS:  What is a black site? </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  A black site is the location where we would take this  terrorist to, to interrogate.  </p><p>IMUS:  Right.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  And it was a secure location.  It was secure and secret,  and we hid in plain sight in different parts of the world so that we could  have total access, unrestricted access that we controlled to the detainee.  </p><p>IMUS:  Were you all at the agency and you and everybody, were you  surprised that you turned up in Pakistan? </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  No.  We always thought he was in Pakistan.  So, I'm not  surprised.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  Were you surprised that -- it seemed like a relatively  easy -- I mean once they decided to go ahead and storm the compound, it  seemed like a fairly easy operation.  Maybe I'm just na[ve or --   </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  No, I think, you know, we got the best Special Forces in  the world, and I'm sure that they do this and do it very well.  So, I think  that once, you know, the hardest part is to find the guy, in my view.  I  think that once you have the target, our special operators can plan it and  with the precision and the fire power and their skill, you know, I don't  think there's anybody better in the world.  </p><p>IMUS:  So, what impact on the whole global terror operation did  killing him have? </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  He was a symbolic figure.  As I said before, he was not  running operations day to day.  He was sending pronouncements, I would like  to attack America.  I would like to, you know, do this and the other.  But  he had no direct impact on the day-to-day planning of operations, but he  was still a symbolic figure and it was important to kill him.  </p><p>IMUS:  What did they -- did the CIA have to sign off on your book or? </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Yes, they had to review it.  You know, the manuscript is  turned over to them.  And they go through the publication review board.   And they take some stuff out.  And we know we discussed with them some  things and take some things out.  And agree on others.  So, yes, it's a  process.  </p><p>IMUS:  Congratulations.  \"60 Minutes\" and all these other programs.   You can't help but have a bestseller.  I hope you do, so.  </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Thank you so much.  Thanks for inviting me.  </p><p>IMUS:  By the way, thanks for your service to our country.  </p><p>RODRIGUEZ:  Thank you so much.  </p><p>IMUS:  Jose Rodriguez, \"Hard Measures.\" </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  When we come back, everybody, we'll have more news for you  business and otherwise.  Also, the latest on those deadly storms that  devastated areas up and down the east coast leaving millions without power.  </p><p>Plus, your business travelers forecast with Maria Molina who is  watching this storm and the attempted recovery.  </p><p>And later, it is Imus on Imus as Deirdre Imus takes on son Wyatt  Imus.  They battle it out on some very interesting topics.         </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAL)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We take you around the world at a look at Asian markets.   First, mixed markets there but very, very slight losses in Japan and South  Korea.  A slight gain on the Shanghai.  But again, Hong Kong closed for  holiday.  Gains across the board in Europe.  </p><p>Again, follow on euphoria from that European agreement, effort to  bail out the banks in that country.  Flat futures here in the U.S. but  after those gains last week and then take a look at oil and gold.  Oil,  however, continued to tumble down almost two percent.  I kind of like that.  </p><p>And now, some of the news stories making headlines this morning.   Utility crews working in blistering heat trying to restore power to  hundreds of thousands along the northeast corridor.  A violent storm  causing damage from Indiana to New Jersey.  And authorities confirming at  least 13 deaths as a result.  </p><p>FOX News correspondent Elizabeth Prann had the latest from  Charleston,, West Virginia.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ELIZABETH PRANN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Among those  killed in the severe weather, two young boys in New Jersey.  They were  camping and crushed by a downed tree.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN:  Fifty foot tall pine tree snapped.  It fell on a  tent that was occupied by two boys, a 7-year-old and 2-year-old.  </p><p>PRANN:  Powerful winds and frequent lightning whipped through the Mid- Atlantic States Friday night.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN:  It sounds like the fourth of July.  There was a  major late show, I mean, the lightning didn't stop for about 90 minutes.  </p><p>PRANN:  An Amtrak train traveling from New York to Chicago waylaid in  West Virginia by downed trees.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN:  I heard the weather and heard the stuff hitting  inside of the train.  And next thing I know we were stopped.  It was pitch- black.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN:  You have the power out and nothing but mountains on  both sides.  </p><p>PRANN:  The 232 passengers eventually making it out by bus.  Ohio,  West Virginia, Maryland and Virginia all declared states of emergency.   President Obama has reached out to the governors.  Trees twisted in wires  across the Washington, D.C. suburbs, crews in Virginia and Maryland trying  to entangle a puzzle of power lines saying, the job requires some extra  manpower.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN:  We requested over 1,000 crews from different parts  of the country.  </p><p>PRANN:  Linemen working here in West Virginia in the 90-degree heat  trying to restore power and relief to more than half a million customers.  </p><p>(on camera) The National Weather Service calling Friday night's storm  a derate (ph) show, meaning a line of thunderstorm packing damaging  straight line winds some cities feeling gusts up to 90 miles per hour.  </p><p>In Charleston, West Virginia, Elizabeth Prann, FOX News.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Florida is now saying no to two features of President  Obama's health care law.  Governor Rick Scott saying, the state will not  comply with the Supreme Court ruling to expand medicaid and implement  insurance exchanges.  Wisconsin and Louisiana to other states with  republican governors also opting out of the two provisions last week.  The  health care law will take full effect in January 2014 but republican  lawmakers are vowing to repeal it before then.  </p><p>A fiesta of democracy, that is what Enrique Pena Nieto is calling his  victory in Mexico's presidential election.  The official preliminary count  gives Pena Nieto about 38 percent of the vote.  Pena Nieto is part of the  institutional revolutionary party which was voted out of office in 2000  after 71 years in power.  The president-elect is promising Mexicans a  government that is democratic, modern and open to criticism.  The PRI, the  party as it's known, was long accused of ruling the country through  authoritarian and corrupt practices.  </p><p>And Spain does it again beating Italy four to nothing in the European  championship last night.  It is Spain's third straight major soccer title.   Tens of thousands of fans gathering in central Madrid to see the team win.   Fireworks and celebrations give temporary relief to the country's economic  crisis.  </p><p>Apparently, you can still play soccer if you're a broke nation.  The  team becomes the first to win a euro and then a world cup and then another  euro.  Cheers all around.</p><p>Let's go up to Diane Macedo who has a look at business news this  morning.  Diane, did you watch any of it? </p><p>MACEDO:  I didn't actually.  I didn't get a chance to.  But I do love  watching soccer.  I heard it was a great game.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yap.  Indeed.  </p><p>MACEDO:  Busy working.  But Facebook executives have decided to keep  the company stock listed on the NASDAQ despite issues surrounding its IPO.   This is according to the \"Wall Street Journal\" which says, the company had  considered moving its shares off the NASDAQ in the days following its  trading debut, but now feel that would erode confidence in the shares even  further.  </p><p>Facebook's executives have quietly blamed the NASDAQ for the glitches  in the IPO.  But officials say that -- officials at the exchange that is  are working to repair the relationship.  Dow is closely wrapping up its  efforts to buy quest software.  According to reports, the deal could be  announced as early as today.  </p><p>There's still no word on a final price but last week Dell offered  roughly $2.3 billion for quest which offered software to help businesses  manage their data bases.  Dell's latest offer was better than the one made  by a private equity group led by inside ventures partners which is also  have been bidding on quest for the last few months.  If Dell does finalizes  the deal, it will mark the company's latest effort to expand beyond its  core business of personal computers.  </p><p>And a movie about a foul-mouthed teddy bear was the top ticket at the  box office this weekend.  Ted took in more than $50 million in North  America beating Channing Tatum's steamy role as a male stripper in \"Magic  Mike.\"  Walt Disney's animated fairy tale brave which was last week's  number one fell to third place.  </p><p>Tyler Perry's new film \"Madea's Witness Protection\" and \"Madagascar  3\" round out the top 5 -- Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If you're going to talk about \"Magic Mike,\" we got to role  some video, I'm sorry (INAUDIBLE) at the full screen -- but just Dagen,  thanks Diane.  </p><p>Right now, we want to get a look at the business travelers' forecast  for you.  And we go to Maria Molina who is standing by in the FOX Business  Weather Center.  Maria, what do you know?  </p><p>MARIA MOLINA, METEOROLOGIST:  Hey, Dagen.  And we're looking at some  showers and thunderstorms still rolling through portions of the Carolinas,  Georgia, the State of Alabama and also the Florida panhandle but nothing  like what we saw last night or in the overnight hours when we saw over 800  reports of severe weather, a lot of them coming from this region where  we're still dealing with some lingering showers across parts of the  Carolinas down into Florida.    </p><p>Now we're still going to be seeing very hot temperatures.  So our heat  wave is going to continue not just for today but even over most of this  work week.  So 90 will be your high in New York City; 96 in Chicago and  Atlanta; and upper 90's in the city of Denver.  So it's going to be another  scorcher.  And of course Dagen when you factor in the humidity, it feels  even hotter during the afternoon.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  Maria Molina, our meteorologist in Fox  Business.</p><p>Coming up after the break, we'll check on the markets for you.  And  stay tuned for an Imus family interview as the I-man gives both Deirdre Imus and his son Wyatt an opportunity to battle it  out over the air waves.  Stick around as this best of Imus on the Fox  Business Network continues.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The live, more scandal cost Barclays chairman Marcus Agius  his job, puts CEO Bob Dimon in the sights of politician who thinks Dimon  has lost his sparkle and also threatens to hit other banks worldwide.</p><p>The heat coming down on bankers, but it's nothing compared to the  scorcher blistering parts of the U.S. and triggering deadly storms.   Millions wake up this morning without electricity while temperatures in  some places top 100 degrees.</p><p>Welcome back everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell here on this Best of Imus  in the Morning.  We've got your markets for you and so much more.  Some  incredible guests coming up in the next couple of hours include Dana Perena  (ph).  And we'll show you a special little new addition to her family if  you haven't been watching The Five.  Well, shame on you if you haven't been  watching The Five.</p><p>In the meantime, we'll take you around the world and look at stocks in  Asia.  First we had a mixed market with just slight losses in Japan and  South Korea, slight gain on the Shanghai.  Hong Kong closed.</p><p>But European markets are up across the board, up nearly 1 percent in  Germany and then in France as well.  Again, more positive reaction to the  bailout decision from those European leaders last week.</p><p>We had incredible numbers on the stock market here.  Stocks are  essentially flat.  It's going to be kind of a funny week, if you will, with  the markets closed for July 4 on Wednesday.  And then nothing funny about a  drop in oil.  We kind of love that.  Oil is off its lows in the session so  far, but still down about $1.50 a barrel.</p><p>For more on the European markets, let's go live to London.  Where  we're joined by Mike Ingram, market analyst for BGC Partners.</p><p>Mike, great of you to be here this morning.  How long does this  excitement last, do you think?</p><p>MARK INGRAM, BGC PARTNERS:  Well, I think this market probably has a  bit of legs to it.  I mean, the other thing that's likely to further  support the market during the course of the week is the ECB decision on  Thursday.  And there there's wide expectation that we will see a rate cut  and they might even fiddle around with the deposit rates to try to get some  of that commercial banking cash off the central bank's balance sheet.</p><p>But yeah, I mean, there is clearly a lot of analysis out of what came  out of Brussels on Friday.  And we're putting it on Monday still feeling  pretty perky.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In terms of fixing the financial problems that have plagued  Europe and the nations there, when do you think a final fix is in?  How  many years are we looking at to have true kind of fiscal unity across the  continent?</p><p>INGRAM:  Well, if you can consider that it took something like 12  years to get the single currency up and running in the first place, we are  certainly talking about months and years rather than weeks and months.  And  in fact, if you go back back to what was actually agreed on, on Friday --  and I wrote on this -- there are a lot of unanswered questions.  For  instance, everybody is saying Spain's bank is going to get cash up front  it'll get directly in the banks.  But none of that can happen until the  European central bank, the ECB is there as a regulator.  That's probably  six months away.  </p><p>So, yeah, this is going to be a long and torturous road.  I guess  we're all going to be commenting on it for a good long time yet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then of course Spain, you know, wins the euro, the  championship, yay, I guess.  Thank you, Mike.</p><p>INGRAM:  Yeah, there a lot of people suddenly Spanish over here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.  We get that a lot here.  Mike, thanks so much.   Mike Ingram from BGC Partners.</p><p>INGRAM:  It's my pleasure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Help may be just around the corner for struggling  homeowners.  A new government program is in the works even though previous ones have had little to no impact on the  housing market.</p><p>Fox Business's Peter Barnes is in Washington, D.C. with the details --  Peter.</p><p>PETER BARNES, FOX BUSINESS sources say the White House is planning a  big push this month to expand government mortgage refinance programs.  The  president announced this idea in his State of the Union Address in January,  but now Senate Democrats produced three bills that the administration says  would offer millions more homeowners lower interest rates on their  mortgages.  The refinances would be done through the FHA, Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac.</p><p>In recent weeks, Obama economic aides have been ramping up the push  online and through social media.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We need congress to act to put this plan into  action for real.</p><p>So we've talked about why we think refinancing is important.  But we  want to hear from you.  We want to hear your stories.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARNES:  Expect to see the president follow up at campaign events this  month to put pressure on Republicans to support the legislation.  And  administration official says the White House and Senate Democrats are  trying to work out a compromise with Senate Republicans to move the bills,  but Democratic leaders are expected to bring them to a vote by the end of  this month even if they can't get a deal.</p><p>But with no support for the measures in the Republican-controlled  House, critics see this as an election-year play, a ploy for votes in key battle ground states hard hit by the housing crisis.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TERRY HAINES, POTOMAC RESEARCH GROUP:  Sounds like something that is - - achieves their legislative goals, but at the same time is not something  that in a practical sense is going to be able to have much impact before  the election on homeowner refinancing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARNES:  The Obama official says the Senate bills would be paid for  mainly through higher closing costs and fees for borrowers, though one  program would require $4 billion in funding from congress.</p><p>Back to you in New York.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Peter.  Peter Barnes in D.C.</p><p>Let's go to our news room and Diane Macedo who has a look at more  business headlines.</p><p>Hey, Diane.</p><p>MACEDO:  Hi Dagen.</p><p>So Barclays chairman Marcus Agius has resigned in the wake of the  bank's interest rate rigging scandal.  Agius who has been the chairman for  more than five years says the scandal has dealt a devastating blow to  Barclays reputation and the buck stops with him.</p><p>He will stay in position, though, until a succession plan is in place.   The bank was fined more than $450 million last week by British and U.S.  regulators for submitting false documents on a London Interbank Offered  Interest Rate which is the rate at which banks lend unsecured funds to each  other.  Barclays admitted some of its trader attempted to manipulate that  rate.  The resignation is scene as an attempt to take the pressure off CEO  Bob Dimon who is also facing calls to resign. </p><p>Germany's Linde is buying U.S.-based home oxygen provider Lincare  Holdings for $4.6 billion.  The deal breaks down to $41.50 a share, a 22  percent premium on its closing price Friday.  Linde's main customers are in  the steel and chemical sectors, but it also provides gases used to process  solar cells and make LCD TV's.</p><p>Dagen, back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Diane.</p><p>Usually it's Deirdre Imus versus Lis Wiehl squaring off on blonde on  blonde, but this time it was Wyatt Imus who debated the issues with his  mother Deirdre.  And things did get a little heated.  Here's some of that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DON IMUS:  It's time for Blonde on Blonde with Deirdre Imus and  ordinarily Lis Wiehl,  But here filling in for Lis Wiehl, 13-year-old Wyatt Imus.  Good morning, Mr. mus.</p><p>WYATT IMUS, DON IMUS' SON:  Hey dad.</p><p>DON IMUS:  How are you?</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  I'm fine.</p><p>DON IMUS:  Are you up to filling in for Lis?</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  Oh, yes.  I think if I just don't get hammered by mom  like Lis does, I'll be fine.</p><p>DON IMUS:  Good morning, Ms. Imus.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS, DON IMUS' WIFE:  Good morning.</p><p>DON IMUS:  OK.  So time for another addition of Blonde on Blonde.</p><p>So, what were you two bickering about?</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  Before, we were discussing what would you do without all  your stuff surrounding you.</p><p>DON IMUS:  What are you talking about?</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  All your stuff.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  Everywhere you go, you have like this stuff around you.</p><p>DON IMUS:  I have a clock here.</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  No, Dad.  You have piles.</p><p>DON IMUS:  Of what?</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  Of stuff.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  Like your tissues, your baby wipes, your humidifier,  your inhaler, your oxygen, your little markers.</p><p>DON IMUS:  Fine, that is our first question.  Where are my Q-tips.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  It's like day-care.</p><p>DON IMUS:  Bernard, you dope.</p><p>There's the first question.  Start with you, Deirdre.</p><p>How old do you think people should be before they have sex?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  20's.</p><p>DON IMUS:  Wyatt, what do you think?</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  13.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  Oh, my god.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  The apple didn't fall far from the tree.</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  I think however responsible someone is to be able to have  sex with another person.  Some 30-year olds or 20-year olds aren't  responsible enough.</p><p>DON IMUS:  No.</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  But if you're 16 or 17 and you can be responsible.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  What does responsible mean?</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  Mean, you use right protection, you're not stupid.  You  don't just do it with anybody like he did in the 60's.</p><p>DON IMUS:  Wyatt, let me explain something to you.  Leave me out of  this.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  You mean in the 40's.</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  Well, he was born in the 40's.</p><p>DON IMUS:  Leave me out of this.</p><p>So you think 16?</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  I think whenever you're responsible enough to have sex  with someone else.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  Well, you know, he actually -- I want to add to that  even in your 20's you have to be responsible.</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  I mean, like we don't know, I may be responsible enough.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  No, 13 is not responsible, darling.  14 isn't, 15  isn't. 16 isn't.</p><p>No, you have to be in your 20's at least.</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  Mom, what if a 17-year-old is more responsible than a 22- year-old?  Sometimes that happens.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  Well, that does happen.  And same with a 30-year-old.</p><p>DON IMUS:  Well, how old is Austin?</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  Austin is 18.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  18.</p><p>DON IMUS:  Isn't Austin having sex with his girlfriend?</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  Probably.</p><p>DON IMUS:  Yeah, probably.  </p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  I wouldn't know.</p><p>DON IMUS:  But what do you think, Wyatt?</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  Well, let's bring him in and ask him.</p><p>DON IMUS:  Well, no I'm not going to bring in Austin and ask him.   Austin is one of the kid wranglers here at the ranch.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  And he's a great kid, a responsible kid.</p><p>DON IMUS:  Let's not get hysterical.</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  I don't know.  I mean, see his girlfriend so probably.</p><p>DON IMUS:  so you don't agree?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  Agree to what?</p><p>DON IMUS:  With Wyatt, that 16 would be old enough.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  Absolutely not.  Absolutely not.  It's too young.  You  don't know enough.  There's too many diseases, even gonorrhea now is at an  all-time high.  There's too much even with protected sex that things  happen, pregnancies and other diseases.  I absolutely don't agree.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Not to mention the emotional peril.</p><p>DON IMUS:  Yes.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  Right.  Actually people change their course in life.   This is a very important time between high school and college.  Boys and  girls will actually not go to the college they want to go to, not pursue  what their dreams are because of a girlfriend or boyfriend and they don't  realize it ruins their life later in life.  Even if you tell them right now  stay on course, they don't and they can't see that.  They're blind-sided.</p><p>DON IMUS:  OK, how about that, Wyatt?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  Are you going to do that with your rodeo career, have  some girl blind side you so then you forever ruin your rodeo career and  your schooling with college and everything else because all of a sudden  some girl comes along?</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  No.  I wouldn't lose focus.  I'm definitely going to  bring one home to you, though, because you'll freak out.  Won't she, dad?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  I won't freak out.</p><p>DON IMUS:  Of course not.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  No, If you're in college, you know...</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  If I'm in college </p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  And all of sudden you're really interested in a girl  and you bring one home, I'll check her out and make sure everything is good, but I'm not going to say that's great  honey.</p><p>DON IMUS:  Speaking of rodeo career, what's the fastest you've ever  roped and tied a cow?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  On record or in practice?</p><p>DON IMUS:  In practice.</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  8.8.</p><p>DON IMUS:  8.8 seconds.</p><p>OK, what's the fastest in a rodeo?</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  The world record?</p><p>DON IMUS:  No, you.</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  Oh, 10.3.</p><p>DON IMUS:  OK, so if I told you what's the world record?</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  6.3.</p><p>DON IMUS:  OK, if I told you you could rope and tie a calf in junior  rodeo coming up this fall in 6.2 seconds if you took a harmless but  nevertheless helpful performance-enhancing drug, would you take it?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  Do you know what that means?</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  Yeah, I know...</p><p>DON IMUS:  Just a steroid or something.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  Probably not.</p><p>DON IMUS:  Yeah, but you seem reluctant to answer that question.</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  Well, I was thinking about it.  They don't drug test in  rodeo.</p><p>DON IMUS:  No, they don't.</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  But that 6.2 seconds wouldn't be true.  I wouldn't be  able to do it if I wasn't on the drug.  I wouldn't just be able to do it by  myself.</p><p>DON IMUS:  Right.</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  So, no, I'd try to work towards that 6.2 without drugs.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  Yeah, he's my man.</p><p>DON IMUS:  So you realize a lot of kids would do it.</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  Would dope?</p><p>DON IMUS:  Yes.</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  Right, but...</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  Yeah, a lot of kids would be like Lance Armstrong.</p><p>DON IMUS:  But a lot of people -- let's leave one of the great  American sports heroes in my lifetime... </p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  Well, his whole sport of cycling is corrupt.  And he's  the only one that doesn't blood dope? Come on?</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  Stop.  Stop.  Time out.</p><p>What about -- if they are all drug doping and you do it, all you're  doing is leveling out the playing field.</p><p>DON IMUS:  Right.</p><p>DEIDRE IMUS:  Like they do in baseball too, unfortunately.</p><p>DON IMUS:  So if...</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  So really you would only be trying to compete with your  peers.  So, I really don't know how bad it would be.</p><p>DON IMUS:  It would be immoral.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  And unethical.</p><p>DON IMUS:  And perhaps illegal.</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  But you would be getting beat every week.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  That's why it's a great question, because could you  live with yourself and would you actually do that?  You would go that far  and be unethical, illegal and wrong just for the sake of saying I won and  did the fastest time in the world at the NFR?</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  Now we're at the NFR?  I thought we were in junior high.</p><p>DON IMUS:  We're tying 6.2 in junior high.</p><p>DEIDRE IMUS:  Oh, he's a phenom then.</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  But I'm tying 6.2 in junior high but I'm drug doping  that's the only way I can do it?</p><p>DON IMUS:  Right.</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  Well, no, because it wouldn't mean anything.</p><p>DON IMUS:  You being a fanatical rodeo mom -- and I've seen you at the  rodeos -- you don't wish well to the other children.  You want all the  other kids roping against Wyatt to come in second, which is fine.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  My philosophy is like Mrs. Bonnie Beaver, I want  everyone to do well.  I want Wyatt to win. And everyone else to come in  second and third.</p><p>DON IMUS:  OK, if you knew he could set the world record in junior  high rodeo at 6.2 seconds, would you be for him...</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  You mean if he had to do steroids of blood dope or  whatever -- absolutely not.  I would not be for that.  No, because it's not  worth it.  That's not worth it because you're cheating and it's not  genuine.  Like Wyatt just said he really didn't do the 6.2 seconds, it  wouldn't inauthentic.</p><p>DON IMUS:  Do you think you have, Deirdre, good number sense?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  I do, yes.</p><p>DON IMUS:  Do you think she does, Wyatt?</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  There's no way to tell.</p><p>DON IMUS:  What do you mean?</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  I'll give you an example, she always does the opposite of  what I'll say so she has a way to prove me wrong.</p><p>DON IMUS:  About numbers?</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  About numbers.  We'll be in the grocery store and we'll  be done shopping because I have to help her buy a bunch of hideous things.   And we'll be standing and there will be a line here and line here.  And any  logical person can see one line is shorter and one is longer.  I want to go  to that line, most of the time -- now this isn't all the time, she'll throw  a fit and say, no, you're stupid let's go to the other line.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  Well, I don't say you're stupid.  But you know what I  do, it's not necessarily by the number of people in each line.</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  That's what number sense is, though, being able to...</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS:  No, I look at it more scientifically, what I'll do is  how many pieces of groceries does each person have in that line.  Because  there can be 10 in one line and 15 in another, but the people with 15, the  line is going to move much faster because they only have two items each.   So I kind of calculate that quickly so I get a more comprehensive numbers sense than the average person.</p><p>DON IMUS:  If they only have two items each, why aren't they in the  seven or less?</p><p>WYATT IMUS:  Exactly.  I don't know what she's talking about.  We  never have ten items or less.  We're never in a group of people with less  than 80 items to buy 46 kale chips.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Very adult young man.  We should leave it at that.</p><p>Coming up, we'll have the I-man's interview with the author of the  Blood Sugar Solution, Dr. Mark Hyman.  And also professor Peter Morici will  be coming up to discuss how the health care law will impact this economy.   Help or hurt? You guess.  Don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So many questions surrounding the health care law that was  upheld by the Supreme Court last week, but what does it mean for the future  of this economy?  We're joined by university of Maryland economic professor  Peter Morici.</p><p>Good morning, Peter.  Good to see you.  I point to the top read story  on the Wall Street Journal website and it is get ready for the new  investment tax.  And I'm talking about that 3.8% surtax on investment  income for people making more than $200,000 a year thanks to the health  care law.  What does that do in the short run to the stock market and the  economy?</p><p>PETER MORICI, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND:  Well, in the short run it won't  have much of an effect, but longer term it means people are going to have  to get higher returns on their stock or they're not going to invest in them  and they'll look for other alternatives.  It's going to take money out of  the market and essentially make the value of stocks lower.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't think people realize if the Bush tax cuts are not  extended at the end of the year because everything goes away unless  congress acts, you're going to have a top rate on dividends, the top rate  on capital gains will go up to 23.8 percent and the top rate on dividends  will go to 43.4 percent.  That is crazy.</p><p>MORICI:  You put on top of that state and local taxes, I mean people  in New York City, for example, they're facing taxes of close to 60 percent  in some cases.  That's absurd.  This president simply wants to put the  private sector out of business.</p><p>You know, he wrote in a book about some time spent in the private  sector, it was very brief, in which he said he felt like an enemy behind  private sector lines.  The president simply doesn't understand how markets  work, the importance of incentives for innovation and to get people to  create jobs.  This is a jobs killer.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What does it do for health care costs in your estimation  that is one of the greatest concerns for the economy is the increasing  amount of money that we spend on health care versus everything else.</p><p>MORICI:  There will be the seen and unseen.  The seen is the health  care will go up even higher taking money away from working people to  subsidize health care will drive up the price.  On top of that, it's going  to impose lots of unseen costs, more bureaucrats in Washington and  bureaucrats in your doctor's office to comply with the mountain of  regulations coming down on them.  This is going to be what happened with  Dodd-Frank and the banks.  Small banks can't make loans.  Now you'll call  up a doctor maybe at 3:00 and he'll say sorry, I've got to finish filing  out my paper work today.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Now, I don't know which doctor you're going to, but I  haven't gotten a doctor on the phone whether 10:00 in the morning or 3:00 in the afternoon ever.  Come on, Peter.</p><p>MORICI:  Professors are smart guys.  I know how to get my doctor on  the phone.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  And I'm sure they really love you for that.</p><p>Let's talk about what the states are doing, however, that was a  critical part of the Supreme Court ruling last week. We have Florida, the  governor there now saying Florida will not expand Medicaid and will not  participate in health exchanges on top of Louisiana and Wisconsin.</p><p>Now how does that impact the implementation of the law and its  effectiveness?</p><p>MORICI:  Well, if they don't participate in Medicaid, the expansion of  Medicaid, then it will drive up hospital costs, because they were counting  on getting more folks with Medicaid not coming in without insurance.  And  that's going to cause the hospitals themselves to start to lobby for some  sort of provision on the rates, the taxes they were to pay and so forth.</p><p>Not participating in the exchange, there's still going to be an  exchange in Florida.  The federal government is going to implement it if  the state government doesn't.  And I don't know if I was a governor -- the  law is the law.  I don't know if I was a governor I'd want to leave it to  Washington to implement the exchange in Florida.  I think I'd want to do it  myself.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  All right.  Peter, it was great to see.  Thank you so much.   We'll see you very soon.  Peter Morici down in Washington, D.C. weighing in  on the health care law.</p><p>Coming up at the top of the hour, much more in store for you,  including the I-man's interviews with Dr. Mark Hyman.  And also the author  of My Two Moms.</p><p>And stick around, Stuart Varney is up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  The (inaudible) scandal caused  Barclays Chairman Marcus Agius his job.  But now CEO Bob Diamond in the  sight of politicians who suspect this Diamond has lost his sparkle and it  also threatens to hit other banks around the globe.  </p><p>The heat coming down on bankers worldwide and that's nothing compared  to the scorcher blistering parts of the U.S. and triggering deadly storms.   Millions wake up this morning without electricity and temperatures in some  places topping over 100 degrees.  </p><p>The Chinese economy anything but hot and continuing to cool down; the  latest PMI reading indicates factory production and exports continue to  plunge as investors wonder what happens when the world's global engine  begins to stall.  </p><p>And what is old is new again in Mexico where voters hand power to the  political party that ruled for 70 years but was swept from office more than  a decade ago only to return on this Monday, July 2nd, 2012.  </p><p>Good morning.  I'm Dagen McDowell in this morning.  This BEST OF IMUS  IN THE MORNING is in our second hour.</p><p>And coming up, we have Imus's interviews with Dr. Mark Hyman on his  book \"The Blood Sugar Solution\", a bestseller in fact; and Zach Wahls on  his book \"My Two Moms.\"  </p><p>But first let's look on your markets.  Starting in Asia we had mixed  markets but in South Korea and Japan they were only down just ever so  slightly.  </p><p>And then let's go to Europe as well.  Let's take a look at you're  European markets.  We have gains across the board.  Let's head to Europe we  already talked about the Asian market let's head over to Europe we have  gains across the board north of one percent on the CAC-40 in France and the  DAX in Germany.  The futures there in the U.S. have been trying to hang on  to some gains but essentially flat so far this morning.</p><p>And then over to commodities, oil and gold are both down.  Oil was  down a bit more, earlier in the trading session but still down 1.5 percent,  losing almost $1.40 almost a barrel -- $1.40 a barrel.  </p><p>For more on the European markets let's go live to London where we're  joined by David Jones chief market strategist for IG Markets.  David, I'm  asking everybody the same question so far this morning.  How long does the  euphoria, the excitement last from that deal that was struck at the end of  last week to kind of open up the bailout facility to banks?  </p><p>DAVID JONES, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, IG MARKETS:  Maybe it will last  for a couple more days.  We do of course have the -- the central bank, the  European Central Bank meeting this week, their normal monthly meeting and  the announcement on interest rates.  </p><p>So maybe we'll hear from them similar to what we heard from U.S. feds  that there will be no QE in the short term, no more stimulus for economies.   So, maybe that will be enough to maybe put -- push down some of this  optimism.</p><p>But for now at least as you say it is also positive.  We're mildly  positive here in Europe but still up on the day and feeling the benefits of  that announcement from the early hours of Friday morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How much of this -- this bit of a rally that we're seeing  this Monday is the expectation that the European Central Bank will indeed  cut interest rates maybe do something else later this week?  </p><p>JONES:  I think there's a little bit of that factor there, I think  ahead of all of these central bank meetings in recent months we have that  expectation that maybe we'll have some sort of more stimulus.  We had  unemployment figures out of the Euro zone today and they've nudged up  again.  So I think many people do expect the central bank to act but I  think expecting the Europeans to act this week is maybe a bit too soon.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much David.  It was great to speak with you  this morning.  David Jones.</p><p>JONES:  Ok.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And for a closer look at the Asian markets let's go to Fox  Business contributor, Katie Sargent.  Hey Katie, she's on the phone with us  from Singapore.  </p><p>KATIE SARGENT, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR (via telephone):  Hi Dagen.   Asian markets today they started strong but they stay this is finish and  other things that investors were considering to Purchasing Managers Indexes  from China, the official one that tracks the state-backed firms and the  private ones that focuses on private companies, now both show that  (inaudible) activity shrank in June at the fastest pace in seven months.   And it was hurt by weak export demand from Europe and North America.  </p><p>Also today the Bank of Japan came out with its Tankan survey and that  showed business sentiment improved in the April to June quarter.  However  that follows up Purchasing Managers Index report from Japan on Friday which  showed that manufacturing activity shrank in June.  So, investors are kind  of having to weigh those too.</p><p>So for today we saw -- well, Hong Kong markets were closed but  elsewhere Japan and South Korea gave up their early gains and they finished  little changed.  Shanghai really an up and down day but at the end it  didn't change a whole lot by the end of the day.  And Australia's main  index one of the better performers adding nearly one percent today --  Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much Katie good to hear from you.  Katie  Sargent on the phone with us from Singapore.</p><p>Now for a closer look at the U.S. markets in a preview of how things  could shape up today we're joined by Fox Business's Lauren Simonetti from  the news room.  Good morning, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.  The fires works  were lit early on Wall Street with stellar gains for the major averages,  the DOW rocketing 277 points on Friday.  June great month too with gains of  at least 3.8 percent for the three major averages.  </p><p>This first trading day of July will be a busy one in an equally busy  week.  National manufacturing figures on tap.  Auto sales tomorrow and that  key government jobs support for June is out on Friday.  </p><p>Speaking of jobs, they're moving off of Wall Street.  The trend is  called \"near shoring\", it's where big financial titans hire and relocate  workers to cities like Salt Lake City, Utah, and Jacksonville, Florida  where rent, taxes and labor all cost less.  Silicon Valley is seeing a  similar exodus as the big tech giants find savings in other U.S. cities.</p><p>And have you read it, \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" flying off bookstore  shelves.  E.L. James's erotic novel became the nation's fastest selling  paper back to reach one million sales.  Milton Books stand finds that it  took 11 weeks to reach that market.  That was 25 weeks faster than the  previous record holder, \"The Da Vinci Code\".  Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was looking for a book to buy over the weekend.  I chose  \"Wise Guys\" by Nick Pileggi, not that thing.  Diane Macedo is in our news  room with a look at more business for you this morning.  Hi Diane.</p><p>DIANE MACEDO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi Dagen.</p><p>So Barclays Chairman Marcus Agius has resigned in the wake of the  bank's interest rate rigging scandal.  Agius has been a chairman for more  than five year; says the scandal has dealt a devastating blow to Barclay's  reputation and that the buck stops with him.  </p><p>He will stay in position until a succession plan is in place.  The  bank was fined more than $450 million last week by British and U.S.  regulators for submitting false documents on the London interbank-offered  interest rate.  That's the rate banks lend unsecured funds to each other.  </p><p>And Barclays has admitted that some of its traders attempted to  manipulate that rate.  Agius's resignation is seen as an attempt to take  pressure off CEO Bob Diamond who along with Agius is also facing calls to  resign.  </p><p>Airbus is set to unveil plans for its first U.S. factory later today.   The company's parent European Aeronautic Defensive Space plans to spend  $600 million to build a facility in Mobile, Alabama.  Once it opens in  2015, the plant is expected to create 1,000 jobs and will reportedly  produce four planes a month by 2017.  It will also be on the home turf of  U.S. rival Boeing which has 2,700 employees in Alabama.  </p><p>Micron Technology is purchasing failed Japanese D-Ram manufacturer  Elpida Memory for $750 million.  In all, Micron will pay $2.5 billion to  satisfy reorganization claims by Elpida creditors.

Over to Europe, we have gains, a follow on to that deal  made at the end of last week among European leaders to expand the bailout  facilities for banks, but really, it will be (inaudible), if you take a  look at the reaction there.</p><p>And then, we've got some gains here, it looks like they're in the  making.  We've got some better than expected news out of China on factory  activity.  Even though it has been slowing recently and you have gains  across the board.

The California  legislature will vote today on a measure aimed at preventing foreclosures  from moving forward while a borrower is trying to modify their mortgage.</p><p>In New York, lawmakers are considering a measure that would  criminalize foreclosure paperwork forgery.

On the first Friday of the month, the Labor Department  releases its findings on jobs created or lost the month before.

Romney's campaign says it has raised millions since Thursday's  court decision declaring the bulk of the President's health care law  constitutional.  Republicans say the law is unpopular and the only way to  get rid of it is to elect them to hold the House, take the Senate and the  White House.  Democrats say the court has ruled, the law is passed and the  Congress should move on.</p><p>The congress in a way has moved on, at least to another week off, both  Houses are out this week for the 4th of July.

Over 800 reports of them across  areas through south of the Great Lakes and also into the southeast, so you  can see them ongoing across portions of the Carolinas, Georgia and also the  Florida Panhandle but most of this activity is now very light and just some  cloud cover across the region.  </p><p>Temperatures will be warming up once again.  Take a look at some of  these high temperatures for today.  Minneapolis, you're expecting a high  temperature this afternoon at 99 degrees, 98 over in Denver, a 97 in Kansas  City and Chicago on the hot side as well, expecting to see a high  temperature at 96 degrees. Our heat wave will continue and we're expecting  those hot temperatures to continue in place across the Plains and even as  we head into the end of this work week. </p><p>Otherwise, travel across the city of Boston could be tricky later on  today and the thunderstorms possible.  Hit or miss in nature, so I'm not  expecting widespread travel delays and the spotty showers in the city of  Atlanta and Chicago. </p><p>Dagen? </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Thank you so much, Maria Molina, our  Meteorologist at Fox Business.  </p><p>We're going to take a quick break, but when we come back, a check on  your markets around the world and the I-Man's interview with the author of,  My Two Moms, Zach Wahls. Who gives you a very personal look at what it's  like growing up with two moms.    </p><p>Stick around.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Lymore Scandal cost Barclay's Chairman Marcus Agius his  job but CEO Bob Diamond is a -- who thinks this diamond has lost its  sparkle and threatens to hit other banks worldwide. </p><p>The heat's coming down on bankers around the globe but that's nothing  compared to the scorcher blistering parts of the U.S. and triggering deadly  storms.  Millions wake up this morning without electricity and temperatures  in some places top 100 degrees.</p><p>Welcome back everybody, I'm Dagen McDowell, here with you on the BEST  OF IMUS IN THE MORNING. We've got Zach Wahls interview with the I-Man  coming up about his book, My Two Moms.</p><p>First, let's take a look at your markets. First over to Asia,  potentially flat. Down in Japan and South Korea and up slightly in  Shanghai. Hong Kong is closed but Australia looking at it go, up one  percent.</p><p>Europe is also moving up. There are gains of more than one percent in  France and Germany. Nearly one percent in England.</p><p>Here in the United States the Future's picture has been brightening  just a bit over the last 30 minutes or so, the DOE Futures are up 14 points  and the Nasdaq and S&amp;P Futures are up as well.  </p><p>And then, on to commodities, oil and gold.  Oil is down a buck 26 a  barrel and gold is also falling on almost point eight percent.  </p><p>Over a half a million more acres of corn were planted this year  compared to last, the heat wave is wreaking havoc over the crops.  Fox  Business's Jeff Flock joins us now from the CME with more. </p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FBN REPORTER:  Getting ready for a very important report  today in the grain pits and in the cattle pits you see to the right here on  this Monday morning. I've got Scott Shellady with me, thinking about  trades.  What is the report that comes out today and why is it so important  in the corn, grain, other grain pits? </p><p>SCOTT SHELLADY, CEO, BRADFORD CENTRAL MANAGEMENT:  Because it's a  crop condition report and the conditions are deteriorating rapidly.  If  they deteriorate anything like last week on last Monday's numbers we've got  more gains on the market to go.  And we've got to see what the Government  says, it's not good. </p><p>FLOCK: It was a big week last week for all the grains, particularly  corn, even though I've got to say, we've got a bearish report in terms of  crop acreage and crop stock piles, still the market went up why? </p><p>SHELLADY:  Because the condition report is still on everybody's mind  and they know what's out there and if we don't have any significant  precipitation to rescue the crop by the end of this week, after the  holidays we're in big trouble. </p><p>FLOCK:  You know what a drought is like.  You actually grew up on a  farm in addition to trading these markets, you remember 1988.  That was a  big drought here.  Compare what we've got so far this year to that. </p><p>SHELLADY:  Well, last week we saw the crop conditions decrease by  seven percent. Everybody thought that was huge and you know what?  We had  this time in 1988 we saw crop conditions come off 16, 17 percent, so, we  could have some more of those things down the pipeline.  If we're off more  than ten percent on Monday, this time in 1988 was a tumultuous period. </p><p>FLOCK:  Time to think about putting your money, in maybe things that  you can eat.  At least if it doesn't go up in price, you take it home and  plant it.  </p><p>Jeff Flock at the CME, big day today.  Stay tuned. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jeff, thank you so much for that.  </p><p>Now, let's go to our News Room and Diane Macedo, who has more  business news. </p><p>Hey Diane.</p><p>DIANE MACEDO, FBN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Dagen. </p><p>Barclay's Chairman Marcus Agius has resigned in the wake of that bank  interest rate rigging scandal. Agius, who has been the Chairman more than  five years, says the scandal has dealt a devastating blow to Barclays  reputation and that the buck stops with him.  He'll stay in the position  until a succession plan is in place. You might remember the bank was fined  more than 450 million dollars last week by British and U.S. Regulators for  submitting false documents on the London Inter-Bank offered interest rate,  or libor, which is a rate at which banks lend unsecured funds to each  other.  Barclays has admitted that some of its traders attempted to  manipulate that rate to make it look like the banks borrowing costs were  lower than they actually were in an attempt to make the bank and industry  in general look healthier than it is.  Agius resignation is seen as an  attempt to take the pressure off CEO Bob Diamond who also is facing calls  to resign. </p><p>Facebook Executives have decided to keep the companies stock listed  on the Nasdaq despite problems surrounding it's IPO. That's according to  the Wall Street Journal who said the company had considered moving its  shares off the Nasdaq in the days following the trading debut, but now feel  that would erode confidence in its shares further.  Facebook Executives  have quietly blamed the Nasdaq for the glitches in the IPO, but officials  at the Exchange are working to repair their relationship.  </p><p>Dagen, back to you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Diane.  </p><p>The book is called, My Two Moms, author Zach Wahls.  He takes a look  at same sex marriage and the details of his life, growing up with two  mothers.  He's stopped by recently to talk about it with the I-Man. </p><p>DON IMUS, FBN IMUS:  Zach Wahls along with Bruce Littlefield has  written a book called, My Two Moms, lessons of love, strength and what  makes a family. </p><p>Please welcome to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program Zach Wahls.</p><p>Good morning Mr Wahls. </p><p>ZACH WAHLS, AUTHOR:  Thanks for having me. </p><p>IMUS:  You're quite welcome.  How are you? </p><p>WAHLS:  Doing all right.  It's a little earlier than I'm used to, but  that's all right. </p><p>IMUS:  You'll live through it. We have. </p><p>WAHLS:  Yeah. </p><p>IMUS:  Tell me, one of these women conceived you, is that the deal. </p><p>WAHLS:  That's right, my biological mom, Terry on the left there, in  the red got pregnant with me in 1990 using artificial insemination and gave  birth to me in '91 and she met Jackie on the right, in 1994, they had a  commitment ceremony in '96 and the rest is history. </p><p>IMUS:  So, you were raised in that environment and at one point did--  were you aware that you had, you didn't have a dad, you had two moms? </p><p>WAHLS:  Yeah, there's never a lightbulb moment where it clicked in my  head or whatever. </p><p>IMUS:  Sure. </p><p>WAHLS:  But what happened was that Terry, explaining to me from when I  was a little guy, before I could understand how I was conceived that I had,  you know, some kids have two moms, two dads, a mom and dad and there was  never a moment looking back on my life where I didn't know who I was and  who my family was. There was never secretly a moment of realization so for  all intents and purposes just like anybody else. </p><p>IMUS:  Okay.  Just so we can put this conversation in context here and  you know where I'm coming from, I support gay marriage.  Because I think  people love one another and each other and it doesn't make any difference  in my view.  </p><p>Now, I know a lot of people don't support it, but I don't know why --  I don't understand that.  It's never made, never resonated with me.  </p><p>I do think that the traditional American family is a father and a  mother.  Having said that it doesn't make-- it doesn't make your family any  less valid than anybody else's in my view. </p><p>WAHLS:  I appreciate that, Don and look at a state like Iowa where I  grew up.  There are a certain amount of people of a different view.  </p><p>IMUS:  Why do you think they're of a different view? </p><p>WAHLS:  I think most of the opposition is certainly rooted in belief,  likely that homosexuality is immoral, and probably religious belief picked  up at an early point in their life and they can't necessarily wrap their  eyes, their mind around the idea that two gay people could ever be in love  with each other or successfully be parents and obviously, once you know my  parents and set us down and have dinner with our family and get to know us  on a personal level, I think it's that misconception falls apart quickly,  but for people who haven't had that experience of sitting down and getting  to know us, it's easy to stick with these misconceptions. </p><p>IMUS:  Do you think it's because it's a threat to them? </p><p>WAHLS:  Yeah, I think they feel threatened. </p><p>IMUS:  Why? </p><p>WAHLS:  It's a good question, I'm not necessarily sure, it seems like  a person getting mad at me for eating a donut because he's on a diet and it  doesn't necessarily seem the kind of thing that's rational and there were  people in Iowa certainly who predicted the apocalypse after this ruling in  2009, but turns out, hell hasn't opened up and swallowed Davenport into the  abyss and in fact, divorce rates are falling in Iowa since 2009.  </p><p>So, anybody who kind of claimed the doomsday scenario after the  ruling in 2009 is proving incorrect. </p><p>IMUS:  There are those who think that children raised by gay parents  then become gay themselves. </p><p>WAHLS:  Yeah, no, that's definitely something that's another myth and  another stereo type, but what those people fail to account for is the fact  that straight parents have been the leading cause of gay people in this  country forever. </p><p>So, no, it's true.  You know, and so, in seconds, the only reason that  that would ever be thrown out there in the first place is under this  misconception that homosexuality is somehow immoral. If you actually know a  gay person, odds are awfully good they were raised by straight parents and  you know, along my journey I've met some kids who are gay and have been  raised by gay parents and if you think it's hard coming out as a gay person  with straight parents, try doing it with gay parents and that's harder and  that stereo type hurts a lot of people and not just the parents either. </p><p>IMUS:  Why would that be? Probably an obvious answer. </p><p>WAHLS:  Then all of a sudden, oh, god you proved the opposition right  or what have you.  So the idea that somehow gay parents are the only ones  raising gay kids is simply not true and then further, it kind of seems like  nonsensical in my mind.  </p><p>IMUS:  Talking with Zach Wahls, who along with Bruce Littlefield. </p><p>Who is he and where did you meet him?</p><p>WAHLS:  My agent found him.  You know, so the way it happened was  that, after the video kind of the start of this whole thing. </p><p>IMUS:  The You Tube video. </p><p>WAHLS:  Exactly.  I was contacted by a couple of literary agents and  wound up signing with one in Manhattan and she found Bruce and got the book  sold. </p><p>IMUS:  \"My Two Moms\" it's called.  Lessons of love and strength and  what makes a family.  </p><p>Why did you want to do the book? </p><p>WAHLS:  There were two immediate motifs that came about.  First, I  wanted to speak out to other kids who had LGBD parents and living in a time  that's tumultuous, and when I started to write the book the GOP Primary was  coming up and there was kind of mudslinging going around on this issue in  particular and I wanted to speak to other kids and just reiterate, to be  reminded all the time, despite what you might hear on TV and some of those  talking heads out there.  You are all right and even though we've heard it  a lot in the last year and a half, it does get better. </p><p>Second, I thought this was a pretty incredible opportunity to speak  to a lot of people who might be on the fence about the issue. People who  are like, well, it's a free country and you know, I'm not going to try and  infringe on somebody's liberty or freedom, but what are the effects on the  kids?  I think the single most effective line that the other side uses on  the issue is, do we really want to live in a country where I'm thought of  as a bigot because I believe all kids have a right to a mother and father?   It's a pretty convincing line when you hear it, but when you sit down and  walk through it, it's not that simple. </p><p>IMUS:  The rational, I would encourage people to use, I was  complaining to a doctor of mine about, I have some, I won't get into a lot  of boring stuff.  You know what old people do, what they do, first thing  they do, probably had this experience, they tell you what's the matter with  them.  So I'm not going to go that far. </p><p>WAHLS:  Yeah. </p><p>IMUS:  But I was complaining about breathing and the doctor, one of  the foremost Pulmonary Specialists in the world and he said it's like golf  and I said, I don't play golf.  He says you have to play the ball where it  lies.  So, wherever the ball, you can't move it. But you can, but you're-- </p><p>WAHLS:  Right. </p><p>IMUS:  So, this is the reality.  It's a reality. </p><p>WAHLS:  Sure. </p><p>IMUS:  Of our-- so I remember explaining to Wyatt, our son, one of the  things we did say is how inhuman it is to discriminate against anybody. </p><p>WAHLS:  That's right. </p><p>IMUS:  For any reason and so, that resonated with him more than  anything else. Rather than to try to rationalize whether or not anybody  thought it was be aberrant behavior or not, which in my view is irrelevant.   And then you've mentioned earlier and I think like a 14-year-old anyway  about like, I've always said and it's not funny, but I've just always said,  you know, I have no problem with women kissing, I just don't want to see  men kissing that's an idiot and half joking, but the point being that  that's really what it comes down to. </p><p>WAHLS:  Yeah, I think a lot of people are uncomfortable with the idea  of seeing two people the same sex being intimate with each other and other  people for whom the opposite might be true. And I explain, look, homophobia  isn't something that's wrong, and we can't control how that goes. The  problem with homophobia, the only thing to fear is fear itself and  certainly true in this case.  I think a lot of people whom I think might  think I am a monster for being homophobic or not necessarily thinking about  two men kissing or whatever and that's not the case as long as when you get  into the voting booth you're not letting that fear dominate your voting  practice. </p><p>IMUS:  Tedious analogy that I employ is three or four years ago on  this program, we decided to book some African-Americans to try to have a  conversation about racial relations and race itself for a number of  reasons.  And one of the things I found is in talking to various African- Americans, blacks, was that there wasn't all that much to talk about and  suddenly, you were talking about issues and other things that affected you  both as inhabitants of the planet and so once you got past the fear of  somebody being different than you were and you discovered that in fact they  weren't, it's got to be the same. </p><p>WAHLS:  Yeah, definitely, definitely. </p><p>IMUS:  Well, you seem pretty squared away to me. </p><p>WAHLS:  Thank you very much. </p><p>IMUS:  That should put to rest the bigots out there that think oh, my  god what's going to happen. </p><p>WAHLS:  Yes. </p><p>IMUS:  Well, good luck with all of this and this sounds like a movie.   Anybody talk to you about that. </p><p>WAHLS:  Not yet, but I have to agree, a pretty incredible story. </p><p>IMUS:  You're going to College or been to College? </p><p>WAHLS:  I was going to university of Iowa as a full-time Engineering  student when this whole thing happened and since took a brief academic  absence and going back to school in 2013. </p><p>IMUS:  You're a good looking kid and get you out in Hollywood. </p><p>WAHLS:  We'll see. </p><p>IMUS:  Good luck.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, a check on your markets around the world and Mr  Stuart Varney joins me right here in the studio to talk about the state of  the economy.</p><p>Do not go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back, everybody. </p><p>He might not do his Anna Wintour imitation, but he has something to  say and say it eloquently, eloquently about the economy.  Stuart Varney is  joining me, host of VARNEY &amp; COMPANY which starts at nine fifteen, nine  twenty. </p><p>STUART VARNEY, HOST OF VARNEY &amp; COMPANY:  Close enough.  </p><p>That was the nicest introduction, Dagen and I thank you very much  indeed. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I didn't even imitate you in the tease, I thought you know  what, I'm rested and back from vacation.</p><p>You say this week, all the attention, economically, politically turns  back to what's going on in the job market and what can the White House do  to fight what is not significant job growth. </p><p>VARNEY:  Friday morning, 8:30 eastern time here comes the next Jobs  Report.  There are only four Jobs Report from now until the election.  And  this is one of them.  And this may be the most important.  </p><p>I think the unemployment rate goes up, which is a disastrous headline  for the President.  And I'm the not sure of this, but in my opinion, it's  going up.  And the number of new jobs created will be minuscule.  I base  that on all the indicators that we've received about the general state of  the economy in the last two months. </p><p>Would you know that we've actually spent less money in each of the  last two months, consumer spending down.  In America, that's big news.   This is a consumer oriented society. This is a spending society. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  In fact-- </p><p>VARNEY:  But it could-- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Big article in the Wall Street Journal about, don't expect  the consumer to rescue the economy at this point. </p><p>VARNEY:  That's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is that because, I mean, are we in a place where it  becomes self-fulfilling and people become more concerned and pull back  spending and make the economy worse? </p><p>VARNEY:  You're precisely right.  It's a vicious circle and it goes  round and round and round. No jobs equals lack on confidence and that  equals a declining standard of living and that equals less spending and  less jobs. You go round and round and round. We've not broken that circle  at this point. We could.  </p><p>I think if the President made a deliberate and concerted effort to  liberate the two trillion dollars, which private enterprise has, in cash,  on the sidelines, if you could get that to come into the economy. Give  private enterprise a sense of confidence, I think that would be a huge  stimulus and I think it would work. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is there anything the President can do between now and the  election that turns things around?  Because, again, you were saying that  we're shifting from health care to the economy, but from the Republican  side, the health care decision is the economy, because that's a tax on many  Americans. </p><p>VARNEY:  If the President were to say, Obamacare was a mistake, forget  it. If he were to say, Dodd Frank Financial Regulation was a mistake,  please forget it.  If he were to say I don't want any more Government  stimulus, I want tax cuts for individuals and private enterprise, I want  tax reform.  If he were to say things, yeah, I think things would turn  around, but you know as well as I do, he's never going to say anything like  that at all.  This President never changes direction. </p><p>MCDOWELL: I point to the top when I woke up this morning, the top read  story in the Wall Street Journal on wsj.com, was the get ready for the new  investment tax and three point eight percent, additional tax on investment  income for people making more than $200,000 a year, so, I think that if  people are focused on not only tax cuts expiring, Washington's not doing  anything about that and then what other taxes are you lumping on me, and  they're very fixated on health care as a tax from here on out and the  President has an even higher hurdle. </p><p>VARNEY:  He's in a really tough spot of his own making.  Look at the  new taxes coming down the pike, because of Obamacare, and because the  Supreme Court says, okay, go ahead with Obamacare, and what is it, biotech  companies, taxed, medical device makers, taxed.  Health insurance, taxed, a  new investment, taxed.  All of these taxes are going up. We will pay for  them.  It will squeeze people, squeeze employers to drop health care  coverage and put people on to public health care. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm paying a ten percent excise tax on tanning, ten  percent, that's a huge tax Stuart. </p><p>VARNEY:  You didn't get that tan in a salon. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, beach.</p><p>VARNEY:  I could tell, there's a difference. </p><p>MCDOWELL: That's why I love you more every day.</p><p>Stuart Varney, thank you so much.</p><p>VARNEY:  That's all right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was great to see you.  </p><p>VARNEY &amp; COMPANY starts at 9:15 a.m. eastern time, don't miss it.  </p><p>In the meantime, we'll be right back.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  The libor scandal cost Barclay's  Chairman Marcus Agius his job, but now CEO Bob Dimon in the fight of  politicians who might think this Dimon has lost its sparkle.    These all  threatens to hit other banks around the globe.  </p><p>The heat coming down on bankers worldwide is nothing compared to the  scorcher blistering parts of the U.S. triggering deadly storms.  </p><p>Hundreds of thousands waking up this morning without electricity,  with temperatures in some places topping 100 degrees.  </p><p>The Chinese economy anything, but hot and continuing to cool down.   The latest PMI reading indicates factory production and exports continue to  plunge as investors wonder what happens when the world's global engine  begins to stall.    </p><p>And what's old is new again in Mexico where voters hand power to the  political party that ruled the country for 70 years, who were swept out of  office more than a decade ago, only to return on this Monday, July the 2nd,     2012.    </p><p>Good morning, everybody, this is the BEST OF IMUS IN THE MORNING and  coming up, you have Imus' interviews with Jay Mohr, always hilarious and  Chris and Lorraine Wallace on \"Mr. Sunday Saturday Night's Chicken.\"  You  don't want to miss either one of those.    </p><p>But right now, let's take a look at your markets around the globe.   Over to Asia, first.  You look at the -- really unchanged except  essentially flat markets except for Australia gaining almost one percent.  </p><p>Over to Europe, we've had gains all morning long, all day long, so  far in 11:30, when your European markets close, but north of one percent  gains in France and in Germany.  </p><p>Here in the U.S., the futures have been hanging on to gains as well.   And up ten points on the Dow futures, but massive gains last Friday, last  week, although, it was a pretty rough quarter for the U.S. markets.  And  the commodities, oil and gold both down.  We like to see oil fall down a  buck 32 a barrel right now.   </p><p>For more on Europe, let's go live to London where we're joined by  James Hughes, chief market analyst for Alpari.  James, what is the biggest  factor driving the markets higher in Europe today? </p><p>JAMES HUGHES, ALPARI SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST:  Well, I think you  haven't necessarily got any positive news around these markets.  I think  it's almost just a rebound from some of the negativity that we've been  seeing recently.  And of course, we are looking just of the start of the  week from after what we saw last week.  It was pretty negative.  </p><p>So, I think, initially, you have got the story in the U.K. which is  Barclays bank, and you've got their shares jumping this morning up around  three-and-a-half percent or so just on the mere fact that they have been --  they were down heavily of course last week on the back of the scandal that  come out Mr. Agius, Marcus Agius, the chairman of Barclays' lost his job  today.   </p><p>So, there are those new stories which are helping to push Barclays  higher, which is helping to push the financials higher which is why we're  getting some of those European, and the U.K. markets higher.  And the rest  of the stories around Europe are a little bit more sketchy, a little bit  more.  Of course, you had those Eurozone unemployment numbers out today,  11.1 percent, all time high unemployment for the Eurozone, not necessarily  good news but all those markets in Europe, they are managing to post a few  gains just on the back of some negativity that we've had over the last  couple of weeks.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  How critical is that -- what the ECB information does later  in the week with expected rate cut on the horizon? </p><p>HUGHES:  Well, I think, I mean, it's a big, it's a big story for the  week and of course, everyone is looking towards that.  I mean, whether it's  going to make much difference, you go back to the same stories, which we  have been talking about for the last two years or so with this Eurozone and  we talk about bailouts, whether they've been helping and of course, we've  seen a series of bailouts and everyone tells us that's the new dawn in  Europe and that's going to solve the problems and of course, nothing has  solved any problems as of yet.   </p><p>So, I think it's almost the same sort of thing for the right -- if we  do see it.  And then of course, we make the markets a little bit of a shot  in the arm.  Again, it's another step being taken to try and solve this  issue.  But, the biggest issue is that we just don't know how to solve the  issue and I think that's going to go on for a long time.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Years, that's what my gut says, James, thank you so much.   James Hughes, chief market analyst for Alpari, be well.   </p><p>Now, for a closer look at the U.S. market.  A preview of how things  might shape up today.  We go to our very own Lauren Simonetti live from our  Newsroom.  Good morning, Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Good morning.  The fireworks  were lit early on Wall Street with stellar gains for the major averages.   The Dow rocketing 277 points on Friday.  June, great months too with gains  of at least 3.8 percent for the three major averages.   </p><p>This first trading day of July will be a busy one and an equally busy  week.  National manufacturing figures on tap, auto sales tomorrow and that  key government jobs report for June is out on Friday.  </p><p>Speaking of jobs, they're moving off of Wall Street.  The trend is  called near shoring, it's where the big financials tightens hire and  relocates workers to cities like Salt Lake City, Utah and Jacksonville,  Florida, where rent, taxes and labor all cost less.   </p><p>Silicon Valley is seeing a similar exodus as the big tech giant and  fine savings in other U.S. cities.  </p><p>And how do you read it?  \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" flying off bookstore  shelves.  EL James erotic novel became the nation's fastest selling  paperback to reach one million sales.  Nelson book scan (ph) finds that it  took 11 weeks to reach that mark.  That was 25 weeks faster than the  previous record holder, \"The Da Vinci Code.\"  Back to you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Lauren.  Now we go to Diane Macedo in our  Newsroom who is live.  Hey, Diane.</p><p>MACEDO:  Hey, Dagen.  So, we keep talking about Barclays here, but  the Chairman Marcus Agius has resigned in the wake of that interest rate  rigging scandal.  Agius has been the chairman of more than five years says,  the scandal has dealt a devastating blow to Barclays reputation and that  the buck stops with him.  He will stay on though until a succession plan is  in place.  The bank was fined more than $450 million last week by British  and U.S. regulators for submitting false documents on the London Interbank  offered interest rate, which is the rate at which banks lend unsecured  funds to each other.   </p><p>Now, Barclays has admitted that some of its traders attempted to  manipulate that rate to make it look like the bank's borrowing costs were  lower than they actually were and that would make the bank and the industry  in general look healthier than it actually is.  Agius resignation is seen  as an attempt to take the pressure of CEO Bob Dimon who is also facing  calls to resign.   </p><p>Micron technology is purchasing DRAM manufacturer.  Elpida Memory for  $750 million.  In all Micron will pay $2.5 billion to satisfy  reorganization claims by Elpida's creditors and shares of micron are higher  in the pre-market.  </p><p>And Germany's Linde is buying U.S. based home oxygen provider Lincare  Holdings for $4.6 billion.  The deal breaks down to 41.50 a share, a 22  percent premium on Lincare's closing price on Friday.  Linde's main  customers are in the steal and chemical sectors but it also provides gases  used to process filter cells and make LCD TV's.  Dagen, back to you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Diane.  There is no shortage of laughs  when this dude visits with the I-man.  I'm talking about actor and comedian  Jay Mohr and he is here on IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DON IMUS, HOST, \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\":  Please welcome now Jay Mohr.   Good morning Mr.  Mohr.  </p><p>JAY MOHR, ACTOR AND COMEDIAN:  Hello, Mr. Imus.  </p><p>IMUS:  So, you remember back when you were single.  </p><p>MOHR:  Yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  And you'd get drunk.  There was always somebody you could call  who would let you come over.  </p><p>MOHR:  Yes.  Who was it for you? </p><p>IMUS:  It doesn't make any difference but that's what I feel like  with you.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MOHR:  I'm the guy -- I'm your late-night booty call.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes, because? </p><p>MOHR:  You know what?  Bartlett is not wearing socks today.  Call Jay  Mohr.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS:  You want something.  Here you are.  Well, we're delighted to  have you back.  </p><p>MOHR:  Thanks for having me back.  I love -- I don't really ever get  to talk politics until I'm here.  And now, Donald -- Connell? </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's right.  </p><p>MOHR:  Connell McShane, sounds like the villain in a Spider Man comic  strip.  Is that your real name? Like -- for my own is Connell McShane? </p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, I used it.  </p><p>MOHR:  Are you the lead singer of the Pogs (ph).  His name is Connell  McShane.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Look at this guy.  He's gorgeous.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Thank you.  </p><p>MOHR:  Where's Dagen?  She's good for courtesy laughs.  She's in the  bathroom fixing her bangs.  And who's the new girl?  Diane? </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p>MOHR:  She's like a pseudo (ph) minority hire because she's a  Portuguese.  </p><p>IMUS:  She can sing, you know.  </p><p>MOHR:  She could sing.  Hi, Diane.  There she is.  </p><p>MACEDO:  Hi, Jay.  </p><p>MOHR:  All right.  On her paper work she filled out Puerto Rican.  </p><p>IMUS:  We had a battle of the bands last summer on this program.  And  her band won.  </p><p>MOHR:  What was the name of your band, Diane? </p><p>MACEDO:  It still is.  Tribeca Rhythm.  </p><p>MOHR:  Tribeca Rhythm.  I don't know, I had nothing.  I don't know.  </p><p>MACEDO:  Wow!  I was expecting some sort of a -- there but.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>IMUS:  She won singing \"Rolling in the Deep,\" Adele's song.  She did  a pretty decent job.  </p><p>MOHR:  Adele just canceled her whole concert.  </p><p>IMUS:  What's the matter with her? </p><p>MOHR:  I mean, her whole tour.  I think she has panic attacks.  </p><p>IMUS:  Really? </p><p>MOHR:  Yes, really.  Speaking from a former panic attack.  </p><p>IMUS:  So, why are you here?  You must be promoting something.  </p><p>MOHR:  I'm not sure.  </p><p>IMUS:  You're not? </p><p>MOHR:  No.  They just said when you're in New York, you want to do  Don Imus.  I said, don't ever ask me that.  Just assume and let's make it  happen.  </p><p>IMUS:  Sure.</p><p>MOHR:  I have a podcast.  </p><p>IMUS:  Do you? </p><p>MOHR:  Yes, it's on I-tunes.  More stories.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS:  Don't you have a new TV show? </p><p>MOHR:  No.  </p><p>IMUS:  You don't? </p><p>MOHR:  No, I'm here strictly for the exposure.  I want my face  between those -- that crawl of little league crawls and stock reports.  </p><p>IMUS:  The last time you were here you had that gay unmarried thing,  right? </p><p>MOHR:  Yes, that got canceled.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, you did.  </p><p>MOHR:  Yes.  That show's in remission.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, it is.  So, I said ESPN can't fire Hank Williams, Jr.  You  said, of course you can.  </p><p>MOHR:  They can do whatever they want.  They're Disney owned.  </p><p>IMUS:  But doesn't that offend you? </p><p>MOHR:  It offends me any time someone is held up to the light for  saying something.  You have to be able to say it.  You have to have the  right to say it.  But then you also have to realize when you say it, and  you are the guy that really got your feet to the fire first for something  that I thought was ridiculous.  But they also have the right to tell you to  get lost.  Look, let's not -- let's call a spade a spade.  Hank Williams,  Jr. is such a mess that he's wearing those dark sunglasses and that  steeple-done beard.  </p><p>He looked like he was in the witness protection program in that whole  interview.  And you know, I mean, that was his big joke.  It was like  Hitler and Netanyahu playing golf together.  He probably had like a group  of people helping him pronounce Netanyahu.  Do we really need to hear that?   Are you ready for some football?  Like, thank God that's dead.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>IMUS:  This hurts me.  Hank is my friend, you can't do this.  </p><p>MOHR:  Hank's your friend? </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p>MOHR:  His father thinks he sucks.  Hank Williams, Sr., every  Halloween comes out of his grave and goes \"Stop Singing.\" </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Hank Williams, Sr., he's like the Black Eyed Peas of the Williams  family.  </p><p>IMUS:  No, this is -- </p><p>MOHR:  You're going to look me in the eye and say that Hank Williams,  Jr. isn't horrible? </p><p>IMUS:  Well, you know, my wife says the same thing.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MOHR:  Your wife and I are trying to talk sense to you.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes, but -- no, he makes some good records.  Hank's made some  good records.  </p><p>MOHR:  Name one.  </p><p>IMUS:  \"All My Rowdy Friends\" are -- that's good.  \"Family  Tradition.\"  That is a great record.  </p><p>MOHR:  -- Goose stepping to ESPN right now.  </p><p>IMUS:  No.  Well, Hank fell off a cliff, you know.  </p><p>MOHR:  He looks it.  </p><p>IMUS:  No, but I mean, but the reason -- </p><p>MOHR:  He looks like Evel Knievel after Snake River canyon.  Holy  smoke.  His beard's on crooked.  He's got a chin strap for his hat.  This  guy doesn't know what to do.  He doesn't know whether he should  pee are go blind.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS:  This is not working out the way I wanted for my friend Hank.  </p><p>MOHR:  Well, I think he's terrible.  I'm not going to lie to the I-  man.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, I mean.  </p><p>MOHR:  What do you want me to tell you?  I went to the gym earlier  today.  </p><p>IMUS:  You look good, by the way.  </p><p>MOHR:  Way too many naked guys at the gym.  And I'm a pervert.  I  look at every guy's package.  I want to see what's happening out there in  America.  </p><p>IMUS:  You do? </p><p>MOHR:  I do.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p>MOHR:  And I like, here's what you do.  If you want guys go into the  Jacuzzi at the gym naked which I find disgusting.  If you want the Jacuzzi  to yourself, just go in and sit facing the Jets.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And just sit there holding the concrete.  And by the way, ladies --  because you do have a lot of ladies that watch this show mostly because  they all want to have sex with Warner Wolf.  Well, I said that like Bob  Newhart.  They wanted to have sex with Warner Wolf.  </p><p>WOLF:  Hey, come on, Jay.  </p><p>MOHR:  Let's go to the videotape! </p><p>IMUS:  Are you a Jets fan? </p><p>MOHR:  I love the Jets.  </p><p>IMUS:  Really? </p><p>MOHR:  I love them.  </p><p>IMUS:  And you like Ryan? </p><p>MOHR:  I'm going to send Rex Ryan photos of my wife's feet because my  wife has perfect feet.  </p><p>IMUS:  No, but I mean.  </p><p>MOHR:  Oscar Wilde writes about my wife's feet.  </p><p>IMUS:  How long have you been a Jets fan? </p><p>MOHR:  I've been a Jets fan since -- this one for Warner Wolf.   Klecko Abdulsalam, Marty Lions and Mark Gastineau, the Sack Exchange, 1982.   I was an 11-year-old boy, sexually ambiguous and I fell in love with them.   And Bruce Harper, number 42.  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes, little Bruce.   </p><p>IMUS:  When you were 11, you were.</p><p>MOHR:  Little Bruce, careful there.</p><p>IMUS: .sexually ambiguous at 11? </p><p>MOHR:  Oh, yes.  Always.  </p><p>IMUS:  Really? </p><p>MOHR:  I'm in the gym facing the Jets for crying out loud.  I was  supposed to get a massage later today and I get more angst about going to  get a massage because they say to you, lay down, the lady will say, lay  down, face down, and I'll be right back.  So, you lay down face down naked  with your ass in the air.  And like two minutes later, someone comes back  into the room and you just assume it's the lady that left.  For all you  know it's like the fetish janitor in a batman mask and he wants to massage  the backs of your knees.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS:  How old is your son now? </p><p>MOHR:  I got a nine-year-old and we have six-month-old now who just  decided to start kicking our ass on the road.  </p><p>IMUS:  Is it a boy? </p><p>MOHR:  It's a boy.  It's a masculine child.  Babies cry when they  have to poop.  Can you imagine having to go to the bathroom so bad that you  weep?  That's a lot of Vicodin and Imodium and cheese.  You sit on the  toilet weeping.  People come in from other parts of the house in their bath  robes.  What's going on? </p><p>IMUS:  I guess you have to take a Vicodin to get that one right.  </p><p>MOHR:  Yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  The nine-year-old, is he starting to ask questions yet? </p><p>MOHR:  You know, he doesn't.  And it started to bother me.  I thought  like he should be a little more curious because I don't want his friends.   He said to me, did you know if you type in \"sex\" on the computer, all crazy  stuff pops up.  And I said, you should type in tranny, and see, that's  really weird stuff pop.  But I didn't tell him that.  But I told him -- I  said, all right, I'm going to tell him everything how it goes.  </p><p>And I told him, you know, the penis and the thing and this and that  and this happens and this comes out.  And it's fertilized.  I told him what  the vagina and the hole, every technical term exact.  And we were driving  to Starbucks in Santa Monica, and we get to the counter and I literally  finish the explanation, and the woman gets pregnant and a baby -- she has a  baby through her vaginal canal, the birth canal, and that's how it goes.  </p><p>And the lady behind the counter, just like a regular-looking gal  says, may I help you?  And my nine-year-old goes, like Jackie Gleason  suddenly is looking at a woman completely differently.  I got literally  just finished the whole explanation and all the things and all the parts  and then a woman saying, how can I help you to my nine-year-old? </p><p>IMUS:  My kid is 13.  When he was nine like your son, he comes in and  he says, dad, I think I discovered masturbation.  </p><p>MOHR:  At nine? </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  </p><p>MOHR:  That's young.  He's a trailblazer.  </p><p>IMUS:  First of all, I said, I don't think you discovered it.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's one way to end an interview.  We'll have more when  we come back including more news headlines, business news for you.  The  latest on those violent storms that struck the northeast.</p><p>Plus, FOX Business' Maria Molina will have your business travelers  forecast, as this BEST OF IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right here on FOX  Business.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's take a look at the markets around the world.  Very  muted movements over in Asia except for Australia which was up almost one  percent.  We've had gains of more than one percent in France and Germany if  you want to head over to Europe.  </p><p>Again, the excitement from the deal that was done last week, among  European leaders to help out Spain and Italy and who knows where the  country falls in coming weeks and months.  The futures here in the U.S.  have actually turned negative, but again, it's going to be a strange week,  if you will.  The markets closed early tomorrow, they're closed completely  Wednesday and then we have that major jobs report on Friday.</p><p>But again, the Dow futures have turned lower down six points.  And  speaking of lower, oil and gold are significantly lower with oil off a buck  30 a barrel, but, we kind of like that.  I have the pleasure of being  joined by my neighbor.  </p><p>But also, one of the co-hosts of the \"THE FIVE,\" Dana Perino, and  it's great of you to be here this morning.  </p><p>DANA PERINO, CO-HOST, \"THE FIVE\":  I'm glad to be here.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's start with health care because I.</p><p>PERINO:  Well, I thought you were going to start with the dogs which  is the most important, I'm kidding.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We can get at the dogs at the end.  </p><p>PERINO:  Health care.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We save the best for last.  And so, let's get the rough  stuff out of the way first.  </p><p>PERINO:  That's how you do it on FOX Business.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But with the health care, I was, maybe I'm foolish to be  shocked, but shocked that the White House is still trying to spin this by  saying that based on the health care ruling last week from the Supreme  Court last that the penalty was not a tax and that the Supreme Court  actually didn't come out and say that, but I don't know how you can  continue to do that for the next.</p><p>PERINO:  It's very disingenuous and it's very insulting to go people  across America who've been paying attention to this debate and there's a  lot of them.  If your new best friend in Washington is going to be Chief  Justice Roberts, if you're on the Left, you might-- it would be honorable  to quote him accurately.  What he said is you are not allowed to do it  under the commerce clause, but you are allowed to do it under the tax  provision, therefore this can stand, it is a tax.  And to try to say  anything else is foolish.  </p><p>I can understand why the White House doesn't want to, they don't want  to be labeled in trying to defend the largest tax increase in American  history on top of the other ones that could be coming at the end of the  year, but it is what it is.  And trying to say otherwise, I think, makes  them look foolish and it actually hurts the process going forward.  If they  do really want to try to reconcile and get people all on the same page,  lying about it is not the way to do it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, speaking to reconcile, the talk about the  Republicans and what their approach is going to be to fighting against this  health care law because there's an article in the Wall Street Journal today  about, that on the Senate side, you can deal with some of the budget issues  in this health care law through reconciliation.  </p><p>PERINO:  So, the overall republican position is Obama-care should be  repealed, that is what they will be running on going forward.  In the  meantime, there are different tactics that you can use legislatively, one  of them is reconciliation, it is tough to implement, but it's conceivable  that it could be done.  That basically, you will get together, you only  need 51 votes to strike it down.  I think that with the current makeup of  the Senate, to get to that point after the Supreme Court has ruled would be  very difficult.  </p><p>However, there might be enough constituent anger calling to members  of Congress and to their senators that says, this was passed as an  individual mandate.  President Obama himself chastised George  Stephanopoulos of ABC News to say this was absolutely not a tax.  The  justice -- Chief Justice Roberts has just said, it is a tax.  Therefore,  were you deceived Mr. Congressman, when you voted for this, you didn't know  it was a tax?  </p><p>Should this be re-voted?  I don't know if that will -- it's  interesting to see, I think the next two weeks will tell us how much that  will stand, I will say that Mitt Romney over the past, in the first four  hours after the ruling, raised over a million dollars from small donations  of people saying, we want this bill thrown out.  The only way to do it is  to elect a republican president.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, the tax ruling from the Supreme Court, it does fold  directly into the Romney campaign strategy of making this election about  the economy.  And again, like first top read story on the Wall Street  Journal this morning is that there's a new investment tax coming because of  the health care law on Americans making more than $200,000 a year under  capital gains and on your dividends, and that does seem to fold.  And if  you take apart the health care law, and look at all the additional taxes  that are coming, the potential drain on the economy does seem to fold into  that strategy.  So it doesn't necessarily become about health care versus  the economy, that's on the Romney side.  That it's all one, one story.  </p><p>PERINO:  Yes.  It's all baked in the cake, you can't separate it out.   I think that is a good strategy actually.  I was getting very excited about  some of the things that the private market could start doing if the law was  rejected, fully, not just under the commerce clause, but taken out  completely.  The things that somewhat, that we could do, is that health  insurance was allowed to be sold across state lines.  </p><p>If were you were in more control of your health care, so you didn't  worry about if you lost your job, if you could take it with you.  And the  things that you might be able to purchase with that, like, if I wanted to  go a chiropractor rather than go to a regular doctor, I would be in charge  of the money and I would choose if I wanted to spend that money.  And I  just feel kind of deflated that what, and what Romney should do, I think,  is to say because of this health care bill, we are now going to keep this  lead blanket on innovation and on the economy and it's not that people who  needed care wouldn't have gotten care.  </p><p>It's just that America can and should do a lot better when it comes  to the private market and unfortunately, it just now, I think it's going to  be chaos for the next six months.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Before you go, I want to show everybody, if you're not  watching \"THE FIVE,\" well, you're crazy.  But a photo of Dana's new puppy,  Jasper, if you watch \"THE FIVE,\" you've seen this, Dana is -- we're  actually neighbors and I see the dog more often, I see Jasper more often  than I see you.  You and your lovely husband and -- </p><p>PERINO:  Well, and one of our neighbors also is Katharine McPhee, star  of \"Smash\" and she came back from Los Angeles last night and Peter was  downstairs with Jasper walking and they got to meet and he gave her lost of  kisses and tore her earring off her ear but she found him and she's in love  with him too.  So, we've got a good neighborhood.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's a Vizslas.  </p><p>PERINO:  What about yours?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I'll show you photos of our.  You've never met.   That's Mabel on the left and we think she's part Rat Terrier because she'd  like to -- she killed a squirrel yesterday actually.  And then Ramon, who  is a Puerto Rican street dog.  </p><p>PERINO:  They've got to meet.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They've got to meet.  My dogs don't have the new puppy  smell, but they do smell good because they got washed yesterday.  </p><p>PERINO:  That's good.  We love our dogs.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, we do.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  Jasper consoled me after the Supreme Court decision.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, what?  That's where you go.  </p><p>PERINO:  And actually, I'm not lying.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I know you're not lying.  Dana, it was great to see  you.  </p><p>PERINO:  Nice to see you too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.  Dana Perino, co-host of \"THE FIVE.\"   Don't miss it.</p><p>Now, some of the news stories that are making headlines this morning.

You can see them popping up across parts of the state of  Alabama and also Georgia.</p><p>But again, much quieter for today until we head into the afternoon  hours and also the evening hours, when those stronger storms are up once  again.</p><p>High temperatures, it's going to be another hot day, not as bad as  what we saw this weekend like on Atlanta where on Saturday you hit a high  temperature at 106 degrees, breaking your all-time record for the hottest  temperature.</p><p>You've seen today is still warm though, 96 for your high  temperature, 96 of as well in Chicago and Minneapolis well above average  for this time of year at 99 degrees, factor in the humidity and of course,  it's going to feel even a little bit hotter.</p><p>New England, you're a lot cooler today, Boston expecting a high  temperature at 79 with some clouds and a spotty shower with a thunderstorm  possible.</p><p>I'm not expecting widespread travel delays though with that  precipitation in New England.  It's going to be more of the hit or miss in  nature activity.</p><p>New York City and Philadelphia, expecting some sunshine and another  warm day in Philadelphia with a high temperature expected at 90 degrees.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Maria Molina, our meteorologist here at Fox  Business.</p><p>We have some breaking news to bring you, a deal on this Monday.   Dell is buying Quest Software for $2.4 billion.  Quest offered software to  help manage business, businesses manages their data bases, that's $28 a  share, $2.4 billion.</p><p>But it was a deal that was expected, there have been some reports  that this deal was in the works and coming and now, here it is.  And we'll  be watching Dell stock today as well as Quest.</p><p>Coming up after the break, one of the I-man's favorite business  reporters Liz Macdonald would join me in the studio live.</p><p>And later the I-man's interview with Chris and Lorraine Wallace on  her latest cookbook, \"Mr. Sunday's Saturday Night Chicken.\"  Don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A scandal caused Barclay's Chairman Marcus Agius' job and put  CEO Bob Diamond in the sites of politicians, expecting the Diamond lost its  sparkle.  Does this scandal threaten to hit other banks worldwide?</p><p>The heat coming down on bankers around the globe, but it's nothing  compared to the scorcher blistering parts of the U.S. and triggering deadly  storms.  Millions waking up this morning without electricity and  temperatures soaring over 100 in some places.</p><p>Good morning, everybody.  I'm Dagen McDowell.  This is \"Best of IMUS  IN THE MORNING.\"  Let's take a quick look at the markets around the globe  before I get to some news on earnings.</p><p>You look at Asia, the markets were essentially flat there except for  nice solid gains in Australia.  You go over to Europe, you have gains  across the board, north of 1 percent gains in Germany and in France, and  well, almost 1 percent and on the DAX, given up some gains there, but all  three markets there in the green, major markets.</p><p>On the U.S. futures, we have a bit of a loss on the Dow and Nasdaq  futures and commodities have been in the tank all morning long.  And kind  of like that though.  Oil is down a buck 50 a barrel, thereabouts, to  $83.45.</p><p>And we are getting earnings from Acuity Brands, the maker of an  electrical component.  Reporting a profit of 82 cents, that beat  expectations of 78 cents.  Revenue of $487.5 million, it did come up short  of revenue expectation for analysts of $491 million.</p><p>But here in the studio with me to talk about foreclosures on homes  the state of California, Liz Macdonald, is ready to make it tougher for  banks to foreclose, across every single state across this country.  Will it  do more harm than good do you think?</p><p>LIZ MACDONALD, FOX BUSINESS:  Yes, that's the question for bankers.   They're saying it could do more harm than good because it could stop the  foreclosure process, stop the housing recovery, stop the clearance of the  backlog and that inventory.</p><p>And so what we're seeing is California has been fighting for its own  set of foreclosure rules for about the last two years and one set of rules  is coming to a vote today.</p><p>And what the issue is, what they want is, basically, stop  foreclosure if a borrower is in loan modification, that could be extended  for a very long time and basically the borrower could strike out that  process and extend the payment process without paying anything, without  paying any mortgage loan payment.</p><p>So the other issue, too, California notably is basically asking  voters to approve the right to sue bankers during the foreclosure process,  if they break any of their new foreclosure rules.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about the other 50 states, Liz?  Is this on a state by  state basis?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And how does it fit in with that massive settlement, that  foreclosure settlement, the banks?</p><p>MACDONALD:  This is what's important.  It's on a state by state basis.  We  have 25 states right now, moving ahead with their own set of foreclosure  rules and basically, we didn't expect this.</p><p>And I don't think the banking industry expected it and I don't think  the media saw this coming.  After the $25 billion foreclosure settlement in  February, basically, we thought that that was the end of it.</p><p>But no, the states are saying forget it.  Let's set aside the $25  billion foreclosure settlement.  That does not stop us from issuing our own  foreclosure rules, basically HARP 3.0 or HAMP 3.0, which is a federal  program for the states.</p><p>So, you know, the bankers are coming out in the media saying it's  going to make it difficult for us and to be able to clear that inventory if  they're willy-nilly sets of rules.</p><p>We get it, we want to protect borrowers, but for the bankers, I'm  sure they're going to feel like they're chasing a net in a hurricane or a  moth in the hurricane, try to follow these different rules.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, but do you -- again, it's the -- do you get to stay in a  home when you're not making payments on a home?  It's not even your home.</p><p>Yes, if you're underwater on it and if you're underwater and you  have no equity in it, it's not your house and you're basically living rent- free and at what point in this country do we say, enough is enough?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes, that's the issue, too.  And also with the new rules  coming, back to your point, we are going to wait for the rules to kick in,  right and see how the rules play out in our own state.</p><p>You know, for example, New York State is talking about criminalizing  forgery if there's in a foreclosure document, called a forgery and the  issue, too, is will all the bankers out there get state by state rules and  if they break the rules, would they be subject to lawsuits, even if they  didn't know or had access to, weren't apprised to the rules ahead of time.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What's does it do to lending?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, you know, the FHA doesn't like it.  They've criticized it  and they've criticized in the past, similar standards, right, similar  ideas.  And saying, freeze up credit.  You know?</p><p>Banks could become gun shy and separate from that the Mortgage  Bankers Association say the cost of thee different rules come down in the  foreclosure rules will be passed along to future borrowers.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And makes you not want to live in one of those states or trying  to find a home in one of those states.</p><p>Liz, thank you so much.  Good to see you.  Liz Macdonald on the Fox  Business Network.  She will be with you all day long.  Right now, we want  to go to our news room and Diane Macedo who has business headlines for you.   Hi, Diane.</p><p>MACEDO:  Hi, Dagen.  So it's official, Dell is buying Qwest Software for  $2.4 billion or $28 a share.  Qwest offers software to help businesses  manage their data bases.  Dell's offer tops the one made by a property  equity group led by insight very much partners bidding on Qwest the last  few months.  The deal marked Dell's latest effort to expand beyond its core  business of personal computers.</p><p>And Barclay's Chairman Marcus Agius has resigned in the wake of the  bank's interest rage rigging scandal.  Agius who's been chairman for more  than five years says the scandal has dealt a devastating blow to Barclay's  reputation and buck stops with him.</p><p>He will stay on until they find a succession plan there.  The bank  was fined more than $450 million last week by British and U.S. regulators  for submitting false documents on the London Interbank offered interest  rate or Libor, which is the rate at which banks lend unsecured funds to  each other.</p><p>Barclays had admitted that some of its traders attempted to  manipulate that rate to make it look like the bank's borrowing costs look  lower than they actually were in an attempt to make the bank and the  industry in general look healthier than it actually is.</p><p>Agius' resignation is seen as an attempt to take the pressure off  CEO Bob Diamond who is also facing calls to resign.  Dagen, back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.  Diane, first, it was Mr. Sunday's soups and  now Lorraine and Chris Wallace rejoin the I-man to talk another cookbook,  this they're talking chicken.  They recently sat down to talk about recipes  with the I-man.</p><p>(REPEAT INTERVIEW WITH CHRIS AND LORRAINE WALLACE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Still ahead, we have a market check and some hilarious moments  from IMUS IN THE MORNING.  So stick around.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANGELA SUN, TENNIS CHANNEL:  Hello.  This is Angela Sun for the Tennis  Channel's Wimbledon Court Report here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Some say middle Monday in Wimbledon is the greatest day of tennis  all year.  Every fourth round match involved the men and women's draws are  scheduled.  Two remain, for the men, Djokovic, Feder and Andy Murray are  the top seeds remaining in the draw and for the women, Sharapova, Victoria,  and (inaudible) are also alive.</p><p>Americans are well represented, as Serena Williams, Mardy Fish and  qualifier Brian Baker, still on.  Baker lost only two sets in six matches.</p><p>Wimbledon prime time will have all the action nightly at 5 p.m.  Eastern on Tennis Channel with extended highlights and news and interviews  from the grass court slams.  For the Tennis Channel Wimbledon Court Report,  I'm Angela Sun.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, speaking of Wimbledon in England and overseas, looking at  your markets around the world.  First we cross the Pacific and go to Asia.   And they were essentially flat except for a nice gain in Australia.</p><p>Over to Europe in England and France and Germany, you have 1 percent  plus gains in France and Germany.  The futures in the U.S., a mixed bag,  they were up, they were down slightly and still see an 8 point loss on the  Dow.  But again, it was a great day and weak last week, rough quarter for  stocks.  Commodities, oil and gold are both lower.</p><p>There's one thing that is for certain, there's never a shortage of  laughs on IMUS IN THE MORNING.  Here are some of the lighter moments from  the I-man and everybody else.</p><p>(BEST OF IMUS EXTRA SEGMENTS)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2012 Fox News Network, LLC.

He suspects this Dimon has lost its sparkle. And to heat other banks worldwide.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The heat coming down on bankers around the world but nothing is compared to the scorcher blistering parts of the United States and triggering deadly storms. Millions waking up this morning without electricity and temperatures in some places are over 100 degrees.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Chinese economy anything but hot and continues to cool down. The latest PMI reading indicates that factory production and exports continues to plunge as investors wonder what happens when the world global engine begins to stall.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And what's old is new again in Mexico where voters hand power to the political party that ruled for 70 years but was swept from office more than a decade ago only to return on this Monday, July the 2nd, 2012.</p><p>Good morning, everybody. Well, I'm back from vacation. Connell is not here. He runs for the hills when he knows he has to be with me. I'm Dagen McDowell everybody. This is BEST OF IMUS.</p><p>And we've got some incredible interviews that the I-man did recently. Coming up this hour, Jose Rodriguez. And also Imus on Imus, not blonde on blonde. Deirdre, Imus and Wyatt Imus go head to head. I missed that last week and I cannot wait to see that.</p><p>Meantime, let's bring you up to date on what is happening in the global markets. And first, we start with Asia. The Hong Kong market was closed for a holiday today. And we had some mixed reaction there. Again, that reading on Chinese factory activity did come in better than expected, somewhat better than expected. The Nikkei was lower, one with the Kospi and South Korea. But the Shanghai managed to tick up just a bit. But the ASX 200 index was also higher.</p><p>We have gains across the board, potentially we follow a reaction to what happened with European leaders and the changes in that bailout facility to help Italy and Spain. We'll see if that lasts. Coming up, we'll talk to a guest from Europe, from London.</p><p>Let's take a look at the futures here in the U.S. It looks like a positive start. Again, the markets closed early tomorrow. Off on Wednesday. Very busy week for data with that critical jobs report coming out on Friday. And we have essentially flat lines there. Not flat but down. Oil and gold with gold falling almost one percent. Oil is down two percent this morning.</p><p>For more on the European markets, let's go live to London where we're joined by Jane Foley, senior foreign currency strategist for Rabobank. Jane, how long does the euphoria from that deal struck by European leaders last? Do you think that we can even get a couple more days out of this in terms of gains?</p><p>JANE FOLEY, RABOBANK SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST: Well, that's really the big question and that will be the question that prevail over the next few weeks. It is quite likely that we'll get decent support from this over the next few weeks, perhaps over the next few months. But I think as we've already been seen, there was already some skepticism entering in here and there's still a lot of pit holes thrown up by what was agreed last week. And a lot of uncertainty about the details too.</p><p>You've already mentioned the banking supervisions. How long is it going to take for Europe to get a single banking supervisor? And what exactly, what should have shaken this at going to be? And there's also about the ESM too. There's been some complaints in some European countries about the seniority the announcement last week, that the ESM would not be seen here to -- holders of Spanish government debt. So, again some confusion today and therefore some backtracking. More consultative tone I think we should say in some markets in Europe this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What is the next great hurdle for the European markets? What is the next meeting, piece of news that you were looking to that we can count on -- give us some direction in these markets?</p><p>FOLEY: Well, of course, we do have the ECB policy meeting on Thursday. Many people expecting a rate cut there because of course the very slow growth conditions in Europe. Beyond that, we have a finance ministers meeting on July the ninth. But that will be important because the market is expecting more detail about the purchase that were announced last week.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What also is the reaction to the resignation to the chairman of Barclays, the livewire scandal there, what it means for other banks not just in Europe but around the globe?</p><p>FOLEY: Well, of course, Barclays is one of the first banks to come through and pay the fine and be fully investigated in the scandal. But I think many people in many parts of the world are waiting for what else is going to come. And there could be further bad news ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jane, thank you so much. Jane Foley, senior foreign currency strategist for Rabobank.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at the Asian markets. And for that, we go to FOX Business contributor Katie Sargent. She joins us on the phone from Singapore. Hey, Katie, reaction to that factory report from China.</p><p>KATIE SARGENT, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: That seems to be something that's taking the markets, taking the wind out of the market sails today, Dagen. Most of the markets in the region started the day pretty strong, still kind of riding that wave of euphoria on the agreement from last week over the European banks. But that quickly waned when we started looking at PMI numbers.</p><p>We saw more evidence of a slowdown in China over the weekend. The official Purchasing Managers Index for June came out showing a drop from May. It was better than expected but still showed a drop. And there was a private PMI report released today that also showed activities shrank in June. They are a little bit in disagreement over the final number but both are showing a slowdown.</p><p>So, the session started quite positive for the region. Australia's benchmark ASX 200 was up nearly one percent. But then as I say, things slowdown, the Nikkei in Japan hit a two-month in today high before faltering and finishing the day little changed. Not much movement in the rest of the markets either -- Dagen.</p><p>MACEDO: Thank you so much, Katie. Katie Sargent on the phone from Singapore. Thank you so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Now, for a closer look at the U.S. markets and a preview of how things will shape up today, we go to our very own Lauren Simonetti from the Newsroom. Good morning, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Good morning. The fireworks were lit early on Wall Street with stellar gains for the major averages. The Dow rocketing 277 points on Friday. June, great months too with gains of at least 3.8 percent for the three major averages. This first trading day of July will be a busy one and an equally busy week. National manufacturing figures on tap. Auto sales tomorrow. And that key government jobs report for June is out on Friday.</p><p>Speaking of jobs, they are moving off of Wall Street. The trend is called near shoring. It's where big financial tightened higher and relocated workers to cities like Salt Lake, City, Utah. And Jacksonville, Florida where rent, taxes and labor all cost less.</p><p>Silicon Valley is seeing a similar exodus. That's the big tech giant find saving in other U.S. cities. And how do you read it? \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" laying off bookstore shelves. EL James' erotic novel became the nation's fastest selling paper back to reach one million sales.</p><p>Nelson book scan (ph) finds that it took 11 weeks to reach that mark, that was 25 weeks faster than the previous record holder, \"The Vinci Code.\" Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Lauren, thank you so much. I will say nothing about that book since I have not read it and have no plans to read it. Now, we go to our Newsroom and Diane Macedo who has a look at more business news for you this morning. Hey, Diane.</p><p>DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: I will say nothing about the book because my mother is watching.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p><person><nameText>Barclays Chairman Marcus Agius </nameText></person>has resigned in the wake of the bank's interest rate raging scandal. Agius who has been the chairman for more than five years says, the scandal has dealt a devastating blow to Barclays' reputation. And at the buck stops with him, he will stay in the position until a succession plan is in place.</p><p>You might remember the bank was fined more than $450 million last week by a British and U.S. regulators for submitting false documents on the London interbank offered interest rate, which the rate at which banks lend unsecured funds to each other. Barclays has admitted that some of its traders attempted to manipulate that rate. Agius' resignation is seen as an attempt to take some pressure off CEO Bob Dimon who along with Agius also is facing calls to resign.</p><p>Airbus is set to unveil plans for its first U.S. factory today. The company's parent, European Aeronautic Defense and Space plans to spend $600 million to build a facility in Mobile, Alabama. Once it opens in 2015, the plant is expected to create 1,000 jobs and will reportedly produce four planes a month by 2017. The move also puts the facility on the home turf of U.S. rival Boeing which has 2700 employees in Alabama as well.</p><p>Bristol-Myers Squibb is buying diabetes drug maker Amylin Pharmaceuticals for $5.3 billion. That breakdown to $31 dollars a share, nine dollars higher. And the offer Bristol-Myers reportedly made back in March. Now, if you include debt, the deal is worth a total of $7 billion.</p><p>In addition, Bristol-Myers will enter into an alliance with British drug maker Astra Zeneca to developed and commercialize Amylin's diabetes drugs. Astra Zeneca will pay Bristol-Myers $3.4 billion in that deal, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Diane. Following attacks on 9/11, the CIA was instructed to protect Americans by any means necessary. Some of the agency's methods were later questioned but a new book by former CIA operative Jose Rodriguez defends the tactics used to fight the terrorists. Rodriguez was on recently to discuss it all with the I-man.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DON IMUS, HOST, \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\": Please welcome to the program Jose Rodriguez, has got a book called \"The Hard Measures: How Aggressive CIA Actions after 9/11 Saved Americans Lives.\" Mr. Rodriguez, sits here and listening to me. Juan use vial language to try and apologize for it.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And two, scream and swear at the recorded commercials which makes me pretty much a mental patient. Anyway, first of all, good morning, Mr. Rodriguez.</p><p>JOSE RODRIGUEZ, \"HARD MEASURES\" AUTHOR: Thank you.</p><p>IMUS: How are you?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Thank you for inviting me on the show.</p><p>IMUS: I saw you on \"60 Minutes.\" How did that go?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: That went well. You know, it was my first time out doing this. I was a 31-year CIA veteran and clandestinity was my thing. And coming out in the open like that was a new one for me. So, far so good.</p><p>IMUS: Were you covert operations for the entire 31 years?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: I was covert operative for 31 years.</p><p>IMUS: OK. So, were you at the University of Florida? Is that where you went to school?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Yes, I did.</p><p>IMUS: And you were recruited there?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: No. I left the university and I sent an application. And it takes awhile but a couple of years later, I was recruited.</p><p>IMUS: You sent an application to the CIA?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Yes.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Why did you want do that?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: I have lived in Latin America all my life, had traveled overseas, was interested in foreign affairs, was interested in that type of life. And, you know, I was always interested in the CIA. So, when it came to time, I was very fortunate to get recruited.</p><p>IMUS: What did you tell people you do?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Well, usually you know, I was assigned overseas for 17 years, so I had State Department cover, so I was a State Department official forever.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So, that's what you -- they didn't know you were in the CIA?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Well, you know, it's kind of a game. I think most people know who you are, you know. And then when you become chief of station, you become declared to that country.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: So, the official, the local service, knows who you are. And, you know, they can tell anybody else. So, it's one of those things that you do but it doesn't matter much. You still have to do your job.</p><p>IMUS: Now, the secrets you reveal, I guess they are, in this book and the techniques, methods and all that stuff, why did you do this? Was it a good idea or?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: No, I did not reveal any secrets.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: I mean, they were already exposed. As a matter of fact, President Obama released the legal opinion that has all these techniques. He did it in 2009 against the advice of a couple of CIA directors because he was concerned that he would give away to the enemy exactly the outer limits of what was permissible under U.S. law, so.</p><p>IMUS: Permissible in terms of interrogation?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: In terms of the law, what our law permits for how far we can go, yes, in interrogating prisoners.</p><p>IMUS: OK. And so, you decided to do the book for what reason?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: I decided to write the book to set the record straight because to me, it is unbelievable the amount of misinformation that has been out there regarding our programs after 9/11. I wrote the book because I was the subject of a criminal investigation for three years for destroying some tapes and I never got the chance to say my side of the story.</p><p>And I wrote the book because there are a lot of people who are still caught up in investigations that are very unfair and are suffering a lot because of it, because they did what our government asked them to do.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, paramount at the top tier of misinformation, what would be the biggest misconception that the general public, people like me and others, would be embracing?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: That the enhanced interrogation techniques were torture.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: That's the top.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, it sounds to me -- of course it's just me -- but like it could have been fun but just me, but people think -- I've got a couple of people a little while ago, one of whom thought that we never got any good information, water boarding people.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Tat is such --</p><p>IMUS: Nonsense.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Can I say crap in radio?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Because we got thousands of intelligence reports. We were able to disrupt plots. We were able to capture high-level terrorists. We were able to destroy the al-Qaeda organization that attacked us on 9/11 because of the work that we did.</p><p>IMUS: So, the people say, well, when you torture people, they'll simply tell you what they think you want to hear but --</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Well, first of all, this is not torture.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: And second of all, we're smarter than that. You know, we have people who are world experts on al-Qaeda and actually know quite a bit about these individuals already. So, we've vetted them very closely and check it. And, you know, these people eventually come through with a lot of really good stuff.</p><p>IMUS: Of course, one of you guys are lawyers. And like lawyers, you already know the answer to the question before you ask it. You just want to see if they're willing to give it to you, so.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Yes, I think the key is knowledge. I mean, the key to a good interrogation is knowledge. How much knowledge do you know of the target? Because if you do, then they can't fool you.</p><p>IMUS: So, leading up to the murder of -- murder, assassination, whatever of Osama -- the killing of Osama bin Laden, what led up to that?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: As you know, it was a ten-year effort. We started to look --</p><p>IMUS: A lot of people don't know that.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Yes. Well, it was a ten-year effort. We started looking for Bin Laden the day after 9/11.</p><p>IMUS: Right. Well, I guess they knew that but they didn't know that it was a concentrated effort in intelligence gathering and so on. So, walk me through that if you can.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Yes. Interestingly, because if you had asked me in 2002, how long it would take to get Bin Laden, I would take you 18 months, two years perhaps. Because I figured eventually, we would find him. But he took himself out of the day-to-day running of al-Qaeda, and he decided he would become the symbolic figure. So, he gave up his day-to-day duties and moved to a compound in Pakistan and communicated with al-Qaeda central via courier.</p><p>And the courier would go by every two or three months to deliver messages from him to the principals of the organization. So until we found the courier, we would not be able to find Bin Laden. And finding the courier took a long time because it's one person. And we started to get some information in 2004 about the courier. We got the pseudonym of the courier...</p><p>IMUS: How did you get that? Through enhance interrogation...</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: We got that from interrogating at one of our black sites, a facilitator that we had captured.</p><p>IMUS: What is a black site?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: A black site is the location where we would take this terrorist to, to interrogate.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: And it was a secure location. It was secure and secret, and we hid in plain sight in different parts of the world so that we could have total access, unrestricted access that we controlled to the detainee.</p><p>IMUS: Were you all at the agency and you and everybody, were you surprised that you turned up in Pakistan?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: No. We always thought he was in Pakistan. So, I'm not surprised.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Were you surprised that -- it seemed like a relatively easy -- I mean once they decided to go ahead and storm the compound, it seemed like a fairly easy operation. Maybe I'm just naive or --</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: No, I think, you know, we got the best Special Forces in the world, and I'm sure that they do this and do it very well. So, I think that once, you know, the hardest part is to find the guy, in my view. I think that once you have the target, our special operators can plan it and with the precision and the fire power and their skill, you know, I don't think there's anybody better in the world.</p><p>IMUS: So, what impact on the whole global terror operation did killing him have?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: He was a symbolic figure. As I said before, he was not running operations day to day. He was sending pronouncements, I would like to attack America. I would like to, you know, do this and the other. But he had no direct impact on the day-to-day planning of operations, but he was still a symbolic figure and it was important to kill him.</p><p>IMUS: What did they -- did the CIA have to sign off on your book or?</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Yes, they had to review it. You know, the manuscript is turned over to them. And they go through the publication review board. And they take some stuff out. And we know we discussed with them some things and take some things out. And agree on others. So, yes, it's a process.</p><p>IMUS: Congratulations. \"60 Minutes\" and all these other programs. You can't help but have a bestseller. I hope you do, so.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Thank you so much. Thanks for inviting me.</p><p>IMUS: By the way, thanks for your service to our country.</p><p>RODRIGUEZ: Thank you so much.</p><p>IMUS: Jose Rodriguez, \"Hard Measures.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: When we come back, everybody, we'll have more news for you business and otherwise. Also, the latest on those deadly storms that devastated areas up and down the east coast leaving millions without power.</p><p>Plus, your business travelers forecast with Maria Molina who is watching this storm and the attempted recovery.</p><p>And later, it is Imus on Imus as Deirdre Imus takes on son Wyatt Imus. They battle it out on some very interesting topics.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAL)</p><p>MCDOWELL: We take you around the world at a look at Asian markets. First, mixed markets there but very, very slight losses in Japan and South Korea. A slight gain on the Shanghai. But again, Hong Kong closed for holiday. Gains across the board in Europe.</p><p>Again, follow on euphoria from that European agreement, effort to bail out the banks in that country. Flat futures here in the U.S. but after those gains last week and then take a look at oil and gold. Oil, however, continued to tumble down almost two percent. I kind of like that.</p><p>And now, some of the news stories making headlines this morning. Utility crews working in blistering heat trying to restore power to hundreds of thousands along the northeast corridor. A violent storm causing damage from Indiana to New Jersey. And authorities confirming at least 13 deaths as a result.</p><p>FOX News correspondent Elizabeth Prann had the latest from Charleston,, West Virginia.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ELIZABETH PRANN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Among those killed in the severe weather, two young boys in New Jersey. They were camping and crushed by a downed tree.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Fifty foot tall pine tree snapped. It fell on a tent that was occupied by two boys, a 7-year-old and 2-year-old.</p><p>PRANN: Powerful winds and frequent lightning whipped through the Mid- Atlantic States Friday night.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: It sounds like the fourth of July. There was a major late show, I mean, the lightning didn't stop for about 90 minutes.</p><p>PRANN: An Amtrak train traveling from New York to Chicago waylaid in West Virginia by downed trees.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I heard the weather and heard the stuff hitting inside of the train. And next thing I know we were stopped. It was pitch- black.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: You have the power out and nothing but mountains on both sides.</p><p>PRANN: The 232 passengers eventually making it out by bus. Ohio, West Virginia, Maryland and Virginia all declared states of emergency. President Obama has reached out to the governors. Trees twisted in wires across the Washington, D.C. suburbs, crews in Virginia and Maryland trying to entangle a puzzle of power lines saying, the job requires some extra manpower.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: We requested over 1,000 crews from different parts of the country.</p><p>PRANN: Linemen working here in West Virginia in the 90-degree heat trying to restore power and relief to more than half a million customers.</p><p>(on camera) The National Weather Service calling Friday night's storm a derate (ph) show, meaning a line of thunderstorm packing damaging straight line winds some cities feeling gusts up to 90 miles per hour.</p><p>In Charleston, West Virginia, Elizabeth Prann, FOX News.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Florida is now saying no to two features of President Obama's health care law. Governor Rick Scott saying, the state will not comply with the Supreme Court ruling to expand medicaid and implement insurance exchanges. Wisconsin and Louisiana to other states with republican governors also opting out of the two provisions last week. The health care law will take full effect in January 2014 but republican lawmakers are vowing to repeal it before then.</p><p>A fiesta of democracy, that is what <person><nameText>Enrique Pena Nieto </nameText></person>is calling his victory in Mexico's presidential election. The official preliminary count gives Pena Nieto about 38 percent of the vote. Pena Nieto is part of the institutional revolutionary party which was voted out of office in 2000 after 71 years in power. The president-elect is promising Mexicans a government that is democratic, modern and open to criticism. The PRI, the party as it's known, was long accused of ruling the country through authoritarian and corrupt practices.</p><p>And Spain does it again beating Italy four to nothing in the European championship last night. It is Spain's third straight major soccer title. Tens of thousands of fans gathering in central Madrid to see the team win. Fireworks and celebrations give temporary relief to the country's economic crisis.</p><p>Apparently, you can still play soccer if you're a broke nation. The team becomes the first to win a euro and then a world cup and then another euro. Cheers all around.</p><p>Let's go up to Diane Macedo who has a look at business news this morning. Diane, did you watch any of it?</p><p>MACEDO: I didn't actually. I didn't get a chance to. But I do love watching soccer. I heard it was a great game.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yap. Indeed.</p><p>MACEDO: Busy working. But Facebook executives have decided to keep the company stock listed on the NASDAQ despite issues surrounding its IPO. This is according to the \"Wall Street Journal\" which says, the company had considered moving its shares off the NASDAQ in the days following its trading debut, but now feel that would erode confidence in the shares even further.</p><p>Facebook's executives have quietly blamed the NASDAQ for the glitches in the IPO. But officials say that -- officials at the exchange that is are working to repair the relationship. Dow is closely wrapping up its efforts to buy quest software. According to reports, the deal could be announced as early as today.</p><p>There's still no word on a final price but last week Dell offered roughly $2.3 billion for quest which offered software to help businesses manage their data bases. Dell's latest offer was better than the one made by a private equity group led by inside ventures partners which is also have been bidding on quest for the last few months. If Dell does finalizes the deal, it will mark the company's latest effort to expand beyond its core business of personal computers.</p><p>And a movie about a foul-mouthed teddy bear was the top ticket at the box office this weekend. Ted took in more than $50 million in North America beating Channing Tatum's steamy role as a male stripper in \"Magic Mike.\" Walt Disney's animated fairy tale brave which was last week's number one fell to third place.</p><p>Tyler Perry's new film \"Madea's Witness Protection\" and \"Madagascar 3\" round out the top 5 -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: If you're going to talk about \"Magic Mike,\" we got to role some video, I'm sorry (INAUDIBLE) at the full screen -- but just Dagen, thanks Diane.</p><p>Right now, we want to get a look at the business travelers' forecast for you. And we go to Maria Molina who is standing by in the FOX Business Weather Center. Maria, what do you know?</p><p>MARIA MOLINA, METEOROLOGIST: Hey, Dagen. And we're looking at some showers and thunderstorms still rolling through portions of the Carolinas, Georgia, the State of Alabama and also the Florida panhandle but nothing like what we saw last night or in the overnight hours when we saw over 800 reports of severe weather, a lot of them coming from this region where we're still dealing with some lingering showers across parts of the Carolinas down into Florida.</p><p>Now we're still going to be seeing very hot temperatures. So our heat wave is going to continue not just for today but even over most of this work week. So 90 will be your high in New York City; 96 in Chicago and Atlanta; and upper 90's in the city of Denver. So it's going to be another scorcher. And of course Dagen when you factor in the humidity, it feels even hotter during the afternoon.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you. Maria Molina, our meteorologist in Fox Business.</p><p>Coming up after the break, we'll check on the markets for you. And stay tuned for an Imus family interview as the I-man gives both Deirdre Imus and his son Wyatt an opportunity to battle it out over the air waves. Stick around as this best of Imus on the Fox Business Network continues.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The live, more scandal cost <person><nameText>Barclays chairman Marcus Agius </nameText></person>his job, puts CEO Bob Dimon in the sights of politician who thinks Dimon has lost his sparkle and also threatens to hit other banks worldwide.</p><p>The heat coming down on bankers, but it's nothing compared to the scorcher blistering parts of the U.S. and triggering deadly storms. Millions wake up this morning without electricity while temperatures in some places top 100 degrees.</p><p>Welcome back everybody. I'm Dagen McDowell here on this Best of Imus in the Morning. We've got your markets for you and so much more. Some incredible guests coming up in the next couple of hours include Dana Perena (ph). And we'll show you a special little new addition to her family if you haven't been watching The Five. Well, shame on you if you haven't been watching The Five.</p><p>In the meantime, we'll take you around the world and look at stocks in Asia. First we had a mixed market with just slight losses in Japan and South Korea, slight gain on the Shanghai. Hong Kong closed.</p><p>But European markets are up across the board, up nearly 1 percent in Germany and then in France as well. Again, more positive reaction to the bailout decision from those European leaders last week.</p><p>We had incredible numbers on the stock market here. Stocks are essentially flat. It's going to be kind of a funny week, if you will, with the markets closed for July 4 on Wednesday. And then nothing funny about a drop in oil. We kind of love that. Oil is off its lows in the session so far, but still down about $1.50 a barrel.</p><p>For more on the European markets, let's go live to London. Where we're joined by Mike Ingram, market analyst for BGC Partners.</p><p>Mike, great of you to be here this morning. How long does this excitement last, do you think?</p><p>MARK INGRAM, BGC PARTNERS: Well, I think this market probably has a bit of legs to it. I mean, the other thing that's likely to further support the market during the course of the week is the ECB decision on Thursday. And there there's wide expectation that we will see a rate cut and they might even fiddle around with the deposit rates to try to get some of that commercial banking cash off the central bank's balance sheet.</p><p>But yeah, I mean, there is clearly a lot of analysis out of what came out of Brussels on Friday. And we're putting it on Monday still feeling pretty perky.</p><p>MCDOWELL: In terms of fixing the financial problems that have plagued Europe and the nations there, when do you think a final fix is in? How many years are we looking at to have true kind of fiscal unity across the continent?</p><p>INGRAM: Well, if you can consider that it took something like 12 years to get the single currency up and running in the first place, we are certainly talking about months and years rather than weeks and months. And in fact, if you go back back to what was actually agreed on, on Friday -- and I wrote on this -- there are a lot of unanswered questions. For instance, everybody is saying Spain's bank is going to get cash up front it'll get directly in the banks. But none of that can happen until the European central bank, the ECB is there as a regulator. That's probably six months away.</p><p>So, yeah, this is going to be a long and torturous road. I guess we're all going to be commenting on it for a good long time yet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And then of course Spain, you know, wins the euro, the championship, yay, I guess. Thank you, Mike.</p><p>INGRAM: Yeah, there a lot of people suddenly Spanish over here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Exactly. We get that a lot here. Mike, thanks so much. Mike Ingram from BGC Partners.</p><p>INGRAM: It's my pleasure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Help may be just around the corner for struggling homeowners. A new government program is in the works even though previous ones have had little to no impact on the housing market.</p><p>Fox Business's Peter Barnes is in Washington, D.C. with the details -- Peter.</p><p>PETER BARNES, FOX BUSINESS sources say the White House is planning a big push this month to expand government mortgage refinance programs. The president announced this idea in his State of the Union Address in January, but now Senate Democrats produced three bills that the administration says would offer millions more homeowners lower interest rates on their mortgages. The refinances would be done through the FHA, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p><p>In recent weeks, Obama economic aides have been ramping up the push online and through social media.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We need congress to act to put this plan into action for real.</p><p>So we've talked about why we think refinancing is important. But we want to hear from you. We want to hear your stories.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARNES: Expect to see the president follow up at campaign events this month to put pressure on Republicans to support the legislation. And administration official says the White House and Senate Democrats are trying to work out a compromise with Senate Republicans to move the bills, but Democratic leaders are expected to bring them to a vote by the end of this month even if they can't get a deal.</p><p>But with no support for the measures in the Republican-controlled House, critics see this as an election-year play, a ploy for votes in key battle ground states hard hit by the housing crisis.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TERRY HAINES, POTOMAC RESEARCH GROUP: Sounds like something that is - - achieves their legislative goals, but at the same time is not something that in a practical sense is going to be able to have much impact before the election on homeowner refinancing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARNES: The Obama official says the Senate bills would be paid for mainly through higher closing costs and fees for borrowers, though one program would require $4 billion in funding from congress.</p><p>Back to you in New York.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, Peter. Peter Barnes in D.C.</p><p>Let's go to our news room and Diane Macedo who has a look at more business headlines.</p><p>Hey, Diane.</p><p>MACEDO: Hi Dagen.</p><p>So <person><nameText>Barclays chairman Marcus Agius </nameText></person>has resigned in the wake of the bank's interest rate rigging scandal. Agius who has been the chairman for more than five years says the scandal has dealt a devastating blow to Barclays reputation and the buck stops with him.</p><p>He will stay in position, though, until a succession plan is in place. The bank was fined more than $450 million last week by British and U.S. regulators for submitting false documents on a London Interbank Offered Interest Rate which is the rate at which banks lend unsecured funds to each other. Barclays admitted some of its trader attempted to manipulate that rate. The resignation is scene as an attempt to take the pressure off CEO Bob Dimon who is also facing calls to resign.</p><p>Germany's Linde is buying U.S.-based home oxygen provider Lincare Holdings for $4.6 billion. The deal breaks down to $41.50 a share, a 22 percent premium on its closing price Friday. Linde's main customers are in the steel and chemical sectors, but it also provides gases used to process solar cells and make LCD TV's.</p><p>Dagen, back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, Diane.</p><p>Usually it's Deirdre Imus versus Lis Wiehl squaring off on blonde on blonde, but this time it was Wyatt Imus who debated the issues with his mother Deirdre. And things did get a little heated. Here's some of that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DON IMUS: It's time for Blonde on Blonde with Deirdre Imus and ordinarily Lis Wiehl, But here filling in for Lis Wiehl, 13-year-old Wyatt Imus. Good morning, Mr. mus.</p><p>WYATT IMUS, DON IMUS' SON: Hey dad.</p><p>DON IMUS: How are you?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: I'm fine.</p><p>DON IMUS: Are you up to filling in for Lis?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Oh, yes. I think if I just don't get hammered by mom like Lis does, I'll be fine.</p><p>DON IMUS: Good morning, Ms. Imus.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS, DON IMUS' WIFE: Good morning.</p><p>DON IMUS: OK. So time for another addition of Blonde on Blonde.</p><p>So, what were you two bickering about?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Before, we were discussing what would you do without all your stuff surrounding you.</p><p>DON IMUS: What are you talking about?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: All your stuff.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Everywhere you go, you have like this stuff around you.</p><p>DON IMUS: I have a clock here.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: No, Dad. You have piles.</p><p>DON IMUS: Of what?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Of stuff.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Like your tissues, your baby wipes, your humidifier, your inhaler, your oxygen, your little markers.</p><p>DON IMUS: Fine, that is our first question. Where are my Q-tips.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: It's like day-care.</p><p>DON IMUS: Bernard, you dope.</p><p>There's the first question. Start with you, Deirdre.</p><p>How old do you think people should be before they have sex?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: 20's.</p><p>DON IMUS: Wyatt, what do you think?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: 13.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Oh, my god.</p><p>MCGUIRK: The apple didn't fall far from the tree.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: I think however responsible someone is to be able to have sex with another person. Some 30-year olds or 20-year olds aren't responsible enough.</p><p>DON IMUS: No.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: But if you're 16 or 17 and you can be responsible.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: What does responsible mean?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Mean, you use right protection, you're not stupid. You don't just do it with anybody like he did in the 60's.</p><p>DON IMUS: Wyatt, let me explain something to you. Leave me out of this.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: You mean in the 40's.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Well, he was born in the 40's.</p><p>DON IMUS: Leave me out of this.</p><p>So you think 16?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: I think whenever you're responsible enough to have sex with someone else.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Well, you know, he actually -- I want to add to that even in your 20's you have to be responsible.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: I mean, like we don't know, I may be responsible enough.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: No, 13 is not responsible, darling. 14 isn't, 15 isn't. 16 isn't.</p><p>No, you have to be in your 20's at least.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Mom, what if a 17-year-old is more responsible than a 22- year-old? Sometimes that happens.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Well, that does happen. And same with a 30-year-old.</p><p>DON IMUS: Well, how old is Austin?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Austin is 18.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: 18.</p><p>DON IMUS: Isn't Austin having sex with his girlfriend?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Probably.</p><p>DON IMUS: Yeah, probably.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: I wouldn't know.</p><p>DON IMUS: But what do you think, Wyatt?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Well, let's bring him in and ask him.</p><p>DON IMUS: Well, no I'm not going to bring in Austin and ask him. Austin is one of the kid wranglers here at the ranch.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: And he's a great kid, a responsible kid.</p><p>DON IMUS: Let's not get hysterical.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: I don't know. I mean, see his girlfriend so probably.</p><p>DON IMUS: so you don't agree?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Agree to what?</p><p>DON IMUS: With Wyatt, that 16 would be old enough.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Absolutely not. Absolutely not. It's too young. You don't know enough. There's too many diseases, even gonorrhea now is at an all-time high. There's too much even with protected sex that things happen, pregnancies and other diseases. I absolutely don't agree.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Not to mention the emotional peril.</p><p>DON IMUS: Yes.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Right. Actually people change their course in life. This is a very important time between high school and college. Boys and girls will actually not go to the college they want to go to, not pursue what their dreams are because of a girlfriend or boyfriend and they don't realize it ruins their life later in life. Even if you tell them right now stay on course, they don't and they can't see that. They're blind-sided.</p><p>DON IMUS: OK, how about that, Wyatt?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Are you going to do that with your rodeo career, have some girl blind side you so then you forever ruin your rodeo career and your schooling with college and everything else because all of a sudden some girl comes along?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: No. I wouldn't lose focus. I'm definitely going to bring one home to you, though, because you'll freak out. Won't she, dad?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: I won't freak out.</p><p>DON IMUS: Of course not.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: No, If you're in college, you know...</p><p>WYATT IMUS: If I'm in college</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: And all of sudden you're really interested in a girl and you bring one home, I'll check her out and make sure everything is good, but I'm not going to say that's great honey.</p><p>DON IMUS: Speaking of rodeo career, what's the fastest you've ever roped and tied a cow?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: On record or in practice?</p><p>DON IMUS: In practice.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: 8.8.</p><p>DON IMUS: 8.8 seconds.</p><p>OK, what's the fastest in a rodeo?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: The world record?</p><p>DON IMUS: No, you.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Oh, 10.3.</p><p>DON IMUS: OK, so if I told you what's the world record?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: 6.3.</p><p>DON IMUS: OK, if I told you you could rope and tie a calf in junior rodeo coming up this fall in 6.2 seconds if you took a harmless but nevertheless helpful performance-enhancing drug, would you take it?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Do you know what that means?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Yeah, I know...</p><p>DON IMUS: Just a steroid or something.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Probably not.</p><p>DON IMUS: Yeah, but you seem reluctant to answer that question.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Well, I was thinking about it. They don't drug test in rodeo.</p><p>DON IMUS: No, they don't.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: But that 6.2 seconds wouldn't be true. I wouldn't be able to do it if I wasn't on the drug. I wouldn't just be able to do it by myself.</p><p>DON IMUS: Right.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: So, no, I'd try to work towards that 6.2 without drugs.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Yeah, he's my man.</p><p>DON IMUS: So you realize a lot of kids would do it.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Would dope?</p><p>DON IMUS: Yes.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Right, but...</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Yeah, a lot of kids would be like Lance Armstrong.</p><p>DON IMUS: But a lot of people -- let's leave one of the great American sports heroes in my lifetime...</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Well, his whole sport of cycling is corrupt. And he's the only one that doesn't blood dope? Come on?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Stop. Stop. Time out.</p><p>What about -- if they are all drug doping and you do it, all you're doing is leveling out the playing field.</p><p>DON IMUS: Right.</p><p>DEIDRE IMUS: Like they do in baseball too, unfortunately.</p><p>DON IMUS: So if...</p><p>WYATT IMUS: So really you would only be trying to compete with your peers. So, I really don't know how bad it would be.</p><p>DON IMUS: It would be immoral.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: And unethical.</p><p>DON IMUS: And perhaps illegal.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: But you would be getting beat every week.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: That's why it's a great question, because could you live with yourself and would you actually do that? You would go that far and be unethical, illegal and wrong just for the sake of saying I won and did the fastest time in the world at the NFR?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Now we're at the NFR? I thought we were in junior high.</p><p>DON IMUS: We're tying 6.2 in junior high.</p><p>DEIDRE IMUS: Oh, he's a phenom then.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: But I'm tying 6.2 in junior high but I'm drug doping that's the only way I can do it?</p><p>DON IMUS: Right.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Well, no, because it wouldn't mean anything.</p><p>DON IMUS: You being a fanatical rodeo mom -- and I've seen you at the rodeos -- you don't wish well to the other children. You want all the other kids roping against Wyatt to come in second, which is fine.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: My philosophy is like Mrs. Bonnie Beaver, I want everyone to do well. I want Wyatt to win. And everyone else to come in second and third.</p><p>DON IMUS: OK, if you knew he could set the world record in junior high rodeo at 6.2 seconds, would you be for him...</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: You mean if he had to do steroids of blood dope or whatever -- absolutely not. I would not be for that. No, because it's not worth it. That's not worth it because you're cheating and it's not genuine. Like Wyatt just said he really didn't do the 6.2 seconds, it wouldn't inauthentic.</p><p>DON IMUS: Do you think you have, Deirdre, good number sense?</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: I do, yes.</p><p>DON IMUS: Do you think she does, Wyatt?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: There's no way to tell.</p><p>DON IMUS: What do you mean?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: I'll give you an example, she always does the opposite of what I'll say so she has a way to prove me wrong.</p><p>DON IMUS: About numbers?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: About numbers. We'll be in the grocery store and we'll be done shopping because I have to help her buy a bunch of hideous things. And we'll be standing and there will be a line here and line here. And any logical person can see one line is shorter and one is longer. I want to go to that line, most of the time -- now this isn't all the time, she'll throw a fit and say, no, you're stupid let's go to the other line.</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: Well, I don't say you're stupid. But you know what I do, it's not necessarily by the number of people in each line.</p><p>WYATT IMUS: That's what number sense is, though, being able to...</p><p>DEIRDRE IMUS: No, I look at it more scientifically, what I'll do is how many pieces of groceries does each person have in that line. Because there can be 10 in one line and 15 in another, but the people with 15, the line is going to move much faster because they only have two items each. So I kind of calculate that quickly so I get a more comprehensive numbers sense than the average person.</p><p>DON IMUS: If they only have two items each, why aren't they in the seven or less?</p><p>WYATT IMUS: Exactly. I don't know what she's talking about. We never have ten items or less. We're never in a group of people with less than 80 items to buy 46 kale chips.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Very adult young man. We should leave it at that.</p><p>Coming up, we'll have the I-man's interview with the author of the Blood Sugar Solution, Dr. Mark Hyman. And also professor Peter Morici will be coming up to discuss how the health care law will impact this economy. Help or hurt? You guess. Don't go away.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So many questions surrounding the health care law that was upheld by the Supreme Court last week, but what does it mean for the future of this economy? We're joined by university of Maryland economic professor Peter Morici.</p><p>Good morning, Peter. Good to see you. I point to the top read story on the Wall Street Journal website and it is get ready for the new investment tax. And I'm talking about that 3.8% surtax on investment income for people making more than $200,000 a year thanks to the health care law. What does that do in the short run to the stock market and the economy?</p><p>PETER MORICI, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND: Well, in the short run it won't have much of an effect, but longer term it means people are going to have to get higher returns on their stock or they're not going to invest in them and they'll look for other alternatives. It's going to take money out of the market and essentially make the value of stocks lower.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't think people realize if the Bush tax cuts are not extended at the end of the year because everything goes away unless congress acts, you're going to have a top rate on dividends, the top rate on capital gains will go up to 23.8 percent and the top rate on dividends will go to 43.4 percent. That is crazy.</p><p>MORICI: You put on top of that state and local taxes, I mean people in New York City, for example, they're facing taxes of close to 60 percent in some cases. That's absurd. This president simply wants to put the private sector out of business.</p><p>You know, he wrote in a book about some time spent in the private sector, it was very brief, in which he said he felt like an enemy behind private sector lines. The president simply doesn't understand how markets work, the importance of incentives for innovation and to get people to create jobs. This is a jobs killer.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What does it do for health care costs in your estimation that is one of the greatest concerns for the economy is the increasing amount of money that we spend on health care versus everything else.</p><p>MORICI: There will be the seen and unseen. The seen is the health care will go up even higher taking money away from working people to subsidize health care will drive up the price. On top of that, it's going to impose lots of unseen costs, more bureaucrats in Washington and bureaucrats in your doctor's office to comply with the mountain of regulations coming down on them. This is going to be what happened with Dodd-Frank and the banks. Small banks can't make loans. Now you'll call up a doctor maybe at 3:00 and he'll say sorry, I've got to finish filing out my paper work today.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Now, I don't know which doctor you're going to, but I haven't gotten a doctor on the phone whether 10:00 in the morning or 3:00 in the afternoon ever. Come on, Peter.</p><p>MORICI: Professors are smart guys. I know how to get my doctor on the phone.</p><p>MCDOWELL: OK. And I'm sure they really love you for that.</p><p>Let's talk about what the states are doing, however, that was a critical part of the Supreme Court ruling last week. We have Florida, the governor there now saying Florida will not expand Medicaid and will not participate in health exchanges on top of Louisiana and Wisconsin.</p><p>Now how does that impact the implementation of the law and its effectiveness?</p><p>MORICI: Well, if they don't participate in Medicaid, the expansion of Medicaid, then it will drive up hospital costs, because they were counting on getting more folks with Medicaid not coming in without insurance. And that's going to cause the hospitals themselves to start to lobby for some sort of provision on the rates, the taxes they were to pay and so forth.</p><p>Not participating in the exchange, there's still going to be an exchange in Florida. The federal government is going to implement it if the state government doesn't. And I don't know if I was a governor -- the law is the law. I don't know if I was a governor I'd want to leave it to Washington to implement the exchange in Florida. I think I'd want to do it myself.</p><p>MCDOWELL: All right. Peter, it was great to see. Thank you so much. We'll see you very soon. Peter Morici down in Washington, D.C. weighing in on the health care law.</p><p>Coming up at the top of the hour, much more in store for you, including the I-man's interviews with Dr. Mark Hyman. And also the author of My Two Moms.</p><p>And stick around, Stuart Varney is up.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: The (inaudible) scandal caused <person><nameText>Barclays Chairman Marcus Agius </nameText></person>his job. But now CEO Bob Diamond in the sight of politicians who suspect this Diamond has lost his sparkle and it also threatens to hit other banks around the globe.</p><p>The heat coming down on bankers worldwide and that's nothing compared to the scorcher blistering parts of the U.S. and triggering deadly storms.

I'm Dagen McDowell in this morning. This BEST OF IMUS IN THE MORNING is in our second hour.</p><p>And coming up, we have Imus's interviews with Dr. Mark Hyman on his book \"The Blood Sugar Solution\", a bestseller in fact; and Zach Wahls on his book \"My Two Moms.\"</p><p>But first let's look on your markets. Starting in Asia we had mixed markets but in South Korea and Japan they were only down just ever so slightly.</p><p>And then let's go to Europe as well. Let's take a look at you're European markets. We have gains across the board. Let's head to Europe we already talked about the Asian market let's head over to Europe we have gains across the board north of one percent on the CAC-40 in France and the DAX in Germany. The futures there in the U.S. have been trying to hang on to some gains but essentially flat so far this morning.</p><p>And then over to commodities, oil and gold are both down. Oil was down a bit more, earlier in the trading session but still down 1.5 percent, losing almost $1.40 almost a barrel -- $1.40 a barrel.</p><p>For more on the European markets let's go live to London where we're joined by David Jones chief market strategist for IG Markets. David, I'm asking everybody the same question so far this morning. How long does the euphoria, the excitement last from that deal that was struck at the end of last week to kind of open up the bailout facility to banks?</p><p>DAVID JONES, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, IG MARKETS: Maybe it will last for a couple more days. We do of course have the -- the central bank, the European Central Bank meeting this week, their normal monthly meeting and the announcement on interest rates.</p><p>So maybe we'll hear from them similar to what we heard from U.S. feds that there will be no QE in the short term, no more stimulus for economies. So, maybe that will be enough to maybe put -- push down some of this optimism.</p><p>But for now at least as you say it is also positive. We're mildly positive here in Europe but still up on the day and feeling the benefits of that announcement from the early hours of Friday morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL: How much of this -- this bit of a rally that we're seeing this Monday is the expectation that the European Central Bank will indeed cut interest rates maybe do something else later this week?</p><p>JONES: I think there's a little bit of that factor there, I think ahead of all of these central bank meetings in recent months we have that expectation that maybe we'll have some sort of more stimulus. We had unemployment figures out of the Euro zone today and they've nudged up again. So I think many people do expect the central bank to act but I think expecting the Europeans to act this week is maybe a bit too soon.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much David. It was great to speak with you this morning. David Jones.</p><p>JONES: Ok.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And for a closer look at the Asian markets let's go to Fox Business contributor, Katie Sargent. Hey Katie, she's on the phone with us from Singapore.</p><p>KATIE SARGENT, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR (via telephone): Hi Dagen. Asian markets today they started strong but they stay this is finish and other things that investors were considering to Purchasing Managers Indexes from China, the official one that tracks the state-backed firms and the private ones that focuses on private companies, now both show that (inaudible) activity shrank in June at the fastest pace in seven months. And it was hurt by weak export demand from Europe and North America.</p><p>Also today the Bank of Japan came out with its Tankan survey and that showed business sentiment improved in the April to June quarter. However that follows up Purchasing Managers Index report from Japan on Friday which showed that manufacturing activity shrank in June. So, investors are kind of having to weigh those too.</p><p>So for today we saw -- well, Hong Kong markets were closed but elsewhere Japan and South Korea gave up their early gains and they finished little changed. Shanghai really an up and down day but at the end it didn't change a whole lot by the end of the day. And Australia's main index one of the better performers adding nearly one percent today -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much Katie good to hear from you. Katie Sargent on the phone with us from Singapore.</p><p>Now for a closer look at the U.S. markets in a preview of how things could shape up today we're joined by Fox Business's Lauren Simonetti from the news room. Good morning, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning. The fires works were lit early on Wall Street with stellar gains for the major averages, the DOW rocketing 277 points on Friday. June great month too with gains of at least 3.8 percent for the three major averages.</p><p>This first trading day of July will be a busy one in an equally busy week.

Take a look at some of these high temperatures for today. Minneapolis, you're expecting a high temperature this afternoon at 99 degrees, 98 over in Denver, a 97 in Kansas City and Chicago on the hot side as well, expecting to see a high temperature at 96 degrees. Our heat wave will continue and we're expecting those hot temperatures to continue in place across the Plains and even as we head into the end of this work week.</p><p>Otherwise, travel across the city of Boston could be tricky later on today and the thunderstorms possible.

We've got Zach Wahls interview with the I-Man coming up about his book, My Two Moms.</p><p>First, let's take a look at your markets. First over to Asia, potentially flat.

Fox Business's Jeff Flock joins us now from the CME with more.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FBN REPORTER: Getting ready for a very important report today in the grain pits and in the cattle pits you see to the right here on this Monday morning. I've got Scott Shellady with me, thinking about trades. What is the report that comes out today and why is it so important in the corn, grain, other grain pits?</p><p>SCOTT SHELLADY, CEO, BRADFORD CENTRAL MANAGEMENT: Because it's a crop condition report and the conditions are deteriorating rapidly. If they deteriorate anything like last week on last Monday's numbers we've got more gains on the market to go. And we've got to see what the Government says, it's not good.</p><p>FLOCK: It was a big week last week for all the grains, particularly corn, even though I've got to say, we've got a bearish report in terms of crop acreage and crop stock piles, still the market went up why?</p><p>SHELLADY: Because the condition report is still on everybody's mind and they know what's out there and if we don't have any significant precipitation to rescue the crop by the end of this week, after the holidays we're in big trouble.</p><p>FLOCK: You know what a drought is like. You actually grew up on a farm in addition to trading these markets, you remember 1988. That was a big drought here. Compare what we've got so far this year to that.</p><p>SHELLADY: Well, last week we saw the crop conditions decrease by seven percent. Everybody thought that was huge and you know what? We had this time in 1988 we saw crop conditions come off 16, 17 percent, so, we could have some more of those things down the pipeline. If we're off more than ten percent on Monday, this time in 1988 was a tumultuous period.</p><p>FLOCK: Time to think about putting your money, in maybe things that you can eat. At least if it doesn't go up in price, you take it home and plant it.</p><p>Jeff Flock at the CME, big day today. Stay tuned.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jeff, thank you so much for that.</p><p>Now, let's go to our News Room and Diane Macedo, who has more business news.</p><p>Hey Diane.</p><p>DIANE MACEDO, FBN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Dagen.</p><p>Barclay's Chairman <person><nameText>Marcus Agius </nameText></person>has resigned in the wake of that bank interest rate rigging scandal. Agius, who has been the Chairman more than five years, says the scandal has dealt a devastating blow to Barclays reputation and that the buck stops with him. He'll stay in the position until a succession plan is in place. You might remember the bank was fined more than 450 million dollars last week by British and U.S. Regulators for submitting false documents on the London Inter-Bank offered interest rate, or libor, which is a rate at which banks lend unsecured funds to each other. Barclays has admitted that some of its traders attempted to manipulate that rate to make it look like the banks borrowing costs were lower than they actually were in an attempt to make the bank and industry in general look healthier than it is. Agius resignation is seen as an attempt to take the pressure off CEO Bob Diamond who also is facing calls to resign.</p><p>Facebook Executives have decided to keep the companies stock listed on the Nasdaq despite problems surrounding it's IPO. That's according to the Wall Street Journal who said the company had considered moving its shares off the Nasdaq in the days following the trading debut, but now feel that would erode confidence in its shares further.

He takes a look at same sex marriage and the details of his life, growing up with two mothers. He's stopped by recently to talk about it with the I-Man.</p><p>DON IMUS, FBN IMUS: Zach Wahls along with Bruce Littlefield has written a book called, My Two Moms, lessons of love, strength and what makes a family.</p><p>Please welcome to the IMUS IN THE MORNING program Zach Wahls.</p><p>Good morning Mr Wahls.</p><p>ZACH WAHLS, AUTHOR: Thanks for having me.</p><p>IMUS: You're quite welcome. How are you?</p><p>WAHLS: Doing all right. It's a little earlier than I'm used to, but that's all right.</p><p>IMUS: You'll live through it. We have.</p><p>WAHLS: Yeah.</p><p>IMUS: Tell me, one of these women conceived you, is that the deal.</p><p>WAHLS: That's right, my biological mom, Terry on the left there, in the red got pregnant with me in 1990 using artificial insemination and gave birth to me in '91 and she met Jackie on the right, in 1994, they had a commitment ceremony in '96 and the rest is history.</p><p>IMUS: So, you were raised in that environment and at one point did-- were you aware that you had, you didn't have a dad, you had two moms?</p><p>WAHLS: Yeah, there's never a lightbulb moment where it clicked in my head or whatever.</p><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p>WAHLS: But what happened was that Terry, explaining to me from when I was a little guy, before I could understand how I was conceived that I had, you know, some kids have two moms, two dads, a mom and dad and there was never a moment looking back on my life where I didn't know who I was and who my family was. There was never secretly a moment of realization so for all intents and purposes just like anybody else.</p><p>IMUS: Okay. Just so we can put this conversation in context here and you know where I'm coming from, I support gay marriage. Because I think people love one another and each other and it doesn't make any difference in my view.</p><p>Now, I know a lot of people don't support it, but I don't know why -- I don't understand that. It's never made, never resonated with me.</p><p>I do think that the traditional American family is a father and a mother. Having said that it doesn't make-- it doesn't make your family any less valid than anybody else's in my view.</p><p>WAHLS: I appreciate that, Don and look at a state like Iowa where I grew up. There are a certain amount of people of a different view.</p><p>IMUS: Why do you think they're of a different view?</p><p>WAHLS: I think most of the opposition is certainly rooted in belief, likely that homosexuality is immoral, and probably religious belief picked up at an early point in their life and they can't necessarily wrap their eyes, their mind around the idea that two gay people could ever be in love with each other or successfully be parents and obviously, once you know my parents and set us down and have dinner with our family and get to know us on a personal level, I think it's that misconception falls apart quickly, but for people who haven't had that experience of sitting down and getting to know us, it's easy to stick with these misconceptions.</p><p>IMUS: Do you think it's because it's a threat to them?</p><p>WAHLS: Yeah, I think they feel threatened.</p><p>IMUS: Why?</p><p>WAHLS: It's a good question, I'm not necessarily sure, it seems like a person getting mad at me for eating a donut because he's on a diet and it doesn't necessarily seem the kind of thing that's rational and there were people in Iowa certainly who predicted the apocalypse after this ruling in 2009, but turns out, hell hasn't opened up and swallowed Davenport into the abyss and in fact, divorce rates are falling in Iowa since 2009.</p><p>So, anybody who kind of claimed the doomsday scenario after the ruling in 2009 is proving incorrect.</p><p>IMUS: There are those who think that children raised by gay parents then become gay themselves.</p><p>WAHLS: Yeah, no, that's definitely something that's another myth and another stereo type, but what those people fail to account for is the fact that straight parents have been the leading cause of gay people in this country forever.</p><p>So, no, it's true. You know, and so, in seconds, the only reason that that would ever be thrown out there in the first place is under this misconception that homosexuality is somehow immoral. If you actually know a gay person, odds are awfully good they were raised by straight parents and you know, along my journey I've met some kids who are gay and have been raised by gay parents and if you think it's hard coming out as a gay person with straight parents, try doing it with gay parents and that's harder and that stereo type hurts a lot of people and not just the parents either.</p><p>IMUS: Why would that be? Probably an obvious answer.</p><p>WAHLS: Then all of a sudden, oh, god you proved the opposition right or what have you. So the idea that somehow gay parents are the only ones raising gay kids is simply not true and then further, it kind of seems like nonsensical in my mind.</p><p>IMUS: Talking with Zach Wahls, who along with Bruce Littlefield.</p><p>Who is he and where did you meet him?</p><p>WAHLS: My agent found him. You know, so the way it happened was that, after the video kind of the start of this whole thing.</p><p>IMUS: The You Tube video.</p><p>WAHLS: Exactly. I was contacted by a couple of literary agents and wound up signing with one in Manhattan and she found Bruce and got the book sold.</p><p>IMUS: \"My Two Moms\" it's called. Lessons of love and strength and what makes a family.</p><p>Why did you want to do the book?</p><p>WAHLS: There were two immediate motifs that came about. First, I wanted to speak out to other kids who had LGBD parents and living in a time that's tumultuous, and when I started to write the book the GOP Primary was coming up and there was kind of mudslinging going around on this issue in particular and I wanted to speak to other kids and just reiterate, to be reminded all the time, despite what you might hear on TV and some of those talking heads out there. You are all right and even though we've heard it a lot in the last year and a half, it does get better.</p><p>Second, I thought this was a pretty incredible opportunity to speak to a lot of people who might be on the fence about the issue. People who are like, well, it's a free country and you know, I'm not going to try and infringe on somebody's liberty or freedom, but what are the effects on the kids? I think the single most effective line that the other side uses on the issue is, do we really want to live in a country where I'm thought of as a bigot because I believe all kids have a right to a mother and father? It's a pretty convincing line when you hear it, but when you sit down and walk through it, it's not that simple.</p><p>IMUS: The rational, I would encourage people to use, I was complaining to a doctor of mine about, I have some, I won't get into a lot of boring stuff. You know what old people do, what they do, first thing they do, probably had this experience, they tell you what's the matter with them. So I'm not going to go that far.</p><p>WAHLS: Yeah.</p><p>IMUS: But I was complaining about breathing and the doctor, one of the foremost Pulmonary Specialists in the world and he said it's like golf and I said, I don't play golf. He says you have to play the ball where it lies. So, wherever the ball, you can't move it. But you can, but you're--</p><p>WAHLS: Right.</p><p>IMUS: So, this is the reality. It's a reality.</p><p>WAHLS: Sure.</p><p>IMUS: Of our-- so I remember explaining to Wyatt, our son, one of the things we did say is how inhuman it is to discriminate against anybody.</p><p>WAHLS: That's right.</p><p>IMUS: For any reason and so, that resonated with him more than anything else. Rather than to try to rationalize whether or not anybody thought it was be aberrant behavior or not, which in my view is irrelevant. And then you've mentioned earlier and I think like a 14-year-old anyway about like, I've always said and it's not funny, but I've just always said, you know, I have no problem with women kissing, I just don't want to see men kissing that's an idiot and half joking, but the point being that that's really what it comes down to.</p><p>WAHLS: Yeah, I think a lot of people are uncomfortable with the idea of seeing two people the same sex being intimate with each other and other people for whom the opposite might be true. And I explain, look, homophobia isn't something that's wrong, and we can't control how that goes. The problem with homophobia, the only thing to fear is fear itself and certainly true in this case. I think a lot of people whom I think might think I am a monster for being homophobic or not necessarily thinking about two men kissing or whatever and that's not the case as long as when you get into the voting booth you're not letting that fear dominate your voting practice.</p><p>IMUS: Tedious analogy that I employ is three or four years ago on this program, we decided to book some African-Americans to try to have a conversation about racial relations and race itself for a number of reasons. And one of the things I found is in talking to various African- Americans, blacks, was that there wasn't all that much to talk about and suddenly, you were talking about issues and other things that affected you both as inhabitants of the planet and so once you got past the fear of somebody being different than you were and you discovered that in fact they weren't, it's got to be the same.</p><p>WAHLS: Yeah, definitely, definitely.</p><p>IMUS: Well, you seem pretty squared away to me.</p><p>WAHLS: Thank you very much.</p><p>IMUS: That should put to rest the bigots out there that think oh, my god what's going to happen.</p><p>WAHLS: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Well, good luck with all of this and this sounds like a movie. Anybody talk to you about that.</p><p>WAHLS: Not yet, but I have to agree, a pretty incredible story.</p><p>IMUS: You're going to College or been to College?</p><p>WAHLS: I was going to university of Iowa as a full-time Engineering student when this whole thing happened and since took a brief academic absence and going back to school in 2013.</p><p>IMUS: You're a good looking kid and get you out in Hollywood.</p><p>WAHLS: We'll see.</p><p>IMUS: Good luck.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, a check on your markets around the world and Mr Stuart Varney joins me right here in the studio to talk about the state of the economy.</p><p>Do not go away.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back, everybody.</p><p>He might not do his Anna Wintour imitation, but he has something to say and say it eloquently, eloquently about the economy. Stuart Varney is joining me, host of VARNEY &amp; COMPANY which starts at nine fifteen, nine twenty.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, HOST OF VARNEY &amp; COMPANY: Close enough.</p><p>That was the nicest introduction, Dagen and I thank you very much indeed.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I didn't even imitate you in the tease, I thought you know what, I'm rested and back from vacation.</p><p>You say this week, all the attention, economically, politically turns back to what's going on in the job market and what can the White House do to fight what is not significant job growth.</p><p>VARNEY: Friday morning, 8:30 eastern time here comes the next Jobs Report. There are only four Jobs Report from now until the election. And this is one of them. And this may be the most important.</p><p>I think the unemployment rate goes up, which is a disastrous headline for the President. And I'm the not sure of this, but in my opinion, it's going up. And the number of new jobs created will be minuscule. I base that on all the indicators that we've received about the general state of the economy in the last two months.</p><p>Would you know that we've actually spent less money in each of the last two months, consumer spending down. In America, that's big news. This is a consumer oriented society. This is a spending society.</p><p>MCDOWELL: In fact--</p><p>VARNEY: But it could--</p><p>MCDOWELL: Big article in the Wall Street Journal about, don't expect the consumer to rescue the economy at this point.</p><p>VARNEY: That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Is that because, I mean, are we in a place where it becomes self-fulfilling and people become more concerned and pull back spending and make the economy worse?</p><p>VARNEY: You're precisely right. It's a vicious circle and it goes round and round and round. No jobs equals lack on confidence and that equals a declining standard of living and that equals less spending and less jobs. You go round and round and round. We've not broken that circle at this point. We could.</p><p>I think if the President made a deliberate and concerted effort to liberate the two trillion dollars, which private enterprise has, in cash, on the sidelines, if you could get that to come into the economy. Give private enterprise a sense of confidence, I think that would be a huge stimulus and I think it would work.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Is there anything the President can do between now and the election that turns things around? Because, again, you were saying that we're shifting from health care to the economy, but from the Republican side, the health care decision is the economy, because that's a tax on many Americans.</p><p>VARNEY: If the President were to say, Obamacare was a mistake, forget it. If he were to say, Dodd Frank Financial Regulation was a mistake, please forget it. If he were to say I don't want any more Government stimulus, I want tax cuts for individuals and private enterprise, I want tax reform. If he were to say things, yeah, I think things would turn around, but you know as well as I do, he's never going to say anything like that at all. This President never changes direction.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I point to the top when I woke up this morning, the top read story in the Wall Street Journal on wsj.com, was the get ready for the new investment tax and three point eight percent, additional tax on investment income for people making more than $200,000 a year, so, I think that if people are focused on not only tax cuts expiring, Washington's not doing anything about that and then what other taxes are you lumping on me, and they're very fixated on health care as a tax from here on out and the President has an even higher hurdle.</p><p>VARNEY: He's in a really tough spot of his own making. Look at the new taxes coming down the pike, because of Obamacare, and because the Supreme Court says, okay, go ahead with Obamacare, and what is it, biotech companies, taxed, medical device makers, taxed. Health insurance, taxed, a new investment, taxed. All of these taxes are going up. We will pay for them. It will squeeze people, squeeze employers to drop health care coverage and put people on to public health care.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm paying a ten percent excise tax on tanning, ten percent, that's a huge tax Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: You didn't get that tan in a salon.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, beach.</p><p>VARNEY: I could tell, there's a difference.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's why I love you more every day.</p><p>Stuart Varney, thank you so much.</p><p>VARNEY: That's all right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It was great to see you.</p><p>VARNEY &amp; COMPANY starts at 9:15 a.m. eastern time, don't miss it.</p><p>In the meantime, we'll be right back.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: The libor scandal cost Barclay's Chairman <person><nameText>Marcus Agius </nameText></person>his job, but now CEO Bob Dimon in the fight of politicians who might think this Dimon has lost its sparkle. These all threatens to hit other banks around the globe.</p><p>The heat coming down on bankers worldwide is nothing compared to the scorcher blistering parts of the U.S. triggering deadly storms.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands waking up this morning without electricity, with temperatures in some places topping 100 degrees.</p><p>The Chinese economy anything, but hot and continuing to cool down. The latest PMI reading indicates factory production and exports continue to plunge as investors wonder what happens when the world's global engine begins to stall.</p><p>And what's old is new again in Mexico where voters hand power to the political party that ruled the country for 70 years, who were swept out of office more than a decade ago, only to return on this Monday, July the 2nd, 2012.</p><p>Good morning, everybody, this is the BEST OF IMUS IN THE MORNING and coming up, you have Imus' interviews with Jay Mohr, always hilarious and Chris and Lorraine Wallace on \"Mr. Sunday Saturday Night's Chicken.\" You don't want to miss either one of those.</p><p>But right now, let's take a look at your markets around the globe. Over to Asia, first. You look at the -- really unchanged except essentially flat markets except for Australia gaining almost one percent.</p><p>Over to Europe, we've had gains all morning long, all day long, so far in 11:30, when your European markets close, but north of one percent gains in France and in Germany.</p><p>Here in the U.S., the futures have been hanging on to gains as well. And up ten points on the Dow futures, but massive gains last Friday, last week, although, it was a pretty rough quarter for the U.S. markets. And the commodities, oil and gold both down. We like to see oil fall down a buck 32 a barrel right now.</p><p>For more on Europe, let's go live to London where we're joined by James Hughes, chief market analyst for Alpari. James, what is the biggest factor driving the markets higher in Europe today?</p><p>JAMES HUGHES, ALPARI SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST: Well, I think you haven't necessarily got any positive news around these markets. I think it's almost just a rebound from some of the negativity that we've been seeing recently. And of course, we are looking just of the start of the week from after what we saw last week. It was pretty negative.</p><p>So, I think, initially, you have got the story in the U.K. which is Barclays bank, and you've got their shares jumping this morning up around three-and-a-half percent or so just on the mere fact that they have been -- they were down heavily of course last week on the back of the scandal that come out Mr. Agius, <person><nameText>Marcus Agius, </nameText></person>the chairman of Barclays' lost his job today.</p><p>So, there are those new stories which are helping to push Barclays higher, which is helping to push the financials higher which is why we're getting some of those European, and the U.K. markets higher. And the rest of the stories around Europe are a little bit more sketchy, a little bit more. Of course, you had those Eurozone unemployment numbers out today, 11.1 percent, all time high unemployment for the Eurozone, not necessarily good news but all those markets in Europe, they are managing to post a few gains just on the back of some negativity that we've had over the last couple of weeks.</p><p>MCDOWELL: How critical is that -- what the ECB information does later in the week with expected rate cut on the horizon?</p><p>HUGHES: Well, I think, I mean, it's a big, it's a big story for the week and of course, everyone is looking towards that. I mean, whether it's going to make much difference, you go back to the same stories, which we have been talking about for the last two years or so with this Eurozone and we talk about bailouts, whether they've been helping and of course, we've seen a series of bailouts and everyone tells us that's the new dawn in Europe and that's going to solve the problems and of course, nothing has solved any problems as of yet.</p><p>So, I think it's almost the same sort of thing for the right -- if we do see it. And then of course, we make the markets a little bit of a shot in the arm. Again, it's another step being taken to try and solve this issue. But, the biggest issue is that we just don't know how to solve the issue and I think that's going to go on for a long time.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Years, that's what my gut says, James, thank you so much. James Hughes, chief market analyst for Alpari, be well.</p><p>Now, for a closer look at the U.S. market. A preview of how things might shape up today. We go to our very own Lauren Simonetti live from our Newsroom. Good morning, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Good morning. The fireworks were lit early on Wall Street with stellar gains for the major averages. The Dow rocketing 277 points on Friday. June, great months too with gains of at least 3.8 percent for the three major averages.</p><p>This first trading day of July will be a busy one and an equally busy week. National manufacturing figures on tap, auto sales tomorrow and that key government jobs report for June is out on Friday.</p><p>Speaking of jobs, they're moving off of Wall Street. The trend is called near shoring, it's where the big financials tightens hire and relocates workers to cities like Salt Lake City, Utah and Jacksonville, Florida, where rent, taxes and labor all cost less.</p><p>Silicon Valley is seeing a similar exodus as the big tech giant and fine savings in other U.S. cities.</p><p>And how do you read it? \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" flying off bookstore shelves. EL James erotic novel became the nation's fastest selling paperback to reach one million sales. Nelson book scan (ph) finds that it took 11 weeks to reach that mark. That was 25 weeks faster than the previous record holder, \"The Da Vinci Code.\" Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, Lauren. Now we go to Diane Macedo in our Newsroom who is live. Hey, Diane.</p><p>MACEDO: Hey, Dagen. So, we keep talking about Barclays here, but the Chairman <person><nameText>Marcus Agius </nameText></person>has resigned in the wake of that interest rate rigging scandal. Agius has been the chairman of more than five years says, the scandal has dealt a devastating blow to Barclays reputation and that the buck stops with him. He will stay on though until a succession plan is in place. The bank was fined more than $450 million last week by British and U.S. regulators for submitting false documents on the London Interbank offered interest rate, which is the rate at which banks lend unsecured funds to each other.</p><p>Now, Barclays has admitted that some of its traders attempted to manipulate that rate to make it look like the bank's borrowing costs were lower than they actually were and that would make the bank and the industry in general look healthier than it actually is. Agius resignation is seen as an attempt to take the pressure of CEO Bob Dimon who is also facing calls to resign.</p><p>Micron technology is purchasing DRAM manufacturer. Elpida Memory for $750 million. In all Micron will pay $2.5 billion to satisfy reorganization claims by Elpida's creditors and shares of micron are higher in the pre-market.</p><p>And Germany's Linde is buying U.S. based home oxygen provider Lincare Holdings for $4.6 billion. The deal breaks down to 41.50 a share, a 22 percent premium on Lincare's closing price on Friday. Linde's main customers are in the steal and chemical sectors but it also provides gases used to process filter cells and make LCD TV's. Dagen, back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Diane. There is no shortage of laughs when this dude visits with the I-man. I'm talking about actor and comedian Jay Mohr and he is here on IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DON IMUS, HOST, \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\": Please welcome now Jay Mohr. Good morning Mr. Mohr.</p><p>JAY MOHR, ACTOR AND COMEDIAN: Hello, Mr. Imus.</p><p>IMUS: So, you remember back when you were single.</p><p>MOHR: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And you'd get drunk. There was always somebody you could call who would let you come over.</p><p>MOHR: Yes. Who was it for you?</p><p>IMUS: It doesn't make any difference but that's what I feel like with you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MOHR: I'm the guy -- I'm your late-night booty call.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, because?</p><p>MOHR: You know what? Bartlett is not wearing socks today. Call Jay Mohr.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: You want something. Here you are. Well, we're delighted to have you back.</p><p>MOHR: Thanks for having me back. I love -- I don't really ever get to talk politics until I'm here. And now, Donald -- Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: That's right.</p><p>MOHR: Connell McShane, sounds like the villain in a Spider Man comic strip. Is that your real name? Like -- for my own is Connell McShane?</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, I used it.</p><p>MOHR: Are you the lead singer of the Pogs (ph). His name is Connell McShane.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Look at this guy. He's gorgeous.</p><p>MCSHANE: Thank you.</p><p>MOHR: Where's Dagen? She's good for courtesy laughs. She's in the bathroom fixing her bangs. And who's the new girl? Diane?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MOHR: She's like a pseudo (ph) minority hire because she's a Portuguese.</p><p>IMUS: She can sing, you know.</p><p>MOHR: She could sing. Hi, Diane. There she is.</p><p>MACEDO: Hi, Jay.</p><p>MOHR: All right. On her paper work she filled out Puerto Rican.</p><p>IMUS: We had a battle of the bands last summer on this program. And her band won.</p><p>MOHR: What was the name of your band, Diane?</p><p>MACEDO: It still is. Tribeca Rhythm.</p><p>MOHR: Tribeca Rhythm. I don't know, I had nothing. I don't know.</p><p>MACEDO: Wow! I was expecting some sort of a -- there but...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: She won singing \"Rolling in the Deep,\" Adele's song. She did a pretty decent job.</p><p>MOHR: Adele just canceled her whole concert.</p><p>IMUS: What's the matter with her?</p><p>MOHR: I mean, her whole tour. I think she has panic attacks.</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>MOHR: Yes, really. Speaking from a former panic attack.</p><p>IMUS: So, why are you here? You must be promoting something.</p><p>MOHR: I'm not sure.</p><p>IMUS: You're not?</p><p>MOHR: No. They just said when you're in New York, you want to do Don Imus. I said, don't ever ask me that. Just assume and let's make it happen.</p><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p>MOHR: I have a podcast.</p><p>IMUS: Do you?</p><p>MOHR: Yes, it's on I-tunes. More stories.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Don't you have a new TV show?</p><p>MOHR: No.</p><p>IMUS: You don't?</p><p>MOHR: No, I'm here strictly for the exposure. I want my face between those -- that crawl of little league crawls and stock reports.</p><p>IMUS: The last time you were here you had that gay unmarried thing, right?</p><p>MOHR: Yes, that got canceled.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you did.</p><p>MOHR: Yes. That show's in remission.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, it is. So, I said ESPN can't fire Hank Williams, Jr. You said, of course you can.</p><p>MOHR: They can do whatever they want. They're Disney owned.</p><p>IMUS: But doesn't that offend you?</p><p>MOHR: It offends me any time someone is held up to the light for saying something. You have to be able to say it. You have to have the right to say it. But then you also have to realize when you say it, and you are the guy that really got your feet to the fire first for something that I thought was ridiculous. But they also have the right to tell you to get lost. Look, let's not -- let's call a spade a spade. Hank Williams, Jr. is such a mess that he's wearing those dark sunglasses and that steeple-done beard.</p><p>He looked like he was in the witness protection program in that whole interview. And you know, I mean, that was his big joke. It was like Hitler and Netanyahu playing golf together. He probably had like a group of people helping him pronounce Netanyahu. Do we really need to hear that? Are you ready for some football? Like, thank God that's dead.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: This hurts me. Hank is my friend, you can't do this.</p><p>MOHR: Hank's your friend?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MOHR: His father thinks he sucks. Hank Williams, Sr., every Halloween comes out of his grave and goes \"Stop Singing.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Hank Williams, Sr., he's like the Black Eyed Peas of the Williams family.</p><p>IMUS: No, this is --</p><p>MOHR: You're going to look me in the eye and say that Hank Williams, Jr. isn't horrible?</p><p>IMUS: Well, you know, my wife says the same thing.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MOHR: Your wife and I are trying to talk sense to you.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, but -- no, he makes some good records. Hank's made some good records.</p><p>MOHR: Name one.</p><p>IMUS: \"All My Rowdy Friends\" are -- that's good. \"Family Tradition.\" That is a great record.</p><p>MOHR: -- Goose stepping to ESPN right now.</p><p>IMUS: No. Well, Hank fell off a cliff, you know.</p><p>MOHR: He looks it.</p><p>IMUS: No, but I mean, but the reason --</p><p>MOHR: He looks like Evel Knievel after Snake River canyon. Holy smoke. His beard's on crooked. He's got a chin strap for his hat. This guy doesn't know what to do. He doesn't know whether he should pee are go blind.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: This is not working out the way I wanted for my friend Hank.</p><p>MOHR: Well, I think he's terrible. I'm not going to lie to the I- man.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I mean.</p><p>MOHR: What do you want me to tell you? I went to the gym earlier today.</p><p>IMUS: You look good, by the way.</p><p>MOHR: Way too many naked guys at the gym. And I'm a pervert. I look at every guy's package. I want to see what's happening out there in America.</p><p>IMUS: You do?</p><p>MOHR: I do.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MOHR: And I like, here's what you do. If you want guys go into the Jacuzzi at the gym naked which I find disgusting. If you want the Jacuzzi to yourself, just go in and sit facing the Jets.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And just sit there holding the concrete. And by the way, ladies -- because you do have a lot of ladies that watch this show mostly because they all want to have sex with Warner Wolf. Well, I said that like Bob Newhart. They wanted to have sex with Warner Wolf.</p><p>WOLF: Hey, come on, Jay.</p><p>MOHR: Let's go to the videotape!</p><p>IMUS: Are you a Jets fan?</p><p>MOHR: I love the Jets.</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>MOHR: I love them.</p><p>IMUS: And you like Ryan?</p><p>MOHR: I'm going to send Rex Ryan photos of my wife's feet because my wife has perfect feet.</p><p>IMUS: No, but I mean.</p><p>MOHR: Oscar Wilde writes about my wife's feet.</p><p>IMUS: How long have you been a Jets fan?</p><p>MOHR: I've been a Jets fan since -- this one for Warner Wolf. Klecko Abdulsalam, Marty Lions and Mark Gastineau, the Sack Exchange, 1982. I was an 11-year-old boy, sexually ambiguous and I fell in love with them. And Bruce Harper, number 42.</p><p>WOLF: Yes, little Bruce.</p><p>IMUS: When you were 11, you were...</p><p>MOHR: Little Bruce, careful there.</p><p>IMUS: ...sexually ambiguous at 11?</p><p>MOHR: Oh, yes. Always.</p><p>IMUS: Really?</p><p>MOHR: I'm in the gym facing the Jets for crying out loud. I was supposed to get a massage later today and I get more angst about going to get a massage because they say to you, lay down, the lady will say, lay down, face down, and I'll be right back. So, you lay down face down naked with your ass in the air. And like two minutes later, someone comes back into the room and you just assume it's the lady that left. For all you know it's like the fetish janitor in a batman mask and he wants to massage the backs of your knees.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: How old is your son now?</p><p>MOHR: I got a nine-year-old and we have six-month-old now who just decided to start kicking our ass on the road.</p><p>IMUS: Is it a boy?</p><p>MOHR: It's a boy. It's a masculine child. Babies cry when they have to poop. Can you imagine having to go to the bathroom so bad that you weep? That's a lot of Vicodin and Imodium and cheese. You sit on the toilet weeping. People come in from other parts of the house in their bath robes. What's going on?</p><p>IMUS: I guess you have to take a Vicodin to get that one right.</p><p>MOHR: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: The nine-year-old, is he starting to ask questions yet?</p><p>MOHR: You know, he doesn't. And it started to bother me. I thought like he should be a little more curious because I don't want his friends. He said to me, did you know if you type in \"sex\" on the computer, all crazy stuff pops up. And I said, you should type in tranny, and see, that's really weird stuff pop. But I didn't tell him that. But I told him -- I said, all right, I'm going to tell him everything how it goes.</p><p>And I told him, you know, the penis and the thing and this and that and this happens and this comes out. And it's fertilized. I told him what the vagina and the hole, every technical term exact. And we were driving to Starbucks in Santa Monica, and we get to the counter and I literally finish the explanation, and the woman gets pregnant and a baby -- she has a baby through her vaginal canal, the birth canal, and that's how it goes.</p><p>And the lady behind the counter, just like a regular-looking gal says, may I help you? And my nine-year-old goes, like Jackie Gleason suddenly is looking at a woman completely differently. I got literally just finished the whole explanation and all the things and all the parts and then a woman saying, how can I help you to my nine-year-old?</p><p>IMUS: My kid is 13. When he was nine like your son, he comes in and he says, dad, I think I discovered masturbation.</p><p>MOHR: At nine?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MOHR: That's young. He's a trailblazer.</p><p>IMUS: First of all, I said, I don't think you discovered it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's one way to end an interview. We'll have more when we come back including more news headlines, business news for you. The latest on those violent storms that struck the northeast.</p><p>Plus, FOX Business' Maria Molina will have your business travelers forecast, as this BEST OF IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right here on FOX Business.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Let's take a look at the markets around the world. Very muted movements over in Asia except for Australia which was up almost one percent. We've had gains of more than one percent in France and Germany if you want to head over to Europe.</p><p>Again, the excitement from the deal that was done last week, among European leaders to help out Spain and Italy and who knows where the country falls in coming weeks and months. The futures here in the U.S. have actually turned negative, but again, it's going to be a strange week, if you will. The markets closed early tomorrow, they're closed completely Wednesday and then we have that major jobs report on Friday.</p><p>But again, the Dow futures have turned lower down six points. And speaking of lower, oil and gold are significantly lower with oil off a buck 30 a barrel, but, we kind of like that. I have the pleasure of being joined by my neighbor.</p><p>But also, one of the co-hosts of the \"THE FIVE,\" Dana Perino, and it's great of you to be here this morning.</p><p>DANA PERINO, CO-HOST, \"THE FIVE\": I'm glad to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Let's start with health care because I...</p><p>PERINO: Well, I thought you were going to start with the dogs which is the most important, I'm kidding.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We can get at the dogs at the end.</p><p>PERINO: Health care.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We save the best for last. And so, let's get the rough stuff out of the way first.</p><p>PERINO: That's how you do it on FOX Business.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But with the health care, I was, maybe I'm foolish to be shocked, but shocked that the White House is still trying to spin this by saying that based on the health care ruling last week from the Supreme Court last that the penalty was not a tax and that the Supreme Court actually didn't come out and say that, but I don't know how you can continue to do that for the next...</p><p>PERINO: It's very disingenuous and it's very insulting to go people across America who've been paying attention to this debate and there's a lot of them. If your new best friend in Washington is going to be Chief Justice Roberts, if you're on the Left, you might-- it would be honorable to quote him accurately. What he said is you are not allowed to do it under the commerce clause, but you are allowed to do it under the tax provision, therefore this can stand, it is a tax. And to try to say anything else is foolish.</p><p>I can understand why the White House doesn't want to, they don't want to be labeled in trying to defend the largest tax increase in American history on top of the other ones that could be coming at the end of the year, but it is what it is. And trying to say otherwise, I think, makes them look foolish and it actually hurts the process going forward. If they do really want to try to reconcile and get people all on the same page, lying about it is not the way to do it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, speaking to reconcile, the talk about the Republicans and what their approach is going to be to fighting against this health care law because there's an article in the Wall Street Journal today about, that on the Senate side, you can deal with some of the budget issues in this health care law through reconciliation.</p><p>PERINO: So, the overall republican position is Obama-care should be repealed, that is what they will be running on going forward. In the meantime, there are different tactics that you can use legislatively, one of them is reconciliation, it is tough to implement, but it's conceivable that it could be done. That basically, you will get together, you only need 51 votes to strike it down. I think that with the current makeup of the Senate, to get to that point after the Supreme Court has ruled would be very difficult.</p><p>However, there might be enough constituent anger calling to members of Congress and to their senators that says, this was passed as an individual mandate. President Obama himself chastised George Stephanopoulos of ABC News to say this was absolutely not a tax. The justice -- Chief Justice Roberts has just said, it is a tax. Therefore, were you deceived Mr. Congressman, when you voted for this, you didn't know it was a tax?</p><p>Should this be re-voted? I don't know if that will -- it's interesting to see, I think the next two weeks will tell us how much that will stand, I will say that Mitt Romney over the past, in the first four hours after the ruling, raised over a million dollars from small donations of people saying, we want this bill thrown out. The only way to do it is to elect a republican president.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, the tax ruling from the Supreme Court, it does fold directly into the Romney campaign strategy of making this election about the economy. And again, like first top read story on the Wall Street Journal this morning is that there's a new investment tax coming because of the health care law on Americans making more than $200,000 a year under capital gains and on your dividends, and that does seem to fold. And if you take apart the health care law, and look at all the additional taxes that are coming, the potential drain on the economy does seem to fold into that strategy. So it doesn't necessarily become about health care versus the economy, that's on the Romney side. That it's all one, one story.</p><p>PERINO: Yes. It's all baked in the cake, you can't separate it out. I think that is a good strategy actually. I was getting very excited about some of the things that the private market could start doing if the law was rejected, fully, not just under the commerce clause, but taken out completely. The things that somewhat, that we could do, is that health insurance was allowed to be sold across state lines.</p><p>If were you were in more control of your health care, so you didn't worry about if you lost your job, if you could take it with you. And the things that you might be able to purchase with that, like, if I wanted to go a chiropractor rather than go to a regular doctor, I would be in charge of the money and I would choose if I wanted to spend that money. And I just feel kind of deflated that what, and what Romney should do, I think, is to say because of this health care bill, we are now going to keep this lead blanket on innovation and on the economy and it's not that people who needed care wouldn't have gotten care.</p><p>It's just that America can and should do a lot better when it comes to the private market and unfortunately, it just now, I think it's going to be chaos for the next six months.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Before you go, I want to show everybody, if you're not watching \"THE FIVE,\" well, you're crazy. But a photo of Dana's new puppy, Jasper, if you watch \"THE FIVE,\" you've seen this, Dana is -- we're actually neighbors and I see the dog more often, I see Jasper more often than I see you. You and your lovely husband and --</p><p>PERINO: Well, and one of our neighbors also is Katharine McPhee, star of \"Smash\" and she came back from Los Angeles last night and Peter was downstairs with Jasper walking and they got to meet and he gave her lost of kisses and tore her earring off her ear but she found him and she's in love with him too. So, we've got a good neighborhood.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's a Vizslas.</p><p>PERINO: What about yours?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, I'll show you photos of our. You've never met. That's Mabel on the left and we think she's part Rat Terrier because she'd like to -- she killed a squirrel yesterday actually. And then Ramon, who is a Puerto Rican street dog.</p><p>PERINO: They've got to meet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They've got to meet. My dogs don't have the new puppy smell, but they do smell good because they got washed yesterday.</p><p>PERINO: That's good. We love our dogs.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, we do.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO: Jasper consoled me after the Supreme Court decision.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know, what? That's where you go.</p><p>PERINO: And actually, I'm not lying.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I know you're not lying. Dana, it was great to see you.</p><p>PERINO: Nice to see you too.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much. Dana Perino, co-host of \"THE FIVE.\" Don't miss it.</p><p>Now, some of the news stories that are making headlines this morning. Utility crews working in blistering heat trying to restore power to hundreds of thousands along the northeast corridor.

The president-elect is promising Mexicans a government that is democratic, modern and open to criticism. The PRI was long accused of ruling the country through authoritarian and corrupt practices.</p><p>Now let's go to our news room and Diane Macedo has more business headlines for you this morning. Hi, Diane.</p><p>DIANE MACEDO, FOX BUSINESS: Hi, Dagen. So General Electric is selling part of its real estate division owned by GE Capital to Ever Bank Financial for $2.5 billion. The business property unit originates and services commercial real estate loans for properties owned or leased by small and mid-sized businesses.</p><p>So that's a new deal that's out. We'll continue to give you details on it as we get them in. In the meantime, shares of Amylin Pharmaceuticals are climbing in the pre-market after Bristol-Myers Squibb announced its buying the diabetes drug maker for $5.3 billion.</p><p>That breaks down to $31 a share and $9 higher than the offer that Bristol Myers reportedly made back in March and including that the whole deal is worth a total of $7 billion.</p><p>In connection with the buyout, Bristol-Myers also will enter into an alliance with British drug maker Astrazeneca to develop and commercialize Amylin's diabetes drugs.</p><p>Astrazenaco will pay Bristol $3.4 billion in that deal. Briston- Myers says its acquisition of Amyline will hurt earnings in 2012 and 2013 by 3 cents a share.</p><p>But the diabetes market is one of the pharmaceutical industry's faster growing with global sales expected to climb to $58 billion in 2018 according to evaluate so a lot of money to be made there -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Diane. Right now, we want to get a look at business travelers forecast. For that, we go to Maria Molina who is standing by in the Fox Business Weather Center. Hi, Maria.</p><p>MARIA MOLINA, FOX BUSINESS WEATHER: Good morning, Dagen. Good to see you and today we are going to be tracking more showers and storms that are possible across parts of the southeast.</p><p>Yesterday, we saw over 800 reports of severe storms -- or severe weather from some of the storms that fired up in the overnight hours.</p><p>And we still have some lingering showers associated with those same storm systems. You can see them popping up across parts of the state of Alabama and also Georgia.</p><p>But again, much quieter for today until we head into the afternoon hours and also the evening hours, when those stronger storms are up once again.</p><p>High temperatures, it's going to be another hot day, not as bad as what we saw this weekend like on Atlanta where on Saturday you hit a high temperature at 106 degrees, breaking your all-time record for the hottest temperature.</p><p>You've seen today is still warm though, 96 for your high temperature, 96 of as well in Chicago and Minneapolis well above average for this time of year at 99 degrees, factor in the humidity and of course, it's going to feel even a little bit hotter.</p><p>New England, you're a lot cooler today, Boston expecting a high temperature at 79 with some clouds and a spotty shower with a thunderstorm possible.</p><p>I'm not expecting widespread travel delays though with that precipitation in New England. It's going to be more of the hit or miss in nature activity.</p><p>New York City and Philadelphia, expecting some sunshine and another warm day in Philadelphia with a high temperature expected at 90 degrees.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Maria Molina, our meteorologist here at Fox Business.</p><p>We have some breaking news to bring you, a deal on this Monday. Dell is buying Quest Software for $2.4 billion. Quest offered software to help manage business, businesses manages their data bases, that's $28 a share, $2.4 billion.</p><p>But it was a deal that was expected, there have been some reports that this deal was in the works and coming and now, here it is. And we'll be watching Dell stock today as well as Quest.</p><p>Coming up after the break, one of the I-man's favorite business reporters Liz Macdonald would join me in the studio live.</p><p>And later the I-man's interview with Chris and Lorraine Wallace on her latest cookbook, \"Mr. Sunday's Saturday Night Chicken.\" Don't go away.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A scandal caused Barclay's Chairman <person><nameText>Marcus Agius</nameText></person>' job and put CEO Bob Diamond in the sites of politicians, expecting the Diamond lost its sparkle. Does this scandal threaten to hit other banks worldwide?</p><p>The heat coming down on bankers around the globe, but it's nothing compared to the scorcher blistering parts of the U.S. and triggering deadly storms. Millions waking up this morning without electricity and temperatures soaring over 100 in some places.</p><p>Good morning, everybody. I'm Dagen McDowell. This is \"Best of IMUS IN THE MORNING.\" Let's take a quick look at the markets around the globe before I get to some news on earnings.</p><p>You look at Asia, the markets were essentially flat there except for nice solid gains in Australia. You go over to Europe, you have gains across the board, north of 1 percent gains in Germany and in France, and well, almost 1 percent and on the DAX, given up some gains there, but all three markets there in the green, major markets.</p><p>On the U.S. futures, we have a bit of a loss on the Dow and Nasdaq futures and commodities have been in the tank all morning long. And kind of like that though. Oil is down a buck 50 a barrel, thereabouts, to $83.45.</p><p>And we are getting earnings from Acuity Brands, the maker of an electrical component. Reporting a profit of 82 cents, that beat expectations of 78 cents. Revenue of $487.5 million, it did come up short of revenue expectation for analysts of $491 million.</p><p>But here in the studio with me to talk about foreclosures on homes the state of California, Liz Macdonald, is ready to make it tougher for banks to foreclose, across every single state across this country. Will it do more harm than good do you think?</p><p>LIZ MACDONALD, FOX BUSINESS: Yes, that's the question for bankers. They're saying it could do more harm than good because it could stop the foreclosure process, stop the housing recovery, stop the clearance of the backlog and that inventory.</p><p>And so what we're seeing is California has been fighting for its own set of foreclosure rules for about the last two years and one set of rules is coming to a vote today.</p><p>And what the issue is, what they want is, basically, stop foreclosure if a borrower is in loan modification, that could be extended for a very long time and basically the borrower could strike out that process and extend the payment process without paying anything, without paying any mortgage loan payment.</p><p>So the other issue, too, California notably is basically asking voters to approve the right to sue bankers during the foreclosure process, if they break any of their new foreclosure rules.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What about the other 50 states, Liz? Is this on a state by state basis?</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And how does it fit in with that massive settlement, that foreclosure settlement, the banks?</p><p>MACDONALD: This is what's important. It's on a state by state basis. We have 25 states right now, moving ahead with their own set of foreclosure rules and basically, we didn't expect this.</p><p>And I don't think the banking industry expected it and I don't think the media saw this coming. After the $25 billion foreclosure settlement in February, basically, we thought that that was the end of it.</p><p>But no, the states are saying forget it. Let's set aside the $25 billion foreclosure settlement. That does not stop us from issuing our own foreclosure rules, basically HARP 3.0 or HAMP 3.0, which is a federal program for the states.</p><p>So, you know, the bankers are coming out in the media saying it's going to make it difficult for us and to be able to clear that inventory if they're willy-nilly sets of rules.</p><p>We get it, we want to protect borrowers, but for the bankers, I'm sure they're going to feel like they're chasing a net in a hurricane or a moth in the hurricane, try to follow these different rules.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, but do you -- again, it's the -- do you get to stay in a home when you're not making payments on a home? It's not even your home.</p><p>Yes, if you're underwater on it and if you're underwater and you have no equity in it, it's not your house and you're basically living rent- free and at what point in this country do we say, enough is enough?</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, that's the issue, too. And also with the new rules coming, back to your point, we are going to wait for the rules to kick in, right and see how the rules play out in our own state.</p><p>You know, for example, New York State is talking about criminalizing forgery if there's in a foreclosure document, called a forgery and the issue, too, is will all the bankers out there get state by state rules and if they break the rules, would they be subject to lawsuits, even if they didn't know or had access to, weren't apprised to the rules ahead of time.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What's does it do to lending?</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, you know, the FHA doesn't like it. They've criticized it and they've criticized in the past, similar standards, right, similar ideas. And saying, freeze up credit. You know?</p><p>Banks could become gun shy and separate from that the Mortgage Bankers Association say the cost of thee different rules come down in the foreclosure rules will be passed along to future borrowers.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And makes you not want to live in one of those states or trying to find a home in one of those states.</p><p>Liz, thank you so much. Good to see you. Liz Macdonald on the Fox Business Network. She will be with you all day long. Right now, we want to go to our news room and Diane Macedo who has business headlines for you. Hi, Diane.</p><p>MACEDO: Hi, Dagen. So it's official, Dell is buying Qwest Software for $2.4 billion or $28 a share. Qwest offers software to help businesses manage their data bases. Dell's offer tops the one made by a property equity group led by insight very much partners bidding on Qwest the last few months. The deal marked Dell's latest effort to expand beyond its core business of personal computers.</p><p>And Barclay's Chairman <person><nameText>Marcus Agius </nameText></person>has resigned in the wake of the bank's interest rage rigging scandal. Agius who's been chairman for more than five years says the scandal has dealt a devastating blow to Barclay's reputation and buck stops with him.</p><p>He will stay on until they find a succession plan there. The bank was fined more than $450 million last week by British and U.S. regulators for submitting false documents on the London Interbank offered interest rate or Libor, which is the rate at which banks lend unsecured funds to each other.</p><p>Barclays had admitted that some of its traders attempted to manipulate that rate to make it look like the bank's borrowing costs look lower than they actually were in an attempt to make the bank and the industry in general look healthier than it actually is.</p><p>Agius' resignation is seen as an attempt to take the pressure off CEO Bob Diamond who is also facing calls to resign. Dagen, back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much. Diane, first, it was Mr. Sunday's soups and now Lorraine and Chris Wallace rejoin the I-man to talk another cookbook, this they're talking chicken. They recently sat down to talk about recipes with the I-man.</p><p>(REPEAT INTERVIEW WITH CHRIS AND LORRAINE WALLACE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Still ahead, we have a market check and some hilarious moments from IMUS IN THE MORNING. So stick around.</p><p>ANGELA SUN, TENNIS CHANNEL: Hello. This is Angela Sun for the Tennis Channel's Wimbledon Court Report here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Some say middle Monday in Wimbledon is the greatest day of tennis all year. Every fourth round match involved the men and women's draws are scheduled. Two remain, for the men, Djokovic, Feder and Andy Murray are the top seeds remaining in the draw and for the women, Sharapova, Victoria, and (inaudible) are also alive.</p><p>Americans are well represented, as Serena Williams, Mardy Fish and qualifier Brian Baker, still on. Baker lost only two sets in six matches.</p><p>Wimbledon prime time will have all the action nightly at 5 p.m. Eastern on Tennis Channel with extended highlights and news and interviews from the grass court slams. For the Tennis Channel Wimbledon Court Report, I'm Angela Sun.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, speaking of Wimbledon in England and overseas, looking at your markets around the world. First we cross the Pacific and go to Asia. And they were essentially flat except for a nice gain in Australia.</p><p>Over to Europe in England and France and Germany, you have 1 percent plus gains in France and Germany. The futures in the U.S., a mixed bag, they were up, they were down slightly and still see an 8 point loss on the Dow. But again, it was a great day and weak last week, rough quarter for stocks. Commodities, oil and gold are both lower.</p><p>There's one thing that is for certain, there's never a shortage of laughs on IMUS IN THE MORNING. Here are some of the lighter moments from the I-man and everybody else.</p><p>(BEST OF IMUS EXTRA SEGMENTS)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and Congress are also conducting probes.</p><p>Nebraska attorney general Doug Peterson, a Republican, said at Monday's press conference that the 50 attorneys general joining together sends a 'strong message to Google'.</p><p>California and Alabama are not part of the investigation, although it does include the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. </p><p>Google is headquartered in California and employs more workers there than in any other region. Google also broke ground last year on a $600 million data-center project in Alabama.</p><p>Tara Gallegos, a spokeswoman for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, declined to confirm or deny any state investigation and would not comment on the announcement by the other states. </p><p>Mike Lewis, a spokesman for Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, also said the state's legal team had no comment on the probe.</p><p>The news conference featured a dozen Republican attorneys general plus the Democratic attorney general of Washington D.C.</p><p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, has a market value of more than $820 billion and controls so many facets of the internet that it's almost impossible to surf the web for long without running into at least one of its services. </p><p>Google's dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data.</p><p>The state officials assembled in Washington were vague about the focus and scope of the investigation, although several suggested scrutiny of the company's dominant search and advertising businesses.</p><p>Critics often point to Google's 2007 acquisition of online advertising company DoubleClick as pivotal to its advertising dominance.</p><p>Europe's antitrust regulators slapped Google with a $1.7 billion fine in March for unfairly inserting exclusivity clauses into contracts with advertisers, disadvantaging rivals in the online ad business.</p><p>One outcome antitrust regulators might explore is forcing Google to spin off search as a separate company, experts say. Regulators also could focus on areas such as Google's popular video site YouTube, an acquisition Google scored in 2006.</p><p>Google has long argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers.</p><p>'Google is one of America's top spenders on research and development, making investments that spur innovation,' wrote Kent Walker, the company's senior vice president of global affairs, in a blog post Friday . On Monday, Google referred reporters to that earlier post.</p><p>'Things that were science fiction a few years ago are now free for everyone - translating any language instantaneously, learning about objects by pointing your phone, getting an answer to pretty much any question you might have,' Walker wrote.</p><p>But federal and state regulators and policymakers are growing more concerned not just with the company's impact on ordinary internet users, but also on smaller companies striving to compete in Google's markets.</p><p>'On the one hand, you could just say, 'well Google is dominant because they're good,'' said Jen King, the director of privacy at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society. </p><p>'But at the same time, it's created an ecosystem where people's whole internet experience is mediated through Google's home page and Google's other products.'</p><p>For instance, Google's search platform is often the starting point for millions of people when they go online. </p><p>Google dwarfs other search competitors and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results. European regulators also have investigated in this area, ultimately fining Google for promoting its own shopping service. Google is appealing the fine.</p><p>Google will control 31.1 percent of global digital ad dollars in 2019, according to eMarketer estimates, crushing a distant second-place Facebook. Many smaller advertisers have argued that Google has such a stranglehold on the market that it becomes a system of whatever Google says, goes - because the alternative could be not reaching customers.</p><p>'There's definitely concern on the part of the advertisers themselves that Google wields way too much power in setting rates and favoring their own services over others,' King said.</p><p>Google's smartphone operating system, Android, is also the most widely used in the world.</p><p>European regulators have fined Google $5 billion for tactics involving Android, finding that Google forced smartphone makers to install Google apps, thereby expanding its reach. Google has since allowed more options for alternative browser and search apps to European Android phones.</p><p>The U.S. Justice Department opened a sweeping investigation of big tech companies this summer, looking at whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. The Federal Trade Commission has been conducting its own competition probe of Big Tech, as has the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-55948138</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X12-34G1-JCJY-G2JJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1077\"/><timeReceived>7:17 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Google has been on a media charm offensive lately, and recently struck a partnership with Fairfax Media, which publishers this column. Apple, meanwhile, whose Apple News product is an increasingly important distribution channel for publishers, didn't feel the need to submit anything.</p><p>In addition to News Corp's leviathan tome, there were also substantial entries from businesses it controls - online real estate portal REA Group, and pay-TV provider Foxtel.</p><p>That Murdoch forces went in hard on this issue should be no surprise. The company's executive chairman Rupert Murdoch has been leading the resistance against Google and Facebook for years. At times, it has been a lonely fight.</p><p>News Corp chief executive Robert Thomson has been equally critical. With the digital duopoly under fire for privacy breaches, failing to stem hate speech and fake news, Murdoch's stance has been vindicated.</p><p>Still, some of the claims and suggestions contained in the News Corp submission to the ACCC were...pretty interesting.</p><p>On just the second page of the document, News argues that digital platforms have reduced choice and diversity in journalism, something the platforms (and the hordes of digitally native outlets that have sprung up in recent years) would contest.</p><p>It then veers into get-off-my-lawn territory when it calls on the regulator to investigate a range of digital services, presumably because they are digital. These include Spotify and Netflix, as well as aggregation services such as Flipboard and Medium, whose impact on traditional media is marginal at best.</p><p>News says it expects \"Netflix to become a major supplier of news and journalism in the future\". For the record, Netflix has publicly declared no interest in live news, at least in the conventional sense.</p><p>One proposal from News Corp is the establishment of an Algorithm Review Board, which would analyse the effects of algorithm changes on publishers, and remove the incentives for the platforms to distribute lower quality content.</p><p>It is an interesting idea - Facebook's arbitrary changes to its secretive algorithm have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/facebook-s-algorithm-changes-cut-publishers-traffic-in-half-20180503-p4zd3e.html\">done serious damage</url> to publisher traffic. But it's also one the digital giants would fight with more fury than News Corp is throwing their way at the moment.</p><p>Some of the claims made by News and other traditional media companies will also be challenged by those digital giants, it just remains to be seen whether that happens in public or behind closed doors.</p><p>There were 57 submissions to the ACCC review in total. They were heavy on complaints, but light on solutions, highlighting the challenge facing Rod Sims.</p><p>Remember, it was independent senator Nick Xenophon (and One Nation) who secured the digital platforms inquiry as part of the deal to change cross media ownership laws.</p><p>Now, in being seized upon by a media company the centrist South Australian clashed with, the inquiry risks veering off course.</p><p>\"It is true to say we are Australia's largest creator of digital content\" News Corp's submission laments.</p><p>\"However the model remains fragile and our industry has partially lost the ability to run its businesses the way it chooses.\"</p><p>In the digital age, that's a luxury few businesses, besides the tech giants, will ever enjoy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520022889</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S7N-5DX1-JBJ7-N3Y9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"681\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Among them: the company now claims their face scanning algorithm can detect \"fear.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's notable how casually Amazon makes this announcement--in a one paragraph blog post--like any other routine software update with a few new features. The implications for human rights are staggering. Face scanning surveillance that claims to be able to detect people's emotions, inner thoughts, or intentions is an authoritarian government's dream come true. In the hands of law enforcement, such a tool could be deadly.</p><p>\"Amazon is going to get someone killed by recklessly marketing this dangerous and invasive surveillance technology to governments,\" said Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future (pronouns: she/her). \"Facial recognition already automates and exacerbates police abuse, profiling, and discrimination. Now Amazon is setting us on a path where armed government agents could make split second judgements based on a flawed algorithm's cold testimony. Innocent people could be detained, deported, or falsely imprisoned because a computer decided they looked afraid when being questioned by authorities. The dystopian surveillance state of our nightmares is being built in plain site -- by a profit-hungry corporation eager to cozy up to governments around the world.\"</p><p>It's incredible that Amazon is touting these new features for their face scanning software when the current ones don't seem to work at all. Their announcement claiming Rekognition can now smell your \"fear\" came on the same day that the ACLU revealed they had used the software to compare California lawmakers to a mugshot database -- and it incorrectly matched 1 in 5 of them with photos of criminals. The ACLU previously used Amazon Rekognition to do the same thing with members of Congress, with similar results, and the majority of those misidentified as criminals were lawmakers of color. The Orlando Police Department, one of the only departments in the country that has publicly acknowledged it was testing Amazon's facial recognition surveillance product, abandoned the program, basically saying that it wasn't workable.</p><p>Amazon's announcement comes amid growing backlash to facial recognition surveillance that has been spreading across the country. Last month Fight for the Future launched our BanFacialRecognition.com campaign, along with an interactive map showing where in the US facial recognition surveillance is being used, and also where there are local and state efforts to ban it. San Francisco, Somerville, MA, and Oakland, CA, recently became the first cities in the country to ban the technology. Berkeley, CA and Cambridge, MA are also considering bans, and bills to halt current use of the tech are moving in the Massachusetts and Michigan legislatures. In Congress, there is growing bipartisan agreement to address the issue, but it could easily stall under pressure from law enforcement and big tech.</p><p>Fight for the Future opposes attempts by the tech industry (including Amazon) and law enforcement to pressure Congress to pass an industry-friendly \"regulatory framework\" for facial recognition that would allow this dangerous technology to spread quickly with minimal restrictions intended to assuage public opposition. But we support narrower efforts to ban or restrict specifically egregious uses of this surveillance, such as a bill introduced recently to ban the use of facial recognition in public housing. For more on our position, read our op-ed in Buzzfeed News: \"Don't regulate facial recognition. Ban it.\"</p><p>Contact: Evan Greer, 508/368-3026, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org\">press@fightforthefuture.org</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6823235 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6823235</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WTN-K2Y1-DYG2-R2HK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"653\"/><timeReceived>10:17 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 14, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The announcement comes on the heels of one from IBM, who announced plans (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/6/10/21285658/ibm-facial-recognition-technology-bias-business\">https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/6/10/21285658/ibm-facial-recognition-technology-bias-business</url>) to get out of the facial recognition business entirely, and questioned whether artificial intelligence powered surveillance should be allowed at all.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Digital rights group Fight for the Future, who have led a coalition (<url normalizedValue=\"http://banfacialrecognition.com/\">http://banfacialrecognition.com/</url>) of dozens of organizations calling for an outright ban on facial recognition surveillance, issued the following statement, which can be attributed to Deputy Director Evan Greer (she/her):</p><p>\"This is nothing more than a public relations stunt from Amazon. But it's also a sign that facial recognition is increasingly politically toxic, which is a result of the incredible organizing happening on the ground right now.</p><p>Amazon knows that facial recognition software is dangerous. They know it's the perfect tool for tyranny. They know it's racist--and that in the hands of police it will simply exacerbate systemic discrimination in our criminal justice system.</p><p>The last sentence of Amazon's statement is telling. They \"stand ready to help if requested.\" They've been calling for the Federal government to \"regulate\" facial recognition, because they want their corporate lawyers to help write the legislation, to ensure that it's friendly to their surveillance capitalist business model. It's likely Congress will impose some limitations on police use of facial recognition soon. Amazon wants to pretend it was their idea all along. They'll spend the next year \"improving\" the accuracy of their facial recognition algorithms, making it even more effective as an Orwellian surveillance tool. Then they'll unleash their army of lobbyists to push for industry-friendly \"regulations\" that assuage public concern while allowing them to profit.</p><p>The reality is that facial recognition technology is too dangerous to be used at all. Like nuclear or biological weapons, it poses such a profound threat to the future of humanity that it should be banned outright. Lawmakers need to stop pandering to Big Tech companies and corrupt law enforcement agencies and do their jobs. Congress should act immediately to ban facial recognition for all surveillance purposes.\"</p><p>Fight for the Future has been leading a national campaign (<url normalizedValue=\"http://banfacialrecognition.com/\">http://banfacialrecognition.com/</url>) backed by dozens of other grassroots organizations calling for an outright ban on law enforcement and government use of facial recognition. In February, the group expanded its efforts to explicitly call for lawmakers to also ban private individuals, institutions, and corporations from using this technology in public places, for surveillance purposes, or without the subjects' knowledge and affirmative consent, such as unlocking a phone. Even seemingly innocuous uses of facial recognition, like speeding up lines or using your face as a form of payment, normalize the act of handing over sensitive biometric information and pose a serious threat to security and civil liberties.</p><p>Fight for the Future worked with Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine and other artists to lead a successful campaign (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/evangreer/stop-facial-recognition-music-festivals-concerts\">https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/evangreer/stop-facial-recognition-music-festivals-concerts</url>) to keep facial recognition technology out of US music festivals and live concerts. More than 40 of the worlds' largest festivals including Coachella, Bonnaroo, and SXSW confirmed they won't use the tech at their events. The group then worked with Students for a Sensible Drug Policy to get more than 60 prominent colleges and universities (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://banfacialrecognition.com/campus\">http://banfacialrecognition.com/campus</url>) to confirm they won't use facial recognition on campus. 150+ university faculty issued an open letter (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://onezero.medium.com/an-open-letter-from-faculty-and-staff-against-campus-facial-recognition-5ee5cf47cdc6\">https://onezero.medium.com/an-open-letter-from-faculty-and-staff-against-campus-facial-recognition-5ee5cf47cdc6</url>) echoing student demands to ban the use of face surveillance on college campuses.

While other candidates, including Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Cory Booker have previously expressed concern about face scanning and biometric surveillance, so far none have incorporated a ban on the technology into their platform.</p><p>\"The rapid spread of facial recognition surveillance is one of the most urgent threats to our basic freedom and human rights today. Every single 2020 candidate should be calling for a ban on this invasive, biased, and dangerous technology,\" said Evan Greer, deputy director of non-partisan digital rights group Fight for the Future (pronouns, she/her). \"Banning facial recognition is not a radical idea. It's common sense. Allowing government agencies to build a face scanning panopticon with no oversight or accountability is reckless and puts people in danger. There's growing bipartisan support to rein in biometric surveillance. Any 2020 candidate that wants to be taken seriously on tech and civil liberties issues needs to be calling for a ban.\"</p><p>The Sanders announcement comes amid growing backlash to facial recognition surveillance that has been spreading across the country.

Although public interest groups representing a broad spectrum of the U.S. public have agreed to key privacy principles, federal lawmakers in Congress have failed to reach bipartisan support for commonsense protections. What's noteworthy about this process is how little the public knows about it, despite how close industry lobbyists have been to the congressional deliberations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, more than a dozen grassroots organizations, representing millions of people, have launched a website that makes it easy for people to contact their federal lawmakers and demand real action from Congress for meaningful privacy protections: FightforPrivacy.co.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The website will also serve as a hub for future online days of action and other initiatives encouraging mass grassroots education and engagement on the issue of privacy in the digital age.</p><p>The endorsing organizations--which include Fight for the Future, Public Citizen, MediaJustice, Consumer Action, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, Presente.org, MPower Change, Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, Ranking Digital Rights, Media Alliance, X Lab, RootsAction, Oakland Privacy, and Coworker.org--believe that any such law must:</p><p>* Guard against discrimination. Any federal privacy law must include civil rights protections. People should not be left without protections when algorithms fueled with bias withhold housing and employment opportunities, as has been reported across several online and social platforms. We can and should aim to build a world free of racism and bias.</p><p>* Protect people's right to sue companies that violate their privacy. People should have a private right of action when companies violate their privacy. Leading public and consumer interest groups agree. So does the Attorney General of California, Xavier Becerra, who publicly asked for a private right of action for California residents given that his office would only have the resources to seriously pursue a handful of cases each year.</p><p>* Act as a floor and not a ceiling for state-level privacy protections. It was only because of state-level privacy laws that Equifax notified all users about its notorious 2017 breach that impacted nearly half of the U.S. adult population. Even if the federal law grants people the strongest protections, state legislatures are better equipped to pass new laws in response to emerging threats.</p><p>If Congress continues down its current course--behind closed doors and away from public consultation-the end result will likely be a fake bill backed by the industry that allows the worst forms of data harvesting and abuse to continue. The time for Congress to get real about privacy is now.</p><p>The following can be attributed to Evan Greer, Deputy Director of Fight for the Future:</p><p>\"It's deeply concerning how much face-time federal lawmakers are giving lobbyists as they draft a law intended to protect people from the industries that bankroll those lobbyists. For decades banks, marketers, and savvy technology companies have demanded Congress let them regulate themselves, and they've promised time and time again to protect people's confidential and sensitive information. The results of this approach have been a failure. Most people have given up on their right to privacy, a fundamental principle of a free society. It's time for lawmakers in Congress to shut out industry and welcome the public to the table--only then will we have privacy protections that matter.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Tracy Rosenberg, Exec Dir at Media Alliance and coordinator at Oakland Privacy</p><p>\"Technology moves rapidly. It's a cliche, but the reality of regulating technology is that yesterday's law is not always applicable to tomorrow's innovations. Even if the 2019-2020 Congress were able to enact an admirably comprehensive consumer privacy law, new technological capacities may require modifications in the future. States are far more capable of acting quickly and responsively than the federal government. But they are only able to do so if it is not prohibited. To give an example, federal preemption of mortgage finance regulations tied the hands of many states when the subprime mortgage crisis hit in 2007-2008. We don't know what the future holds until we get there. In 2012, we would not have realized that our light switches would be gathering our personal data. But they are. We shouldn't pretend that we can pass the one and only federal consumer privacy law today for all time\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Erin Shields, National Field Organizer at MediaJustice (formerly the Center for Media Justice):</p><p>\"Data privacy is one of the most important issues that the public and Congress will grapple with over the coming years. Companies have shown us time and time again that they cannot be trusted to respect user rights regarding personal data. Congress must act now to protect the digital civil rights of their constituents and not the interests of corporate bottom lines. Too frequently, data is collected coercively or completely devoid of informed user consent, and is then run through unaudited and unaccountable algorithms or bought and sold by data brokers. Who pays the price? Most often communities historically targeted and marginalized, those with the least resources to actualize their fundamental right to privacy. Understanding this reality, MediaJustice is committed to making sure privacy and civil rights remain linked and demanding any proposed legislative solutions center the people of color most impacted by harms and not the corporations and agencies who have caused them. This is not an issue that can be solved by sloppily cobbling together industry-approved solutions, but rather, we ask that congressional members engage critically and thoughtfully with the concepts of data privacy and be willing to offer and fight for meaningful solutions that grasp at the root of data-fueled discrimination.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to David Monahan, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood:</p><p>\"In July, the FTC gave Facebook a meek slap on the wrist, sweeping under the rug a laundry list of misdeeds, including illegal data collection from children as young as five years old. It's clear that our current regulatory framework is inadequate to protect Americans' privacy, especially of the most vulnerable: children. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act took effect in 2000 and desperately needs an update - and real enforcement. Without new policies that put kids' needs above Big Tech's thirst for data and profit, we are dooming our children to a world of commercial surveillance designed to push consumerism at the expense of wellbeing.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen:</p><p>\"No one signed up for a surveillance society in which a handful of giant corporations know our most intimate thoughts, track our every movement, control the information we receive and monitor our communications. But that's the situation in which we all increasingly find ourselves. The solution is a national minimum standard to protect our privacy and digital rights, secure our data, and restrain Big Tech's abusive and discriminatory practices. Big Tech has a different answer: A weak national standard that overrides the ability of states to adopt stronger standards and hold the tech titans accountable. Our coalition is not going to let that happen.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Linda Sherry, Director of National Priorities at Consumer Action:</p><p>\"Consumers must have control over their personal information. It's time for Congress to act on consumers' growing demands for the right to know, limit, correct and delete data that is collected about them. Lawmakers must pass a strong federal data protection law that requires companies to obtain permission before sharing personal data with others, and holds companies accountable when they abuse the consumer's trust.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6865528 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6865528</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X46-3HX1-JC11-1162-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1359\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 23, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Digital rights activists have been warning that Silicon Valley's calls to \"regulate\" facial recognition are a trap, designed to hasten the widespread adoption of this invasive and harmful technology by implementing weak regulations that assuage public concern without putting a dent in corporate profits.</p><p>\"Amazon wants to write the laws governing facial recognition to make sure they're friendly to their surveillance driven business model,\" said Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future, \"But this type of technology is uniquely dangerous. It poses a profound threat to the future of human liberty that can't be mitigated by industry-friendly regulations. We need to draw a line in the sand and ban governments from using this technology before it's too late. We know that members of Congress are currently drafting legislation related to facial recognition, and we hope they know that the public will not accept trojan horse regulations that line Jeff Bezos' pockets at the expense of all of our basic human rights.\"</p><p>Last month Fight for the Future launched our BanFacialRecognition.com campaign, along with an interactive map showing where in the US facial recognition surveillance is being used, and also where there are local and state efforts to ban it. Since then, 30+ organizations including MoveOn, Greenpeace, Daily Kos, Color of Change, and CAIR have endorsed that campaign. San Francisco, Somerville, MA, and Oakland, CA, recently became the first cities in the country to ban the technology. Berkeley, CA and Cambridge, MA are also considering bans, and bills to halt current use of the tech are moving in the Massachusetts, New York, California, and Michigan legislatures. In Congress, there is growing bipartisan agreement to address the issue, but it could easily stall under pressure from law enforcement and big tech.</p><p>Backlash to facial recognition continues to spread. This week, many of the world's largest music festivals committed to not using the technology after Fight for the Future launched a campaign backed by prominent artists including Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello. 2020 presidential hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Beto O'Rourke have both echoed the call for a federal ban on law enforcement use of facial recognition. Sweden recently banned the use of facial recognition in schools, and lawmakers in the UK are considering hitting the breaks on the tech.</p><p>Fight for the Future, which is a non-profit that does not endorse candidates for office, opposes attempts by the tech industry and law enforcement to pressure Congress to pass an industry-friendly \"regulatory framework\" for facial recognition that would allow this dangerous technology to spread quickly with minimal restrictions intended to assuage public opposition. But we support narrower efforts to ban or restrict specifically egregious uses of this surveillance, such as a bill introduced recently to ban the use of facial recognition in public housing.

While Senator Bernie Sanders -- and more than 30 major civil liberties, immigration, and public interest groups--have called for a complete federal ban on law enforcement use of controversial facial recognition surveillance technology, Senator Harris' plan appears to fall far short of that. Instead, it repeats talking points that have been pushed by law enforcement agencies and Big Tech companies like Microsoft and Amazon, calling for vague \"regulations and protections,\" which experts say would fail to address the harms inherent in facial recognition surveillance.</p><p>\"Facial recognition poses a unique threat to human liberty and basic rights -- any candidate who wants to be taken seriously on criminal justice issues should be calling for an outright ban, or at the very least a moratorium on current use of this tech. Senator Harris' plan says she will work with civil rights and technology organizations, but she already seems to be ignoring us,\" said Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future, \"There is growing consensus among public interest groups and tech experts that law enforcement must be banned from using facial recognition entirely. Industry-friendly regulations will only serve to speed up the adoption and spread of this uniquely dangerous and invasive surveillance technology.\"</p><p>Senator Harris' disappointing position comes amid growing backlash to facial recognition surveillance that has been spreading across the country. Last month Fight for the Future launched our BanFacialRecognition.com campaign, along with an interactive map showing where in the US facial recognition surveillance is being used, and also where there are local and state efforts to ban it. Since then, 30+ organizations including MoveOn, Greenpeace, Daily Kos, Color of Change, and CAIR have endorsed that campaign. San Francisco, Somerville, MA, and Oakland, CA, recently became the first cities in the country to ban the technology. Berkeley, CA and Cambridge, MA are also considering bans, and bills to halt current use of the tech are moving in the Massachusetts and Michigan legislatures. In Congress, there is growing bipartisan agreement to address the issue, but it could easily stall under pressure from law enforcement and big tech.</p><p>Fight for the Future, which is a non-profit that does not endorse candidates for office, opposes attempts by the tech industry and law enforcement to pressure Congress to pass an industry-friendly \"regulatory framework\" for facial recognition that would allow this dangerous technology to spread quickly with minimal restrictions intended to assuage public opposition. But we support narrower efforts to ban or restrict specifically egregious uses of this surveillance, such as a bill introduced recently to ban the use of facial recognition in public housing.

He later went on Hilton's show, \"The Next Revolution,\" for a congenial interview.</p><p>The antitrust movement has been revived by a bipartisan loathing of Big Tech that extends beyond lawmakers to the furthest firmaments of the right and the left.</p><p>On one side is the progressive left, whose members have been appalled by Facebook's handling of pro-Trump Russian disinformation campaigns and Silicon Valley's consolidated power. On the other side is the Trumpist right, whose members see the power of social media companies to ban content as censorship and worry that the arteries of communication are controlled by young liberals.</p><p>The common cause has made for some strange new bedfellows. The left and the right now often have similar anti-tech talking points on cable news and at congressional hearings. Conservatives are showing up at largely liberal conferences, while liberals are going on conservative TV shows.</p><p>That alignment will be evident at an antitrust hearing on Capitol Hill today featuring executives from Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple, as well as policy experts like Wu. The hearing, held by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, will examine \"the impact of market power of online platforms on innovation and entrepreneurship.\"</p><p>\"To the bewilderment of many observers, the ascendant pressures for antitrust reforms are flowing from both wings of the political spectrum,\" Daniel A. Crane, a law professor at the University of Michigan, wrote last year in a paper called \"Antitrust's Unconventional Politics.\"</p><p>Now those who have found mutual understanding need to figure out if they can actually get along.</p><p>It is not easy. Often, it is awkward.</p><p>\"I think we should be skeptical,\" said Sabeel Rahman, the president of the progressive think tank Demos and an associate law professor at Brooklyn Law School. \"What are the coalitions that we ought to embrace? Who's the we?\"</p><p>Rahman said that he was wary of these new conservative allies and that progressives in the movement needed to be cautious. Yes, they both want to take power out of the hands of large tech companies \u2014 but then the two sides have to agree on whose hands that power falls into.</p><p>\"How do we operationalize this? Who's doing the moderating? Are these new allies coming in good faith?\" Rahman asked.</p><p>\"The devil's in the details.\"</p><p>The detail here is who exactly should be in charge of a company like Facebook, if it is not Mark Zuckerberg. The two sides may both want third-party ombudsmen of some sort, but agreement seems to fall apart beyond that.</p><p>\"Most people getting involved haven't really gamed out what this means,\" said Katy Glenn Bass, the research director at the Knight First Amendment Institute, an advocacy group for free speech.</p><p>Regulation of online speech is not exclusively an antitrust concern, but today these threads are becoming interwoven. Critics argue that Big Tech companies need to be broken up or regulated because they are suppressing speech.</p><p>Bass, who is organizing a Knight Institute symposium in October on tech giants, monopoly power and public discourse, said she worried that popular enthusiasm for aggressive regulation of speech on the platforms could get out of hand. She worries that now arguments for moderating speech are coming from groups that once stood against government intervention.</p><p>\"The idea that these platforms should be pretty tightly regulated on what speech they can host is not a traditional conservative argument,\" Bass said.</p><p>\"This has all been a real whiplash.\"</p><p>A case in point: On Thursday, The Washington Post published an essay by Charlie Kirk, the president of Turning Point USA, a group for young conservatives, proposing that digital platforms be regulated the way publishers are.</p><p>\"Fighting back against private companies with governmental action is a politically and ideologically fraught idea for those of us on the right,\" he wrote. But he went on to add, \"There is now ample reason to believe the market's normal corrective powers are being blocked by anti-competitive forces.\"</p><p>Traditional conservatives said they were feeling the whiplash. James Pethokoukis, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, a pro-market think tank, was at a party this spring that included Republican donors in Washington when the conversation took a turn toward Big Tech companies.</p><p>\"They were talking about breaking them up, turning them into utilities,\" Pethokoukis said.</p><p>\"It's a breathtaking change from even a year ago.\"</p><p>He was shocked. To him these companies were American jewels and some of the best bulwarks against rising power abroad. He has since been writing against the movement with pieces like \"The Astonishingly Weak Antitrust Case Against Facebook, Google, and Amazon.\"</p><p>Tech bias has been a longtime concern for the right, and Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump's former chief strategist, frequently mentioned it. Little came of it.</p><p>Now the movement is finding more mainstream allies. Kirk and others who have complained of an anti-conservative bias by Facebook, Google and Twitter attended a social media summit at the White House on Thursday. At the event, Trump accused the companies of exhibiting \"terrible bias\" and said he was calling representatives from all of them to the White House over the next month.</p><p>On Friday, Trump took the tech companies to task again, calling them \"crooked\" and \"dishonest\" and adding that \"something is going to be done.\"</p><p>\"In my circles right now,\" Pethokoukis said, \"if you say, 'I don't think we're seeing systemic bias against conservatives,' it's like they wonder about your sanity.\"</p><p>Matt Stoller, a former Democratic congressional staff member who is now at the antimonopoly think tank Open Markets Institute, which leans liberal, said he noticed the same thing.</p><p>\"The white supremacists liked to appropriate this language around antimonopoly and free speech,\" said Stoller, who has written a book on the antimonopoly movement, \"Goliath.\"</p><p>\"But now there are real networks on the right that are not white supremacist networks, and the people in them are genuinely concerned about the power of Big Tech.\"</p><p>He said he was having to reassess his relationships with conservatives.</p><p>\"I always knew we were aiming at different things,\" he said. \"Now, we have some of the same goals.\"</p><p>And so they are building wary coalitions. Wu said he was working on a movement of state attorneys general to take the antitrust fight to individual courtrooms across the country. The most eager allies are Republicans, he said.</p><p>Hilton, a former British political adviser, built his Fox News show in 2017 around what he predicted would be an anti-elitist populism movement. The 2016 presidential election was just the start, he figured. But the rallying cries fizzled out, and party lines remained unchanged.</p><p>Today, he sees a bright spot: The shared antipathy for Big Tech companies.</p><p>\"Three years on, it looks like the only remnant of that is this antitrust issue and, if we're really specific about it, anti-Big Tech,\" Hilton said.</p><p>On Hilton's show, Wu argued for breaking up Facebook by forcing its two other popular apps \u2014 Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 to be spun off.</p><p>But Wu worried about being seen as having a friendly chat on Fox News and felt uncomfortable sharing his appearance on the show with his mostly liberal followers.</p><p>\"I didn't publicize it a great deal,\" he said.</p><p>\"I took a selfie. But then I decided not to broadcast it.\"</p><p>* Nellie Bowles covers tech and Internet culture for The New York Times.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRNDLY-149208857</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRNDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK3-2RW1-JDJN-61B0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1322\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Iran Cultural &amp;

The hearing, held by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, will examine \"the impact of market power of online platforms on innovation and entrepreneurship.\"</p><p> \"To the bewilderment of many observers, the ascendant pressures for antitrust reforms are flowing from both wings of the political spectrum,\" Daniel Crane, a law professor at the University of Michigan, wrote last year in a paper called \"Antitrust's Unconventional Politics.\"</p><p> Now those who have found mutual understanding need to figure out if they can actually get along.</p><p> It is not easy. Often, it is awkward.</p><p> \"I think we should be skeptical,\" said Sabeel Rahman, president of the progressive think tank Demos and an associate law professor at Brooklyn Law School. \"What are the coalitions that we ought to embrace? Who's the we?\"</p><p> Rahman said he is wary of these new conservative allies and that progressives in the movement need to be cautious. Yes, they both want to take power out of the hands of large tech companies \u2014 but then the two sides have to agree on whose hands that power falls into.</p><p> \"How do we operationalize this? Who's doing the moderating? Are these new allies coming in good faith?\" Rahman asked. \"The devil's in the details.\"</p><p> The detail here is who exactly should be in charge of a company like Facebook, if it is not Mark Zuckerberg. The two sides may both want third-party ombudsmen of some sort, but agreement seems to fall apart beyond that.</p><p> \"Most people getting involved haven't really gamed out what this means,\" said Katy Glenn Bass, research director at the Knight First Amendment Institute, an advocacy group for free speech.</p><p> Regulation of online speech is not exclusively an antitrust concern, but today these threads are becoming interwoven. Critics argue that big tech companies need to be broken up or regulated because they are suppressing speech.</p><p> Bass, who is organizing a Knight Institute symposium in October on tech giants, monopoly power and public discourse, said she worried that popular enthusiasm for aggressive regulation of speech on the platforms could get out of hand. She worries that now arguments for moderating speech are coming from groups that once stood against government intervention.</p><p> \"The idea that these platforms should be pretty tightly regulated on what speech they can host is not a traditional conservative argument,\" Bass said. \"This has all been a real whiplash.\"</p><p> A case in point: On Thursday, the Washington Post published an essay by Charlie Kirk, president of Turning Point USA, a group for young conservatives, proposing that digital services be regulated the way publishers are.</p><p> \"Fighting back against private companies with governmental action is a politically and ideologically fraught idea for those of us on the right,\" he wrote. But he went on to add, \"There is now ample reason to believe the market's normal corrective powers are being blocked by anti-competitive forces.\"</p><p> Traditional conservatives said they are feeling the whiplash. James Pethokoukis, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, a pro-market think tank, was at a party this spring that included Republican donors in Washington when the conversation took a turn toward big tech companies.</p><p> \"They were talking about breaking them up, turning them into utilities,\" Pethokoukis said. \"It's a breathtaking change from even a year ago.\"</p><p> He was shocked. To him these companies were American jewels and some of the best bulwarks against rising power abroad. He has since been writing against the movement with pieces like \"The Astonishingly Weak Antitrust Case Against Facebook, Google, and Amazon.\"</p><p> Tech bias has been a longtime concern for the right, and Steve Bannon, President Trump's former chief strategist, frequently mentioned it. Little came of it.</p><p> Now the movement is finding more mainstream allies. Kirk and others who have complained of an anti-conservative bias by Facebook, Google and Twitter attended a social media summit at the White House on Thursday.</p><p> At the event, Trump accused the companies of exhibiting \"terrible bias\" and said he was calling representatives from all of them to the White House over the next month.</p><p> On Friday, Trump took the tech companies to task again, calling them \"crooked\" and \"dishonest\" and adding that \"something is going to be done.\"</p><p> \"In my circles right now,\" Pethokoukis said, \"if you say, 'I don't think we're seeing systemic bias against conservatives,' it's like they wonder about your sanity.\"</p><p> Matt Stoller, a former Democratic congressional staff member who is now at the antimonopoly think tank Open Markets Institute, which leans liberal, said he noticed the same thing.</p><p> \"The white supremacists liked to appropriate this language around antimonopoly and free speech,\" said Stoller, who has written a book on the antimonopoly movement, \"Goliath.\" \"But now there are real networks on the right that are not white supremacist networks, and the people in them are genuinely concerned about the power of Big Tech.\"</p><p> He said he was having to reassess his relationships with conservatives.</p><p> \"I always knew we were aiming at different things,\" he said. \"Now, we have some of the same goals.\"</p><p> And so they are building wary coalitions. Wu said he was working on a movement of state attorneys general to take the antitrust fight to individual courtrooms across the country. The most eager allies are Republicans, he said.</p><p> Nellie Bowles is a New York Times writer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-5bcdc84aa795c71925f998246fa325456384931c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK9-3TK1-JBCN-40RM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1155\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

At the event, Mr. Trump accused the companies of exhibiting \u201cterrible bias\u201d and said he was calling representatives from all of them to the White House over the next month.</p><p>On Friday, Mr. Trump took the tech companies to task again, calling them \u201ccrooked\u201d and \u201cdishonest\u201d and adding that \u201csomething is going to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my circles right now,\u201d Mr. Pethokoukis said, \u201cif you say, \u2018I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing systemic bias against conservatives,\u2019 it\u2019s like they wonder about your sanity.\u201d </p><p>Matt Stoller, a former Democratic congressional staff member who is now at the antimonopoly think tank Open Markets Institute, which leans liberal, said he noticed the same thing. </p><p>\u201cThe white supremacists liked to appropriate this language around antimonopoly and free speech,\u201d said Mr. Stoller, who has written a book on the antimonopoly movement, \u201cGoliath.\u201d \u201cBut now there are real networks on the right that are not white supremacist networks, and the people in them are genuinely concerned about the power of Big Tech.\u201d</p><p>He said he was having to reassess his relationships with conservatives. </p><p>\u201cI always knew we were aiming at different things,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, we have some of the same goals.\u201d</p><p>And so they are building wary coalitions. Mr. Wu said he was working on a movement of state attorneys general to take the antitrust fight to individual courtrooms across the country. The most eager allies are Republicans, he said. </p><p>Mr. Hilton, a former British political adviser, built his Fox News show in 2017 around what he predicted would be an anti-elitist populism movement. The 2016 presidential election was just the start, he figured. But the rallying cries fizzled out, and party lines remained unchanged. </p><p>Today, he sees a bright spot: the shared antipathy for big tech companies. </p><p>\u201cThree years on, it looks like the only remnant of that is this antitrust issue and, if we\u2019re really specific about it, anti-Big Tech,\u201d Mr. Hilton said. </p><p>On Mr. Hilton\u2019s show, Mr. Wu argued for breaking up Facebook by forcing its two other popular apps \u2014 Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 to be spun off. </p><p>But Mr. Wu worried about being seen as having a friendly chat on Fox News and felt uncomfortable sharing his appearance on the show with his mostly liberal followers. </p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t publicize it a great deal,\u201d he said. \u201cI took a selfie. But then I decided not to broadcast it.\u201d</p><p>PHOTO: Steve Hilton, left, a conservative Fox News host, and Tim Wu, a Columbia University law professor who worked in the Obama administration, have found something in common.\u00a0 (PHOTOGRAPH BY Left, Jason Henry for The New York Times;

He was accompanied by Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade representatives, and other Australian government agency officials.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The meeting with Tencent's general counsel and other members of the company's legal team is believed to have been the first between a Western nation's electoral authorities and the immensely powerful media company.</p><p>The AEC's idea was to open the lines of communication with the social media player, recognising the platform as a potential conduit for disinformation ahead of the May 18, 2019 federal election.</p><p>\"We pointed out what we thought their obligations were under Australian electoral laws,\" AEC commissioner Tom Rogers tells The Australian.</p><p>Similar meetings took place in Silicon Valley with Twitter, Facebook and Google. But recognising WeChat's two million-plus user base in Australia, the officials knew they could not ignore the Chinese social media platform.</p><p>Tencent was \"receptive\", Rogers says, opening the way for a \"collaborative relationship\" during the 2019 campaign. It was, at least, the start of a dialogue.</p><p>University of Canberra research on WeChat news items before the election found they were biased against the Coalition. But on the whole, the 2019 poll was ruled by election officials to be free of detected foreign interference.</p><p>However, just over 12 months later, an explosion of fake news around the world and the rise of misinformation and foreign government interference across almost all the biggest social media platforms has infuriated the Morrison government, spurring a national, multi-agency response.</p><p>The problem is taking centre stage overseas in the lead-up to the US election in November, with Facebook under pressure to do more to combat extremist and fake posts, scrutiny of Twitter, and the rising influence of TikTok, a Chinese network initially made hugely popular by teenagers the world over. Australia has an eye to international developments.</p><p>It was the Australian Strategic Policy Institute's International Cyber Policy Centre that this month uncovered hundreds of thousands of tweets linked to Chinese disinformation campaigns, prompting Twitter to remove more than 170,000 \"bot\" accounts.</p><p>The discovery made global headlines as Twitter responded by publicly releasing an archive of 23,750 suspended accounts connected to Chinese state-backed -information operations. A further 150,000 haven't been released due to privacy reasons, as they are thought to be stolen or hacked legitimate accounts.</p><p>These accounts aimed to sow discord across several fronts - including propaganda against Hong Kong protesters who are portrayed repeatedly as violent and referred to as \"cockroaches\", and in linking the COVID-19 outbreak to Hong Kong or the US.</p><p>\"Eliminate the scum of Hong Kong \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 together with the virus, and return a bright tomorrow to Hong Kong,\" one tweet reads. Other tweets take aim at exiled Chinese billionaire Gui Wengui.</p><p>Tweets from official sources were also shared or \"amplified\" by the bot accounts. One, from Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, urged readers to read and retweet an article entitled \"COVID-19: Further Evidence the Virus Originated in the US\".</p><p>Twitter is banned in China, but most of the misinformation is aimed at the Chinese-speaking -diaspora, including in Australia.</p><p>Here, there are also worries that Chinese claims of Australian \"racism\" against its students and tourists are being perpetuated via WeChat.</p><p>Foreign Minister Marise Payne seized on Twitter's comprehensive take-down of state-linked accounts in a speech this month to the ANU's National -Security College, in which she accused China and Russia of spreading disinformation during the pandemic to shore up their political systems.</p><p>\"It is troubling that some countries are using the pandemic to undermine liberal democracy to promote their own more authoritarian models,\" Payne said, She also called out as disinformation China's warnings to its students and tourists not to come to Australia because of racism, accusing Beijing of sowing \"fear and division\".</p><p>Payne declared Australia would stand against the use of false information \"to foment violence and divide communities\", and would counter it with \"facts and transparency\".</p><p>Facts versus lies WeChat has an estimated 2.9 million Australian users. Australian political parties believe the platform has the potential to affect election results in up to six federal seats, which have high numbers of Chinese-Australian voters.</p><p>Researcher Osmond Chiu and Sydney local councillor Kun Huang warn WeChat is a perfect disinformation tool, given its lack of accountability and the fact that conversations on the platform occur in Mandarin.</p><p>It also enables users to connect with other WeChat accounts within a 3km radius, allowing the creation of local groups and spreading of information to users not personally known to the person posting information. \"This function has played a role in circulating rumours about coronavirus within Chinese communities by allowing the creation of geographically specific group chats,\" the pair said.</p><p>It is within this context that DFAT, Home Affairs and the Australian Communications and Media Authority are refocusing efforts towards countering propaganda, chiefly on social media. A new special unit has been created within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade - the Countering Foreign Interference Unit - located within the department's National Security and Intelligence Branch. It will work with like-minded countries across the Indo-Pacific to shine a spotlight on fake news and counter it with facts.</p><p>Its aim is to use Australian -diplomacy - which has been strengthened through the coronavirus by the nation's effective pandemic response - to call out disinformation and shame the state actors behind fake news.</p><p>DFAT's submission to an ongoing Senate inquiry into foreign interference through social media says Australia's message to perpetrators is \"their actions can and will be revealed and will generate a meaningful response\".</p><p>ANU National Security College senior adviser Katherine Mansted says a strong counter-narrative is a powerful weapon.</p><p>\"We don't need to fight lies with lies, or censor disinformation. Even just a simple step of drawing people's attention to the narratives the Chinese Communist Party puts out, and pointing to the evidence, is really effective.\" The Department of Home Affairs is also flagging \"additional responses\", warning the use of social media platforms in Australia \"that are extensions of social platforms in authoritarian states\" pose a particular problem.</p><p>It does not mention specific platforms, but WeChat and TikTok are almost certainly the top two candidates.</p><p>Its Senate submission goes on to note: \"The manipulation by foreign states of social media during Australia's electoral processes is a realistic prospect for federal, state and territory elections.</p><p>\"However, foreign state-sponsored social media campaigns can be conducted at any time in response to geopolitical developments, not just during elections.\" ASPI senior analyst Tom Uren says Australia needs to spend less on submarines and more on bolstering cyber defences and weeding out disinformation from strategic rivals, including China.</p><p>\"Internally, the Chinese Communist Party has always shaped perceptions. That's what it does - it controls the internal narrative through censorship, and also through controlling state media,\" Uren tells The Australian.</p><p>\"As it has become more and more powerful, and more of a -global presence, it sees threats to itself all over the world.\" Uren, a former Defence Department analyst, says the Hong Kong protest movement has been a prime target of China's fake news factories, because the party sees the relative freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong citizens as a threat to order on the mainland.</p><p>\"China is also being blamed for COVID-19, so they are reaching out around the globe to try and control these narratives,\" Uren says.</p><p>Western digital platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have been blighted by \"extreme idealism\", Uren says, which has held them back from making tough decisions about removing bad actors from their platforms.</p><p>The government has also tasked communications watchdog ACMA with developing a new misinformation and news quality code of practice, in a bid to reduce the impact of fake news.</p><p>The voluntary code, which is due to be completed by the end of the year, would make social media giants responsible for misinformation in the same way that most Australian media organisations are bound by self- and co-regulatory requirements for journalistic ethics and accuracy in their news and reporting.</p><p>\"This is one of the most significant issues facing consumers today,\" ACMA chair Nerida O'Loughlin tells The Australian.</p><p>\"(The tech giants) should provide greater information to their users about where news is coming from so people can make a judgment about whether or not they want to access that news, or whether they would prefer to go to another source.\"</p><p>Targeting TikTok For all the work being done to engage with, and combat, big tech as a platform for propaganda and foreign political interference, it is difficult to predict where the next battleground will emerge.</p><p>Like WeChat, TikTok - the hugely popular short video platform - is effectively a black box for Western regulators, offering none of the transparency of its US counterparts. TikTok's user base has exploded, soaring to more than 800 million active users in just three years. Embraced by teens and twenty-somethings, it allows users to create short videos and is dominated by memes, lip-synched songs and comedy skits. But the world was given a stark demonstration of its potential power as a tool of disinformation after its Gen Z user base claimed responsibility for the poor turnout at Donald Trump's political comeback rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma this month.</p><p>Teenage TikTok users and -Korean pop music fans used the platform to urge followers to register for the rally, but not show up, in posts viewed millions of times.</p><p>Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted jubilantly that Trump had been \"ROCKED by teens on TikTok\". But security analysts have serious concerns about the platform, which already heavily censors content that calls into question China's human rights policies. What havoc could it wreak to a liberal democracy by manipulating the minds and actions of its teenage users? It's a question Australian researchers are already examining, as the Morrison government considers Home Affairs advice on potential new regulatory powers targeting the Chinese platforms.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-6fbaeafab8d711eaa0f32fc44ffae8f54ac9377a4ffbfe43acccf6fd39dbb459</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:607M-4SM1-JD3N-52P7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1844\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 29, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

However, not everyone is aware of the dangers the open Internet is facing, so much so that it could even vanish before our eyes. Many do not realise the severity of what they will be sacrificing without the open Internet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The open Internet is a founding principle of the Web. It represents a digital realm, abundant with freedom and equality. Each Internet user is given the same power and opportunity to publish and access any information and content of their choice without any restrictions. Ideally, it is a platform that unites citizens, governments and committed Web companies.</p><p>The open Internet now</p><p>The past few years have seen the open Internet being subjected to threats from technology, specifically the rapid consolidation of Big Tech. This greatly undermines the idea of freedom and equality on the Internet.</p><p>Today, Big Tech companies exercise control over a myriad of sectors - search, mobile content, social networks and much of retail commerce. This makes it harder for similar but smaller players to gain a foothold in the market as it is no longer a matter of funding but rather, the digital ecosystem has simply become impenetrable.</p><p>Innovation could also be limited given the oligopolistic market. It is worrying that Big Tech accounts for less than 50 per cent of the time spent on the Internet but holds more than 75 per cent of the industry's added value, and this trend intensifies every year.</p><p>Consumers need an open Internet</p><p>This impenetrability is not just an economic issue - it significantly impacts the way we live. The founders of the Web intended for the Internet to be free of restrictions and control, contrary to what we see today. By allowing the Internet to shut itself, we have indirectly allowed our personal information to be governed by a few global firms that have the power to access and make use of it.</p><p>Since Big Tech controls many parts of the digital ecosystem, it is plagued by major conflicts of interest towards Internet users. The main problem comes from having the same company offer services to Internet users, while simultaneously selling the personal data of those very Internet users. As a result, any kind of transparency with regard to data use and the protection of consumers' privacy becomes difficult to establish. Being in this opaque model, the predominant operator will always be tempted to use the data it collects, sometimes for unethical business goals.</p><p>Managing the situation</p><p>This major conflict of interest will continue to exist if there is no further intervention. It is critical for the current digital ecosystem to be overhauled. This ensures greater transparency and protection of each Internet user's choice of how they want their data to be used. To manage these conflicts of interest, public authorities can draw inspiration from what they had successfully done in the banking sector - separating commercial from investment banking. Similarly in the digital sector, consumer services should be separated from the monetisation of those services. In this way, it would be much easier to regulate and prevent data misuse.</p><p>Fighting for an open Internet is not about defending a theoretical principle, rather, it is about trying to protect our lifestyles and individual choices in a tangible manner. There is an urgency to act immediately because only then will the Web be reopened to entrepreneurial freedom and Internet users can enjoy freedom of choice. This is the very essence of the Internet and it must be protected at all costs.</p><p> The writer is founder and CEO of Criteo </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Today, Big Tech companies exercise control over search, mobile content, social networks and much of retail commerce.

The more tech companies know about their users, the more effectively they can direct them to goods and services that they are likely to buy. The more companies know about their users, the more competitive they are in the market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Custom-tailored capitalism is what has made Google, Facebook, Amazon and others the richest companies in the world. This profit incentive has turned big tech into a competitive field of mass intelligence gathering.</p><p>The better and more comprehensive the data, the higher profits will be. But this business model \u2014 what I consider spying machines \u2014 has enormous potential to violate civil liberties. Big tech is already being used abroad to enhance the power of repressive regimes, as my work and others\u2019 has shown.</p><p>While it is not presently a direct threat to U.S. democracy, I worry that the potential for future abuses exists so long as big tech remains largely unregulated.</p><p>Big tech\u2019s spy machines</p><p>Current news is rife with examples of data abuses. In April, NBC News broke a story detailing how Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had used data gathered by the platform to support his friends and defeat his rivals.</p><p>This is not Facebook\u2019s first privacy public relations nightmare. In 2018, data firm Cambridge Analytica used a Facebook app to collect data profiles of more than 87 million people, which was later used to distribute targeted political advertising during elections.</p><p>Facebook is not alone in the data collection boom. This May, it was revealed that Snapchat employees were using the app\u2019s data to obtain location data, pictures and email addresses without users\u2019 consent. A new book by former Harvard business professor Shoshana Zuboff goes into great detail of the practices of what she calls \u201csurveillance capitalism.\u201d Zuboff writes, \u201cOnce we searched Google. Now, Google searches us.\u201d</p><p>The practice goes beyond someone\u2019s taste in music or what they purchase on Amazon. Apps created to help people through mental illness or quit smoking sell data to big tech companies. These users could be potential targets for social stigmatization or targeted advertising that exacerbates heath problems rather than solving them.</p><p>In December, the New York Times published an expos\u00e9 on what one can learn about someone using their collated data from apps and smartphones. By blending location tracking with other online behavior, researchers were able to put together a detailed portrait of the most intimate details of users\u2019 lives, such as where their children go to school or who was cheating on their diet. They could even tell which area of a nuclear power plant an individual worked in, information that is typically classified.</p><p>Because of these revelations, data that big tech collects poses a national security problem. One open-source researcher used data from Strava, a fitness app, to map U.S. military bases around the world as soldiers tracked their runs. Our devices are constantly telling companies where we are and what we are doing. That is not always a good thing.</p><p>For worst-case scenarios, look abroad</p><p>Big tech is a highly unregulated sector of the economy. Existing regulations have struggled to keep up with a rapidly innovating tech sector. In some scenarios, big tech\u2019s capabilities are being used by dictators to craft a dystopian digital reality.</p><p>Autocratic governments around the world have already begun to use emerging technology to violate human rights. China is a prime example. China integrates artificial intelligence, biometric data and online activity to track and monitor dissidents and members of ethnic minority communities, who are then sent to reeducation camps.</p><p>From my time researching the ways Russia uses these platforms to threaten democracy, I am familiar with the worst-case scenarios of big tech\u2019s capabilities. Because platforms\u2019 success is predicated on making information go viral, the most successful content can also be some of the most divisive. Russia believes that by disseminating enough false information about the most inflammatory areas of American politics, it can sow chaos in the system. Big tech is the perfect port of entry for such campaigns.</p><p>If Russian attacks on social media are combined with AI technology, information attacks could become precision-guided. Nefarious actors could gather the comprehensive profiles that surveillance capitalism has compiled over the years. Fake news would then no longer speak to issues but to individuals, appealing to what makes the user change their mind.</p><p>If a monopolistic tech company decided to fully embrace its capacity to spy on its users and leverage that data to a personal or political end, the consequences for democracy could be catastrophic. Americans got a taste of what an influence attack looks like during the 2016 presidential election. So long as big tech remains largely unregulated, future influence attacks on American elections will become only more potent.</p><p>Big tech isn\u2019t going anywhere</p><p>A surface-level solution to this privacy dilemma would be for people to decouple their online lives from these companies.</p><p>For example, DuckDuckGo is an alternative search engine that does not compile user data and promises total privacy. A new browser, Brave, has promised to pay users back for selling data to advertisers.</p><p>However, these products are nowhere near as useful for a casual internet user as Google. Simply choosing not to use Google is not that simple.</p><p>While there are many companies in question, they all hold near-monopolistic control over their corner of the market. Amazon dominates online shopping. Facebook dominates interacting with friends and causes.

The proposal would sideline the Federal Trade Commission, which has limited powers and a mixed record of holding companies to account for privacy problems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the other side, a think tank backed by Google, Amazon, Microsoft and other major tech companies proposed changes that would still give the industry broad authority to collect and use customer data. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation called for national legislation that would repeal and replace existing privacy laws with a \"common set of protections\" intended to encourage innovation while also quashing tougher state laws.</p><p>Unlike many industrialized nations, the U.S. has no overarching national law governing data collection and privacy. Instead, it has a patchwork of federal laws that protect specific types of data, such as consumer health and financial information and the personal data generated by younger children.</p><p>States have also started to pass their own tougher restrictions. A California measure set to take effect next year, for instance, will let consumers request the data collected from them and to opt out of future collection.</p><p>Calls for a national privacy law gained force after Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal last year, in which the social-media giant was forced to admit that onetime political consultants for the 2016 Trump campaign had improperly accessed the personal information of as many as 87 million users.</p><p>Continuing revelations of data missteps at Facebook and other big tech companies have bolstered a U.S. reform movement. Its advocates take heart from recent developments in Europe, which last year enacted sweeping privacy regulations that, among other things, require companies to obtain permission before collecting most data. Several U.S. senators - including Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat, and Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican - have already introduced draft privacy legislation.</p><p>\"Privacy advocates are fed up with the FTC and with Washington failing to reign in the immense power the big data giants hold,\" said Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, which helped author the reform proposal.</p><p>Their proposal would set limits on what data companies can collect and would require firms to consider correcting or deleting personal data upon request. It would also prevent companies from giving customer data to the government unless criminal investigations necessitated it.</p><p>By contrast, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation report calls for a \"grand bargain\" that would accept a national privacy law long opposed by industry. In the foundation's proposal, however, this law would establish \"baseline\" privacy protections across all industries - and would prevent states from enacting stronger measures.</p><p>\"A lot of privacy activists are entrenched in creating ever more complicated rules,\" Daniel Castro, a co-author of the foundation's report, said by email. \"The only way to simplify these rules is to rewrite them.\"</p><p>Privacy experts say the baseline protections in the foundation's proposal still leave consumers at the mercy of big corporations. For instance, its \"limited\" consumer protections would require individuals to track the companies that collect their data in order to request access or corrections, rather than shifting that burden to companies themselves, said Eric Null, senior policy counsel at the New America think tank's Open Technology Institute.</p><p>The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation proposal would also prevent individual lawsuits against companies accused of misrepresenting or misusing their data, primarily to shield corporations from legal risk. Instead, only government would be empowered to protect individual rights.</p><p>\"A federal privacy law should include the power of a private individual to bring legal action,\" said Adam Schwartz, a lawyer with the Electronic Freedom Foundation, a digital-rights advocacy group.</p><p>The foundation's plan could potentially start a conversation in Congress over repealing existing federal privacy laws, Null said, but several Democratic lawmakers strongly oppose that.</p><p>\"We should build upon - not dismantle - existing safeguards,\" said Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, in an emailed statement from his office.</p><p>Chris Hoofnagle, another privacy researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, called the foundation offer \"laughable,\" noting that it falls short of the voluntary privacy commitments companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon have already made.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEATTM-810bd0881ad311e9acc7d865467ed3aa</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SEATTM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V86-SK31-DY2P-400X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"827\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Seattle Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 18, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

How should investors who bet on Trump or Biden behave?</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">   ALEX REICHMUTH</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Donald Trump (74) against Joe Biden (77) - it's like fire and ice. Here the incumbent with his fiery temperament, unpredictable, loved or hated. There the challenger, with a serene coolness, standing for orderly circumstances, widely appreciated. It is not yet known who can win the White House over. Trump is clearly trailing Biden in the polls at present. But there are still seventy days to go before the elections - a long time in which a lot can happen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The last four years in Trump's power have been good years for the economy, at least until the beginning of the Corona crisis. Trump reduced the corporate tax rate from 34 to 21 percent and cleared the forest of regulations that had become increasingly dense under his predecessor Barack Obama. The years were marked by economic growth and rising share prices: Since Trump's inauguration, the Dow Jones index has risen by well over a third (despite Corona) and the S&amp;P 500 index by as much as half.</p><p>That's why Trump is actually the favorite of the economy and the stock market. Because Joe Biden has announced that he wants to partially reverse the tax cuts and restore more state influence, especially in the health care sector and in the financial industry. He also wants to strengthen the requirements for investment banks.</p><p>The US bank Goldman Sachs calculated that a complete victory for the Democrats, i.e. including a victory in Congress, would result in an average decline of 12 percent in the profits of S&amp;P 500 companies. \"Strong stock markets You want to see them go down? Then vote for the radical left with its big tax increases,\" Donald Trump tweeted in response to Biden's election platform.</p><p>Trade war and nastiness</p><p>But Trump was not only a blessing for the economy and stock markets. His presidency was also marked by hatefulness towards Europe and the trade war with China. The uncertainties that resulted were poison for stock prices. Accordingly, J. P. Morgan even classified a Biden victory as \"neutral to slightly positive\" for the stock market. The US bank expects a more diplomatic and less erratic policy from Biden in the White House than from Trump.</p><p>It is interesting to note that historically, stock markets have actually performed better under Democratic presidents than under Republican ones. This is the result of an analysis by the Schroders investment company that goes back to 1933. According to this, the S&amp;P 500 index rose by an average of 10.2 percent in real terms each year during Democratic presidencies, while Republican presidencies only rose by 6.9 percent (see chart).</p><p>Nevertheless: Donald Trump is controversial, but he is the stock market favourite. This view is shared by Martin L\u00fcck, chief investment strategist for Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Eastern Europe at asset manager Blackrock. \"Because the capital markets are pragmatic and appreciate tax cuts or the dismantling of regulations such as environmental standards. \"</p><p>The financial markets have also learned to emancipate themselves to some extent from the unpredictability of Trump's policies, such as the escalation of tensions with China or the threatening gestures against Russia, said L\u00fcck. \"Therefore, I believe that the markets are not going to take every word from Trump.\" Joe Biden, on the other hand, is likely to create more uncertainty for markets. Biden himself has rather moderate views on economic policy. \"But among the Democrats as a whole, calls to break up technology companies are popular,\" says Martin L\u00fcck. \"This could put pressure on Biden within the party to move in that direction. \"</p><p>Matthias Jenzer, CEO of the asset management company Quilvest Switzerland, also believes that a confirmation of the incumbent should boost the stock markets. \"If a Trump re-election comes as a surprise, given the current pre-election results, the stock market will certainly be given a strong boost Sectors such as energy and technology would be among the biggest winners. After all, \"Biden's agenda is less equity-friendly, at least in the immediate future. We expect a small correction in the markets if Biden is elected</p><p>David Goodman, equity analyst at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, believes that a Biden administration would regulate the energy and automotive sectors more strictly. In addition, the US would reaffirm its commitment to the Paris climate agreement. \"This would likely create headwinds for the energy sector and related industries such as engineering.\" Financial firms could also suffer from increased regulation, and Biden could also gain more control over large technology companies, Goodman said.</p><p>Daniel Kalt, Chief Economist Switzerland at UBS, takes a similar view. In the short term, however, he says it is less important who wins the election than whether the US has the political capacity to act and to address the numerous problem areas. \"In this respect, a high degree of uncertainty for the markets in the event of an extremely close election and a possible legal dispute about the outcome would probably be the worst scenario,\" says Kalt.</p><p>Decision also in Congress</p><p>Observers point out that on 3rd November not only the president will be chosen but also general elections will be held. All members of the House of Representatives and 35 senators will be newly elected. The impact of the elections on the economy and the stock markets will depend very much on whether a party not only provides the president but can also determine in Congress (parliament).</p><p>In the view of Daniel Kalt of UBS, a clear election victory, for whichever party, is preferable: \"Clear relations with a congress in which one of the two parties dominates both chambers would eliminate uncertainty most quickly in the short term\" David Goodman, on the other hand, sees advantages if no party can march through. \"The most market-friendly outcome in the short term could be a split rule,\" he points out, \"either the status quo or a Biden presidency with a Republican-controlled Senate.\" That's how different the estimates are.</p><p>Trump thinned out the forest in line with the regulations of his predecessor.</p><p>Who is better for the stock market: Democrats or Republicans?</p><p>MISCELLANEOUS * Investors who expect TRUMP to win should consider these US sectors * Investors who expect BIDEN to win should consider these US sectors</p><p>Classic oil and energy business, fracking industry Trump is likely to continue to dispense with strict environmental regulations.</p><p>Financial industry Could benefit from further deregulation by the Trump administration.</p><p>Technology The Democrats want Big Tech to be smashed.

He, too, finds the mass collection of personal data invasive.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But as the longtime owner of Fremont Flowers, Lorenz said California lawmakers' antidote to those concerns could be toxic for small retailers like him.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> A year ago, the Legislature passed the California Consumer Privacy Act, the most sweeping law of its kind in the nation, with lightning speed. The law's requirements are significant \u2014 consumers can tell businesses not to sell their data or demand that they delete the information altogether.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Lorenz said people assume the law will affect only big tech firms, but it will apply to his flower shop as well. He handles more than 50,000 web visitors and store transactions per year, which makes his business subject to the law's requirements. Lorenz said he may have to hire a data analyst so he can comply.</p><p> \"I'm a company with 15 employees or fewer, and I don't have that resource,\" said Lorenz, who has owned his East Bay store for 35 years. \"It's going to cost a good deal of money. To put it on the backs of small business, it's just very burdensome.\"</p><p> When the law passed, nearly everyone agreed it would need clarification before it takes effect Jan. 1, 2020.</p><p> But with lawmakers close to the end of their session in September, privacy proponents and industry groups have yet to agree on any major changes. That has left many small business owners struggling to understand how to prepare.</p><p> Backers of the bill say they've held the line against attempts to weaken the new law. They claimed victory last month when a series of largely business-driven bills to amend it failed or were watered down in the state Senate Judiciary Committee.</p><p> The outcome was a relief to Alastair Mactaggart, a wealthy San Francisco housing developer who pushed legislators to approve the law in 2018 \u2014 and threatened to go to the voters if they didn't. He thinks the business-backed bills were tabled because lawmakers understand public sentiment is on the side of privacy rights.</p><p> \"I don't think in this state you want to be perceived as caving to industry,\" Mactaggart said. \"No legislator in California wants that to be something they can get tagged with.\"</p><p> The Legislature passed the law, AB375, after Mactaggart spent more than $3 million collecting signatures to get a privacy initiative on the 2018 ballot. He agreed to withdraw his measure after the law passed.</p><p> Mactaggart concedes that the law has a lower threshold than his initiative, which would have applied to companies that sell the information of at least 100,000 customers in a year. But he said fears that it will greatly affect mom-and-pop stores or websites are misplaced.</p><p> Many details of how the law will be enforced will be contained in regulations drawn up by state Attorney General Xavier Becerra's office. Mactaggart expects those rules will make clear that the law doesn't apply to small businesses handling one-time transactions if they don't sell or reuse the customer's data.</p><p>Becerra's office, which declined to discuss the details of the regulations, has until July 1, 2020, to adopt the rules. While the law takes effect Jan. 1, enforcement won't start until six months later.</p><p> The law applies to any company that meets at least one of three thresholds: it receives $25 million in annual revenue, collects the data of 50,000 people in a year, or makes half its money by selling personal data to third parties.</p><p> Under the new law, the companies must start telling people what data they collect. At consumers' request, companies must delete their data, provide access to their information or stop selling it.</p><p> Tech behemoths such as Google and Facebook probably won't have to change their business practices as much as small retailers. That's because California's law is similar to a European Union privacy law that took effect last year, which covered U.S. companies that do business there.</p><p> Rachel Michelin, president of the California Retailers Association, said the way legislators hurriedly pushed the state law through \u2014 from drafting to passage, the process took less than a week \u2014 left many details murky.</p><p> \"For my members in particular, it's the uncertainty,\" Michelin said. \"They want to know the boxes that they have to operate within, and I don't think those lines are straight right now.\"</p><p> One of the industry groups pushing hardest to change the law is the powerful California Chamber of Commerce, which represents businesses of all sizes, from big corporations to corner retailers.</p><p> \"Folks want to go after those big tech companies, and that's really what this law was written to do,\" said Sarah Boot, a lobbyist for the chamber. \"But that seems to be blinding people to the ramifications of what all these other types of businesses are going to face.\"</p><p> She said business groups are grappling with how to adjust before lawmakers return from their recess in mid-August. Bills could still be revived before the Legislature ends its session for the year in September.</p><p> One of the most controversial bills, AB873, would have limited what's considered personal information under the law by excluding more types of information that isn't linked to an individual. The current law broadly defines personal information to include data \"capable of being associated with\" a person or household.</p><p> Industry groups say they fear that definition could force retailers to find and delete data they don't necessarily associate with individuals, such as security-camera footage and website traffic.</p><p> The bill, by Assemblywoman Jacqui Irwin, D-Thousand Oaks (Ventura County), would have excluded data that cannot \"reasonably\" be linked to an individual. But some privacy advocates said it would weaken the law because companies can easily link such data to individuals with a bit of effort, and the bill failed in the Senate committee.</p><p> Backers of the privacy law were also intent on killing AB1416, which would have allowed businesses to ignore customers' requests to delete data if the firms provide the information to a government entity or sell it to another company for fraud-detection purposes.</p><p> The bill was withdrawn from the Senate committee by its sponsor, Assemblyman Ken Cooley, D-Rancho Cordova (Sacramento County), after Senate legal analysts concluded it \"would dramatically erode the rights of consumers\" under the law.</p><p> Government and business groups argued that the privacy act could make it harder to find family members of foster children, let people know they have an infectious disease or track down people who don't pay taxes or child support.</p><p> But privacy advocates said the bill would give businesses a blanket excuse to evade the law. They emphasize that the law already contains a broad exemption allowing companies to respond to government inquiries, as well as court subpoenas and summons.</p><p> Tracy Rosenberg, co-coordinator of the group Oakland Privacy, said AB1416 would have created a more Orwellian\" state by allowing corporations to keep any data they want for any government program without consumers' consent.</p><p> \"The business lobby is extremely powerful,\" she said. \"They were united in wanting to significantly water down (the law). And on the whole, they were unsuccessful.\"</p><p> Business groups did succeed in advancing a handful of smaller clarifying bills. One such measure, AB1564, would free smaller online companies from having to provide a toll-free number for submission of privacy requests. That was a priority for small-website owners such as Aileen Luib, a blogger who writes about fashion and lifestyle and lives in Moreno Valley (Riverside County).</p><p> She runs the site herself, but says that if AB1564 doesn't pass, she will probably have to hire someone to field calls to a toll-free line. The bill has cleared the Assembly and is awaiting a Senate vote.</p><p> Legislators \"don't realize that the cost of compliance is so high that it's actually going to drive small businesses out of the competition,\" Luib said.</p><p> Business groups aren't the only ones that have failed to persuade the Legislature to make major changes to the privacy law. Bills backed by consumer advocates that would have gone further \u2014 including one that would have required companies to ask customers to opt in before their personal information could be shared \u2014 were shelved earlier in the session.</p><p> Assemblywoman Buffy Wicks, D-Oakland, who sponsored the measure creating the opt-in rule, said the law as it stands is \"logistically very difficult\" for consumers because they must tell every company that has their information that they don't want it sold.</p><p> \"It kind of seems like nobody was happy with the deal last year,\" she said. \"We're going to keep pushing forward very aggressively.\"</p><p> Dustin Gardiner is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. Amazon started as an online bookseller, but now it not only sells nearly everything. It owns a wide range of companies, including Whole Foods. It's created streaming services, developed facial recognition and surveillance technologies and sold cloud computing services to the CIA. Bezos, the richest man in the world, owns The Washington Post and is developing technology for space travel. A new documentary titled \"Amazon Empire: The Rise And Reign Of Jeff Bezos\" will premiere on PBS next Tuesday as part of \"Frontline,\" the investigative documentary series.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                Our guest is the film's director and correspondent, James Jacoby, who worked with producers Anya Bourg and Megan Robertson. The documentary investigates how Amazon has disrupted and transformed nearly every aspect of our lives and has come under scrutiny for its tactics and expanding power. Terry spoke with James Jacoby yesterday, and as you'll hear, she has a cold. Here's her interview.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TERRY GROSS:                 James Jacoby, welcome to FRESH AIR.             </p><p>JAMES JACOBY:                 Thank you so much.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 So let's start with - how big is Amazon?             </p><p>JAMES JACOBY:                 It's very big. It's a trillion-dollar company, and it's a company that really extends in a lot of different directions. And so it's not just the online e-commerce company that a lot of us interact with on a very regular basis. It's also the largest cloud computing company in the world. It has a - does about a third of the cloud computing, which means the sort of digital infrastructure of the Internet and storing and managing the data of millions of companies out there and governments and academic institutions. It's a streaming service. It's a big Hollywood producer. It owns Whole Foods. The reach of Amazon in many different directions is tremendous. And it's certainly - by, you know, the market standards, it's one of the largest companies in the world.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 So Jeff Bezos started his career at a hedge fund. Why did he look to the Web?             </p><p>JAMES JACOBY:                 Well, he started his career at D. E. Shaw, which was a hedge fund in New York, a rather secretive hedge fund started by a computer scientist named David Shaw. And Shaw was one of the first traders on Wall Street that used data and algorithmic trading. And Jeff Bezos was recently - rather recently out of Princeton, had studied computer science and engineering. And he - Shaw had taken on a lot of people like Bezos, who were real QuantMinds, and applying that type of scientific mind to Wall Street trading.             </p><p>                And he had tasked Bezos at the time with looking into new major business opportunities, including - this is the mid-'90s - including looking at the World Wide Web, the Internet, which was in its nascent stages at that point, at least for commercial purposes. And Bezos recognized this startling statistic, which is - essentially, it was growing at 2,300% a year. And as he puts it in his own words, he says, you know, that things only grow at that rate in Petri dishes. It's really something you rarely see. And he saw an opportunity there that this was going to be the next big thing and that he needed to figure out a way in. And his way in was selling books online.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 Yeah, why was it books? Bezos never intended Amazon to be just a bookstore, so why did he start with books?             </p><p>JAMES JACOBY:                 There's a number of reasons why he started with books. First of all, books are easy to ship. They don't really get hurt in shipping. And he also realized that in the online world, there would be an advantage that no single bookstore could hold all of the books in print. But if you had an online bookstore, you could basically get any book to a customer. You'd have to just source it, find it and get it to a customer. He also, I think, saw an opportunity to learn about customers through what they read. He recognized very early on the power of data kind of to predict what people would want. So in many ways, you are what you read. And you could glean a lot about a customer from what he or she reads.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 Amazon lost money for a really long time. Was it 20 years?             </p><p>JAMES JACOBY:                 Yeah, it was about 20 years. I don't have the exact number, but it was - for roughly 20 years, Amazon was losing money. It was unprofitable. Yeah.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 But that didn't stop people from investing in it, and it didn't stop Jeff Bezos from building his empire. What was his strategy, realizing that he was going to give up making profits in order to gain market share?             </p><p>JAMES JACOBY:                 Yeah, he had - Jeff Bezos really came at Wall Street and investors with a big idea pitch at the time. And he spelled it out, actually, in 1997 with the company's first shareholder letter, where he basically lays out a vision that he still cites to this day, which is that we're not going to really pay attention to the vicissitudes of the market. We're not going to pay attention too much to our share price or to Wall Street reactions. What - really, what we want is to play a very long game, which, as we know, is not necessarily the Wall Street game. Wall Street's interested in quarterly earnings, and Wall Street investors can be rather fickle if you have a bad quarter.             </p><p>                He wasn't going to play that game. He was going to say, come along with me. I have a plan to basically gain market share in this burgeoning economy online. Part of that means I'm going to have to reinvest every single dollar back into building infrastructure, digital infrastructure, keeping prices low. And that - if I stick to that strategy, the nature of this new marketplace is that I will win, and you should come along with me. And Wall Street - it wasn't always an easy ride with Wall Street. But investors really did stick with him and obviously have been very handsomely rewarded over the years.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 One of the reasons why Bezos was able to undersell his competitors was that, you know, on the Web, you didn't have to pay sales tax. So how much of an edge did that give him, and how did he use it?             </p><p>JAMES JACOBY:                 Well, Bezos was using an advantage that any new online business had at that point. He just did so very skillfully, which was that online businesses were not subjected to sales tax in the states. And they had a sort of exemption, which was in order to sort of grow this nascent industry online. They had this advantage. So in any given state, it could be that you go and buy a book or you go and buy a kayak, and it's six or seven percent cheaper than it would be in a physical store. And at the time, there were a lot of mom and pop retailers on Main Street or even retailers like Wal-Mart that had a physical presence that were - that had a disadvantage when it came to what Amazon was doing. They had a six or seven percent advantage over physical stores, and they - that was a very important part of an early strategy to what they called get big fast.             </p><p>                There was this very early idea that Bezos had, which was that the Internet economy was going to be a land grab, and they had to get big fast. And one of their advantages that they needed to really exploit from early on was the sales tax advantage and be very careful about not opening up in states or having a physical presence in states that charge sales tax. So they strategically set up their warehouses in places - states that didn't charge it but would be across the border from a state that did charge it. So they were really strategic about keeping that advantage for as long as they could.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 So books was the first area Bezos expanded into, and he demanded concessions from publishers whose books he was selling through Amazon. So part of what the publishers were up against is that Amazon basically said, if you don't comply - that Amazon was going to lead customers to cheaper price vendors. And also that - publishers were concerned that Amazon was not only selling their books. Amazon was competing with them. So describe both of those predicaments.             </p><p>JAMES JACOBY:                 One of Bezos' genius moves was to make Amazon into a platform or a marketplace. So there's Amazon the store, which sells you anything from books to electronics, but then he realized - he always had this vision of creating the everything store or the place where people could buy everything. But he couldn't stock all that himself in his store, so he said, all right, well, I'm going to create a platform or a marketplace for other businesses to come sell on amazon.com who had all sorts of goods that he himself didn't stock.             </p><p>                So essentially, he owns the platform but also has a store that exists on the platform, that is competing against all the other stores, which is now really the focus of what regulators and anti-trust enforcers are looking at, which is - is it really fair to both own the platform and have all the data that comes with it and the knowledge and be competing with all the other businesses on the platform that you own? And that's really the rub when it comes to Amazon's online business.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 Amazon has always been about, in part, collecting data. And is the data collection so as to better sell to customers, or does Bezos want to use the data for other things, too?             </p><p>JAMES JACOBY:                 The company says that all of the data that it collects is in order to serve customers, and I think the jury's still out on that. And there's certainly businesses that will tell you that Amazon has used the data that they gather on their business and how they're doing business on Amazon to then undercut them in certain ways. If you make a widget that you're selling on Amazon and it's doing really well, the widget-maker will often say, well, Amazon then went straight to our manufacturer in China and started manufacturing our widget itself, and then there goes our business.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 Let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is James Jacoby. He's the director and the correspondent for Frontline's two-hour documentary \"Amazon Empire: The Rise And Reign Of Jeff Bezos.\" It premieres Tuesday, February 18 on public television. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF NOAM WIESENBERG'S \"DAVKA\")                </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is James Jacoby. He's the director of and correspondent for a new Frontline documentary called \"Amazon Empire: The Rise And Reign Of Jeff Bezos.\" It premieres Tuesday on public television.             </p><p>                So one of the biggest drivers of Amazon's growth was Amazon Prime. You pay Amazon an annual fee, and you get free two-day shipping for many, but not all goods that you could order on Amazon. So how did Prime become such a big driver of Amazon's growth?             </p><p>JAMES JACOBY:                 Well, it's the idea of a membership program, which isn't new. But what Bezos was promising in those early days was pretty outrageous. A lot of people internally thought it was kind of a crazy idea to - you know, shipping is expensive, and it takes a huge logistical, complicated logistical operation to pull off the idea of two-day, three-day shipping in those days. I mean, this wasn't that long ago, but now we expect things same day. But a few years ago, you know, the idea of two-day shipping was almost ludicrous and that it would be free.             </p><p>                So Bezos came up with this idea that as long as you could get something quickly - this is what customers want - then they'd be willing to pay this fee for it. And the idea was to keep them loyal to Amazon, to get them into the Amazon ecosystem, that this would truly be the place where you would buy everything. And so you offer the customer a great incentive to stay there and to make it your go-to shopping destination online, as they put it.             </p><p>                And so it was kind of this ingenious move, but it was also wildly expensive for the company because the logistical operations they had to build out were enormous and would take sort of military grade precision in order to deliver on this promise. And part of the reason why Amazon is such a trusted brand in the United States is because they actually do deliver on promises and are incredibly competent in what they do. But it was - it set into motion this huge internal build out, and it's been, you know, wildly popular. I should mention, there's now 150 million Prime numbers, which is just a mind-boggling number.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 Once Bezos developed Amazon Prime, he had to open fulfillment centers, warehouses around the country in order to fulfill the two-day delivery promise. So that created a lot of jobs, but there were complaints from a lot of employees - and you go into this in the documentary - complaints about the working conditions and the speed at which they were expected to work and the constant monitoring of employees to make sure that they were working and working to capacity all the time. So tell us about some of the complaints you heard from employees.             </p><p>JAMES JACOBY:                 Yeah, well, we spoke to dozens of current and former employees in the reporting process. And the nature of the work has changed a bit over the years. When Bezos was first building out these fulfillment centers all over the country in order to deliver on the promise of delivering packages quickly, it was almost ad hoc. It was - they were growing so quickly. And there were a lot of complaints at the time about things like heat stress. I mean, there wouldn't be the proper air conditioning in these warehouses, and people would be working like crazy to try to meet these quotas to get the packages out. People would be fainting in these warehouses. There would be injuries.             </p><p>                Over time, the warehouses become much more systematized and in part because of the automation of the warehouses and buying a robot company that helped to automate things. But one thing that hasn't changed in talking to workers, both current and former, is the pace of work is incredibly grueling. You have to make rates. And something we heard from, I'd say, almost every single worker we spoke to was about the rates, that, you know, the rates were really high. They have a way of kind of setting the rates for the whole warehouse that, you know, if you don't make that rate, then you can get a write-up, and if you get three write-ups, then you can be fired. There's a lot of anxiety in these warehouses about making rates. And essentially...             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 And what is the rate measuring?             </p><p>JAMES JACOBY:                 The rate essentially measures how quickly you pick and pack items. So there's a conveyor belt, and you're picking an item off the conveyor belts or off of kind of a shelf, a very high-tech shelf, and then you're packing it in a box. And so you're measured on that rate and keeping up with that rate. And those rates fluctuate. And the company will say that the rates are reasonable, but a lot of the workers we spoke to say that they're not.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 So, you know, we're talking about the difficult working conditions at a lot of the Amazon fulfillment centers. What Amazon says is, like, look - we raised the pay scale for workers. Workers are getting paid $15 an hour now, which is twice minimum wage or just about twice minimum wage. And Amazon says that's going to - you know, that's going to raise the rates for workers at other places, too. What do workers have to say about that?             </p><p>JAMES JACOBY:                 Workers aren't necessarily complaining about the wages. They're not complaining about the fact that Amazon offers really good medical benefits to their employees. And it's something that Amazon is very quick to point out and rightfully so, that they have raised wages in their warehouses. They understand that these $15 an hour is not a great wage, but it's better - it's twice as good basically than the federal minimum wage. But I think it's really interesting right now.             </p><p>                I mean, Jay Carney, who's the former spokesman for President Obama and is now a senior vice president at Amazon, kind of their - Bezos' top spokesperson just had an op-ed in The New York Times recently about saying that they are this industry leader. And even Bernie Sanders called him up and said, look - you know, we applaud you for raising your wages to $15 an hour. That op-ed was written in anticipation of a scathing letter from a bunch of Democratic senators about working conditions. But it - Carney does raise a really important point, which is that Amazon has created more jobs than any other private employer in the country over the past decade and that they are an industry leader in paying these higher wages and that they do give benefits and that, in the absence of government doing anything about raising the minimum wage, they feel like they're filling the void here.             </p><p>                The counterargument to that would come from people, you know - for instance, from the unions - who would say, well, in a unionized environment, we'd be able to negotiate even higher wages that may be a living wage in certain parts of the country. So there's a debate about the wages, but that's not - the wages aren't really the main complaint of workers, nor are the benefits. It's more about the nature of the work, and that there really isn't - a lot of workers will tell you there's not really an opportunity to move up in the organization, to get out of these jobs, and they're so grueling, and the turnover is so high.             </p><p>                Interestingly, Amazon has kind of taken that complaint to heart, to some degree, that these are sort of these jobs that are kind of go-nowhere jobs. And they've taken it upon themselves to come up with this $700 million upskilling program, where they're essentially paying tuition for, I think, about 100,000 employees to go to college or to go to vocational schools to try to get better jobs. And that also is an interesting model going forward. But it does raise questions about whether that's something that we want to rely on a private company to do or something that government should be doing.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 But the bottom line question still is, is it a manageable job?             </p><p>JAMES JACOBY:                 Well...             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 Were they pushing people beyond rates that they could actually do?             </p><p>JAMES JACOBY:                 That's the right question to ask, and I think a lot of workers will tell you no, it's not a manageable job to stay in for a very long time. And the more cynical view of the raising the wages to $15 an hour is that unemployment's rather low right now. So it's a tougher market for Amazon to find employees that want to take these grueling jobs, so market conditions forced them to raise the wages; it wasn't necessarily something that they did out of the goodness of their hearts, as an industry leader. It's market conditions that dictated it. Back when unemployment was high, you didn't see them raising wages. So that's what a lot of labor economists will point out to you about this decision to raise it to $15 an hour.             </p><p>DAVE DAVIES:                 We're listening to the interview Terry recorded yesterday with James Jacoby, the correspondent and director of the PBS Frontline documentary \"Amazon Empire: The Rise And Reign Of Jeff Bezos.\" It premieres Tuesday. After a short break, they'll talk about what Amazon didn't disclose when it released Echo and Alexa, the company's listening device and program and why Jeff Bezos has shifted his attention to space exploration. Also, rock critic Ken Tucker will review the new album from singer-songwriter John Moreland. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF CHICK COREA'S \"WORK\")                </p><p>DAVE DAVIES:                 This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross, who's home with a cold. Let's get back to the interview she recorded yesterday with James Jacoby about the new PBS Frontline documentary \"Amazon Empire: The Rise And Reign Of Jeff Bezos.\" Jacoby is the film's director and correspondent. It premieres Tuesday. The documentary investigates how Amazon has disrupted and transformed nearly every aspect of our lives and has come under scrutiny for its tactics and expanding power.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 Let's talk about Alexa. You know, Alexa is the Amazon device that you can talk to and give instructions to. And it can play you something. It can turn something on in your house if it speaks to Alexa, you know if it's on Bluetooth. But Alexa not only listens when you ask it to do something, it's listening to other things, too. And this has become a big concern. So tell us more about Alexa as a listening device and how is what it hears is being used.             </p><p>JAMES JACOBY:                 So Amazon takes issue with describing Alexa as a listening device, but I think that that basically is what it is in that - so there's a distinction to be made. Alexa is the artificial intelligence of Amazon. It's the voice that you are speaking to. The little devices are called an Echo, or they can be embedded in cars now or hotel rooms or even in showers. They've got Alexa - what they call Alexa-enabled devices, and there - it's now compatible, Alexa, the system is compatible with over 100,000 devices, I think.             </p><p>                Basically, what's going on is that with the thing in your home, the Echo device, if the microphone is on that Alexa is on, and you say Alexa, she wakes up because she's listening for that word, and then you see the blue light come on. And essentially, after she's awake, she's listening and she's recording. And she's recording so that the artificial intelligence can get smarter. So they use that data that she records in order to make Alexa smarter. So, for instance, you know, if you have a type of accent, accented English, and she's not really understanding what you're saying, what command you're giving her or what question you're asking her, there may be a team of human beings that are listening to that recording to try to understand and train her better to respond to those commands are questions.             </p><p>                This was not clearly disclosed to consumers, that there are teams of thousands of people around the world that are listening to the recordings, once she's awake, once that blue light is on, trying to train her better. Now, these are anonymized to some degree, these recordings, and not all recordings are listened to by human beings. But it's a rather jarring thing for people that have these devices to realize that, oh, wow, one, she's actually recording when she's awake and I'm talking to her, and, two, there's a chance that a human being is actually listening, annotating and transcribing what I'm talking about.             </p><p>                And we had an interesting exchange in - that's featured in the film with this guy named Robert Frederick. He's one of the founders of Amazon Web Services, their cloud computing company. And he talked about the fact that he approaches his Alexa with caution. He'll - when he wants to have a private moment in his house - he has an Alexa device; he has several - he'll press the button that disables the microphone because he doesn't want to even risk it that somehow she's triggered, she wakes up, and she records a private moment. And he doesn't want those - he doesn't - he wants to eliminate the chance that any sort of private moment could be listened to by another human being, which I think is fair and reasonable.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 So, you know, you talk about in your documentary how Amazon wants to have the entire environment miked. So what other devices has it created or purchased to mike or video our world, your world?             </p><p>JAMES JACOBY:                 So one purchase that Amazon made recently was this company called Ring, and Ring makes these doorbell cameras. That was their first main device. And so you may see them these days, and essentially, it's a doorbell that has a camera on it. And in part, Amazon liked the idea of it because package theft is a big deal for the company, that a lot of people get packages to their door and then someone's stealing that package. So now you can watch your front step. You know, of course, if the camera's watching the front step, it's also watching the public space on the street as well, which is somewhat problematic.             </p><p>                But - so there's this - now this whole suite of Ring devices or Ring cameras and not just to monitor the outside of your home, but also the inside of your home. And there was a recent hack of indoor Ring cameras, which was rather frightful, where all of a sudden there's - you know, we show it in the documentary. There's a little girl in her room, and her parents had installed a Ring camera in that room, and all of a sudden there's a voice coming from the camera that's basically terrorizing her as she's alone in her room. And, you know, she's a young girl. And, you know, we feature this moment.             </p><p>                It was a hack, and this actually - this hack happened all around the country. And it was a rather embarrassing moment for Amazon, certainly, because here they are saying that these cameras are introduced to make your home more secure, but here's an invasion of privacy that's rather frightening.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 So is Amazon trying to do anything to prevent further hacks?             </p><p>JAMES JACOBY:                 Yes, absolutely. I mean, the company, I think, has tried to investigate what the nature of that hack was. And the executives we spoke to about it say that they're - you know, they're putting new features in. It's - you know, that's one thing, which is to address the actual security of these devices. And we generally do have an issue with the Internet of things - that not all of these devices are secure, not everybody sets them up properly, not everybody is instructed to set them up properly.             </p><p>                But the larger issue at hand here is that, in some ways, these devices are being sold as a way to enhance your safety and security, but people aren't necessarily taking into account what they're introducing to their homes, the risks attendant with putting cameras that are connected to networks in their homes and on their doorsteps.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is James Jacoby. He's the director of and correspondent for the new Frontline documentary, \"Amazon Empire: The Rise And Reign Of Jeff Bezos,\" which premieres Tuesday on PBS. We'll be right back after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ALLEN TOUSSAINT'S \"EGYPTIAN FANTASY\")                </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is James Jacoby. He's the director of and correspondent for Frontline's new two-hour documentary, \"Amazon Empire: The Rise And Reign Of Jeff Bezos,\" which premieres Tuesday on public television.             </p><p>                I want to ask you if Amazon is being regulated at all as a monopoly, but I don't even know what to call Amazon. It's not an old-fashioned monopoly. It's the kind of entity that has never existed before. But what are the efforts to consider regulating Amazon?             </p><p>JAMES JACOBY:                 Well, there's a rather robust investigation going on right now in Congress, bipartisan investigation in the subcommittee, antitrust subcommittee, run by David Cicilline. He's a Rhode Island congressman who - where they're really gathering testimony - one, on what it's like for businesses, large and small, to do business with Amazon in the online marketplace, but about their data gathering. They've held hearings about their Web services and what it's like for companies to do business with their Web services.             </p><p>                So there's a big information gathering process going on right now in Congress as to, like, what is Amazon, how do they do business? - asking the company questions that it hasn't been asked before - and to try to come up with some way to figure out how to regulate it. And at the same time, the Federal Trade Commission, which has kind of been tasked with enforcing our antitrust laws, they're in the midst of a reexamination of the fact that in their history, they've never brought an action against any of the major tech companies.             </p><p>                And they're in the midst of saying, OK, well, what are we going to do? We need to figure out how we enforce antitrust laws with companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google, which are distinctly different in some ways than some of the monopolies of the past.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 You know, when it comes to a government possibly regulating Amazon, there's a couple of questions that enter into the story. One is, like, should it regulate? You know, should government regulate Amazon, and if so, what aspects of it? But there's also the question, is President Trump trying to interfere with Amazon for retribution because Bezos owns The Washington Post, and Trump hates The Washington Post and considers it fake news, and considers The Post a publication that's out to get Trump? So what do you see happening with President Trump and his allies and Amazon?             </p><p>JAMES JACOBY:                 Well, Amazon right now is challenging the fact that they lost this $10 billion contract. They were passed over for it, and it was given to Microsoft. And their challenge is saying that President Trump essentially corrupted the process because he doesn't like Bezos. And he's made it clear that he doesn't like Bezos in Tweets and elsewhere because Bezos owns The Washington Post. It's one of the craziest wrinkles in the whole story, which is that, you know, Bezos bought The Post well before Trump became president or was a candidate for president.             </p><p>                But Bezos' ownership of The Washington Post has made him a target for the president's ire. And so it'll be interesting if, for instance, the Federal Trade Commission, which is independent from the president - but still, he appointed the chairman there - whether they take an enforcement action against Amazon, and that in some way that could be construed as a political act. I would urge caution about that. I think that the FTC would probably take that independently.             </p><p>                But just the mere fact that that could be insinuated because the president doesn't like Bezos makes for a really interesting time right now when it comes to this. And what's also interesting is that the president raises some valid points about Amazon, you know. And so I think that for some of the critics of Amazon, it's a very strange thing that their criticisms are echoed by President Trump, because those aren't necessarily natural bedfellows.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 Do you think any of the Democratic candidates have interesting proposals for regulating Amazon?             </p><p>JAMES JACOBY:                 Yes. I mean, I think Elizabeth Warren has really been at the forefront of thinking through what to do with Amazon and the other big tech companies. And really, I mean, before she was even running for president really did open up a conversation about the concentration of power, especially monopoly power, among the big tech companies. And, I mean, she's come up, as she does, with a very detailed proposal. But she's also made a big deal of the idea of break them up, which can mean a lot of different things. Essentially, what break them up really means, though, is that - to try to limit the lines of business that Amazon can engage in.             </p><p>                So, for instance, Amazon is this platform for online commerce that they themselves are competing on as a store against other stores and retailers. So she has this idea of, maybe they shouldn't be competing on a platform that they own. Maybe they shouldn't be allowed to be doing that because they have an unfair advantage. That's in part what break them up means. And so I think it's certainly something that Congress is going to be considering. And I, you know, I think some of the other candidates have been supportive of that idea, of breaking them up.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 Amazon owns so many companies. Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post. Amazon has contracted with the CIA for cloud computing services. They're selling facial recognition services to police departments. I mean, Amazon is involved with just about everything. And Bezos' big goal is to get into outer space. So let's talk about that for a second. What are his plans?             </p><p>JAMES JACOBY:                 When it comes to Jeff Bezos, he's got two CEOs that are running Amazon. And he has stepped away a bit from the company - I mean, he's helping to expand it into India and other places. But as we understand it, his primary goal is to focus on his company, Blue Origin. And Blue Origin is his space exploration company. It's his rocket ship company. And essentially, it's the fulfillment of something that has been his lifelong goal and plan, which is to, as he puts it, build the infrastructure to go to space and to it make cost-effective for us to figure out what to do in space.             </p><p>                And he claims - and I think he's genuine in believing this - that he wants to save planet Earth. And his whole idea is that he doesn't - he wants there to be dynamism and growth. He believes in capitalism. He believes in consumerism. He believes that all of these advancements of energy usage and things that we're doing here are for the better, but obviously, they're hurting the planet, and that we're going to need to look to the heavens, essentially, to figure out how we can continue to live in a world of dynamism and growth. And that, in Jeff Bezos' mind, means we may need to move heavy industry into space. We may need to mine other planets or planetary objects for their resources, or we may need to actually build space colonies. And he is really serious about this.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 Well, it's a complicated vision because - do we want outer space to be owned by a private company?             </p><p>JAMES JACOBY:                 Yeah, I think that that's complicated. I think that there are other - obviously, other very wealthy people that have their space endeavors have similar things in mind. The way that Bezos thinks about it is - he's going to spend a billion dollars of his own fortune every year, pump it into Blue Origin, this company. And by the way, Blue Origin is also seeking out a lot of federal contracts to try to do this, to send satellites up - contracts with the intelligence community, contracts with the Department of Defense, contracts with the - with NASA because even the richest person in the world can't fund this himself. He needs the help of the federal government.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 Did you change your mind about anything pertaining to Amazon or Bezos through the course of doing the documentary?             </p><p>JAMES JACOBY:                 Yeah, I mean, certainly. It's - in the course of reporting this for the past year with my partner, Anya Bourg, and Megan Robertson, who went through every shred of footage of Jeff Bezos over the years to try to kind of see what he was saying as the company was growing - I mean, you can't help but be absolutely astounded by what he's done. I think, though, one of the things that - it just felt for the past year of - like, OK, on one hand, it's amazing, because we're all enjoying these inventions. You know, PBS runs on Amazon Web Services, right? And I am actually - I am a Prime member, you know? So you're dealing with all these conflicts as you go along.             </p><p>                But I think that Franklin Foer in the film puts it best, which is, like, everything that's amazing or awesome about Jeff Bezos and Amazon is also something to be feared about Amazon and Jeff Bezos. And that really - at the end of the day, you know, I think what I was surprised by was just how complicated this is - you know, the nature of the power that comes with being such an innovator and such an inventor but also how problematic that is that so much power is pooled into the hands of one company and one man.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 James Jacoby, thank you so much for talking with us.             </p><p>JAMES JACOBY:                 Thank you.             </p><p>DAVE DAVIES:                 James Jacoby spoke with Terry Gross yesterday.

There is one hour left for Scotland to decide its future. Voters are being asked to answer yes or no to this question: \"Should Scotland be an independent country?\"</p><p>Max Foster is live for us tonight from inside the Royal Highland Centre near Edinburgh. That is where the final results will be announced. Max? What are you seeing?</p><p>MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, they've got one of the local counts here, so the Edinburgh count will be here, and they've got these tables out and these big boxes in the middle of them, so they're going to dump those votes in there, and then they literally start by hand going through each one.</p><p>It's an exciting moment for Scotland, a big moment for Scotland, because it's such a big question, should Scotland be an independent country? We'll get the result, we think -- it's all guesswork at the moment -- in around ten hours' time.</p><p>And I think it will go up to the wire, because you've got these big population centers, like Glasgow, North Lanarkshire, and Edinburgh, which are all reporting at the end, and that's where the bulk of the population is. So, we'll wait to see what comes out of that.</p><p>But earlier on, we've got some interesting results as well coming out, so we'll bring that to you over the course of the next ten hours. I think we'll get the first sort of results sort of coming in about four or five hours. So, a big day for Scotland. A date with destiny, Poppy.</p><p>HARLOW: Absolutely. And of course, Max, the question is the turnout. There's a lot that the media is not allowed to talk about on the day when people are heading to the polls, but in terms of what you've seen in terms of turnout?</p><p>FOSTER: Well, we're relying on anecdotal evidence, really, from the polling stations, and certainly, all the anecdotal evidence seems to suggest that a lot more voters have come out than they would for a general election or a national election here in Scotland. So it does look as though the population's been fully engaged with this debate, which has been going on for two years.</p><p>Some concern about the weather, Poppy. Well, this is the UK, and Scotland in particular, and there's been some fog out on the outskirts of the outer isles, and there's some concern that they won't be able to get the planes that they need into the airs to bring those ballot boxes in. May have to rely on boats instead. So, that might slow things down a bit.</p><p>But so far, things look OK. There haven't been any reports of major problems at any of the polling stations, so we're looking forward to getting the vote in in less than 12 hours, and it will be announced here in the hall next to me.</p><p>HARLOW: And of course, we will bring you those results live on CNN when we have them. Max Foster, thank you, we appreciate the reporting.</p><p>Meantime, another huge story we are tracking. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba expected to announce pricing for its shares at any moment. We are expecting to see prices in the range of $66 to $68 per share. Could be a lot higher. That would make this the biggest IPO of all time.</p><p>It has been variously described as the Amazon, the eBay, the PayPal, a combination of them, of China. And it's had huge success there while Western companies have struggled to gain a foothold. Investors are hoping for a fairy tale return. Instead of getting three wishes, though, they face three key hazards. These are important to point out.</p><p>First, a complex ownership structure. Jack Ma and a select inner circle will retain control of decision-making at this company. Investors are not actually investing in Alibaba. Instead, they are buying into a contract to share in Alibaba profits. That is actually registered in the Cayman Islands.</p><p>Also, that structure is driven by Chinese law, of course, which prohibits foreign investment in strategic sectors of the Chinese economy. So, how will this be deemed? And investors have faced transparency concerns with Chinese companies in the past.</p><p>And unlike many IPOs, some of those earliest investors, they will be able to sell their shares on the first day of trading. That typical lock- up period, which is often in place, is not in place here, and it's designed to prevent investors from flooding the market and damaging the share price.</p><p>Let's talk a lot more about this. Very, very big day. Joining me now, Martin McNulty is CEO of the digital marketing agency Forward3D. Samuel Burke is our business correspondent. Gentlemen, thank you both for being here.</p><p>Martin, let me begin with you. You call this \"Competition against the business we never thought we'd see competition again.\" You're talking about Amazon.</p><p>MARTIN MCNULTY, CEO, FORWARD3D: Yes, absolutely. I think in Alibaba, you've got a credible threat to Amazon, eBay, and even dare I say, Google?</p><p>HARLOW: Samuel points out three very important pitfalls: mobile, social, and their international recognition and exposure.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, so on the mobile front, yes, a lot of people use Alibaba to buy things on their mobile phones in China. But they're really lacking a mobile messaging platform, and as we saw with the purchase of WhatsApp by Facebook, that's very important.</p><p>They do have a mobile messenger, but it has not done very well compared to Tencent's WeChat, which has hundreds and millions of people on the social front. They don't have a social networking platform, and many people think that platforms like Pinterest, buying things based on what your friends recommend, could be very important to e-commerce moving forward, and the international strategy.</p><p>Clearly, they've made a lot of revenue inside of China, but if you try and buy something from Alibaba here in the United States particularly at a consumer level, you see barely any to no footprint.</p><p>HARLOW: What do you think about that, Martin? There is this name recognition issue in the West, and you're going up against a formidable competitor like Amazon.</p><p>MCNULTY: Well, I wouldn't agree with that analysis at all. I think what consumers are experiencing when they look at Alibaba at the moment is a business-to-business service. It's not a business-to-consumer services.</p><p>So, if you look at the power of Alibaba today, quarter upon quarter of colossal profits. Compare that to an Amazon absolutely paper-thin profits, and you have to look long and hard to find a profitable quarter, I don't think they're terribly well-equipped to whether a storm of really aggressive price-matching, for instance.</p><p>Or Alibaba courting some of the sectors that they're not particularly strong in, for instance, luxury. And there's clear evidence that they're doing that. So, I think they are a genuinely credible threat to Amazon.</p><p>HARLOW: Let's talk about that. You point out the numbers: Alibaba, $2 billion profit alone in the last quarter. You have mentioned how they can have the ability to price undercut so many of their competitors, going after one specific thing, whether it's luxury, whether as you brought up before, a PlayStation 4, for example, and get it so cheap that they're just going to dominate.</p><p>MCNULTY: Yes, absolutely. I think Amazon has done two things very well. They've demonstrated utility through a great web service and through a great product range, and they've been aggressive on prices. You'd expect most businesses at some point to want to claw back that margin. Amazon do not have that luxury now, because I think that's exactly where Alibaba will go after them.</p><p>HARLOW: Samuel, in terms of any potential rocky IPO, public offering here. Obviously, following what happened with Facebook and the NASDAQ, this is going to be on the New York Stock Exchange, but some people are saying, should we be concerned? Is there any reason to think that because one big tech IPO went that way, this one will?</p><p>BURKE: Well, they have the luxury of coming after Facebook And for instance, their price point, this between $66, $68, a lot of people were saying that that would -- they're just trying to stay shy of that $70. They don't want to fall into maybe a little bit of the greed track, which we saw Facebook have at the beginning. So, I think they do have the benefit of being second in line after Facebook.</p><p>HARLOW: Quickly before we go, Martin, what do you think it's going to price at?</p><p>MCNULTY: What do I think it's going to price at? Absolutely no idea. I would never call that one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HARLOW: All right, we'll be watching very closely. Thank you both for joining us this evening. We appreciate it.</p><p>MCNULTY: Thank you.</p><p>HARLOW: We have breaking news just coming into us here at CNN. Oracle CEO <person><nameText>Larry Ellison </nameText></person>is stepping down from the company, a company really synonymous with his name. He will be replaced by Mark Hurd and Safra Cat. He has become the company's CTO and executive chairman.</p><p>All right. This comes on the day that the Dow hit an all-time record high. The S&amp;P 500 also a record high. What a market. Alison Kosik is here. What is driving it?</p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, today, it was more about the residual effect of the Fed's decision to not raise interest rates --</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>KOSIK: -- too soon, so you were seeing sort of that cheering effect. As you said, we see the Dow having its 17th record high of the year. The S&amp;P 500 its 23rd record high today --</p><p>HARLOW: Wow!</p><p>KOSIK: -- we can't forget about the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>HARLOW: Wow. Talk to us about Alibaba. We're still waiting for the pricing news.</p><p>KOSIK: We are waiting. And he says, we don't know where it's going to go.</p><p>HARLOW: I've seen some projections, $80, $100.</p><p>KOSIK: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: We know the price range is $66 to $68.</p><p>KOSIK: It really is astounding to think about. If shares are going to go for $68 a share, it means that Alibaba's market value is going to be somewhat around $170 billion, making it the 23rd most valuable company just behind Intel, but bigger than Amazon. It just is -- it's just amazing to just watch and see how it goes.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes, and we're going to be watching. You're standing by as we --</p><p>KOSIK: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: -- wait for the pricing to come out sometime this hour.</p><p>KOSIK: Exactly.</p><p>HARLOW: Alison Kosik, thank you.</p><p>KOSIK: Sure.</p><p>HARLOW: We appreciate it. Anders Borg says he is through with politics. Even though his party was voted out in Sweden, he does still see a way for ward for center-right politics in Europe. My interview with the former finance minister is next.</p><p>HARLOW: As we just told you before the break, breaking news into CNN. Oracle CEO <person><nameText>Larry Ellison </nameText></person>is stepping down. He's going to be replaced by pretty common names in tech, Mark Hurd and Safra Cat. He will stay with the company, though. He's going to be the CTO and the executive chairman.</p><p>You think -- but let's bring in our Paul La Monica. He's managing editor over at CNN Money. You think of Oracle, you think of <person><nameText>Larry Ellison. </nameText></person>Any idea why this timing?</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN MONEY MANAGING EDITOR: This is very shocking to me. Oracle's going to be reporting their earnings or have reported their earnings this afternoon as well, so strangely, the timing there.</p><p>But I hadn't heard anything to suggest that Ellison was going to back from the company in any way. As you mentioned, he is the company.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>LA MONICA: There's a slew of executives who have been at Oracle for many years then subsequently left. People like the guy who started Salesforce.com, and --</p><p>HARLOW: Sure.</p><p>LA MONICA: -- and PeopleSoft and others, Siebel, that there was always this perception that you never were going to get the CEO job at Oracle because Ellison was never going to relinquish it.</p><p>HARLOW: So, it sounds like he's bringing in these two big names to replace his job. Do we know if Mark Hurd, Safra Cat are going to have equal position?</p><p>LA MONICA: They have already been operating as kind of this co- president model. So, I do find it very curious that Ellison and the board decided to promote both of them rather than make a choice. Hurd obviously has CEO experience. He was at HP, resigned --</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>LA MONICA: -- in a bit of a scandal there.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>LA MONICA: But then, Oracle scooped him up pretty quickly. With Safra Cat, she's been a loyal lieutenant at Oracle for years and is widely respected on Wall Street, had been the CFO at one point. So I think this is just a reflection that obviously Ellison has a lot of faith in here, and I guess didn't want to maybe risk her leaving if she didn't get the job and they just gave it to Hurd.</p><p>HARLOW: But why, was there talk about them giving it just to Hurd? I guess there was no talk about this, it's all happening --</p><p>LA MONICA: I know, this is literally just happened, yes.</p><p>HARLOW: You could have seen a trajectory where she would have just gotten the role, no?</p><p>LA MONICA: It's possible, and I think a lot of people assumed that if there was ever some sort of accident or act of God if you will, before Hurd joined, she was the obvious person to replace Ellison.</p><p>Once they brought in Hurd, that's when things got murky and you had to wonder, OK, they're both kind of this co-number two, which one would eventually get promoted?</p><p>HARLOW: Sure.</p><p>LA MONICA: But we didn't -- no one ever thought Ellison was going to step down.</p><p>HARLOW: OK, what about strategy-wise for Oracle? What needs to happen in the next phase of life for Oracle under new leadership?</p><p>LA MONICA: I don't really think there's going to be that much difference. I suspect that with Ellison saying as the CTO, they're going to continue to emphasize this shift into the Cloud that most business software companies are doing.</p><p>When they brought in Hurd, obviously, there was also a lot of expectations about what they might do on the hardware side --</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>LA MONICA: -- because of his experience with HP. Oracle had just purchased Sun Microsystems, which had a big server component. Also some software as well. So, I'm not so sure this is going to be a dramatic change in strategy.</p><p>HARLOW: But do look out for the hardware side of it, possibly.</p><p>LA MONICA: It's possible, but again, this is really shocking.</p><p>HARLOW: What a week in tech. What a day!</p><p>LA MONICA: I know. And the co-CEO model doesn't always work.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>LA MONICA: BlackBerry had co-CEOs for a long time, and BlackBerry has not been that great of a company.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes, we will see what happens. Paul La Monica on the big news for us this evening.</p><p>LA MONICA: Thank you.</p><p>HARLOW: Thank you, we appreciate it.</p><p>France's president says he can't be expected to push through economic reforms faster than Germany did. Hollande's approval ratings are plummeting due to worries over the French economy. The French government has denied reports widely speculated that Moody's is planning to downgrade France's sovereign credit rating. Hollande says that economic reforms simply cannot be rushed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>FRANCOIS HOLLANDE, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF FRANCE (through translator): Don't ask us to do it in five years.

We French are very good, but we can't do twice as fast and twice as good as the Germans.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Looking at the European markets, now, stocks finished higher during Thursday's trading. The London FTSE 100 was up more than 0.5 percent. Germany's DAX shot up nearly 1.5 percent. One worry for investors, banks have been slow to embrace the ECB's new lending scheme, taking up just about half of the anticipated funds offered so far.</p><p>In Sweden, a Social Democrat leader has been invited to form a new government. That is after Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt was voted out in last week's election.</p><p>The country's now former finance minster, Anders Borg, says the road ahead looks very rough for Sweden. As one of the key players in Europe's response to the financial crisis, I asked him today, looking back, would he do anything differently?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDERS BORG, FORMER SWEDISH FINANCE MINISTER: I would be very supportive of an expansion under monetary policy. I think if you have a crisis with some debt components, an expansion under monetary policy is extremely important, and it might have been that the ECB could have done more earlier.</p><p>On the other hand, I think it's always difficult in dealing with circumstances with a lot of uncertainty. So, basically, I would be very supportive of what Draghi had done, and maybe he could have stepped on the gas pedal somewhat earlier.</p><p>HARLOW: Looking back, of course, we know more than when we were in the situation, but looking at how everything stands now, do you think that the lack of take-ups for the TLTROs will force the ECB into more drastic action? And if so, frankly, what more do they have in their war chest? What more can be done?</p><p>BORG: Well, I basically think that they have quite a lot of dry powder left. And what they need to do is provide liquidity and also longer-term liquidity to create an environment where the growth is coming back in the economy.</p><p>But that's only half of the story. You probably also need some more fundamental structural reforms in key states like France and Italy to get this to work.</p><p>HARLOW: You said recently -- and this got a lot of headlines -- that the road ahead for Sweden does not look good. Obviously, you're not going to be in your position anymore, your party is leaving. When you look at the new left-leaning government there just elected, why do you think that the road ahead does not look good?</p><p>BORG: Well, there's a lot of political uncertainty here, and we've seen that some of our neighbor countries that have gotten into a political gridlock has also lost quite a lot of competitiveness. So, there is a high degree of political uncertainty, there is not a clear majority in parliament.</p><p>And given that they are implementing some reforms that are going to decrease the flexibility of the labor market, that's a long-term issue here, I think.</p><p>HARLOW: Let me ask you this: your party's defeat is seen as a hit to fellow conservative leaders like UK prime minister David Cameron, German chancellor Angela Merkel. How do you view the broader implications of this across Europe?</p><p>BORG: Well, the fact that we have done quite a lot of long-term growth reforms and still wasn't able to convince the voters to vote for us, I think to some extent is problematic. But I do also think that we weren't able to reload our reforms program with enough strength.</p><p>So, it's always difficult to be reelected a third time, and I still think that there is a kind of a main road forward for the center-right parties in Europe, structural reforms and fiscal responsibility is two key areas.</p><p>HARLOW: What are you going to do next? You've said no more politics. So, what is it going to be?</p><p>BORG: Well, I will have to make up my mind in a few weeks about that. I have a background in central banking and investment banking, so something in that neighborhood in Sweden or elsewhere is likely to become the answer.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HARLOW: Maybe he will go Wall Street, we will be watching. Anders Borg there, thank you for that.</p><p>Six years ago this week, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, yet to date, not a single criminal charge has been filed against any bank executive involved in the ensuing meltdown. US attorney general Eric Holder admitted his frustration about that in a speech in New York on Wednesday.</p><p>He also added that investigations are open right now regarding the conduct of individuals at several Wall Street firms. Holder said he expects to bring charges in the coming months. While he did not indicate the targets, reports say he was likely referring to manipulation in the currency markets.</p><p>Protecting the public from financial fraud has been a priority for my next guest. Bart Chilton is a former commissioner of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. He joins us from London, where he just gave a speech and is focusing on creating a framework for transparency, frankly, in the global markets. Thank you for being here, sir. Appreciate it.</p><p>BART CHILTON, FORMER CTFC COMMISSIONER: Good to be with you, Poppy.</p><p>HARLOW: Let's talk first about this speech that you gave to a group of Treasurers Conference. You said that \"the financial system is somewhat better protected.\" You also clearly stated there are still institutions that are too big too fail. How can that be after all of the changes? What needs to happen now?</p><p>CHILTON: Well, we've seen both the regulators in the US and the regulators here in the EU have said that these living wills -- that is, what happens if one of these mega institutions goes under -- are still -- still need to be tweaked. They still need to do some more to ensure that their balance books will be OK, and that it doesn't have some ripple effect on the economy like we saw in 2008.</p><p>So, they're working through that, but it's a good thing they're working through that. But overall, to answer your question about whether or not we're safer, there's certainly improvements. There are capital and margin requirements on these trades that before some of the regulation were dark markets.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>CHILTON: So, there's something has been done, but there's more to be done.</p><p>HARLOW: You still -- you brought up in your speech -- you still have a real divergence between the regulation of US markets and European markets. For example, one trader needing to report a trade in the US versus both traders on each side reporting in the EU, just one example.</p><p>And you've said that if we don't have harmonization of regulation, what we're going to see is a race to the bottom in terms of a jump to markets where people can operate in the financial system with the thinnest rule books. Do you have confidence that the US, the EU are going to get on that same page?</p><p>CHILTON: Well, I think this -- the new phrase is \"alternative compliance,\" and deferential treatment of similar but not uniform, not identical rules. I've used this analogy of the movie, Poppy. You may remember the US movie called \"Field of Dreams\" --</p><p>HARLOW: Of course.</p><p>CHILTON: -- with Kevin Costner where he hears in his ear in the cornfield, \"If you build it, he will come.\" And ultimately, he builds a baseball field in Iowa and old-timey baseball players and his good old dad come out and they play ball.</p><p>So, I've used the analogy that if the US and the EU build global -- build regulations that are harmonized, that the rest of the world will come. I think that will happen.</p><p>But there's a real test during this next few months, really before European Commissioner Michel Barnier leaves at the end of the year, along with chairman of my old agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Tim Massad.</p><p>Those guys really have to work on this alternative compliance, and they have to do it pretty quick, because there's window of opportunity. If they don't get it right, Poppy, I am worried that some will be racing to the bottom --</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>CHILTON: -- and that we could see some market migration from the EU and the US to other places around the globe.</p><p>HARLOW: We really do have to go. Very quickly, your reaction to Attorney General Eric Holder's comments yesterday in New York that they are looking to bring charges against individuals at US banks it sounds like in the coming months. Are you encouraged by that? Do you think that needs to happen?</p><p>CHILTON: If you do the crime and it's against the law, you should do the time, not just pay the fine.</p><p>HARLOW: And there have been some very big fines paid, especially lately. Multibillion-dollar mortgage settlements at some of the biggest banks in the world. Thank you for joining us. We appreciate your time, Bart Chilton from London.</p><p>CHILTON: Good to be with you.</p><p>HARLOW: Coming up here on the program, for some people, renting makes a lot more sense that owning. And armed with a smartphone, you've now got limitless choices in vehicles to share: cars, bikes, even boats, all with just a touch of a finger.</p><p>HARLOW: Today is September 18th, 2014. More than a billion people worldwide are using their smartphones, one-seventh of the world's population. Millions will get their hands on a brand-new model on Friday when the iPhone 6 hits the stores.</p><p>This time ten years ago, few of us could have imagined that kind of hype over a phone. The smartphone market was just taking off, dominated by BlackBerry. My, how things have changed. And remember this? I had one of these -- the Palm Trio? One of the earliest smartphones.</p><p>Fast-forward another ten years, and we can only imagine how the smartphone will have transformed our daily lives. And one of the most important parts of our daily life is already transforming. It is our daily commute.</p><p>You have Uber, ZipCar, bike-sharing schemes, all at your fingertips. Here our own Richard Quest, we miss very dearly this week, Richard Quest with the traveler's guide to Tomorrow Transformed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN INTERNATIONAL (voice-over): Hail a cab. Buy a bike. Own a car. The traditional ways of getting around town, which in the future could look quite quaint.</p><p>QUEST (on camera): Today, the smartphone is our vehicle for getting from A to B. Transportation has embraced new technologies that widen our choices in ways we couldn't have imagined even a decade ago. Just touch the screen and a car arrives. Scroll through the maps and find a bicycle waiting for you.</p><p>QUEST (voice-over): Vehicle-sharing is growing around the world. It's a reflection of a reality that we all have different transport needs for different times. And these can now be met using technology.</p><p>SAM AQUILLANO, SHARES VEHICLES: The smartphone allows for things that are just unbelievable.</p><p>QUEST: Sam Aquillano is living this new life. Two years ago, tired of his brutal commute into Boston, Sam packed up and moved into the city. He bought a bike, got rid of his car, and now shares vehicles of all types when he needs them.</p><p>Such as Uber, for the one-off trips. You book on the app, monitor the car's arrival, and someone like Fadi Ghorra is driving the car.</p><p>FADI GHORRA, UBER DRIVER: Every single trip with Uber, it's recorded. It's innovations, it's technology.</p><p>QUEST: Car-sharing companies like ZipCar wouldn't be possible without hefty technology in the background. Managing large fleets of cars that never stay still.</p><p>MILLIE PARK, ZIPCAR: It's not easy to always know where your cars are, and our vehicles are kitted with technology that allows us to lock and unlock cars remotely, that allows to understand where cars are when they're in trouble. So, there's a lot of technology beyond just the app that goes into making ZipCar successful.</p><p>AQUILLANO: If it wasn't smooth, then I'd do something else. These car-sharing and bike-sharing are competing with I have a car, I'll just start the car and go. And so, it has to be that smooth, and that's where the technology comes in and just makes it amazing.</p><p>QUEST: Like the cars and the bikes we rent, this revolution is moving fast, ready to take advantage of whatever technology offers us in the future.</p><p>PARK: I'm really interested to see what happens with driverless cars. We know that that's just around the corner.</p><p>QUEST: Less traffic on the roads, fewer accidents, more time at home. Technology is evolving the way we move. Our lives are evolving with it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HARLOW: Richard Quest, thank you for that. Still to come on the program, a decision made nine years ago means Yahoo! will cash in big when Alibaba goes public. We'll explain right after the break.</p><p>HARLOW: Welcome back. I'm Poppy Harlow in New York. These are the top news headlines we are following this hour. In around 30 minutes' time, voting in Scotland's independence referendum will end. More than 4 million people have registered to vote. They're being asked should Scotland be an independent country. A simple majority for either yes or note will carry the vote.</p><p>The United Nations has declared the Ebola outbreak in West Africa to be a threat to international peace and security. The first time that a public health crisis has been referred to in that way. This comes as the World Health Organization said the number of deaths from the virus has risen to more than 2,600.</p><p>Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko is in Washington today in an effort to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis in Eastern Ukraine. Addressing a joint session of Congress, Mr. Poroshenko has asked the U.S. for more military assistance.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>PETRO POROSHENKO, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT: We need more military equipment bought - lethal and non-lethal.</p><p>(APPLAUSE).</p><p>POROSHENKO: Urgently.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Australian authorities say they have topped a terror plot that involved plans for a public execution. They've now charged two men in connection with this. More than 800 police officers carried out the massive raids. In Sydney and Brisbane. The prime minister says the plan was to kidnap and behead a member of the public.</p><p>We are still waiting for Alibaba to price its initial public offering on the eve of its stock market debut. One key winner though is clear - it is Yahoo. Yahoo owns 22 and 1/2 percent of Alibaba. Its investment dates back to 2005. If you look at Yahoo's stock, it is up about 12 percent in the past month, all because of Alibaba in anticipation of this IPO. Add its IPO price, Yahoo's stake in Alibaba is worth $35 billion. We'll see where that price actually falls. But it's 80 percent of Yahoo's entire market cap at current prices.</p><p>Yahoo is expected to report a decline though in sales for the year. It'll sell one quarter of its stake in Alibaba. It may use those proceeds for share buybacks or more acquisitions. Alibaba's IPO will give the company a huge war chest that it can use to expand its reach. That is worrying some of Silicon Valley's biggest layers as our Maggie Lake reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>(CHEERS)</p><p>MAGGIE LAKE, BUSINESS ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT FOR CNN INTERNATIONAL: Forget Twitter and Facebook. Alibaba's IPO is unlike anything investors have seen before.</p><p>BRENDAN AHERN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, KRANESHARES: Really it's like 12 companies. It's - you know - the eBay and Amazon and PayPal's pretty easy, but it's a Netflix, it's a Groupon, it's - they have a money market fund business. They were buyers and sellers to just park their cash. They have 100 billion U.S. in their money market fund business. So it's almost like it's an ecosystem of its own.</p><p>LAKE: The numbers swirling around this ecosystem are huge, even by Silicon Valley standards. Alibaba's profit for the second quarter jumped some 179 percent to $2 billion. Revenue increased by 46 percent, double that of U.S. online retailer Amazon. Mobile user growth has jumped ten- fold, and last year, the company delivered six billion packages, more than global delivery giant UPS. Those stats are enough to put even the most confident CEOs on edge. Who should be afraid of them, if anyone?</p><p>MAX WOLFF, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MANHATTAN VENTURE PARTNERS: I don't know about afraid, --</p><p>LAKE: Who do they compare to?</p><p>WOLFF: -- but they're going to be a big competitor I think to a lot of other countries trying to have their own e-commerce. So to be honest with you, I don't see Alibaba bumping eBay or Amazon out their place in the United States. But as eBay and Amazon try to become global in more and more markets, they're going to fight a heavily-entrenched Alibaba that's working really hard to get into those markets. So it'll more cut them that way.</p><p>LAKE: The financials are backed up by some serious sizzle. Charismatic founder Jack Ma has the stage presence to rival many tech icons. And he's followed the tech world's presence for structuring the stock sale to make sure controlled stays in management hands. But Alibaba is still young, and analysts say it won't be easy to knock the likes of Amazon and eBay from their perch.</p><p>WOLFF: They are kind of a wall garden, and they're not the cheapest deal in the world. They force you to use Alipay, it's not that cheap and they don't have as global a mix of premium brands because they have a counterfeiting problem on Tmall which is fairly extreme. So a few times when you checked on Tmall which is the brand, maybe half or more of some of the branded content was knockoffs.</p><p>LAKE: Maintaining momentum after the listing will be a challenge. But the windfall from the IPO means Alibaba has the cash to spend on winning over skeptics. Maggie Lake, CNNNew York.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Maggie, thank you for that report. We're watching Alibaba very closely. Meantime, there was a vote in Scotland today. Have you heard? We're not talking about the one for the right for independence, we're talking about the right to golf. Two and a half centuries later, women get the right to play through at St. Andrews. Next.</p><p>HARLOW: As Scotland goes to the polls on independence, we've already had the results of another very historic vote. Women are now allowed to be admitted as members to the Royal and Ancient Golf Club at St. Andrews. Eighty-five percent of the club's more than 2,000 members voted to drop a centuries-old policy barring women from membership at what is known as `the home of golf.' This is a big deal - letting women into the world of golf is about a lot more than just getting with the times, folks. IBM CEO Ginni Rometty was famously barred from the Augusta National Course here in the United States. After protests and even the White House weighing in, Augusta later found the `fairway' and admitted women. Former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was also among one of the first women members there.</p><p>Golf is not just a hobby as, you know, it is an opportunity to really be a deal breaker. Steve Ballmer and Donald Trump are among the business icons who have admitted to having cemented deals - business deals - over, around of 18 holes. The games - the game really even affects - this was surprising to see - a chief executive's take-home pay. A study in Barcelona found that bosses who play golf get 17 percent more than those who do not. CNN World Sports Lara Baldesarra joins us now from the CNN Center. I guess I suppose I should learn how to play golf.</p><p>LARA BALDESARRA, SPORTS ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT FOR CNN: (LAUGHTER). Well it is a very good game for people to play and clearly there are a lot of benefits that go along to it. However, I am going to take exception, Poppy, with one thing that you did say.</p><p>HARLOW: Tell me.</p><p>BALDESARRA: I don't know - I think that this notion that business deals are constantly done on the course - I'm not sure that it's entirely justified. I think it might have been a myth that's created by professionals, by workers that want to, you know, --</p><p>HARLOW: (LAUGHTER).</p><p>BALDESARRA: -- have an excuse to take an afternoon off. I think that what we're actually seeing is that this - it just simply - allows people to form those necessary relationships that are needed for -</p><p>HARLOW: Sure.</p><p>BALDESARRA: -- business deals to move forward. You know, you can do that over dinner, over lunch, going to see a sporting event, what have you.</p><p>HARLOW: Lara, you brought up an important point earlier today when I was watching you talking about the fact that - just to be fair here - there are also courses that do not allow men.</p><p>BALDESARRA: Absolutely. You know, all of these courses that we're talking about - these single-sex membership courses which are now in the public eye because of a vote today --- we're looking - a lot of people are looking - at them as though they are only male-only membership courses. And I do want to add that at those courses, women are allowed to play, they're just not accepting membership - or extending membership - to them. On the flip side, there's a number of female-only membership clubs. And we're kind of seeing a growth in some areas of the world in not just golf clubs that are female membership only, but other types of clubs. I mean, Poppy, you -we both - know, there's women's-only gyms out there that, you know, that a lot of people are quite fond of. We see this kind of thing everywhere, but everyone just wants to focus on the fact that there's male- only memberships.</p><p>HARLOW: So, well OK, so this was a historic - is a historic - course though. I mean, `home of golf,' right, as the Augusta National is in this country. Looking globally, are there any other major courses that still do not allow women to be members? Or was this sort of the final frontier on that?</p><p>BALDESARRA: Well, this one is - let's put it this way - the Royal and Ancient Golf Club - this is like you said, it's the home of golf. This is where all of the tradition comes from. This is where the administrative faction of the Royal and Ancient - is called the R&amp;A - they're the governing body of golf. Rules of golf are made here. There's actually a total of 30 single-sex membership clubs in the United Kingdom, and that's both male and female. So now we're going to see if all of those clubs will be following suit. But you ask if there's clubs outside of just the United Kingdom - yes there is. You know, in Toronto where I'm from, there's women's-only golf clubs. These things do exist. And, but we'll see now if because of this change in decision by golf's governing body, if it means that other clubs will follow suit.</p><p>HARLOW: Lara Baldesarra, thank you for joining us. We appreciate it.</p><p>BALDESARRA: Of course.</p><p>HARLOW: All right, this just in to CNN. Reuters is reporting that eight bodies, including those of three journalists, have been found after an attack on an Ebola education team in Guinea a government spokesman has announced. We will bring you more on that developing story here - very troubling of course - as soon as we get it.</p><p>Now this on the program - five years ago Goldman Sachs committed $100 million to help 10,000 women around the world start small businesses. Now, they find out their 10,000th woman. The results are in. I sat down with Dina Powell of Goldman Sachs who really led the program along with Isobel Coleman of the Council on Foreign Relations to talk about how this is working and what's next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>DINA POWELL, GLOBAL HEAD OF CORPORATE ENGAGEMENT, GOLDMAN SACHS: When Goldman Sachs made this investment, it was really based on data in the sense that we saw that when women had the chance to start businesses, the growth of women in the economy was going to lead dramatically to GDP growth. And now we're hoping that this is really proving the case. The women that were surveyed have increased their revenues by more than 60 percent. Eighty percent of them have created net new jobs both in developed and very challenging emerging markets. And what's interesting is that the most important I think part of the thesis was proved which is that when you economically empower women, they take those proceeds and dramatically improve the entire society.</p><p>HARLOW: One thing, Isobel, that was also found in this report that stood out to me a lot was that despite the success that Dina just talked about, there was a significant portion of the women who did not look for outside funding. And you found specific reasons as to why that is.</p><p>ISOBEL COLEMAN, SENIOR FELLOW, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS: Well I think there are a number of reasons. I mean, women are - they go into business with a lack of confidence, so they're already doubting their own abilities and when they have a little bit of success, then they think OK, I'm going to just turn to friends and family to grow my business. The idea of approaching a bank or external financing is very intimidating. And then of course there're also structural barriers - banks are not particularly friendly to women entrepreneurs. You know, there are a lot of built-in assumptions about what a woman entrepreneur can or cannot do. And it just is an added layer of difficulty to access external financing.</p><p>HARLOW: This is a fascinating story, Dina, but I want you to tell us about one of these entrepreneurs in Egypt.</p><p>POWELL: Yes. Well, you know, we have worked with women all around the work from 43 countries, and in particularly challenging countries where there's some cultural issues obviously about women working. And yet the need for their income at home and for them to be part of that economy is so critical. There's a woman we worked with in Egypt whose husband really did not want her to work outside the home. And the idea of her starting up her own business was really something he could not understand. She actually had a tourism transporting business that, after the revolution, really, you know, was almost completely lost -</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>POWELL: -- and as a product of going through 10,000 Women, she learned how to revamp her business plan, found a new niche in the market that we sort of describe as an Uber-like product in Egypt --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>POWELL: -- without all the technology necessarily.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>POWELL: She doubled her revenues, she doubled her workforce. By the end of it, she was making more money than her husband and contributing to the family so much so that he currently works for her.</p><p>HARLOW: Now the question is always what's next? This program is being expanded exponentially to 100,000 women, you're teaming up with the World Bank to get a lot of the funding because they're going to need a lot of funding. What's the goal here, what are the challenges ahead?</p><p>POWELL: Sure. Well when we started, we knew we were reaching the 10,000th woman. We at Goldman Sachs really wanted to hold ourselves accountable to a measurable impact. We tracked the progress of each of these women, and in that data which is a very large data set, we learned that the next greatest barrier to not having education - management education with capital - women must have growth and working capital for their businesses. This is a gap that has - been identified by the World Bank. But we also learned through this data that it's not just a supply side issue - that women are not applying for loans, they are nervous to do that, they don't have the confidence, they don't have the business plans -</p><p>HARLOW: So that needs to be addressed as well.</p><p>POWELL: -- to go into the bank. And we're addressing that through grant capital and this partnership with the IFC.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: (AUDIO GAP). Dina Powell and also Isobel Coleman for that. Now let's take a look at the weather. Jenny Harrison joins us at the CNN International Weather Center. Of course we have to start in Scotland. How's it looking?</p><p>JENNY HARRISON, WEATHER ANCHOR FOR CNN INTERNATIONAL: We do, because as you say, Holly (ph) well it's coming up to the last hour - hour and ten minutes I think is left in the voting. But this is what it's been like all day. We've had a lot of cloud around - quite a lot of fog this morning. Quite drizzly as well. There'll be a bit more rain too before the day is actually done. But these are the current conditions. Of course it is dark right now. Not bad for Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow, but there is actually some fog to come in in the next couple of hours. And then we've had actually had some fog in Stornoway. That has actually since cleared and you can see that it's obviously mostly cloudy everywhere. But I said been a bit of drizzly all day, and not a particularly cold day. In fact, some very nice weather further to the south. And in the afternoon Dumfries got up to about 22 degrees Celsius.</p><p>Now, talking about this particular region - the U.K. in particular - and rain of course we're, what, in the middle of September? So far, this time in the month we'd expect to see about 48 millimeters of rain across the entire country. So far though it's only been 6.7 millimeters, driest first half of September since 1960. But as well as that, being so dry, it's also been very warm. Temperatures on average as much as 2 degrees above the average, and in fact there's some more pretty warm weather to come across much of Western Europe.</p><p>At the same time, in the last few hours, quite a few showers and thunderstorms have been working their way in. And in fact that rain will eventually spread into more central areas as we continue through the next 24 hours. Still quite warm though in places, and also dryer than it was across those central and southeastern areas. But the rain of course has been coming in pretty heavily across parts of Spain and Portugal. Look at this - 137 millimeters. Even into parts of France we've seen 64 millimeters and there are some more sharp showers and thunderstorms to come.</p><p>But look at these temperatures - this is what I mean about how nice and warm it has been even this part of the middle of September. Paris 27 against an average of 21 and in fact Amsterdam 6 degrees about the average - no, in fact 7 - 7 degrees above the average - 25 with an average of 18. So enjoy Friday and Saturday because come Sunday, it is all about to change. Look at that - Amsterdam low 20s again but by Sunday 17. The same in London, 17 on Sunday and Paris starts at 21 which is the average but after 27 Celsius, that might feel a little bit chilly.</p><p>Now when it comes to rain, we've certainly seen plenty of that of course across the Eastern Pacific. We're now following this. It is actually a tropical storm Polo. It was a hurricane a bit earlier on, but the winds have just dropped down to 110, so it's very close to hurricane status. We have to hope it continues in that journey, keeping away from land. Even so, we know there's quite a bit of rain to push into the southwest of the U.S., so that falling on some very saturated ground.</p><p>Unfortunately, we could do with the rain into California. It is so dry - the drought of course is severe and extreme across as much as 90 percent of the state, and this is one particular big fire. This is the big fire - this is the King fire. You can see where it is, just to the east of Sacramento. A very, very big fire. We've actually got some images to show you because a very, very hard fire to fight this one right down in the valleys and canyons, so people have had to evacuate, and evacuate well ahead of the time to be safe. Over 2,000 people evacuated. And in fact over 3,000 structures are actually at risk.</p><p>But it's producing, Poppy, some huge amounts of smoke and you can see it here actually. The smoke plume travels as far as 400 kilometers within the U.S. So hopefully weather conditions will change -- a bit more humidity and lower temperatures. But it's a big fire, only 5 percent contained. They've got a big job ahead of them.</p><p>HARLOW: Only 5 percent contained.</p><p>HARRISON: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: It has been devastating and continues to roar there in California. Jenny Harrison, thank you, we appreciate it. Coming up next on the program, he was the very familiar barista in one of the favorite settings of the classic television show \"Friends.\" I talked to Gunther actor James Michael Tyler about what it takes to brew up a television phenomenon.</p><p>HARLOW: Polls in Scotland are about to close in just about 7 and 1/2 minutes' time at 10 o'clock local there. This has been a vote where 97 percent of the electorate has registered to vote. Sixteen-year-olds and 17-year-olds also included in this voting. We will see what the outcome is, we will bring you the results here on CNN as soon as we have them.</p><p>Also now this - it may be the most famous coffee shop in the world, and it didn't exist until now. Remember Central Perk? It was one of the main settings in \"Friends,\" a show that became a rite of passage for many 20-somethings in the 1990s, and it's back here in New York City - a pop-up replica opened this weekend in Manhattan. It will be there for one month. It is part of the 20-year anniversary celebrating that show -- that show that introduced us to Rachel, Ross, Joey, Chandler, Phoebe and Monica. None of their good times would have been possible without the ever-faithful barista, Gunther, serving them up coffee.</p><p>I went down to Central Perk to meet the actor, James Michael Tyler, and started by asking him what was the recipe for such a successful show?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>JAMES MICHAEL TYLER, \"GUNTHER\" ON \"FRIENDS\": I think it was like universal characters. I think the characters were real, people can identify with people in their 20s, you know, they're no longer with their families, so their friends become their families, and they're struggling in life, love, work, ambition and they're a support group. So I believe that fans and people who enjoyed the show could see a little bit of themselves in at least one of the characters and relate to them.</p><p>HARLOW: The story of how you became part of the show is pretty phenomenal. You were cast the night before the first episode as an extra.</p><p>TYLER: Yes. I wasn't actually even cast, but I have a friend who was a second AD, and he became the second AD on \"Friends\" for the first episode. He called me the night before, he said, `Hey, would you come in tomorrow. We need someone with some experience as a barista. \"I dropped a cup.\"</p><p>HARLOW: You were in more than half of the 248 episodes. What stands out to you the most?</p><p>TYLER: The last scene, because Gunther, my character, had an obsession and a deep-seated love for Jennifer Aniston's character Rachel. So he does finally get to express his love to Rachel and she rejects him once again, but in a very kind way. So it gave the character some closure.</p><p>(\"FRIENDS\" CLIP)</p><p>TYLER AS GUNTHER: Rachel, --</p><p>JENNIFER ANISTON, ACTRESS, AS RACHEL: Yes?</p><p>GUNTHER: I know you're leaving tonight, -- I just have to tell you - I love you.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END \"FRIENDS\" CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: When you think about \"Friends,\" it was really a reflection of the time, right? People - a little more than they can now - could come in their 20s to New York, maybe afford an apartment. I don't know about as nice as the one in the show, but now it's just impossible in this city. Do you think about that ever?</p><p>TYLER: Wow, you know - if \"Friends\" were set today and it was Monica's apartment, which was enormous as you pointed out, --</p><p>HARLOW: Huge.</p><p>TYLER: -- you know what, it would be split up as a ten. Right? It would be ten separate apartments.</p><p>HARLOW: So, something people may not know about Gunther, we don't love coffee.</p><p>TYLER: Kind of odd, and I understand that you have never even tasted coffee.</p><p>HARLOW: I've tasted it but I've never had a -</p><p>TYLER: A full cup.</p><p>HARLOW: -- full coffee in my life.</p><p>TYLER: You know what, I think we need to remedy that right now. That's like coffee-flavored milk.</p><p>(\"FRIENDS\" CLIP)</p><p>GUNTHER: Maybe you'd just like to get something to eat with me sometime.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END \"FRIENDS\" CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Delicious. It's not that bad.</p><p>TYLER: It's really great, isn't it?</p><p>HARLOW: Not that bad.</p><p>TYLER: Told you.</p><p>HARLOW: Thank you, Gunther.</p><p>TYLER: You're welcome.</p><p>HARLOW: We appreciate it.</p><p>TYLER: Thank you.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Best cup of coffee I ever had made by Gunther, though I didn't drink the whole thing. Thank you for that, sir. Scotland's vote counters may well be dosing up on a lot of coffee now -- the final minutes of voting next.</p><p>HARLOW: We want to return to our top story tonight. Polls in Scotland are about to close. Voting will be over at the top of the hour as you can see from the countdown clock on the bottom of your screen. That is just a few seconds from now. You are looking at live pictures from Edinburgh, Scotland, the country's capital city. This is the scene outside a polling station near Edinburgh. This is the day that will go down, certainly, in Scottish and in British history.</p><p>For now, that is \"Quest Means Business.\" I am Poppy Harlow in New York. Our special coverage of the referendum begins now with Christiane Amanpour.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2014091801cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5D5P-YYD1-JB20-G27Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8661\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>September 18, 2014 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Banking</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Consumers</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Financial Services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Internet</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Policies</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Products</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stock Markets</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Telecommunications</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Transportation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>World Affairs</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Money Market Pricing</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDFENUFENTlCOUZDNDg0OEFEMjg4MTJFOEVDMDNDQTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjhBODUyMzhBNzc4NDZDNEE4RjRCRUQ2QzJDMDg2QjM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Authorities &amp;

We began tonight with this breaking news. The Justice Department Inspector General has delivered to the attorney general the draft of his report on the IG investigation of FISA abuse by the Obama era Justice Department and FBI.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The inspector general 16 month long investigation including the review of more than a million records and documents and more than a 100 interviews. What's next? We take that up with Former Acting Attorney General Mathew Whitaker.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump's agenda and spirits are souring while the Radical Dems on Capitol Hill seemed dumb founded and floundering while the ever more Radical Dem 2020 presidential hopefuls appear more radical than hopeful and certainly far more leftist than the Democrats they're asking to vote for them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump last night rousing House Republicans with a rocket speech.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We'll tell you this, the green new deal we just want that thing to go as long as it can because anybody that can win office promoting the green new deal, they deserve to win.</p><p>They got to be really good, they got to have the greatest line of crap anybody's ever had in the history of politics.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: At the same time the Radical Dems were eating their own on a debate stage in Houston, Texas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENTIAL CANDITATE: I do not have to buy in.</p><p>JULIAN CASTRO, PRESIDENTIAL CANDITATE: You just said that, you just said that two minutes ago. You just said two minutes ago that they would have to buy in.</p><p>BIDEN: They can't afford it.</p><p>CASTRO: You said they would have to buy in.</p><p>BIDEN: They would not have to buy in, if you qualify for --</p><p>CASTRO: Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?</p><p>BIDEN: It's automatic --</p><p>CASTRO: Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Our guest tonight include General Jack Keane, Congressman Andy Biggs, Pastor Robert Jeffress. And the president resolute stand against China's unfair trade practices, the outright theft of trillions of dollars in the United States.</p><p>Well, the president stand and tough negotiating have moved the Chinese back to the bargaining table and it appears that Chinese now recognize while the United States is after all the world's only superpower led by a president who means to change the way China does business with the United States and indeed the world itself.</p><p>The Chinese today lifted tariffs on several U.S. agricultural products. And for the latest we turn to Edward Lawrence in Washington, Ed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ED LAWRENCE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Lou, I could tell you I can confirm that the Chinese deputy level meetings will happen next week here in Washington.</p><p>Those progresses of those meetings will set out how the progress goes when the heads of the delegations meet in early October. Now, some goodwill felt on both sides the Chinese adding two more products to their tariff exemption list, soy beans and pork.</p><p>Now, this coincides with the Department of Agriculture confirming that Chinese made a large purchase of soybeans from American farmers. The Chinese have been trying to meet their demand for soybeans through trade deals with other countries, recently like Chile and Russia, they have not been able to do that.</p><p>The Chinese were also dealing with an African swine fever that's killing pigs inside China. Now including pork in the exemption list maybe a good will gesture but itOs also something China needs to do to meet their demand.</p><p>Now, adding to all of these intrigue as President Donald Trump responding or answered questions about possibly an interim deal with China. I think it's important here to hear exactly what the president said, listen.</p><p>TRUMP: I'd rather get the whole deal done. We've taken in many, many billions of dollars of tariffs. I'd rather get the entire Chinese done it. Look, if we're going to do the deal, let's get it done.</p><p>A lot of people are talking about and I see a lot of analysts are saying an interim deal meaning we'll do pieces of it, the easy ones first.</p><p>But there's no easy or hard, there's a dealer, there's not a deal. But it's something we would consider I guess but we're doing very well.</p><p>LAWRENCE: He would consider I guess but you heard him say that he would rather have the whole deal and to the experts, trade experts say they pointed the president speech as well as some of his tweets where he says that he wants a good deal with China or no deal at all.</p><p>MICHAEL PILLSBURY, HUDSON INST. CHINESE STRATEGY, DIR.: I'm quoting the president who says I'd rather have the whole deal. I think we had to stick with analyzing the president's words, his tweets, not paying attention to unauthorized leagues from so-called advisers.</p><p>LAWRENCE: Now, China's economy is slowing their Central Bank this week had to add stimulus to the economy. The economic fundamentals in the U.S. are very strong.</p><p>Retail sales numbers out today show stronger than expected spending, online sales up 1.6 percent so Lou, the consumer still spending here driving this economy.</p><p>DOBBS: And this economy of course most of it is a consumer spending. This economy is roaring along particularly if you look in comparison to that of Asia, the economies of Asia and Europe.</p><p>And Edward, it's important I think too to take note to something with Mr. Michael Pillsbury said, the so-called sources that are being quoted too often in the certainly the business press and the national left-wing media.</p><p>It seems to me and I want to get your assessment of this, in some cases our reports have more Chines sources than they have U.S. sources.</p><p>LAWRENCE: You know the Chinese have been very vocal about this and we're getting a lot of information out of China related to the trade deal things that they would like to see and floating ideas.</p><p>Now, specifically I can't speak to the interim trade deal where that came from that was not from our reporting. We reported with the president said and what his advisers are saying that he wanted the whole deal.</p><p>But I can tell you the Chinese are talking about what they would like to see in this deal. You know with their economy slowing as it is, you know China is sort of on the back foot or the president believes that the strength of our economy will get them to the table for a good deal.</p><p>DOBBS: And the president believes that so to his principle advisers and by that I mean Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.</p><p>And when I'm talking about interim deals and two tracks solutions, as you know I follow these things rather closely.</p><p>LAWRENCE: Yes. Yeah, you do.</p><p>DOBBS: And it sounds to me just like the Chinese have a megaphone that just booms across Wall Street from time to time perhaps that's an exaggeration but I don't think so.</p><p>LAWRENCE: But certainly mark its following the headlines.</p><p>DOBBS: You better believe it.</p><p>LAWRENCE: Yeah.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DOBBS: Every headline.</p><p>LAWRENCE: Yeah.</p><p>DOBBS: Trade and otherwise. As always, Ed, great work, appreciate it. Edward Lawrence --</p><p>LAWRENCE: Thanks, Lou.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: -- From Washington. The Hudson Institutes Director of Chinese Strategy as I just mentioned Dr. Michael Pillsbury. He will be with us on Monday night's broadcast. He's getting ready to have toward China next week.</p><p>The House Judiciary Committee wants records from Big Tech executives for any evidence of their anti-competitive behavior. The committee today sent letters to Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Tim Cook, Google's early leaders Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Eric Schmidt.</p><p>And the committee's anti-trust investigation is separate of course from those of dozens of state attorney's general and the U.S. Department of Justices and I Trust Division.</p><p>There's a lot of investigating going on and the markets where their part today basically unmoved by the day's developments.</p><p>Breaking news tonight, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is selling both the house, senate oversight committees that he's in the process of finalizing his report into FISA Court abuse by the FBI and the Department of Justice.</p><p>Horowitz telling those committees there are two versions of his report, one classified, and the other will be public. The report could be released by the end of this month or early October.</p><p>Joining us tonight to assess this further Former Acting U.S. Attorney General Matthew Whitaker. And Matt, great to have you with us. This is the development that we've all been waiting for that is the delivery of the draft report to the Attorney General. Your thoughts on the timing?</p><p>MATTHEW WHITAKER, FORMER ACTING U.S. ATTY. GENERAL: Well, this is a big deal and we've all heard that this report was eminent sometime September.</p><p>And what we now know is the inspector general has submitted it for classification review and we also know that the Department of Justice now has it.</p><p>And this is where Attorney General Barr has a real opportunity to preemptively if there are punishments that need to be meted out, if there are people that need to be have disciplinary findings, for example Bruce Ohr is a prime example.</p><p>If there was FISA abuse, if there was someone that did something wrong and should be subject to punishment or even prosecution the time is now for Bill Barr to take this report and take action.</p><p>And soon enough we will all see what happened and again don't forget Derm is still looking at the origins of this investigation but this FISA piece is such an important piece where now actions can be taken against rouge employees or those that did belong.</p><p>DOBBS: Going into that aspect of the investigation, but this investigation by the inspector general is even broader than well, certainly than I suspected that I'd like to know what you think.</p><p>But we're talking about a million records and documents, we're talking about more than a hundred interviews. We've got as you say the adjunct investigations still ongoing and maybe others that we don't know about this looks like it is the whole sale investigation of the origins of spy gate and everything that has occurred under this Obama-era Justice Department and FBI. Your thoughts?</p><p>WHITAKER: Lou, we're finally going to see how this investigation started. How a FISA was obtained for color page and how the dossier was used in that investigation.</p><p>And from where I sit and from what I know, I think it is going to be fairly dramatic what this investigations going to show because as you know, it now appears that actually the Russian collusion was with Michael Steele and the Democrats who paid for this original dossier that was used as the foundation for this investigation.</p><p>And I think this is such a critical moment on behalf of the American people and the Department of Justice to show everything that win into this so that we can know and make sure this never happens again.</p><p>DOBBS: And as you say, Christopher Steele we now know was discredit by his own government, the very agencies for whom he wants to work and the United States and government to government communications were aware of that including leading up to the prosecution of General Michael Flynn.</p><p>It is outrageous. It turns out the outrageous that have been committed here none by the Trump organization or the president is accused by the Obama era intelligence agencies but rather by the investigators, the intelligence agencies, and their counterparts in other foreign intelligence agencies.</p><p>I mean you have to be as the man who once was leading the organization as a Justice Department official, you got to be sickened to see this kind of corruption at the highest levels of our law enforcement and intelligence agencies.</p><p>WHITAKER: And this is what the entire Department of Justice should guard against and that is the weaponization of Apple research. We cannot have investigations launch the way this appears to have been launched based on unverified scurrilous as Jim Comey called it.</p><p>Apple research that is then used as a basis for FISA application it appears and in addition as a basis to launch the special counsel investigation that was unfortunately hamstrung the president for too long.</p><p>And you know we've talked about this, the Department of Justice has under Bill Barr I think is going to recover from this, but this is going to be such an important moment in our nation's history when this evidence and this information is finally given to the American people so they can judge for themselves.</p><p>DOBBS: President Trump putting William Barr in charge of the Justice Department at this critical historic moment, because as you say, first investigate the investigators and bring the justice those perpetrators of such heinous acts of actual effort to overthrow a president.</p><p>But also with a heavy burden of reforming the FBI leadership, reforming the Department of Justice, I think we're very fortunate to have indeed William Barr there at this point in history.</p><p>WHITAKER: I agree.</p><p>DOBBS: Matthew Whitaker, as always great to have you with us. Thanks so much.</p><p>WHITAKER: Thank you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Up next, the United States placing sanctions on those responsible for cyberattacks. We'll tell you what those attacks were targeted at and the role of North Korea.</p><p>General Jack Keane will be joining us.

After watching that, no wonder the Trump campaign actually said to the Dems, thank you for your pro-Trump infomercial.</p><p>Former assistant to the president, Kelly Sadler with us, we'll take up what with those people were thinking about there. Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: On Wall Street stocks today closing mix the Dow up for an eighth consecutive trading day of 37 points just a half percent from it's all time record high close back on July 15.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 down two points, the Nasdaq down 18 volume on the big board, 3.7 billion shares. The Dow up over one 1.5 pe4rcent however for this very busy and market achievement week.</p><p>The S&amp;P, Nasdaq up a percent, retail sales meeting expectations in August back by this urgent strong car sales. That surprised many. Consumer confidence rebounded last month after a slight drop in August according to new data released by the University of Michigan.</p><p>President Trump touting this booming economy, he tweeted this earlier today, quote, \"Dow do you impeach a president who has helped create perhaps the greatest economy in the history of our country.</p><p>All time best unemployment numbers especially for blacks, Hispanics, Asians and women. More people working today than ever before.\"</p><p>And I might add to that, he has restored prosperity to America and to all Americans just as he promise.</p><p>A remind, listen to my reports three times a day coast to coast on the Salem Radio Network.</p><p>Well, here's a new survey, destroying the left-wing business press fears of a recession and of course their anti-Trump narrative, the little darlings are just going to be upset.</p><p>And I just want to say here, I'm commiserating with you and I feel for you and I'm enjoying this moment immensely. According to CNBC survey conducted among 62 chief financial officers, more than two-thirds of them say President Trump will be re-elected in 2020.</p><p>But that's not all, we have more for you, 65 percent of hose CFOS say there will be no recession in 2020. Can you hear the tears falling on the marble floors under those terrible, terrible anti-Trumpers.</p><p>Perhaps the left-wing business press should start listening and start reporting on this booming Trump academy instead of constantly trying to feed into the talking point narrative presented them by all the anti-Trump rinos and of course the Radical Dem darlings who just can't stand to think of an economy with well 3 percent growth, unemployment rates rates at the historic lows.</p><p>And frankly just a great atmosphere in this entire country. Well, let's turn to a fellow who has well his sense of timing when it comes to throwing something in the punch bowl.</p><p>A never Trumper and rino, Mitt Romney, you remember him. He's in form still saying and you're going to be very upset by this and distraught.</p><p>Romney says he has no plans to endorse President Trump for the 2020 election. I know many of you were waiting to hear what Romney would say about our president. Well, there it is.</p><p>Romney refusing to endorse President Trump or any other Republican candidate in the primary or general election. I mean the despair is spreading across the country now.</p><p>The never Trumpers says he himself as he refers to himself, will not be running at 2020, and I know more disappointment. Romney also refusing to endorse the president back in 2016. As you can see, he's not a quick learner but there it is.</p><p>Joining us tonight, Kelly Sadler, former special assistant to the president, now the director communications in America First Policy and America First Action. Kelly, it is great to have you with us.</p><p>KELLY SADLER, FORMER. SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: Great to be here.</p><p>DOBBS: First, I don't know if I saw a tear forming?</p><p>SADLER: Oh I'm sorry, I just had to hold them back, you know.</p><p>DOBBS: What is wrong with this man?</p><p>SADLER: You know what is so funny is when he practically begged to the president to endorse him for his Utah senate run. And then the president did so and he won handily.</p><p>You know what, the president's endorsement means something, you saw that down in North Carolina this week. And not only it's an endorsement, it is going down holding rallies, gaining up the support of his base that turns out for the president.</p><p>And we saw that happened, who turns out front Mitt Romney? Who really cares if he endorses or if he doesn't endorse? I mean this is just -- it's just unbelievable.</p><p>DOBBS: I'm wondering if we should call Romney and the rinos who are not supporting the president or we can just call them sort of the illuminate of the 6 percent because the president has 94 percent, stay with me folks, 94 percent support in the Republican Party. So I guess that they want to build a base around 6 percent?</p><p>SADLER: Yeah. No, this is --</p><p>DOBBS: This is insane.</p><p>SADLER: The Republican Party is the president's party. And you cannot separate the two. Now, they might hope you know the Democrats, the socialists come in and win, and then they can re-establish themselves, but let me just tell you the Republican Party has forever changed and the president of the United States has forever changed the electorate. It really woke up the populous.</p><p>DOBBS: I think you're exactly right.</p><p>SADLER: Yeah.</p><p>DOBBS: And he stands for the American working man and woman, no longer the forgotten man and woman in this country but the working men and women, their families, the middle class, and those who aspire to it.</p><p>And the Democrats -- what did you make of that performance last night?</p><p>SADLER: The three hour marathon. Well, I think we have a very fundamental debate going on. It's socialism versus freedom. And you have the president of the United States who loves this country, has devoted his life, you know this later part of his life to servicing this country and wants to build it up.</p><p>And then you see this radical socialists democrats who want to tear it down, whose motive seems to be blame America first, that we are not good enough, and that is our fault, and now we have to destroy the fundamentals, the principles of which this country were built in order to bring in this revolution.</p><p>DOBBS: It sounds like the faint echoes of former President Obama in his campaign. He wants to transform fundamentally this country.</p><p>SADLER: Yeah, fundamentally.</p><p>DOBBS: You know, the hell with that kind of attitude. This country -- look what we're doing right now under this president. Every American is participating, almost every American is participating prosperity and I would guess that there are more people right now within that benefiting, then any time since certainly modern history.</p><p>SADLER: Well, you know the one thing they did not talk about last night, and that is the economy.</p><p>DOBBS: Right, isn't that interesting?</p><p>SADLER: Because they have no talking points on the economy and they would have to admit that we're at lowest unemployment ever that the poverty rate is the lowest since it's been to 2001. I can go on and on with statistics.</p><p>DOBBS: And they forgot impeachment, they forgot abortion, it's as if they don't want to talk about those things. Jerry Nadler wants to talk about Nancy Pelosi but only up to a point --</p><p>SADLER: Only up to a point.</p><p>DOBBS: Because they know what this president has done and what he will do to them in 2020.</p><p>SADLER: We feel good --</p><p>DOBBS: It's just my guess.</p><p>SADLER: We feel good about it, right? I mean the gun confiscation, government takeover of healthcare, this is not what middle America wants. They want an inspirational message and that's something that the Democrats have not provided.</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah, socialism, gun confiscation, the madness of the left is almost complete. Kelly Sadler, great to see you. Thanks so much for all you do --</p><p>SADLER: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: -- for the president and for the country we appreciate it.</p><p>Coming up next, President Trump having a great time last night talking to house Republicans at their so-called retreat in Baltimore they were actually talking about how to advance.</p><p>We take up the president's leadership, Congressman Andy Biggs Chairman of the freedom Caucus joins us. We'll be right back with much more.</p><p>DOBBS: Joining us tonight, General Jack Keane, former vice-chief of the staff of the U.S. Army, retired four star, general Fox Business senior strategic analyst. General, great to have you with us.</p><p>I'd like to share with the audience the president last night at the Republican conference where he addressed the issue of the Taliban in Afghanistan, if we could listen to this?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: And I'll tell you one thing, we are hitting the Taliban right now harder than they've ever been hit. But when they did what they did in order to create what they thought was a better negotiating stance, I said that's the end of that, get them out. I don't want anything to do with them and they've been hit very hard.</p><p>And I know for a fact they said that was a big mistake that they made and it was but, that was my decision.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: The president referring to of course not ending the proposed talks between the Taliban and the United States government at Camp David.</p><p>Your reaction to what is going on right now and what the prospects are for achieving any of these goals now the withdrawal of our troops from Afghanistan and for securing Afghanistan for the Afghan government?</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET), FORMER VICE CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE U.S. ARMY: Yeah, first of all I totally agree with the president's position here as absolutely outrageous. Indeed the Taliban for nine months have told their fighters to increase their level of activity, kill as many people as you can to include Americans with a single purpose of using that as leverage for negotiation.</p><p>That's who we're dealing with here right call on cancelling those talks here, right call on cancelling negotiations. I think the Afghan election is coming up here, it's been slightly delayed, let's let that election go forward.</p><p>I would bring in the newly elected leader, I think it will likely be the one that's incumbent and I would bring him in and talk to him about let's cut a path ahead in terms of where we are or where we need to be.</p><p>If there's any negotiations again with the Taliban, Lou, there has to be one single condition going in there, permanent ceasefire while we're talking.</p><p>And that's got to be a condition. Now do I think that we can reduce our forces in Afghanistan? Yes. Do I think we can reduce the money rather significantly which is now about 45 billion a year, I think we can get that down into the teams to be frank about it.</p><p>I think the Afghans can pay their own way as opposed to we helping pay them and I think President Ghani can put in front of our president a plan to just do that.</p><p>But we've got to maintain some kind of force there to deal with the A Qaeda and ISIS, we cannot contract that out to the Taliban. We can't trust these guys, and we are talking about America's security. Small modest forced to protect America's homeland.</p><p>DOBBS: You and I have talked about Afghanistan over the course of almost two decades now.</p><p>KEANE: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: And it truly begs the question, if we were to look at the prospect of another Afghanistan in another country and in another year, has the U.S. military, has our state department, has our foreign policy, and national security apparatus learned a lesson here that could be applied so that we don't get involved in something a rationalization of a long war doctrine for crying out loud for the United States which now has cost something approaching to trillion dollars in Afghanistan alone.</p><p>And thousands of American lives, tens of thousands of Afghan lives, is there a different approach in doctrine being taught in war colleges at West Point, Annapolis. What are we doing to react to what we've learned this point?</p><p>KEANE: Yeah. Well, a valuable lesson was in Iraq. You know we toppled the regime in Iraq very quickly and then they conducted insurgency to return themselves to power.</p><p>And we really didn't know how to fight that very well, we had the wrong strategy for three years. We figured that one out, we got doctrine to support that.</p><p>We wanted to apply that Lou in Afghanistan. Remember, Afghanistan was put on a diet right after we toppled the regime because we went to Iraq.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>KEANE: That was the President Bush decision. And we never put forces back into Iraq until 2000 into Afghanistan, until 2008.</p><p>DOBBS: General, I hate to interrupt --</p><p>KEANE: So it was U.S. policy, the military knows how to fight this war, but they've been handcuffed by President Bush and also by President Obama.</p><p>DOBBS: General, thanks so much. We'll be right back.</p><p>KEANE: All right, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Thank you, General.</p><p>DOBBS: President Trump firing those house republicans at the GOP retreat in Baltimore last night taking on the field of Radical Dems.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: You really have to elect me whether you like me or not, it makes no difference because our country will go to hell if any of these people get in, it will go to hell.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: You notice, there weren't a lot of people arguing with that statement, not in that room last night, and not in the media throughout the country.</p><p>Joining me now, Congressman Andy Biggs of Arizona, member of the House Judiciary Committee, co-chair of the Border Security Caucus, he's also in October the new chairman of the House Freedom Caucus.</p><p>First congratulations, Andy, the Freedom Caucus chairmanship and great to see you.</p><p>REP. ANDY BIGGS, (R-AZ): Good to be with you.</p><p>DOBBS: Let's start with the president last night in great form as is his want. How was he received? Do you believe by the rinos, I know the good guys like you and Congressman Jordan and many others, but how about the rinos?</p><p>BIGGS: Well, he speaks truth to power here, he's is exactly right and I think, it's been hard to find a descending voice among Republicans because he's right.</p><p>If anybody gets in from the left, from the Democrats, this country is going to go to hell in a hand basket. And what President Trump has done in spite of the fact of the establishment, the swamp, that's thrown down piece sticks has been remarkable.</p><p>I mean, you are going to get some elite, but they're not in that room, they're not in Congress. You're going to get some elite that think he's gauche whatever, but the reality is --</p><p>DOBBS: Gauche?</p><p>BIGGS: Yeah, gauche --</p><p>DOBBS: That's not Tony, that's not a very populous word, Congressman.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DOBBS: Gauche?</p><p>BIGGS: That's the point. They think in those terms, he's gauche, she's boorish, but for the rest of us, he's speaking --</p><p>DOBBS: Who the hell are these people, I mean really who do they think they are? They're silly where there's snap boxes in 18th century in England again, my god.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BIGGS: Yeah, right upon the sleeve, right, sniffing the snuff. You know but the --</p><p>DOBBS: Making a horrible mouth.</p><p>BIGGS: Exactly. But &gt;&gt; for the American people, Donald Trump is speaking what they want to hear, they elected him to be a disruptor, they elected him to be a fighter, and so sometimes he's going to rub people the wrong way I guess but the reality is he's in there doing what he said he do and that overcomes a lot of gaucheness I supposed.</p><p>But I mean the reality is, what's on the other side is so terrible for this country.</p><p>DOBBS: You know what, I find it amazing is here is a president who's done all that he's done as he pointed out today, two and a half years he's a historic president.</p><p>He has improved the lives of nearly every American, my god, who can say that in their lifetimes. And he's done it in two and a half years. And these people you're using, use words like gauche and boorish --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BIGGS: Yeah.</p><p>DOBBS: These SOB's haven't done a damn thing for anyone but themselves and they trampled the constituents who put them in office whether you call them rinos or Radical Dems, they are frankly absolutely irrelevant to the course of this country.</p><p>BIGGS: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: And I think he's right, Andy. I think that this president is right. You even act like you're going to put anybody else in the oval office and you're going to watch these markets, they're going to collapse. You can watch this economy the growth rate --</p><p>BIGGS: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: -- will be in the negatives not positives, not 3 percent but I think this economy would slump off trillions of dollars almost immediately on the prospect of this president not leading the nation.</p><p>BIGGS: I think you're right. I think you'd see a contraction actually in our economy and I think the other thing is I think if Wall Street or anybody else thinks that the Democrats actually can win this thing, except for a few, I would call fascistic companies who think they're going to make money off of a big government.</p><p>I think you're going to see a contraction, I do not believe that these folks want Democrats to get there and certainly not main Street. Main Street understands there's a big difference between the government controlling every aspect of your life and the freedom that we're feeling and the economy.</p><p>I mean look at the unemployment rate so low, more people participating in the economy.</p><p>DOBBS: So 96 percent of Republican support the President?</p><p>BIGGS: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: Who are these six percenters?</p><p>BIGGS: They're the ones with the snuff on their sleeves saying he's gauche I suppose.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DOBBS: Congressman, thanks so much. You and I probably have worn out that snuff and sleeves --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>-- and terrible mess and gauche. Thanks so much, Andy.</p><p>BIGGS: Thanks.</p><p>DOBBS: Andy Biggs, never gauche himself. Up next, I can be but never again. Last night's debate sparking outrage among the Radical Dems after ABC News asked them a single question about abortion, you know the right to life.</p><p>We take that up with Pastor Robert Jeffers here next. Stay with us. We'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: After last night's exciting Radical Dem debate, Beto O'Rourke and Senator Kamala Harris expressed their disappointment about the lack of abortion questions. There were none.</p><p>Both 2020 hopefuls took to twitter, they slammed ABC saying no questions were asked regarding abortion or reproductive rights. O'Rourke even said women's rights are under attack throughout the country.</p><p>Joining us tonight, Pastor Robert Jeffress, member of the White House Faith Initiative, pastor of the first Baptist Church of Dallas, Fox Business contributor, also the host of the Fox Nation Show, Pathway to Victory and it is great to see you, Pastor.</p><p>PASTOR ROBERT JEFFRESS, WHITE HOUSE FAITH INITIATIVE MEMBER: Thank you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Let's start with this, Kamala Harris, Beto O'Rourke upset as they are usually with something.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Upset that there were no questions about abortion from ABC News perhaps because they wanted to keep their audience, your thoughts?</p><p>JEFFRESS: Well, I don't think it's an accident ABC didn't ask that question. ABC like the Mainstream Media is in bed with the Democrats, they know that the Democrats Achilles heel with voters is their barbaric view of abortion.</p><p>And so the liberals want to keep that hidden, ABC and other media outlets as well. They want to keep those views hidden, our job is to expose what the Democrats really believe about abortion.</p><p>Lou, the Democrat position on abortion is not only wrong it's evil. And in case anybody just missed what I said, let me say it again, the Democrats are evil, evil people and their support of the butchering and dismembering of babies inside the womb.</p><p>And I don't see how any person with a shred of a conscience could vote for anyone of those Democrats we saw on the stage Thursday night.</p><p>DOBBS: Let's take a look at some of the reaction, Kamala Harris very upset, and the Catholic League president Bill Donohue who is saying this, if we can put this up on the full screen please?</p><p>\"Quite frankly it is not normal for anyone to have such an extreme fixation on aborting babies. That Harris touts herself as a champion of social justice makes her obsession with abortion all the more sickening.\" Your reaction to Bill Donahue?</p><p>JEFFRESS: Bill is exactly right on that. It makes no logical sense that this party would alienate so many religious voters on an issue like this.</p><p>You would think Lou that they would at least moderate their position or at least ban later term abortion, but this is a part of who they are. The only explanation for it is evil in their hearts and look I think this is going to be a tipping point in 2020.</p><p>I think you're going to see more religious voters even then in 2016 both for Donald Trump who has become the most argued pro-life president in history.</p><p>DOBBS: Well the Democrats made it very, very clear that they are the secular party, they do not want -- they're appealing to all who are not affiliated with legitimate churches.</p><p>This is Pete Buttigieg, the mayor saying, quote, \"Right now, they hold everybody in line with this one piece of doctrine about abortion referring to the Dems of the false interpretation of Christianity.</p><p>They say this then again there are lots of parts of the bible that talk about how life begins with breath. So even that is something we can interpret he says differently.\" Your thoughts about his ecclesiastical scholarship?</p><p>JEFFRESS: Pete Buttigieg is either dumb or dishonest when it comes to the bible. I mean a 5-year-old reading the bible knows that the breath of life is God's breath of life, not a baby's breath of life that marks life.</p><p>And look Lou, the bible is clear, life begins at conception. And science has proven that is true, metal technology shows us that the life inside the womb is not some biological blob, it is a human being.</p><p>And I think it's so ironic that the Democrats claim to be the party of science but when it comes to life inside the womb they have become science deniers.</p><p>Perhaps it's because science is presented Democrats with an inconvenient truth when it comes to life inside the womb.</p><p>DOBBS: Perhaps indeed. Mississippi prayer, students walking out because they were being denied a faith-based program and prayer. Your reaction? We've got about 35 seconds.</p><p>JEFFRESS: Well, you bet the Supreme Court is very clear on this, student led prayers and gatherings are constitutional, I don't know what the whole story is about this but it seems strange that the school officials allowed it for 15 years, but suddenly they say is unconstitutional or wrong.</p><p>And look, we have to continue to fight for religious liberty and no president has done more for religious liberty than Donald J. Trump.</p><p>DOBBS: And as a nation if I may add, it's truly my belief we've got to take control of our schools at the local level.</p><p>JEFFRESS: Yes.</p><p>DOBBS: That means more citizen involvement, more community involvement, by parents and all who care about their communities, and of course the nation.</p><p>Pastor, thanks and as always for being here, we appreciate it. Robert Jeffress.</p><p>JEFFRESS: Thank you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Up next, few thoughts on last night's debate on one of those Radical Dem 2020 hopefuls, I don't think they're ready quite to face President Trump on a debate stage.</p><p>I can be wrong, but right now that's just my estimate of the thing. We'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: A few thoughts now as we go into the weekend, I didn't want or listen I've got to confess any part of the Democratic debate last night.</p><p>I did read about it, all about it. Found out a single surprised in any of it but I was struck, by one of those so-called presidential hopefuls said a word about the economy. Can you imagine that?</p><p>But not one of them has a principal or sufficient courage or integrity to credit President Trump for his leadership. For tearing up the regulations that former President Obama put in place as his principal legal legacy or for that matter Mr. Trump's record of high employment for all Americans.</p><p>The return of economic growth and prosperity, it wouldn't be so hard, you know good going Mr. President and move on. But the Radical Dems on that stage last night were all radical.</p><p>And most of what they had to say was basically nonsense. Basically half- baked and of not much real interest to working men and women in this country.</p><p>In fact, I get a kick out of Republican conservative and independent who watch the nonsense and then go about their business on cable television, telling the Dems they have big problems and then these Republicans savants tell the Dems they think how to fix the mess they're in.</p><p>I'm not one of those folks, I have to tell you I do agree the Radical Dems are in a big mess, an awful mess. But I'm not going to be the one to tell them what or how they should fix any part of a disaster they're in spooling for themselves.</p><p>They're excited, luxuriating in the limelight, let them enjoy it. You can see it, watch Booker, Biden, Bernie, Buttigieg and that band of hopefuls and then imagine one of them, any one of them in a general election debate trying to stand up against President Trump in his historic record of accomplishment, not even remotely possible.</p><p>Have a great weekend. The president makes such a thing possible for us all. Good night from New York.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LOUDOB-2019091301cb229</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LOUDOB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X22-1TG1-DXH2-616W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">383182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6497\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Lou Dobbs Tonight</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 13, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democratic Debate</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tariffs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Taliban</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Peace Talks</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Afghanistan</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Composition</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM4NkI4M0M2OUEzNDY3M0E1RjhFMDM5RUNBODAxMkM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDIwQjUyMTIwMkE5NDc3Qjk5ODQyMUI1OThGMzk2OTE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000128</classCode><className>ATTORNEYS GENERAL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

During this time, a lot of shady business deals and corporate management went down. Mostly it\u2019s swept under the rug or marked \u2018Confidential\u2019 and everyone moves on. If someone tries to speak up, they\u2019re neutralised. In the corporate sense of course.     This week we saw four of the top tech CEOs in the US face accusations of theft, abuse and power. The CEO antitrust hearing in Washington this week revealed a lot about big tech that everyone expected, but everyone was too afraid to address.    And\u2026 fight!   This hearing doesn\u2019t involve countries outside the US per se, it\u2019s important to realise what a corporate monopoly can do to an industry. This is particularly true for tech, which has thrived on competition. With great competition, comes great growth and innovation \u2014 something tech companies pride themselves in.     This week, the US House of Representatives\u2019 antitrust subcommittee questioned the four big CEOs: Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, Alphabet and Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg before a panel. The four men called in via videoconferencing to allow for proper social distancing, where they faced accusations of abuse of market power, with the committee saying the four had crippled smaller rivals in order to dominate the market.    It follows an in-depth 13-month investigation into their dominance of the online world.    The four men were told they have \u201ctoo much power\u201d in the online world, and its\u2019 effects include censoring political choices, spreading fake news and \u201ckilling\u201d the engines of the US economy by buying out competitors \u2014 something Amazon and Facebook are accused of.   Their side of the story   All four of them had a chance to state their cases, with the majority trying to pull the \u2018humble beginnings\u2019 card, and all of them mentioning they\u2019ve helped grow the very American economy that all Americans thrive on. Amazon has created millions of jobs in the country, while Apple became one of the leading smartphone manufacturers in the world.     There\u2019s no denying all of these corporations have had a significant effect on the US economy, both good and bad. Because it is a capitalism-driven country, there are certain laws against uncompetitive behaviour. Some of these haven\u2019t been updated or tailored for the new digital economy.     Unsurprisingly, the CEOs didn\u2019t like this. Zuckerberg said: \u201cWe started with nothing and provided better products that people find valuable. As I understand our laws, companies aren\u2019t bad just because they are big. Many large companies that fail to compete cease to exist.\u201d   The accusations   One of the more important accusations against the tech four was the idea of stealing content and ideas from smaller rivals in order to retain their dominance. \u201cWhy does Google steal content from honest businesses?,\u201d Democrat David Cicilline asked Google. This follows allegations that Google stole reviews from Yelp to bolster its review system. When Yelp didn\u2019t agree to its terms, Google threatened to delist them from Search. That\u2019s quite\u2026 unsportsmanlike?    Which is exactly the case. If you don\u2019t really get the whole story, the best way to explain it is that these companies are acting unsportsmanlike. Instead of taking competitors head-on, they crush them, absorb them, steal their tactics or innovations and threaten them.     I reckon the most unsportsmanlike act was committed by Amazon, which uses its platform and insights to see which third-party products sell more. It uses this detailed insight to develop similar products under its own label and sell them to users. What a sneaky way to become the richest man in the world.    This had to happen   The whole thing was an odd experience to watch. Tech CEOs and congresspeople alike seem disassociated from real life, with one Republican in particular grilling CEOs on the censorship of right-wing conservatives. Sure, everyone has the right to free speech in the US of A, but that\u2019s not what this hearing was about.     Cicilline\u2019s closing statement summed it up nicely: \u201cThese companies as they exist today have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable.\u201d    These are the responsibilities we, as consumers, place on the shoulders of these tech giants. Yes, it\u2019s important to develop and put out great products, but at what cost?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42728959116</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GH-DW81-F07F-8104-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"814\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Stuff.co.za</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I'm Christine Romans. This is YOUR MONEY.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the first time since 2008, more Americans now say the economy is getting better than getting worse. Gallup has tracked Americans' economic confidence every week since the financial crisis and it now stands at a 5-year high. Why? Well, first, stocks are at record highs; that's boosting everyone's 401(k)s.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fidelity said the average account is now $80,900, up a whopping 75 percent from the market low in 2009.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For employees 55 and older, the average account now holds $255,000. That's nearly doubled over the past four years.</p><p>Next, home values are rising. We hope that's making you feel a little richer. We learned this week the median price of a home sold in April jumped 11 percent from a year ago. It's the 14th straight year over year pricing increase and the fifth in a row in the double digits.</p><p>And finally, unemployment, 7.5 percent, the lowest since December 2008. Yes, it is still too high, way too high; millions of Americans are out of work; they are underemployed, but the signs point to an improving labor market.</p><p>So is this recovery, four years in now, solid enough for most Americans to feel it, and not just the best earners? And what does it mean for <person><nameText>President Obama?</nameText></person></p><p>CNN's chief political correspondent Candy Crowley is the anchor of \"STATE OF THE UNION\".</p><p>Candy, the president has been knocked off message lately, controversies over Benghazi, the IRS targeting the Tea Party, the administration going after reporter phone records.</p><p>Will a positive economic message ultimately drown out those controversies?</p><p>CANDY CROWLEY, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Likely not, to tell you the truth. First of all, we're not at the end of the IRS controversy. So it's still playing out. Certainly, there are elements of Benghazi as well, and there is the AP; in this new report now, that they went after another reporter who revealed something about North Korea.</p><p>So these things will be ongoing because Congress keeps them ongoing. And as you know, this is a town that is sort of driven -- actually, it's a country where great news, I think the economy, you'll see the president out there kind of talking about it and pushing it.</p><p>But on the other hand, good news is not where headlines go. The headlines still are on the IRS and things like that. It's just hard to get this off the table. It certainly helps the president, it strengthens his hand as you move forward with legislation; I don't think it erases the headlines.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>Stephen Moore, an editorial writer for \"The Wall Street Journal\" with us also today.</p><p>Stephen, you admit you're seeing signs of a pickup in the economy.</p><p>Does the president deserve any of the credit for it?</p><p>STEPHEN MOORE, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, you've been waiting to ask me that question for a long time, Christine.</p><p>ROMANS: About three years, actually.</p><p>MOORE: There's no question the economy is picking up. I'm feeling pretty bullish about the economy. You did a nice summary about the good news in the economy. And, by the way, let's not get carried away. It's still, for middle class and lower income people, they're still really struggling. We haven't seen wage increases and salary increases.</p><p>In fact, if you look at the median wage over the last four years of this recovery, it's fallen a little bit, not risen. And unemployment is still too high, but you talk about the good things in the economy, and I would point to a couple things. One is those low interest rates out there are really providing a boom to the stock market and a boom to the housing market.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROMANS: You're going to point out that's not the president's doing?</p><p>MOORE: Well, look, the president gets the credit because he's there when it happened. Reagan gets credit for the boom that happened under his term. Obviously Bill Clinton got credit for the boom under his.</p><p>But the other thing is one of the reasons the president might not get total credit for what is going on right now is that the biggest boom sector right now is the oil and gas industry. There's just no question it's been carrying the rest of the economy on its back, and let's face it, Christine, he hasn't been the biggest advocate of oil and gas. In fact, he's, if anything, tried to hold that sector back.</p><p>ROMANS: I want to bring in Rana Foroohar. She's the assistant managing editor at \"Time\".</p><p>And he brings up a very good point, not everyone is feeling this.</p><p>And I wanted to show the statistic. Demos, it's a left-leaning policy group, says a third of Americans are paid less than $24,000 a year. A third of American workers earn less than $24,000 a year.</p><p>Can you have an American recovery where a third of the people who are working are making so little money?</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, ASSISTANT MANAGING EDITOR, \"TIME\": No, I don't think you really can have a truly robust recovery. I mean, the fact is, we're still in a 2 percent economy.</p><p>The private sector is recovering. In fact, if you stripped out the government, we'd be in a 3 percent economy, in part because of, as Stephen mentioned, oil and gas, but also housing and some other sectors.</p><p>But, ultimately, if you look at the fastest growing job categories in this country, they are low wage jobs. Eight out of 10 of the fastest growing categories make very low wages. And when you have a 70 percent consumer economy, as we do, it's really hard to imagine how we're going to go back up to historic growth levels unless we can get these middle class jobs going.</p><p>ROMANS: And that brings back to Candy, where, you know, our own CNN/ORC polling, not quite as rosy as the Gallup polling I gave you earlier.</p><p>Two-thirds of Americans still say the economy is in poor shape.</p><p>There are a few glimmers of optimism, though, when you dig in these numbers. Here's one: the number of people who say conditions are poor, the worst option offered is at the lowest point in over a year.</p><p>So, Candy, what is the administration's strategy on the economy as it's knocked off message here?</p><p>CROWLEY: In terms of actual policy, they're now around the margins of this. They push jobs for veterans, legislation like that, much of what the president is going to do or wants to do was put in his budget.</p><p>This is still an economy that doesn't have a government with a lot of money to spend. There's still that big old debt, Republicans are still concentrated on that as is some Democrats. So there's not a lot of, hey, let's really prime this some more and throw this money into a stimulus program. There's not that kind of money left.</p><p>So there are some things that he's doing and has proposed to increase the job rate among various groups, but you're not going to see anything major. I think this is one of those things where you will hear the president continue to talk about this certainly so long as those numbers continue to go up.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROMANS: Go ahead.</p><p>MOORE: You know, what's interesting about that, Candy, is that, as I talk to businessmen and women, they are feeling more optimistic, no question about it. And these are people who hire Americans.</p><p>One of the things that's interesting is they're not as afraid of <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>and the policies that are coming out of Washington as they were in the first term. I mean, think about the first term. We had, you know, the stimulus, the huge debt, ObamaCare, you know, there was talk about union card check, and cap and trade laws.</p><p>Those kinds of threats from Washington have really subsided and I think that's one of the reasons the private sector is starting to take off.</p><p>CROWLEY: Sure, absolutely. Businesses, in general, love it when Washington isn't doing anything.</p><p>MOORE: That's right. Exactly, bingo.</p><p>ROMANS: Except when they bring you to the brink of paralysis because of our debt ceiling and all that stuff.</p><p>I mean, there is the conventional wisdom, Rana, you know, a gridlock in Washington is good for business, but it doesn't feel that way this time.</p><p>FOROOHAR: It certainly doesn't feel that way. I think it's going to be interesting to see how the markets react and just how much of the wealth that we've been feeling is down to the Fed and how much of it is down to the real economy.</p><p>ROMANS: I know. And the Fed -- oh, I think the Fed and the discussions happening within the Fed and about the Fed are going to be so important in the months going on.</p><p>Candy, Stephen and Rana -- thank you so much all of you.</p><p>CROWLEY: Thanks.</p><p>MOORE: Thank you.</p><p>ROMANS: Coming up, less than a week after deadly tornadoes tore through more Oklahoma, residents vow to rebuild. But does that make sense economic sense? That's next on YOUR MONEY.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS: Twenty-four dead, hundreds of buildings destroyed, billions of dollars in property lost but residents of Moore, Oklahoma, have seen this before. This is the third, the third time in 15 years that tornadoes have carved a path through Moore. So, after three tornadoes, you might be surprised by this response.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. MARY FALLIN (R), OKLAHOMA: We will get through this. We will overcome, and we will rebuild.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: We will rebuild. Again, she says.</p><p>I want to bring in Jerold Kayden. He's a professor of urban planning and design at Harvard's Graduate School of Design.</p><p>So nice to see you. Thanks for coming by.</p><p>You know, rebuilding really heals psychological wounds. We've heard again and again people say this is my home, I'm going to rebuild. We are strong. We will get through it.</p><p>But is it smart to rebuild in the same place where disaster has struck so many times?</p><p>JEROLD KAYDEN, PROFESSOR, HARVARD GRADUATE SCHOOL OF DESIGN: Smart is, of course, in the brain of the beholder, and some people will say it is smart and others will say it's the opposite of smart.</p><p>Look, we are a resolute, some would even say, stubborn people. As you just said, we're going to rebuild, we're going to show that storm, even we're going to show the terrorists that we rebuild in the same area. Nothing is going to stop us.</p><p>Also, we have to recognize these are people's homes, their streets, their neighborhoods where they grew up, where they have memories. We're very attached to place, so where we see the images of a desolate, destroyed area, they're actually seeing their street still.</p><p>Yes, it's their destroyed house, but this is where they grew up, this is where they want to continue to live. So we're a compassionate people and we honor that sort of rebuilding effort, sometimes in unwise ways.</p><p>And that's where it actually isn't smart. It can indeed lead to unwise behavior and it's a question of both government policy and individuals recognizing that we have to be smarter in the future.</p><p>ROMANS: So if we rebuild and we rebuild in better ways or we learn lessons in the rebuilding, that's what's really a key, I think, here.</p><p>You know, in 1999, President Clinton urged Moore's residents then to invest in safe rooms, reinforced spaces that can resist tornadoes. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM J. CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT: If you don't remember anything else I say today, remember this, for goodness sakes, build a safe room in your house when you rebuild. Go in and do the -- any kind of alterations you have to do. It will be the cheapest $2,000 you ever spent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: And, you know, since 1993, FEMA has paid more than $57 million for 12,000 private and public safe rooms in Oklahoma. But still, it's not everyone. It's not everywhere.</p><p>Vital places like Morris Plaza Towers Elementary School, they were not protected when those tornadoes came.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR GLENN LEWIS, MOORE, OKLAHOMA: It's about the money and the statistics. An F-5 tornado is very rare. It's 1 percent to 2 percent of the tornadoes. Same reason they don't have safe rooms for earthquakes, they don't work all the time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: My question to you is whether it's safe rooms for tornadoes, earthquake proofing, flood prevention measures, who pays for it? Who should pay for it?</p><p>KAYDEN: It's really the central question now going forward. I think on smaller types of things that are manageable by a middle class family, it is not unreasonable to ask at a minimum that they share, if not pay for the entire cost.</p><p>No one hesitates when government imposes a regulation, for example that, going forward, requires homeowners to install smoke alarms or carbon monoxide detectors. The reason nobody objects is first of all it's smart for safety but also it's a very small cost.</p><p>The issue here is the cost is slightly more and yet we should be asking people to bear some of that burden and if government can provide some assistance, particularly in the aftermath of a disaster or over time to help people contribute to this, then it may be reasonable to do that of course given budget constraints.</p><p>ROMANS: That's a key point, that given budget constraints, because you hear on the one hand people talk about big government and government intrusion, too much regulation and this and that, and then something like this happens and you hear with almost unanimity, why wasn't there a safe room in that school? Because it costs money to build these things and the public has to pay for it.</p><p>KAYDEN: Right. But it's a two-step dance. After the disaster, people understandably say, Government, come here and rescue me. Government, come here and give me money to rebuild.</p><p>And then when government says, yes, but in the future you will not be able to rebuild in certain areas or in the future you must install a safe room or a basement in terms of tornadoes or whatever it may be, then you hear people say, no regulation, no government.</p><p>So, it's this dilemma between wanting government and not wanting government.</p><p>ROMANS: Let me ask you this. EQECAT -- it's a disaster modeling firm -- it says that it estimates, that, you know, the insured property losses from these tornadoes will be between $2 billion and $5 billion.</p><p>And the cost of the disasters is rising. So, in the '80s, major extreme weather costs less than $20 billion in damage each year on average. Since 2010, the average yearly damage has been $86 billion.</p><p>So, what's driving this? Is Mother Nature getting nastier or is human nature -- are we're building bigger things and there's more of us building in the same spots?</p><p>KAYDEN: It's a combination of all of those things. I mean, there does appear to be more high-risk storms, flooding, tornadoes, weather- related incidents that are occurring more and more and more, not earthquakes but weather related incidents.</p><p>And then, in some cases, we do have building, not even rebuilding but building in areas that are vulnerable, although I will say also that government has enacted laws in a variety of places which begin to restrict building in vulnerable areas and we're simply going to need more of that.</p><p>This is not simply a matter of individuals being protected against their own unwise behavior but it's society rescuing them, which puts them at risk.</p><p>BERMAN: So nice to meet you, today. Jerold Kayden, thank you very much for your insight on that. Of course, our thoughts and prayers with those people in Oklahoma as they prepare. It is clear, over the past 15 years, they have done much in that town to try to protect themselves. I'll give them best of luck as they try to do more.</p><p>Thank you so much, sir.</p><p>ROMANS: The Jersey Shore is open for business this Memorial Day weekend. According to a survey from AAA Mid-Atlanta, 79 percent of shoregoers say Sandy hasn't changed their summer vacation plans. Some even say they'll make an even greater effort to give their business to some of the places hit hardest by the storm.</p><p>Will the businesses be ready?</p><p>CNN's business correspondent Zain Asher took a trip down to Asbury Park.</p><p>She joins us this morning.</p><p>ZAIN ASHER, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Christine.</p><p>You know, it's not just a big weekend for businesses. It's also a big weekend for the city of Asbury Park itself. You got to remember the one-third of the city's revenue actually comes from beach tourism and so, Memorial Day weekend is unbelievably important to that.</p><p>Also, you know, these businesses are seasonal and so if they don't make enough revenue through Memorial Day, then they will have a tough time through the winter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARILYN SCHLOSSBACH, OWNER, LANGOSTA LOUNGE, ASBURY PARK: You feel like you're walking on the ocean.</p><p>ASHER (voice-over): New Jersey restaurant owner Marilyn Schlossbach always worries about the forecast.</p><p>SCHLOSSBACH: When we're open for business, every morning the first thing I look is at the weather.</p><p>ASHER: But it was the weather nearly destroyed her business.</p><p>SCHLOSSBACH: The window frames from these pavilions all blew in to the other side, so every surge of water that came up after that ended up in here.</p><p>ASHER: The rebuilding began almost as soon as the waters receded. She landed a $250,000 loan from the Small Business Administration and was able to reopen here in April. But it's been a challenging year to say the least. Schlossbach now survives on one-tenth of her salary and is struggling to make ends meet.</p><p>SCHLOSSBACH: Basically, I went from almost no debt to having about $25,000 in credit card bills and my entire savings wiped out.</p><p>ASHER: But she's hoping to see a turnaround and so is the rest of Asbury Park. On a gray day ahead of the holiday weekend, there's a sense of anticipation.</p><p>TOM GILMOUR, ASBURY PARK DIRECTOR OF COMMERCE: I think a lot of people will come to the shore this weekend to sort of check it out, see what it's really doing, but we're open, we're ready. We have great music here all the time. We're always partying. This is the place to come.</p><p>ASHER: You might say Asbury Park is one of the luckier spots on the Jersey Shore. Its music scene made famous by rock legend Bruce Springsteen, who got his start at the Stone Pony across the street, has kept Asbury Park in the spotlight in the aftermath of Sandy.</p><p>In the lesser-known and harder-hit town of Normandy Beach, Schlossbach has another restaurant, Labrador Lounge, which has also reopened, but she says customers are nowhere to be found.</p><p>SCHLOSSBACH: I'm dying down there. I've been open for a month; I have no customers. Everybody thinks the island is closed. You drive through there and you see houses on top of houses, restaurants and businesses aren't reopening, and I'm really scared because that's my home. ASHER: Memorial Day weekend is the shore's first big chance to bring business back and reward months of hard work. Schlossbach is back to worrying about the weather.</p><p>SCHLOSSBACH: To us, the weather is everything. If it is 90 degrees and sunny, we'll be packed. If it's raining and cold, we're not going to be busy.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ASHER: And you know, Christine, we've talked about the fact that 11.7 million Americans are out of work and that the unemployment rate is 7.5 percent.</p><p>But what's interesting is that she's actually having the opposite problem. She's looking to hire, but she says she cannot find workers. She says people sort of still have it in their mind that the Jersey Shore was completely destroyed by Sandy.</p><p>But, of course, you know, now that's really true anymore.</p><p>ROMANS: The last shore town I visited last summer with my kids is Asbury Park, and was so beautiful and so great. And it's changed so much over the last 10 years, so I really hope people get out there and spend some money on the shore because it really matters.</p><p>ASHER: It does.</p><p>ROMANS: Thanks, Zain.</p><p>Coming up, protecting your property before disaster strikes. The ins and outs of insurance, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS: Thousands of Oklahomans are picking up the pieces after this week's deadly tornadoes. The painful process of rebuilding for them starts now. It's one that's all too familiar to homeowners on the New Jersey Shore. They have spent the last seven months rebuilding their homes and their lives dealing with reconstruction and insurance claims, a process that's not always easy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS (voice-over): More than 2,400 homes damaged or destroyed by the devastating tornado that rocked Moore, Oklahoma. For homeowners forced out of their properties by a natural disaster, the painful process of rebuilding and insurance claims starts now.</p><p>Mary and Tom Walls know a thing or two about that. Seven months ago, their New Jersey home on the shore was flooded during Hurricane Sandy.</p><p>TOM WALLS, LAVAILETTE, N.J., RESIDENT: I think that there was a certain shock when the water was coming in my house. I couldn't believe it. It didn't knock the front door down. It just kind of rose up through the -- MARY WALLS, LAVAILETTE, N.J. RESIDENT: Bubbled up through the carpeting.</p><p>TOM WALLS: Immediately we walked around with my son, and that was my first thought of insurance actually.</p><p>ROMANS (on camera): What's the first call you make? The first call you make after everyone safe, is it to the person who sold you the insurance policy?</p><p>JEANNE SALVATORE, SR., V.P., INSURANCE INFORMATION INSTITUTE: Well, the first thing you should do is get in touch with your insurance company. Let them know the extent of the damage and where you can be reached. That's the most important thing to do.</p><p>ROMANS (voice-over): Jeanne Salvatore represents the insurance industry. She advises all homeowners to know what's in their insurance policies before disaster hits.</p><p>SALVATORE: There's a lot of disasters that are covered in just standard policies. I mean, you are covered for wind damage, for fire, for falling objects. The two big disasters that are not covered, one is flood and the other is earthquake. And you need to get separate insurance for those types of disasters.</p><p>ROMANS: The Walls home is covered for flood damage and they contacted their insurance company immediately after the storm. But they were frustrated by their carrier's slow response and decided not to wait for an insurance check to start the rebuilding process.</p><p>MARY WALLS: I had no clue what goes into this whole process. I actually had to say to a couple guys, what exactly takes place? Like break it down for me and tell me how this works. It was very foreign for me.</p><p>TOM WALLS: There were people that just experienced so much worse than we did. You know, my insurance company didn't pay for everything, but in the final analysis, I was satisfied with the dollar amount.</p><p>ROMANS: They spent most of the past seven months displaced, but were able to move back into their home last month.</p><p>TOM WALLS: Keep the faith. Things will get better.</p><p>MARY WALLS: Yes.</p><p>TOM WALLS: You need family and friends and --</p><p>MARY WALLS: And don't be afraid to ask for help.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: Best of luck to the Walls and also to everyone starting to rebuild now in Oklahoma.</p><p>A rare round of cheers in Congress this week as senators actually came to an agreement. A landmark immigration bill now headed to the floor. I'll explain what that could mean for your job, your paycheck, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS: A surprise in Washington this week -- real compromise. I'm Christine Romans. This is YOUR MONEY.</p><p>Twenty-seven years -- that's how long it's been since the United States overhauled immigration law. But this week we got a step closer.</p><p>On Tuesday, members of the Senate judiciary committee reached an agreement on a landmark immigration bill. Three Republicans joined the panel of Democrats in voting for the measure. It now moves to the Senate floor for a full vote.</p><p>Immigration touches every aspect of American life. It raises heated controversial issues about national security and cultural identity. But make no mistake, make no mistake. At its core, immigration is 100 percent about jobs.</p><p>Under this bill the number of highly skilled foreign workers admitted to the country would rise from 65,000 a year to 110,000 and possibly more, depending on the unemployment levels. That's a major win for big tech firms. Tech company CEOs say they can't find enough talent at home to fill the positions they need.</p><p>The legislation also scraps regulations requiring companies to make a good faith effort to find American workers before hiring from abroad. That now only applies to companies that hire foreign nationals for more than 15 percent of the workforce.</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum, millions of undocumented workers would be granted registered provisional immigrant status, meaning they can stay in the country legally. They can work in this country legally. After a decade, they would become eligible for a green card and three years later full citizenship.</p><p>The bill also establishes a new visa program for low skilled workers on America's farms and elsewhere.</p><p>Judiciary Committee member Jeff Sessions, a Republican, he voted against the measure. He is worried authorizing millions of undocumented workers to take jobs legally will push down already stagnant wages. That hurts low skilled Americans, he says, the most vulnerable people in this workforce right now.</p><p>As he put it, quote, \"My Republican colleagues seem oblivious to the free market.\"</p><p>Ana Navarro is a CNN contributor and a Republican strategist.</p><p>Ana, you are a Republican in favor of immigration reform. You got to tell me, how divided is your party on this issue right now? How do the factions stack up here?</p><p>ANA NAVARRO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: You know, Christine, I think the division is highly exaggerated. I don't see the level of division that I saw in 2007 or that I have seen in the past.</p><p>Most Republicans agree that what we have right now is de facto amnesty, that it is a broken system and that it needs to be resolved. There are some differences on how to resolve that, but there is almost consensus on the first part.</p><p>And I would tell you that the Republicans that matter, the ones that draft policy, the ones that shape the agenda, are very committed to moving something and passing something.</p><p>ROMANS: I will say you do not see the heat and sort of the public interest and also misinformation that you saw in 2007. This has been moving quickly and sort of under the radar, wouldn't you agree?</p><p>NAVARRO: I think a few things are happening. First of all, there is a lot of things going on at the same time. It is almost hard to keep up with the scandal du jour in Washington.</p><p>But I also think having my senator, I think having Marco Rubio in the mix is making a huge difference because he is uniquely situated to explain this and to talk about this bill and the benefits of this bill as a Hispanic, as a Republican, and as somebody that really understands and communicates and identifies with the base of the Republican Party.</p><p>ROMANS: He doesn't agree with another senator that has a voice on this, too.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAVARRO: -- conservative host.</p><p>ROMANS: When you look at the two different positions of Senator Cruz and Senator Rubio, it sort of illustrates what Republicans are grappling with right now.</p><p>NAVARRO: You know, I have been somewhat surprised by the attitude and the votes of Senator Cruz. I think he has changed somewhat from when he was back in 2000, working in the Bush campaign, but also, he is -- at this point he is in the minority in the Republican faction of the Senate. You're seeing that this thing is moving along.</p><p>What we saw this week is we saw the four members of the Senate Gang of Eight who were also members of the Judiciary Committee stick together and protect the integrity of the deal they crafted. They swatted away anything that would be a poison pill amendment.</p><p>On -- both two Democrats did it as well as the two Republicans that were in the committee. So there is great commitment to getting this deal through.</p><p>ROMANS: All right, Ana Navarro, nothing more interesting and controversial than when you put politics, jobs and immigration all in one discussion. Certainly this discussion will only get louder and more interesting over the next few weeks. Thanks, Ana. NAVARRO: Thank you.</p><p>ROMANS: Some in government want to take a bigger bite out of Apple.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHN MCCAIN, (R) ARIZONA: It is past time for American corporations like Apple to reorganize their tax strategies, to pay what they should and invest again in the American economy.</p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL, (R) KENTUCKY: I frankly think the committee should apologize to Apple.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Is this a greedy company, a broken tax system? The truth about big corporate tax loopholes, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS: I have here in my hands the U.S. tax code. This big binder is one of 16, 16 binders, 74,000 pages is the U.S. tax code. It is a confusing maze for both individuals and corporations.</p><p>The top tax rate for businesses is 35 percent. But many companies don't pay that. They don't pay that because within all of these books, within all of these words, within 74,000 pages are scores, hundreds, thousands of loopholes for companies. And companies don't pay those top tax rates, including Apple.</p><p>This week a Senate committee grilled Apple CEO Tim Cook on the company's tax practices. The committee wrote a scathing report that found Apple uses subsidiaries in Ireland to avoid paying taxes, all legal because of all of these books here behind me.</p><p>Senator John McCain coauthored that report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCAIN: America's tax system is broken and uncompetitive and I have long supported efforts to modernize it. However, I will not allow that position to be used as an excuse to turn a blind eye to the highly questionable tax strategies used by Apple.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: But Apple CEO Tim Cook defended his company.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, APPLE CEO: We pay all of the taxes we owe, every single dollar. We not only comply with the laws, but we comply with the spirit of the laws. We don't depend on tax gimmicks. We don't move intellectual property offshore and use it to sell our products back to the United States to avoid taxes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Apple isn't doing anything illegal. It is simply doing what every U.S. company does, take advantage of all of these loopholes that Congress itself created. It is a point Senator Rand Paul made during one of the hearings more fire-breathing moments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL, (R) KENTUCKY: I frankly think the committee should apologize to Apple. I think that the Congress should be on trial here for creating a bizarre and byzantine tax code that runs into the tens of thousands of pages, for creating a tax code that simply doesn't compete with the rest of the world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: So this is that tax code, and Paul went on to say that Congress doesn't need to be having a hearing. It needs to be looking in a mirror. It needs a mirror because it is time for Congress to take a good look at itself before castigating companies for legally navigating the system.</p><p>David Cay Johnston is a columnist for \"Tax Analysts\"; Jeanne Sahadi is a senior writer for CNN Money.</p><p>David, Congress creates tax laws, and now senators are grilling Apple over loopholes in the laws.</p><p>Is that fair? Isn't tax reform really the answer here?</p><p>DAVID CAY JOHNSTON, COLUMNIST, \"TAX ANALYSTS\": Well, of course tax reform is the answer. But, remember, the companies are the ones who go and give campaign contributions and hire relatives of lawmakers to get all these complexities.</p><p>For 100 million of the 140 million tax returns filed in this country by individuals, it's so simple you can put it on one page. In fact, I have written you could eliminate tax filing.</p><p>But companies like Apple engage in strategies that are, to cite the title of my book on the subject, \"Perfectly Legal,\" but have the same effect of not paying taxes. And that means you and I either have to get less government services, pay higher taxes or have the government take on more debt while Apple defers its taxes.</p><p>And I have a column laying out how this hits your pocketbook, how Apple is costing you money; that's at the nationalmemo.com today.</p><p>ROMANS: And you can draw that direct connection, you draw the direct connection with complicated and sometimes not very complicated tax strategies, usually involving Ireland, that keep a company's tax below and my tax bill where it stands now?</p><p>JOHNSTON: And here is the simple way to think about it. Imagine if, instead of having your taxes taken out of your check before you got it, you could keep that money and pay the government 30 years from now.</p><p>If you invested that money at 3 percent, it would be 2.5 times as large in the future, but the taxes would be the same. It is a zero interest loan. You would actually make money off the tax system.</p><p>And that's what Apple and other big companies do. The tax system is a profit center, and indeed Enron called its tax department a profit center.</p><p>ROMANS: Jeanne Sahadi is here with me, and I have to say that when I talk about taxes and budgets, Jeanne is the one. We just chat about taxes and budgets all the time. Apple's complex tax strategies really draw -- it's an example of what's wrong with our tax code. Explain to me how U.S. multinationals take advantage of these loopholes in the system.</p><p>JEANNE SAHADI, SENIOR WRITER, CNNMONEY.COM: Well, one of the big things that we discussed on Tuesday when Apple was on the Hill was something called a cost-sharing agreement. U.S. multinationals choose to share things like the costs of research and development, whether they are offshore subsidiaries that are located in low tax or, in the case of Ireland, it's in no tax countries.</p><p>What the problem with that is, tax experts say, is that they give the offshore subsidiaries a sweetheart deal that they would not give an outside party. So if I am going to invite you in to get in on the ground floor of my next great product, I will make you pay for that.</p><p>What happened in the case of Apple is that they -- the offshore subsidiaries pay a little bit more than 50 percent of the costs but they earned about 15 times the profits on their investment; whereas the U.S.-based operation only earned about eight times.</p><p>So that sort of raises a red flag to tax experts, saying is that really a fair market price that you charge your subsidiaries?</p><p>And that offshores profits that then, as David noted, don't get paid -- U.S. taxes are not paid on that for years and years and years because they don't bring the money back home.</p><p>ROMANS: David, what this all tells me, what I learned week, listening to those hearings, listening to fire-breathing senators angry about a tax code that they created, what it just cements, in my opinion, is that executives in charge of tax departments at major corporations are probably the most important people in business today.</p><p>Do you agree?</p><p>JOHNSTON: They're certainly very, very important. They are very well paid. GE has it is estimated more than 800 tax lawyers. This is a huge waste of human capital we should be putting into other things. But what we shouldn't do is just cut tax rates, because if we just cut tax rates, everything that's wrong will stay in place.</p><p>We need to have real fundamental reform. We should have, I believe, something called signal company accounting that would end the practice Jeanne described, by the way, much better than any of the newspapers I read this morning.</p><p>And we should end deferrals. We require companies to keep two sets of books, one for shareholders, one for the IRS. I think we should go to unified accounting.</p><p>ROMANS: All right, well, let's come back and talk taxes again sometime soon because I think it is not going away. One thing certain, death, taxes, and fighting about the taxes. Thanks so much, David and Jeanne.</p><p>Coming up, Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer promises the company won't screw up Tumblr. But what do Tumblr users really want to know? What happens with all of that adult content? That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS: It is official. Tumblr is becoming part of Yahoo!. Now what? Yahoo! bought the blogging website for $1.1 billion this week, but Tumblr might be worth even more to Yahoo!. Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer promised Tumblr users that her company, quote, \"won't screw this up,\" but users are skeptical.</p><p>CNNMoney's technology correspondent Laurie Segall sat down with Tumblr CEO David Karp this week.</p><p>And I think it is so interesting this kid didn't even go -- didn't even finish high school and now he is negotiating with Marissa Mayer, probably one of the most famous female tech executives, for his company. What was her role in all of this?</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT, CNNMONEY.COM: Marissa Mayer has for some reason this charge in the tech industry. You see, all of these young entrepreneurs going to Yahoo! now, and Yahoo! wasn't able to get a lot of these younger start-ups to get involved. It wasn't cool to be acquired by Yahoo!.</p><p>And I will say this. David Karp really defines cool. He is a New York-based entrepreneur. He used to drive a Vespa around the streets; he's got this beautiful girlfriend.</p><p>ROMANS: A gray hoodie.</p><p>SEGALL: Yes, exactly, he wears a hoodie. He is very much cool. And so Yahoo! really wants to be cool. When I spoke to him -- I sat down with him and he said really it wasn't just about Yahoo!. It was Marissa Mayer, formerly Google and now she's at Yahoo!. Listen to what he said to me. Christine.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID KARP, FOUNDER AND CEO, TUMBLR: Not only is she a genius of the geniuses, she is something that I really value, which is she was one of the most uniquely happy and productive people I have ever met, certainly in this industry. And that's something that we just strive for in our team is that sense of eternal optimism and purpose. She just brings that in a profound way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: So interesting because, you know what, I think people think he's made maybe $250 million of his own money on this.</p><p>Here's a kid, born and raised in Manhattan; his parents let him drop out of high school because, you know, high school wasn't really feeding his brain. They let him work on his own and make his own programs. This is not your typical kid.</p><p>SEGALL: Absolutely not. I will say when he showed up to the interview, he brought his mom. They're from the Upper West Side here. He said he doesn't suggest that entrepreneurs should drop out. You hear this and you say, OK, maybe everyone should drop out and got sell their company for $1 billion.</p><p>But he said this has been a full time job since he was 14. He said his parents were very different than many other parents because they supported him leaving. He actually told me a little bit about it. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KARP: I give both my parents so much credit for this. It was, in fact, their idea. I knew what I wanted to be working on. I wasn't really getting it out of school at the time. My parents saw that. They helped me find opportunities where I could pursue that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: We have been hearing about Tumblr users, though, jumping ship all week.</p><p>What is the status of what the users are saying about this acquisition -- sorry, partnership?</p><p>SEGALL: Sure. Exactly. Look, people are worried. The Tumblr users, there is a certain user base. They have fiercely independent people pouring their hearts out on these blogs. And a lot of people went to WordPress, which is their biggest competitor.</p><p>And I had the opportunity to sit down with the founder of WordPress, Matt Mullenweg. They're looking at the 10th anniversary. Believe it or not, they have been around for 10 years.</p><p>And he said, look, people jump ship any time this kind of thing happens. We'll see if it sticks. But what he said that was very interesting is they didn't sell for enough. Listen to what he told me.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATT MULLENWEG, FOUNDER AND CEO, WORDPRESS: Yahoo! needs somewhere to work and they need a social network, and really, the only criticism I have for the whole deal is I think they sold for too little. Like I said, blogging platforms have huge potential, and they have fantastic engagement as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEGALL: So if you look in the future, could Tumblr have sold for not $1.1 billion but tens of billions of dollars? That's what Matt says. And he says that this was very bittersweet, because this kind of platform, you look in the future, it could have -- it could be very, very successful and for advertisers, too.</p><p>ROMANS: We know there is a lot of adult content on Tumblr. Should users expect big changes?</p><p>SEGALL: I asked him that. And I will say this. He was a little bit awkward about that answer. I thought maybe it was because I was asking him about the porn problem on Tumblr in front of his mother.</p><p>But what he really said was nothing is going to change. Those guidelines are strict. But I think we're -- honestly I think it will take time. We'll look, because people are posting a lot of times illegal material on Tumblr. Now it is part of a big public company. You just can't ignore that now.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes. All right. Laurie Segall, such an interesting interview. I'm glad you got us a chance to sit down with him. We'll talk to you again very, very soon.</p><p>And coming up, most days they grade tests, they assign book reports, but this week teachers in Oklahoma put their lives on the line to protect the children they teach. Our look at the courage of the profession, the courage of teachers, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS: When you drop your child off at school in the morning you never think it is the last time you will see your little boy or little girl. But as we've learned too often in the past few months there do come days when is it just might be.</p><p>I want you to listen to something. It's the sound of 25 terrified children huddled inside in an elementary school bathroom as a massive tornado rains debris on them. You can hear sixth grade teacher Lynne Breton trying to reassure them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LYNNE BRETON, TEACHER: You're OK. You're OK. You're OK. You're OK.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: You're OK. This week as the full horror of the deadly tornado in Oklahoma emerged, so did story after story of heroic teachers who put themselves between their tiny charges and the fury of that twister.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: His teacher is in the hospital. His teacher saved his life.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Who is his teacher?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Ms. Lowe (ph). I have no doubt God and his teacher, they lifted a wall off of these kids, several kids.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Me and four other guys pulled a teacher out. She was on top of three kids. The kids were fine. She was hurt pretty bad.</p><p>SUZANNE HALEY, TEACHER: It is nothing anybody wouldn't do. These children, we see their smiles, their tears, every day, in and out. And we love them. And they're our babies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: This isn't the first time teachers have bravely stood up in the face of terror.</p><p>Nearly six months ago in Newtown, Connecticut, six teachers died trying to shield their students from a gunman bent on mass murder.</p><p>In February, <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>posthumously awarded those educators the Medal of Freedom.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They could have taken shelter by themselves. They could have focused on their own safety, on their own well-being, but they didn't. They gave their lives to protect the precious children in their care.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Away from the headlines, teachers are called on every day to exhibit a quiet heroism that can change lives. We depend on them not only to educate our kids, to prepare our kids for the rest of their lives but also to detect whether a child is being abused or to intervene if a child is being bullied.</p><p>Let's not forget, more than 355,000 teacher jobs have been lost since June of 2009, when the recession officially ended. Since the recession ended, the average starting salary in education, about $40,000 a year.</p><p>College grads who start in communications or health sciences are making more. Someone who gets into teaching clearly isn't doing it for the money. They are doing it, we know, to shape young lives, to provide the knowledge that will enable the next generation to compete in the global economy.</p><p>But sometimes in between a mundane math quiz or a lesson on subject- verb agreement, they're asked to sacrifice their own safety. When they do, so often they say they were just doing their jobs.</p><p>We wanted to take a moment to say thank you to this country's teachers. That's what they're doing in Moore, Oklahoma.</p><p>Just listen to David Wheeler, who says his son, Gabriel, is alive today, alive thanks to the actions of his third grade teacher Julie Simon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID WHEELER, TORNADO SURVIVOR: She is a member of our family for the rest of our lives. And she will be a part of it forever. There is nothing that we can give to her that will repay her. We just thank you, Julie, and we love you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: The largest profession in America and none more important, our sentiments exactly.</p><p>Thanks for joining the conversation this week on YOUR MONEY. We're here every Saturday at 9:30 am, 2:00 pm Eastern, and also Sunday at 3:00 pm. Until then you can find me on Facebook and on Twitter.

I'm Christine Romans.  This is YOUR MONEY.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the first time since 2008, more Americans now say the economy is getting better than getting worse.  Gallup has tracked Americans' economic confidence every week since the financial crisis and it now stands at a 5-year high.  Why?  Well, first, stocks are at record highs; that's boosting everyone's 401(k)s.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fidelity said the average account is now $80,900, up a whopping 75 percent from the market low in 2009.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For employees 55 and older, the average account now holds $255,000. That's nearly doubled over the past four years.  </p><p>Next, home values are rising.  We hope that's making you feel a little richer.  We learned this week the median price of a home sold in April jumped 11 percent from a year ago.  It's the 14th straight year over year pricing increase and the fifth in a row in the double digits.  </p><p>And finally, unemployment, 7.5 percent, the lowest since December 2008.  Yes, it is still too high, way too high; millions of Americans are out of work; they are underemployed, but the signs point to an improving labor market.  </p><p>So is this recovery, four years in now, solid enough for most Americans to feel it, and not just the best earners?  And what does it mean for President Obama?  </p><p>CNN's chief political correspondent Candy Crowley is the anchor of \"STATE OF THE UNION\".  </p><p>Candy, the president has been knocked off message lately, controversies over Benghazi, the IRS targeting the Tea Party, the administration going after reporter phone records.  </p><p>Will a positive economic message ultimately drown out those controversies?  </p><p>CANDY CROWLEY, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Likely not, to tell you the truth.  First of all, we're not at the end of the IRS controversy.  So it's still playing out.   Certainly, there are elements of Benghazi as well, and there is the AP; in this new report now, that they went after another reporter who revealed something about North Korea.  </p><p>So these things will be ongoing because Congress keeps them ongoing. And as you know, this is a town that is sort of driven -- actually, it's a country where great news, I think the economy, you'll see the president out there kind of talking about it and pushing it.  </p><p>But on the other hand, good news is not where headlines go.  The headlines still are on the IRS and things like that.  It's just hard to get this off the table.  It certainly helps the president, it strengthens his hand as you move forward with legislation; I don't think it erases the headlines.</p><p>ROMANS:  Yes.</p><p>Stephen Moore, an editorial writer for \"The Wall Street Journal\" with us also today.  </p><p>Stephen, you admit you're seeing signs of a pickup in the economy.  </p><p>Does the president deserve any of the credit for it?  </p><p>STEPHEN MOORE, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Well, you've been waiting to ask me that question for a long time, Christine.</p><p>ROMANS:  About three years, actually.</p><p>MOORE:  There's no question the economy is picking up.  I'm feeling pretty bullish about the economy.  You did a nice summary about the good news in the economy.  And, by the way, let's not get carried away.  It's still, for middle class and lower income people, they're still really struggling.  We haven't seen wage increases and salary increases.  </p><p>In fact, if you look at the median wage over the last four years of this recovery, it's fallen a little bit, not risen.  And unemployment is still too high, but you talk about the good things in the economy, and I would point to a couple things.  One is those low interest rates out there are really providing a boom to the stock market and a boom to the housing market.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROMANS:  You're going to point out that's not the president's doing?  </p><p>MOORE:  Well, look, the president gets the credit because he's there when it happened.  Reagan gets credit for the boom that happened under his term.  Obviously Bill Clinton got credit for the boom under his.  </p><p>But the other thing is one of the reasons the president might not get total credit for what is going on right now is that the biggest boom sector right now is the oil and gas industry.  There's just no question it's been carrying the rest of the economy on its back, and let's face it, Christine, he hasn't been the biggest advocate of oil and gas.  In fact, he's, if anything, tried to hold that sector back.</p><p>ROMANS:  I want to bring in Rana Foroohar.  She's the assistant managing editor at \"Time\".</p><p>And he brings up a very good point, not everyone is feeling this.</p><p>And I wanted to show the statistic.  Demos, it's a left-leaning policy group, says a third of Americans are paid less than $24,000 a year.  A third of American workers earn less than $24,000 a year.</p><p>Can you have an American recovery where a third of the people who are working are making so little money?</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, ASSISTANT MANAGING EDITOR, \"TIME\":  No, I don't think you really can have a truly robust recovery.  I mean, the fact is, we're still in a 2 percent economy.</p><p>The private sector is recovering.  In fact,  if you stripped out the government, we'd be in a 3 percent economy, in part because of, as Stephen mentioned, oil and gas, but also housing and some other sectors.</p><p>But, ultimately, if you look at the fastest growing job categories in this country, they are low wage jobs.  Eight out of 10 of the fastest growing categories make very low wages.  And when you have a 70 percent consumer economy, as we do, it's really hard to imagine how we're going to go back up to historic growth levels unless we can get these middle class jobs going.</p><p>ROMANS:  And that brings back to Candy, where, you know, our own CNN/ORC polling, not quite as rosy as the Gallup polling I gave you earlier.</p><p>Two-thirds of Americans still say the economy is in poor shape.</p><p>There are a few glimmers of optimism, though, when you dig in these numbers.  Here's one:  the number of people who say conditions are poor, the worst option offered is at the lowest point in over a year.</p><p>So, Candy, what is the administration's strategy on the economy as it's knocked off message here?</p><p>CROWLEY:  In terms of actual policy, they're now around the margins of this.  They push jobs for veterans, legislation like that, much of what the president is going to do or wants to do was put in his budget.</p><p>This is still an economy that doesn't have a government with a lot of money to spend.  There's still that big old debt, Republicans are still concentrated on that as is some Democrats.  So there's not a lot of, hey, let's really prime this some more and throw this money into a stimulus program.  There's not that kind of money left.</p><p>So there are some things that he's doing and has proposed to increase the job rate among various groups, but you're not going to see anything major.  I think this is one of those things where you will hear the president continue to talk about this certainly so long as those numbers continue to go up.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROMANS:  Go ahead.</p><p>MOORE:  You know, what's interesting about that, Candy, is that, as I talk to businessmen and women, they are feeling more optimistic, no question about it.  And these are people who hire Americans.</p><p>One of the things that's interesting is they're not as afraid of President Obama and the policies that are coming out of Washington as they were in the first term.  I mean, think about the first term.  We had, you know, the stimulus, the huge debt, ObamaCare, you know, there was talk about union card check, and cap and trade laws.  </p><p>Those kinds of threats from Washington have really subsided and I think that's one of the reasons the private sector is starting to take off.</p><p>CROWLEY:  Sure, absolutely.  Businesses, in general, love it when Washington isn't doing anything.</p><p>MOORE:  That's right.  Exactly, bingo.</p><p>ROMANS:  Except when they bring you to the brink of paralysis because of our debt ceiling and all that stuff.  </p><p>I mean, there is the conventional wisdom, Rana, you know, a gridlock in Washington is good for business, but it doesn't feel that way this time.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  It certainly doesn't feel that way.  I think it's going to be interesting to see how the markets react and just how much of the wealth that we've been feeling is down to the Fed and how much of it is down to the real economy.</p><p>ROMANS:  I know.  And the Fed -- oh, I think the Fed and the discussions happening within the Fed and about the Fed are going to be so important in the months going on.</p><p>Candy, Stephen and Rana -- thank you so much all of you.</p><p>CROWLEY:  Thanks.</p><p>MOORE:  Thank you.</p><p>ROMANS:  Coming up, less than a week after deadly tornadoes tore through more Oklahoma, residents vow to rebuild.  But does that make sense economic sense?  That's next on YOUR MONEY.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>ROMANS:  Twenty-four dead, hundreds of buildings destroyed, billions of dollars in property lost but residents of Moore, Oklahoma, have seen this before.  This is the third, the third time in 15 years that tornadoes have carved a path through Moore. So, after three tornadoes, you might be surprised by this response.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV.  MARY FALLIN (R), OKLAHOMA:  We will get through this.  We will overcome, and we will rebuild.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS:  We will rebuild.  Again, she says.</p><p>I want to bring in Jerold Kayden.  He's a professor of urban planning and design at Harvard's Graduate School of Design.</p><p>So nice to see you.  Thanks for coming by.</p><p>You know, rebuilding really heals psychological wounds.  We've heard again and again people say this is my home, I'm going to rebuild.  We are strong.  We will get through it.</p><p>But is it smart to rebuild in the same place where disaster has struck so many times?</p><p>JEROLD KAYDEN, PROFESSOR, HARVARD GRADUATE SCHOOL OF DESIGN:  Smart is, of course, in the brain of the beholder, and some people will say it is smart and others will say it's the opposite of smart.</p><p>Look, we are a resolute, some would even say, stubborn people.  As you just said, we're going to rebuild, we're going to show that storm, even we're going to show the terrorists that we rebuild in the same area.  Nothing is going to stop us.</p><p>Also, we have to recognize these are people's homes, their streets, their neighborhoods where they grew up, where they have memories. We're very attached to place, so where we see the images of a desolate, destroyed area, they're actually seeing their street still.</p><p>Yes, it's their destroyed house, but this is where they grew up, this is where they want to continue to live.  So we're a compassionate people and we honor that sort of rebuilding effort, sometimes in unwise ways.</p><p>And that's where it actually isn't smart.  It can indeed lead to unwise behavior and it's a question of both government policy and individuals recognizing that we have to be smarter in the future.</p><p>ROMANS:  So if we rebuild and we rebuild in better ways or we learn lessons in the rebuilding, that's what's really a key, I think, here.</p><p>You know, in 1999, President Clinton urged Moore's residents then to invest in safe rooms, reinforced spaces that can resist tornadoes. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM J. CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT:  If you don't remember anything else I say today, remember this, for goodness sakes, build a safe room in your house when you rebuild.  Go in and do the -- any kind of alterations you have to do.  It will be the cheapest $2,000 you ever spent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS:  And, you know, since 1993, FEMA has paid more than $57 million for 12,000 private and public safe rooms in Oklahoma.  But still, it's not everyone.  It's not everywhere.</p><p>Vital places like Morris Plaza Towers Elementary School, they were not protected when those tornadoes came.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR GLENN LEWIS, MOORE, OKLAHOMA:  It's about the money and the statistics.  An F-5 tornado is very rare.  It's 1 percent to 2 percent of the tornadoes.  Same reason they don't have safe rooms for earthquakes, they don't work all the time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS:  My question to you is whether it's safe rooms for tornadoes, earthquake proofing, flood prevention measures, who pays for it?  Who should pay for it?</p><p>KAYDEN:  It's really the central question now going forward.  I think on smaller types of things that are manageable by a middle class family, it is not unreasonable to ask at a minimum that they share, if not pay for the entire cost.  </p><p>No one hesitates when government imposes a regulation, for example that, going forward, requires homeowners to install smoke alarms or carbon monoxide detectors.  The reason nobody objects is first of all it's smart for safety but also it's a very small cost.</p><p>The issue here is the cost is slightly more and yet we should be asking people to bear some of that burden and if government can provide some assistance, particularly in the aftermath of a disaster or over time to help people contribute to this, then it may be reasonable to do that of course given budget constraints.</p><p>ROMANS:  That's a key point, that given budget constraints, because you hear on the one hand people talk about big government and government intrusion, too much regulation and this and that, and then something like this happens and you hear with almost unanimity, why wasn't there a safe room in that school?  Because it costs money to build these things and the public has to pay for it.</p><p>KAYDEN:  Right.  But it's a two-step dance.  After the disaster, people understandably say, Government, come here and rescue me. Government, come here and give me money to rebuild.  </p><p>And then when government says, yes, but in the future you will not be able to rebuild in certain areas or in the future you must install a safe room or a basement in terms of tornadoes or whatever it may be, then you hear people say, no regulation, no government.</p><p>So, it's this dilemma between wanting government and not wanting government.</p><p>ROMANS:  Let me ask you this.  EQECAT -- it's a disaster modeling firm -- it says that it estimates, that, you know, the insured property losses from these tornadoes will be between $2 billion and $5 billion.</p><p>And the cost of the disasters is rising.  So, in the '80s, major extreme weather costs less than $20 billion in damage each year on average.  Since 2010, the average yearly damage has been $86 billion.  </p><p>So, what's driving this?  Is Mother Nature getting nastier or is human nature -- are we're building bigger things and there's more of us building in the same spots?</p><p>KAYDEN:  It's a combination of all of those things.  I mean, there does appear to be more high-risk storms, flooding, tornadoes, weather- related incidents that are occurring more and more and more, not earthquakes but weather related incidents.</p><p>And then, in some cases, we do have building, not even rebuilding but building in areas that are vulnerable, although I will say also that government has enacted laws in a variety of places which begin to restrict building in vulnerable areas and we're simply going to need more of that.  </p><p>This is not simply a matter of individuals being protected against their own unwise behavior but it's society rescuing them, which puts them at risk.</p><p>BERMAN:  So nice to meet you, today.  Jerold Kayden, thank you very much for your insight on that.  Of course, our thoughts and prayers with those people in Oklahoma as they prepare.  It is clear, over the past 15 years, they have done much in that town to try to protect themselves.  I'll give them best of luck as they try to do more.  </p><p>Thank you so much, sir.</p><p>ROMANS:  The Jersey Shore is open for business this Memorial Day weekend.  According to a survey from AAA Mid-Atlanta, 79 percent of shoregoers say Sandy hasn't changed their summer vacation plans.  Some even say they'll make an even greater effort to give their business to some of the places hit hardest by the storm.</p><p>Will the businesses be ready?  </p><p>CNN's business correspondent Zain Asher took a trip down to Asbury Park.</p><p>She joins us this morning.</p><p>ZAIN ASHER, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Christine.</p><p>You know, it's not just a big weekend for businesses.  It's also a big weekend for the city of Asbury Park itself.  You got to remember the one-third of the city's revenue actually comes from beach tourism and so, Memorial Day weekend is unbelievably important to that.</p><p>Also, you know, these businesses are seasonal and so if they don't make enough revenue through Memorial Day, then they will have a tough time through the winter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARILYN SCHLOSSBACH, OWNER, LANGOSTA LOUNGE, ASBURY PARK:  You feel like you're walking on the ocean.</p><p>ASHER (voice-over):  New Jersey restaurant owner Marilyn Schlossbach always worries about the forecast.</p><p>SCHLOSSBACH:  When we're open for business, every morning the first thing I look is at the weather.</p><p>ASHER:  But it was the weather nearly destroyed her business.</p><p>SCHLOSSBACH:  The window frames from these pavilions all blew in to the other side, so every surge of water that came up after that ended up in here.</p><p>ASHER:  The rebuilding began almost as soon as the waters receded. She landed a $250,000 loan from the Small Business Administration and was able to reopen here in April.  But it's been a challenging year to say the least.  Schlossbach now survives on one-tenth of her salary and is struggling to make ends meet.</p><p>SCHLOSSBACH:  Basically, I went from almost no debt to having about $25,000 in credit card bills and my entire savings wiped out.</p><p>ASHER:  But she's hoping to see a turnaround and so is the rest of Asbury Park.  On a gray day ahead of the holiday weekend, there's a sense of anticipation.</p><p>TOM GILMOUR, ASBURY PARK DIRECTOR OF COMMERCE:  I think a lot of people will come to the shore this weekend to sort of check it out, see what it's really doing, but we're open, we're ready.  We have great music here all the time.  We're always partying.  This is the place to come.</p><p>ASHER:  You might say Asbury Park is one of the luckier spots on the Jersey Shore.  Its music scene made famous by rock legend Bruce Springsteen, who got his start at the Stone Pony across the street, has kept Asbury Park in the spotlight in the aftermath of Sandy.</p><p>In the lesser-known and harder-hit town of Normandy Beach, Schlossbach has another restaurant, Labrador Lounge, which has also reopened, but she says customers are nowhere to be found.</p><p>SCHLOSSBACH:  I'm dying down there.  I've been open for a month; I have no customers.  Everybody thinks the island is closed.  You drive through there and you see houses on top of houses, restaurants and businesses aren't reopening, and I'm really scared because that's my home. ASHER:  Memorial Day weekend is the shore's first big chance to bring business back and reward months of hard work.  Schlossbach is back to worrying about the weather.</p><p>SCHLOSSBACH:  To us, the weather is everything.  If it is 90 degrees and sunny, we'll be packed.  If it's raining and cold, we're not going to be busy.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ASHER:  And you know, Christine, we've talked about the fact that 11.7 million Americans are out of work and that the unemployment rate is 7.5 percent.  </p><p>But what's interesting is that she's actually having the opposite problem.  She's looking to hire, but she says she cannot find workers. She says people sort of still have it in their mind that the Jersey Shore was completely destroyed by Sandy.</p><p>But, of course, you know, now that's really true anymore.</p><p>ROMANS:  The last shore town I visited last summer with my kids is Asbury Park, and was so beautiful and so great.  And it's changed so much over the last 10 years, so I really hope people get out there and spend some money on the shore because it really matters.</p><p>ASHER:  It does.</p><p>ROMANS:  Thanks, Zain.</p><p>Coming up, protecting your property before disaster strikes.  The ins and outs of insurance, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS:  Thousands of Oklahomans are picking up the pieces after this week's deadly tornadoes.  The painful process of rebuilding for them starts now.  It's one that's all too familiar to homeowners on the New Jersey Shore.  They have spent the last seven months rebuilding their homes and their lives dealing with reconstruction and insurance claims, a process that's not always easy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS (voice-over):  More than 2,400 homes damaged or destroyed by the devastating tornado that rocked Moore, Oklahoma.  For homeowners forced out of their properties by a natural disaster, the painful process of rebuilding and insurance claims starts now.</p><p>Mary and Tom Walls know a thing or two about that.  Seven months ago, their New Jersey home on the shore was flooded during Hurricane Sandy.</p><p>TOM WALLS, LAVAILETTE, N.J., RESIDENT:  I think that there was a certain shock when the water was coming in my house.  I couldn't believe it.  It didn't knock the front door down.  It just kind of rose up through the -- MARY WALLS, LAVAILETTE, N.J.  RESIDENT:  Bubbled up through the carpeting.</p><p>TOM WALLS:  Immediately we walked around with my son, and that was my first thought of insurance actually.</p><p>ROMANS (on camera):  What's the first call you make?  The first call you make after everyone safe, is it to the person who sold you the insurance policy?</p><p>JEANNE SALVATORE, SR., V.P., INSURANCE INFORMATION INSTITUTE:  Well, the first thing you should do is get in touch with your insurance company.  Let them know the extent of the damage and where you can be reached.  That's the most important thing to do.</p><p>ROMANS (voice-over):  Jeanne Salvatore represents the insurance industry.  She advises all homeowners to know what's in their insurance policies before disaster hits.</p><p>SALVATORE:  There's a lot of disasters that are covered in just standard policies.  I mean, you are covered for wind damage, for fire, for falling objects.  The two big disasters that are not covered, one is flood and the other is earthquake.  And you need to get separate insurance for those types of disasters.</p><p>ROMANS:  The Walls home is covered for flood damage and they contacted their insurance company immediately after the storm.  But they were frustrated by their carrier's slow response and decided not to wait for an insurance check to start the rebuilding process.</p><p>MARY WALLS:  I had no clue what goes into this whole process.  I actually had to say to a couple guys, what exactly takes place?  Like break it down for me and tell me how this works.  It was very foreign for me.</p><p>TOM WALLS:  There were people that just experienced so much worse than we did.  You know, my insurance company didn't pay for everything, but in the final analysis, I was satisfied with the dollar amount.</p><p>ROMANS:  They spent most of the past seven months displaced, but were able to move back into their home last month.</p><p>TOM WALLS:  Keep the faith.  Things will get better.</p><p>MARY WALLS:  Yes.</p><p>TOM WALLS:  You need family and friends and --</p><p>MARY WALLS:  And don't be afraid to ask for help.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS:  Best of luck to the Walls and also to everyone starting to rebuild now in Oklahoma.</p><p>A rare round of cheers in Congress this week as senators actually came to an agreement.  A landmark immigration bill now headed to the floor. I'll explain what that could mean for your job, your paycheck, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS:  A surprise in Washington this week -- real compromise.  I'm Christine Romans.  This is YOUR MONEY.</p><p>Twenty-seven years -- that's how long it's been since the United States overhauled immigration law.  But this week we got a step closer.  </p><p>On Tuesday, members of the Senate judiciary committee reached an agreement on a landmark immigration bill.  Three Republicans joined the panel of Democrats in voting for the measure.  It now moves to the Senate floor for a full vote.</p><p>Immigration touches every aspect of American life.  It raises heated controversial issues about national security and cultural identity. But make no mistake, make no mistake.  At its core, immigration is 100 percent about jobs.  </p><p>Under this bill the number of highly skilled foreign workers admitted to the country would rise from 65,000 a year to 110,000 and possibly more, depending on the unemployment levels.  That's a major win for big tech firms.  Tech company CEOs say they can't find enough talent at home to fill the positions they need.</p><p>The legislation also scraps regulations requiring companies to make a good faith effort to find American workers before hiring from abroad. That now only applies to companies that hire foreign nationals for more than 15 percent of the workforce.</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum, millions of undocumented workers would be granted registered provisional immigrant status, meaning they can stay in the country legally.  They can work in this country legally.  After a decade, they would become eligible for a green card and three years later full citizenship.</p><p>The bill also establishes a new visa program for low skilled workers on America's farms and elsewhere.</p><p>Judiciary Committee member Jeff Sessions, a Republican, he voted against the measure.  He is worried authorizing millions of undocumented workers to take jobs legally will push down already stagnant wages.  That hurts low skilled Americans, he says, the most vulnerable people in this workforce right now.  </p><p>As he put it, quote, \"My Republican colleagues seem oblivious to the free market.\"</p><p>Ana Navarro is a CNN contributor and a Republican strategist.  </p><p>Ana, you are a Republican in favor of immigration reform.  You got to tell me, how divided is your party on this issue right now?  How do the factions stack up here?  </p><p>ANA NAVARRO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  You know, Christine, I think the division is highly exaggerated.  I don't see the level of division that I saw in 2007 or that I have seen in the past.  </p><p>Most Republicans agree that what we have right now is de facto amnesty, that it is a broken system and that it needs to be resolved. There are some differences on how to resolve that, but there is almost consensus on the first part.</p><p>And I would tell you that the Republicans that matter, the ones that draft policy, the ones that shape the agenda, are very committed to moving something and passing something.</p><p>ROMANS:  I will say you do not see the heat and sort of the public interest and also misinformation that you saw in 2007.  This has been moving quickly and sort of under the radar, wouldn't you agree?</p><p>NAVARRO:  I think a few things are happening.  First of all, there is a lot of things going on at the same time.  It is almost hard to keep up with the scandal du jour in Washington.  </p><p>But I also think having my senator, I think having Marco Rubio in the mix is making a huge difference because he is uniquely situated to explain this and to talk about this bill and the benefits of this bill as a Hispanic, as a Republican, and as somebody that really understands and communicates and identifies with the base of the Republican Party.</p><p>ROMANS:  He doesn't agree with another senator that has a voice on this, too.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAVARRO:  -- conservative host.</p><p>ROMANS:  When you look at the two different positions of Senator Cruz and Senator Rubio, it sort of illustrates what Republicans are grappling with right now.</p><p>NAVARRO:  You know, I have been somewhat surprised by the attitude and the votes of Senator Cruz.  I think he has changed somewhat from when he was back in 2000, working in the Bush campaign, but also, he is -- at this point he is in the minority in the Republican faction of the Senate.  You're seeing that this thing is moving along.</p><p>What we saw this week is we saw the four members of the Senate Gang of Eight who were also members of the Judiciary Committee stick together and protect the integrity of the deal they crafted.  They swatted away anything that would be a poison pill amendment.  </p><p>On -- both two Democrats did it as well as the two Republicans that were in the committee.  So there is great commitment to getting this deal through.</p><p>ROMANS:  All right, Ana Navarro, nothing more interesting and controversial than when you put politics, jobs and immigration all in one discussion.  Certainly this discussion will only get louder and more interesting over the next few weeks.  Thanks, Ana. NAVARRO:  Thank you.</p><p>ROMANS:  Some in government want to take a bigger bite out of Apple.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN.  JOHN MCCAIN, (R) ARIZONA:  It is past time for American corporations like Apple to reorganize their tax strategies, to pay what they should and invest again in the American economy.</p><p>SEN.  RAND PAUL, (R) KENTUCKY:  I frankly think the committee should apologize to Apple.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS:  Is this a greedy company, a broken tax system?  The truth about big corporate tax loopholes, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS:  I have here in my hands the U.S. tax code.  This big binder is one of 16, 16 binders, 74,000 pages is the U.S. tax code.  It is a confusing maze for both individuals and corporations.  </p><p>The top tax rate for businesses is 35 percent.  But many companies don't pay that.  They don't pay that because within all of these books, within all of these words, within 74,000 pages are scores, hundreds, thousands of loopholes for companies.  And companies don't pay those top tax rates, including Apple.</p><p>This week a Senate committee grilled Apple CEO Tim Cook on the company's tax practices.  The committee wrote a scathing report that found Apple uses subsidiaries in Ireland to avoid paying taxes, all legal because of all of these books here behind me.  </p><p>Senator John McCain coauthored that report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCAIN:  America's tax system is broken and uncompetitive and I have long supported efforts to modernize it.  However, I will not allow that position to be used as an excuse to turn a blind eye to the highly questionable tax strategies used by Apple.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS:  But Apple CEO Tim Cook defended his company.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, APPLE CEO:  We pay all of the taxes we owe, every single dollar.  We not only comply with the laws, but we comply with the spirit of the laws.  We don't depend on tax gimmicks.  We don't move intellectual property offshore and use it to sell our products back to the United States to avoid taxes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS:  Apple isn't doing anything illegal.  It is simply doing what every U.S. company does, take advantage of all of these loopholes that Congress itself created.  It is a point Senator Rand Paul made during one of the hearings more fire-breathing moments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN.  RAND PAUL, (R) KENTUCKY:  I frankly think the committee should apologize to Apple.  I think that the Congress should be on trial here for creating a bizarre and byzantine tax code that runs into the tens of thousands of pages, for creating a tax code that simply doesn't compete with the rest of the world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS:  So this is that tax code, and Paul went on to say that Congress doesn't need to be having a hearing.  It needs to be looking in a mirror.  It needs a mirror because it is time for Congress to take a good look at itself before castigating companies for legally navigating the system.</p><p>David Cay Johnston is a columnist for \"Tax Analysts\"; Jeanne Sahadi is a senior writer for CNN Money.  </p><p>David, Congress creates tax laws, and now senators are grilling Apple over loopholes in the laws.  </p><p>Is that fair?  Isn't tax reform really the answer here?</p><p>DAVID CAY JOHNSTON, COLUMNIST, \"TAX ANALYSTS\":  Well, of course tax reform is the answer.  But, remember, the companies are the ones who go and give campaign contributions and hire relatives of lawmakers to get all these complexities.  </p><p>For 100 million of the 140 million tax returns filed in this country by individuals, it's so simple you can put it on one page.  In fact, I have written you could eliminate tax filing.</p><p>But companies like Apple engage in strategies that are, to cite the title of my book on the subject, \"Perfectly Legal,\" but have the same effect of not paying taxes.  And that means you and I either have to get less government services, pay higher taxes or have the government take on more debt while Apple defers its taxes.  </p><p>And I have a column laying out how this hits your pocketbook, how Apple is costing you money; that's at the nationalmemo.com today.</p><p>ROMANS:  And you can draw that direct connection, you draw the direct connection with complicated and sometimes not very complicated tax strategies, usually involving Ireland, that keep a company's tax below and my tax bill where it stands now?</p><p>JOHNSTON:  And here is the simple way to think about it.  Imagine if, instead of having your taxes taken out of your check before you got it, you could keep that money and pay the government 30 years from now.  </p><p>If you invested that money at 3 percent, it would be 2.5 times as large in the future, but the taxes would be the same.  It is a zero interest loan.  You would actually make money off the tax system.  </p><p>And that's what Apple and other big companies do.  The tax system is a profit center, and indeed Enron called its tax department a profit center.</p><p>ROMANS:  Jeanne Sahadi is here with me, and I have to say that when I talk about taxes and budgets, Jeanne is the one.  We just chat about taxes and budgets all the time.  Apple's complex tax strategies really draw -- it's an example of what's wrong with our tax code.  Explain to me how U.S. multinationals take advantage of these loopholes in the system.</p><p>JEANNE SAHADI, SENIOR WRITER, CNNMONEY.COM:  Well, one of the big things that we discussed on Tuesday when Apple was on the Hill was something called a cost-sharing agreement.  U.S. multinationals choose to share things like the costs of research and development, whether they are offshore subsidiaries that are located in low tax or, in the case of Ireland, it's in no tax countries.</p><p>What the problem with that is, tax experts say, is that they give the offshore subsidiaries a sweetheart deal that they would not give an outside party.  So if I am going to invite you in to get in on the ground floor of my next great product, I will make you pay for that.  </p><p>What happened in the case of Apple is that they -- the offshore subsidiaries pay a little bit more than 50 percent of the costs but they earned about 15 times the profits on their investment; whereas the U.S.-based operation only earned about eight times.</p><p>So that sort of raises a red flag to tax experts, saying is that really a fair market price that you charge your subsidiaries?  </p><p>And that offshores profits that then, as David noted, don't get paid -- U.S. taxes are not paid on that for years and years and years because they don't bring the money back home.</p><p>ROMANS:  David, what this all tells me, what I learned week, listening to those hearings, listening to fire-breathing senators angry about a tax code that they created, what it just cements, in my opinion, is that executives in charge of tax departments at major corporations are probably the most important people in business today.  </p><p>Do you agree?</p><p>JOHNSTON:  They're certainly very, very important.  They are very well paid.  GE has it is estimated more than 800 tax lawyers.  This is a huge waste of human capital we should be putting into other things. But what we shouldn't do is just cut tax rates, because if we just cut tax rates, everything that's wrong will stay in place.  </p><p>We need to have real fundamental reform.  We should have, I believe, something called signal company accounting that would end the practice Jeanne described, by the way, much better than any of the newspapers I read this morning.  </p><p>And we should end deferrals.  We require companies to keep two sets of books, one for shareholders, one for the IRS.  I think we should go to unified accounting.</p><p>ROMANS:  All right, well, let's come back and talk taxes again sometime soon because I think it is not going away.  One thing certain, death, taxes, and fighting about the taxes.  Thanks so much, David and Jeanne.</p><p>Coming up, Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer promises the company won't screw up Tumblr.  But what do Tumblr users really want to know?  What happens with all of that adult content?  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS:  It is official.  Tumblr is becoming part of Yahoo!.  Now what?  Yahoo! bought the blogging website for $1.1 billion this week, but Tumblr might be worth even more to Yahoo!.  Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer promised Tumblr users that her company, quote, \"won't screw this up,\" but users are skeptical.</p><p>CNNMoney's technology correspondent Laurie Segall sat down with Tumblr CEO David Karp this week.  </p><p>And I think it is so interesting this kid didn't even go -- didn't even finish high school and now he is negotiating with Marissa Mayer, probably one of the most famous female tech executives, for his company.  What was her role in all of this?</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT, CNNMONEY.COM:  Marissa Mayer has for some reason this charge in the tech industry.  You see, all of these young entrepreneurs going to Yahoo! now, and Yahoo! wasn't able to get a lot of these younger start-ups to get involved.  It wasn't cool to be acquired by Yahoo!.  </p><p>And I will say this.  David Karp really defines cool.  He is a New York-based entrepreneur.  He used to drive a Vespa around the streets; he's got this beautiful girlfriend.</p><p>ROMANS:  A gray hoodie.</p><p>SEGALL:  Yes, exactly, he wears a hoodie.  He is very much cool.  And so Yahoo! really wants to be cool.  When I spoke to him -- I sat down with him and he said really it wasn't just about Yahoo!.  It was Marissa Mayer, formerly Google and now she's at Yahoo!.  Listen to what he said to me. Christine.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID KARP, FOUNDER AND CEO, TUMBLR:  Not only is she a genius of the geniuses, she is something that I really value, which is she was one of the most uniquely happy and productive people I have ever met, certainly in this industry.  And that's something that we just strive for in our team is that sense of eternal optimism and purpose.  She just brings that in a profound way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS:  So interesting because, you know what, I think people think he's made maybe $250 million of his own money on this.</p><p>Here's a kid, born and raised in Manhattan; his parents let him drop out of high school because, you know, high school wasn't really feeding his brain.  They let him work on his own and make his own programs.  This is not your typical kid.</p><p>SEGALL:  Absolutely not.  I will say when he showed up to the interview, he brought his mom.  They're from the Upper West Side here. He said he doesn't suggest that entrepreneurs should drop out.  You hear this and you say, OK, maybe everyone should drop out and got sell their company for $1 billion.  </p><p>But he said this has been a full time job since he was 14.  He said his parents were very different than many other parents because they supported him leaving.  He actually told me a little bit about it. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KARP:  I give both my parents so much credit for this.  It was, in fact, their idea.  I knew what I wanted to be working on.  I wasn't really getting it out of school at the time.  My parents saw that. They helped me find opportunities where I could pursue that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS:  We have been hearing about Tumblr users, though, jumping ship all week.  </p><p>What is the status of what the users are saying about this acquisition -- sorry, partnership?</p><p>SEGALL:  Sure.  Exactly.  Look, people are worried.  The Tumblr users, there is a certain user base.  They have fiercely independent people pouring their hearts out on these blogs.  And a lot of people went to WordPress, which is their biggest competitor. </p><p>And I had the opportunity to sit down with the founder of WordPress, Matt Mullenweg.  They're looking at the 10th anniversary.  Believe it or not, they have been around for 10 years.  </p><p>And he said, look, people jump ship any time this kind of thing happens.  We'll see if it sticks.  But what he said that was very interesting is they didn't sell for enough.  Listen to what he told me.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATT MULLENWEG, FOUNDER AND CEO, WORDPRESS:  Yahoo! needs somewhere to work and they need a social network, and really, the only criticism I have for the whole deal is I think they sold for too little.  Like I said, blogging platforms have huge potential, and they have fantastic engagement as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEGALL:  So if you look in the future, could Tumblr have sold for not $1.1 billion but tens of billions of dollars?  That's what Matt says. And he says that this was very bittersweet, because this kind of platform, you look in the future, it could have -- it could be very, very successful and for advertisers, too.</p><p>ROMANS:  We know there is a lot of adult content on Tumblr.  Should users expect big changes?</p><p>SEGALL:  I asked him that.  And I will say this.  He was a little bit awkward about that answer.  I thought maybe it was because I was asking him about the porn problem on Tumblr in front of his mother.  </p><p>But what he really said was nothing is going to change.  Those guidelines are strict.  But I think we're -- honestly I think it will take time.  We'll look, because people are posting a lot of times illegal material on Tumblr.  Now it is part of a big public company. You just can't ignore that now.</p><p>ROMANS:  Yes.  All right.  Laurie Segall, such an interesting interview.  I'm glad you got us a chance to sit down with him.  We'll talk to you again very, very soon.</p><p>And coming up, most days they grade tests, they assign book reports, but this week teachers in Oklahoma put their lives on the line to protect the children  they teach.  Our look at the courage of the profession, the courage of teachers, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ROMANS:  When you drop your child off at school in the morning you never think it is the last time you will see your little boy or little girl.  But as we've learned too often in the past few months there do come days when is it just might be.</p><p>I want you to listen to something.  It's the sound of 25 terrified children huddled inside in an elementary school bathroom as a massive tornado rains debris on them.  You can hear sixth grade teacher Lynne Breton trying to reassure them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LYNNE BRETON, TEACHER:  You're OK.  You're OK.  You're OK.  You're OK.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS:  You're OK.  This week as the full horror of the deadly tornado in Oklahoma emerged, so did story after story of heroic teachers who put themselves between their tiny charges and the fury of that twister.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  His teacher is in the hospital.  His teacher saved his life.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Who is his teacher?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Ms. Lowe (ph).  I have no doubt God and his teacher, they lifted a wall off of these kids, several kids.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Me and four other guys pulled a teacher out.  She was on top of three kids.  The kids were fine.  She was hurt pretty bad.</p><p>SUZANNE HALEY, TEACHER:  It is nothing anybody wouldn't do.  These children, we see their smiles, their tears, every day, in and out. And we love them.  And they're our babies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS:  This isn't the first time teachers have bravely stood up in the face of terror.  </p><p>Nearly six months ago in Newtown, Connecticut, six teachers died trying to shield their students from a gunman bent on mass murder.  </p><p>In February, President Obama posthumously awarded those educators the Medal of Freedom.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They could have taken shelter by themselves.  They could have focused on their own safety, on their own well-being, but they didn't.  They gave their lives to protect the precious children in their care. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS:  Away from the headlines, teachers are called on every day to exhibit a quiet heroism that can change lives.  We depend on them not only to educate our kids, to prepare our kids for the rest of their lives but also to detect whether a child is being abused or to intervene if a child is being bullied.</p><p>Let's not forget, more than 355,000 teacher jobs have been lost since June of 2009, when the recession officially ended.  Since the recession ended, the average starting salary in education, about $40,000 a year.  </p><p>College grads who start in communications or health sciences are making more.  Someone who gets into teaching clearly isn't doing it for the money.  They are doing it, we know, to shape young lives, to provide the knowledge that will enable the next generation to compete in the global economy.</p><p>But sometimes in between a mundane math quiz or a lesson on subject- verb agreement, they're asked to sacrifice their own safety.  When they do, so often they say they were just doing their jobs.  </p><p>We wanted to take a moment to say thank you to this country's teachers.  That's what they're doing in Moore, Oklahoma.  </p><p>Just listen to David Wheeler, who says his son, Gabriel, is alive today, alive thanks to the actions of his third grade teacher Julie Simon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID WHEELER, TORNADO SURVIVOR:  She is a member of our family for the rest of our lives.  And she will be a part of it forever.  There is nothing that we can give to her that will repay her.  We just thank you, Julie, and we love you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS:  The largest profession in America and none more important, our sentiments exactly.</p><p>Thanks for joining the conversation this week on YOUR MONEY.  We're here every Saturday at 9:30 am, 2:00 pm Eastern, and also Sunday at 3:00 pm.  Until then you can find me on Facebook and on Twitter.

I'm Christine Romans. This is YOUR MONEY.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the first time since 2008, more Americans now say the economy is getting better than getting worse. Gallup has tracked Americans' economic confidence every week since the financial crisis and it now stands at a 5-year high. Why? Well, first, stocks are at record highs; that's boosting everyone's 401(k)s.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fidelity said the average account is now $80,900, up a whopping 75 percent from the market low in 2009.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For employees 55 and older, the average account now holds $255,000. That's nearly doubled over the past four years.</p><p>Next, home values are rising. We hope that's making you feel a little richer. We learned this week the median price of a home sold in April jumped 11 percent from a year ago. It's the 14th straight year over year pricing increase and the fifth in a row in the double digits.</p><p>And finally, unemployment, 7.5 percent, the lowest since December 2008. Yes, it is still too high, way too high; millions of Americans are out of work; they are underemployed, but the signs point to an improving labor market.</p><p>So is this recovery, four years in now, solid enough for most Americans to feel it, and not just the best earners? And what does it mean for <person><nameText>President Obama?</nameText></person></p><p>CNN's chief political correspondent Candy Crowley is the anchor of \"STATE OF THE UNION\".</p><p>Candy, the president has been knocked off message lately, controversies over Benghazi, the IRS targeting the Tea Party, the administration going after reporter phone records.</p><p>Will a positive economic message ultimately drown out those controversies?</p><p>CANDY CROWLEY, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Likely not, to tell you the truth. First of all, we're not at the end of the IRS controversy. So it's still playing out. Certainly, there are elements of Benghazi as well, and there is the AP; in this new report now, that they went after another reporter who revealed something about North Korea.</p><p>So these things will be ongoing because Congress keeps them ongoing. And as you know, this is a town that is sort of driven -- actually, it's a country where great news, I think the economy, you'll see the president out there kind of talking about it and pushing it.</p><p>But on the other hand, good news is not where headlines go. The headlines still are on the IRS and things like that. It's just hard to get this off the table. It certainly helps the president, it strengthens his hand as you move forward with legislation; I don't think it erases the headlines.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>Stephen Moore, an editorial writer for \"The Wall Street Journal\" with us also today.</p><p>Stephen, you admit you're seeing signs of a pickup in the economy.</p><p>Does the president deserve any of the credit for it?</p><p>STEPHEN MOORE, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, you've been waiting to ask me that question for a long time, Christine.</p><p>ROMANS: About three years, actually.</p><p>MOORE: There's no question the economy is picking up. I'm feeling pretty bullish about the economy. You did a nice summary about the good news in the economy. And, by the way, let's not get carried away. It's still, for middle class and lower income people, they're still really struggling. We haven't seen wage increases and salary increases.</p><p>In fact, if you look at the median wage over the last four years of this recovery, it's fallen a little bit, not risen. And unemployment is still too high, but you talk about the good things in the economy, and I would point to a couple things. One is those low interest rates out there are really providing a boom to the stock market and a boom to the housing market.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROMANS: You're going to point out that's not the president's doing?</p><p>MOORE: Well, look, the president gets the credit because he's there when it happened. Reagan gets credit for the boom that happened under his term. Obviously Bill Clinton got credit for the boom under his.</p><p>But the other thing is one of the reasons the president might not get total credit for what is going on right now is that the biggest boom sector right now is the oil and gas industry. There's just no question it's been carrying the rest of the economy on its back, and let's face it, Christine, he hasn't been the biggest advocate of oil and gas. In fact, he's, if anything, tried to hold that sector back.</p><p>ROMANS: I want to bring in Rana Foroohar. She's the assistant managing editor at \"Time\".</p><p>And he brings up a very good point, not everyone is feeling this.</p><p>And I wanted to show the statistic. Demos, it's a left-leaning policy group, says a third of Americans are paid less than $24,000 a year. A third of American workers earn less than $24,000 a year.</p><p>Can you have an American recovery where a third of the people who are working are making so little money?</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, ASSISTANT MANAGING EDITOR, \"TIME\": No, I don't think you really can have a truly robust recovery. I mean, the fact is, we're still in a 2 percent economy.</p><p>The private sector is recovering. In fact, if you stripped out the government, we'd be in a 3 percent economy, in part because of, as Stephen mentioned, oil and gas, but also housing and some other sectors.</p><p>But, ultimately, if you look at the fastest growing job categories in this country, they are low wage jobs. Eight out of 10 of the fastest growing categories make very low wages. And when you have a 70 percent consumer economy, as we do, it's really hard to imagine how we're going to go back up to historic growth levels unless we can get these middle class jobs going.</p><p>ROMANS: And that brings back to Candy, where, you know, our own CNN/ORC polling, not quite as rosy as the Gallup polling I gave you earlier.</p><p>Two-thirds of Americans still say the economy is in poor shape.</p><p>There are a few glimmers of optimism, though, when you dig in these numbers. Here's one: the number of people who say conditions are poor, the worst option offered is at the lowest point in over a year.</p><p>So, Candy, what is the administration's strategy on the economy as it's knocked off message here?</p><p>CROWLEY: In terms of actual policy, they're now around the margins of this. They push jobs for veterans, legislation like that, much of what the president is going to do or wants to do was put in his budget.</p><p>This is still an economy that doesn't have a government with a lot of money to spend. There's still that big old debt, Republicans are still concentrated on that as is some Democrats. So there's not a lot of, hey, let's really prime this some more and throw this money into a stimulus program. There's not that kind of money left.</p><p>So there are some things that he's doing and has proposed to increase the job rate among various groups, but you're not going to see anything major. I think this is one of those things where you will hear the president continue to talk about this certainly so long as those numbers continue to go up.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROMANS: Go ahead.</p><p>MOORE: You know, what's interesting about that, Candy, is that, as I talk to businessmen and women, they are feeling more optimistic, no question about it. And these are people who hire Americans.</p><p>One of the things that's interesting is they're not as afraid of <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>and the policies that are coming out of Washington as they were in the first term. I mean, think about the first term. We had, you know, the stimulus, the huge debt, ObamaCare, you know, there was talk about union card check, and cap and trade laws.</p><p>Those kinds of threats from Washington have really subsided and I think that's one of the reasons the private sector is starting to take off.</p><p>CROWLEY: Sure, absolutely. Businesses, in general, love it when Washington isn't doing anything.</p><p>MOORE: That's right. Exactly, bingo.</p><p>ROMANS: Except when they bring you to the brink of paralysis because of our debt ceiling and all that stuff.</p><p>I mean, there is the conventional wisdom, Rana, you know, a gridlock in Washington is good for business, but it doesn't feel that way this time.</p><p>FOROOHAR: It certainly doesn't feel that way. I think it's going to be interesting to see how the markets react and just how much of the wealth that we've been feeling is down to the Fed and how much of it is down to the real economy.</p><p>ROMANS: I know. And the Fed -- oh, I think the Fed and the discussions happening within the Fed and about the Fed are going to be so important in the months going on.</p><p>Candy, Stephen and Rana -- thank you so much all of you.</p><p>CROWLEY: Thanks.</p><p>MOORE: Thank you.</p><p>ROMANS: Coming up, less than a week after deadly tornadoes tore through more Oklahoma, residents vow to rebuild. But does that make sense economic sense? That's next on YOUR MONEY.</p><p>ROMANS: Twenty-four dead, hundreds of buildings destroyed, billions of dollars in property lost but residents of Moore, Oklahoma, have seen this before. This is the third, the third time in 15 years that tornadoes have carved a path through Moore. So, after three tornadoes, you might be surprised by this response.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. MARY FALLIN (R), OKLAHOMA: We will get through this. We will overcome, and we will rebuild.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: We will rebuild. Again, she says.</p><p>I want to bring in Jerold Kayden. He's a professor of urban planning and design at Harvard's Graduate School of Design.</p><p>So nice to see you. Thanks for coming by.</p><p>You know, rebuilding really heals psychological wounds. We've heard again and again people say this is my home, I'm going to rebuild. We are strong. We will get through it.</p><p>But is it smart to rebuild in the same place where disaster has struck so many times?</p><p>JEROLD KAYDEN, PROFESSOR, HARVARD GRADUATE SCHOOL OF DESIGN: Smart is, of course, in the brain of the beholder, and some people will say it is smart and others will say it's the opposite of smart.</p><p>Look, we are a resolute, some would even say, stubborn people. As you just said, we're going to rebuild, we're going to show that storm, even we're going to show the terrorists that we rebuild in the same area. Nothing is going to stop us.</p><p>Also, we have to recognize these are people's homes, their streets, their neighborhoods where they grew up, where they have memories. We're very attached to place, so where we see the images of a desolate, destroyed area, they're actually seeing their street still.</p><p>Yes, it's their destroyed house, but this is where they grew up, this is where they want to continue to live. So we're a compassionate people and we honor that sort of rebuilding effort, sometimes in unwise ways.</p><p>And that's where it actually isn't smart. It can indeed lead to unwise behavior and it's a question of both government policy and individuals recognizing that we have to be smarter in the future.</p><p>ROMANS: So if we rebuild and we rebuild in better ways or we learn lessons in the rebuilding, that's what's really a key, I think, here.</p><p>You know, in 1999, President Clinton urged Moore's residents then to invest in safe rooms, reinforced spaces that can resist tornadoes. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM J. CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT: If you don't remember anything else I say today, remember this, for goodness sakes, build a safe room in your house when you rebuild. Go in and do the -- any kind of alterations you have to do. It will be the cheapest $2,000 you ever spent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: And, you know, since 1993, FEMA has paid more than $57 million for 12,000 private and public safe rooms in Oklahoma. But still, it's not everyone. It's not everywhere.</p><p>Vital places like Morris Plaza Towers Elementary School, they were not protected when those tornadoes came.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR GLENN LEWIS, MOORE, OKLAHOMA: It's about the money and the statistics. An F-5 tornado is very rare. It's 1 percent to 2 percent of the tornadoes. Same reason they don't have safe rooms for earthquakes, they don't work all the time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: My question to you is whether it's safe rooms for tornadoes, earthquake proofing, flood prevention measures, who pays for it? Who should pay for it?</p><p>KAYDEN: It's really the central question now going forward. I think on smaller types of things that are manageable by a middle class family, it is not unreasonable to ask at a minimum that they share, if not pay for the entire cost.</p><p>No one hesitates when government imposes a regulation, for example that, going forward, requires homeowners to install smoke alarms or carbon monoxide detectors. The reason nobody objects is first of all it's smart for safety but also it's a very small cost.</p><p>The issue here is the cost is slightly more and yet we should be asking people to bear some of that burden and if government can provide some assistance, particularly in the aftermath of a disaster or over time to help people contribute to this, then it may be reasonable to do that of course given budget constraints.</p><p>ROMANS: That's a key point, that given budget constraints, because you hear on the one hand people talk about big government and government intrusion, too much regulation and this and that, and then something like this happens and you hear with almost unanimity, why wasn't there a safe room in that school? Because it costs money to build these things and the public has to pay for it.</p><p>KAYDEN: Right. But it's a two-step dance. After the disaster, people understandably say, Government, come here and rescue me. Government, come here and give me money to rebuild.</p><p>And then when government says, yes, but in the future you will not be able to rebuild in certain areas or in the future you must install a safe room or a basement in terms of tornadoes or whatever it may be, then you hear people say, no regulation, no government.</p><p>So, it's this dilemma between wanting government and not wanting government.</p><p>ROMANS: Let me ask you this. EQECAT -- it's a disaster modeling firm -- it says that it estimates, that, you know, the insured property losses from these tornadoes will be between $2 billion and $5 billion.</p><p>And the cost of the disasters is rising. So, in the '80s, major extreme weather costs less than $20 billion in damage each year on average. Since 2010, the average yearly damage has been $86 billion.</p><p>So, what's driving this? Is Mother Nature getting nastier or is human nature -- are we're building bigger things and there's more of us building in the same spots?</p><p>KAYDEN: It's a combination of all of those things. I mean, there does appear to be more high-risk storms, flooding, tornadoes, weather- related incidents that are occurring more and more and more, not earthquakes but weather related incidents.</p><p>And then, in some cases, we do have building, not even rebuilding but building in areas that are vulnerable, although I will say also that government has enacted laws in a variety of places which begin to restrict building in vulnerable areas and we're simply going to need more of that.</p><p>This is not simply a matter of individuals being protected against their own unwise behavior but it's society rescuing them, which puts them at risk.</p><p>BERMAN: So nice to meet you, today. Jerold Kayden, thank you very much for your insight on that. Of course, our thoughts and prayers with those people in Oklahoma as they prepare. It is clear, over the past 15 years, they have done much in that town to try to protect themselves. I'll give them best of luck as they try to do more.</p><p>Thank you so much, sir.</p><p>ROMANS: The Jersey Shore is open for business this Memorial Day weekend. According to a survey from AAA Mid-Atlanta, 79 percent of shoregoers say Sandy hasn't changed their summer vacation plans. Some even say they'll make an even greater effort to give their business to some of the places hit hardest by the storm.</p><p>Will the businesses be ready?</p><p>CNN's business correspondent Zain Asher took a trip down to Asbury Park.</p><p>She joins us this morning.</p><p>ZAIN ASHER, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Christine.</p><p>You know, it's not just a big weekend for businesses. It's also a big weekend for the city of Asbury Park itself. You got to remember the one-third of the city's revenue actually comes from beach tourism and so, Memorial Day weekend is unbelievably important to that.</p><p>Also, you know, these businesses are seasonal and so if they don't make enough revenue through Memorial Day, then they will have a tough time through the winter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARILYN SCHLOSSBACH, OWNER, LANGOSTA LOUNGE, ASBURY PARK: You feel like you're walking on the ocean.</p><p>ASHER (voice-over): New Jersey restaurant owner Marilyn Schlossbach always worries about the forecast.</p><p>SCHLOSSBACH: When we're open for business, every morning the first thing I look is at the weather.</p><p>ASHER: But it was the weather nearly destroyed her business.</p><p>SCHLOSSBACH: The window frames from these pavilions all blew in to the other side, so every surge of water that came up after that ended up in here.</p><p>ASHER: The rebuilding began almost as soon as the waters receded. She landed a $250,000 loan from the Small Business Administration and was able to reopen here in April. But it's been a challenging year to say the least. Schlossbach now survives on one-tenth of her salary and is struggling to make ends meet.</p><p>SCHLOSSBACH: Basically, I went from almost no debt to having about $25,000 in credit card bills and my entire savings wiped out.</p><p>ASHER: But she's hoping to see a turnaround and so is the rest of Asbury Park. On a gray day ahead of the holiday weekend, there's a sense of anticipation.</p><p>TOM GILMOUR, ASBURY PARK DIRECTOR OF COMMERCE: I think a lot of people will come to the shore this weekend to sort of check it out, see what it's really doing, but we're open, we're ready. We have great music here all the time. We're always partying. This is the place to come.</p><p>ASHER: You might say Asbury Park is one of the luckier spots on the Jersey Shore. Its music scene made famous by rock legend Bruce Springsteen, who got his start at the Stone Pony across the street, has kept Asbury Park in the spotlight in the aftermath of Sandy.</p><p>In the lesser-known and harder-hit town of Normandy Beach, Schlossbach has another restaurant, Labrador Lounge, which has also reopened, but she says customers are nowhere to be found.</p><p>SCHLOSSBACH: I'm dying down there. I've been open for a month; I have no customers. Everybody thinks the island is closed. You drive through there and you see houses on top of houses, restaurants and businesses aren't reopening, and I'm really scared because that's my home. ASHER: Memorial Day weekend is the shore's first big chance to bring business back and reward months of hard work. Schlossbach is back to worrying about the weather.</p><p>SCHLOSSBACH: To us, the weather is everything. If it is 90 degrees and sunny, we'll be packed. If it's raining and cold, we're not going to be busy.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ASHER: And you know, Christine, we've talked about the fact that 11.7 million Americans are out of work and that the unemployment rate is 7.5 percent.</p><p>But what's interesting is that she's actually having the opposite problem. She's looking to hire, but she says she cannot find workers. She says people sort of still have it in their mind that the Jersey Shore was completely destroyed by Sandy.</p><p>But, of course, you know, now that's really true anymore.</p><p>ROMANS: The last shore town I visited last summer with my kids is Asbury Park, and was so beautiful and so great. And it's changed so much over the last 10 years, so I really hope people get out there and spend some money on the shore because it really matters.</p><p>ASHER: It does.</p><p>ROMANS: Thanks, Zain.</p><p>Coming up, protecting your property before disaster strikes. The ins and outs of insurance, next.</p><p>ROMANS: Thousands of Oklahomans are picking up the pieces after this week's deadly tornadoes. The painful process of rebuilding for them starts now. It's one that's all too familiar to homeowners on the New Jersey Shore. They have spent the last seven months rebuilding their homes and their lives dealing with reconstruction and insurance claims, a process that's not always easy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS (voice-over): More than 2,400 homes damaged or destroyed by the devastating tornado that rocked Moore, Oklahoma. For homeowners forced out of their properties by a natural disaster, the painful process of rebuilding and insurance claims starts now.</p><p>Mary and Tom Walls know a thing or two about that. Seven months ago, their New Jersey home on the shore was flooded during Hurricane Sandy.</p><p>TOM WALLS, LAVAILETTE, N.J., RESIDENT: I think that there was a certain shock when the water was coming in my house. I couldn't believe it. It didn't knock the front door down. It just kind of rose up through the -- MARY WALLS, LAVAILETTE, N.J. RESIDENT: Bubbled up through the carpeting.</p><p>TOM WALLS: Immediately we walked around with my son, and that was my first thought of insurance actually.</p><p>ROMANS (on camera): What's the first call you make? The first call you make after everyone safe, is it to the person who sold you the insurance policy?</p><p>JEANNE SALVATORE, SR., V.P., INSURANCE INFORMATION INSTITUTE: Well, the first thing you should do is get in touch with your insurance company. Let them know the extent of the damage and where you can be reached. That's the most important thing to do.</p><p>ROMANS (voice-over): Jeanne Salvatore represents the insurance industry. She advises all homeowners to know what's in their insurance policies before disaster hits.</p><p>SALVATORE: There's a lot of disasters that are covered in just standard policies. I mean, you are covered for wind damage, for fire, for falling objects. The two big disasters that are not covered, one is flood and the other is earthquake. And you need to get separate insurance for those types of disasters.</p><p>ROMANS: The Walls home is covered for flood damage and they contacted their insurance company immediately after the storm. But they were frustrated by their carrier's slow response and decided not to wait for an insurance check to start the rebuilding process.</p><p>MARY WALLS: I had no clue what goes into this whole process. I actually had to say to a couple guys, what exactly takes place? Like break it down for me and tell me how this works. It was very foreign for me.</p><p>TOM WALLS: There were people that just experienced so much worse than we did. You know, my insurance company didn't pay for everything, but in the final analysis, I was satisfied with the dollar amount.</p><p>ROMANS: They spent most of the past seven months displaced, but were able to move back into their home last month.</p><p>TOM WALLS: Keep the faith. Things will get better.</p><p>MARY WALLS: Yes.</p><p>TOM WALLS: You need family and friends and --</p><p>MARY WALLS: And don't be afraid to ask for help.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS: Best of luck to the Walls and also to everyone starting to rebuild now in Oklahoma.</p><p>A rare round of cheers in Congress this week as senators actually came to an agreement. A landmark immigration bill now headed to the floor. I'll explain what that could mean for your job, your paycheck, next.</p><p>ROMANS: A surprise in Washington this week -- real compromise. I'm Christine Romans. This is YOUR MONEY.</p><p>Twenty-seven years -- that's how long it's been since the United States overhauled immigration law. But this week we got a step closer.</p><p>On Tuesday, members of the Senate judiciary committee reached an agreement on a landmark immigration bill. Three Republicans joined the panel of Democrats in voting for the measure. It now moves to the Senate floor for a full vote.</p><p>Immigration touches every aspect of American life. It raises heated controversial issues about national security and cultural identity. But make no mistake, make no mistake. At its core, immigration is 100 percent about jobs.</p><p>Under this bill the number of highly skilled foreign workers admitted to the country would rise from 65,000 a year to 110,000 and possibly more, depending on the unemployment levels. That's a major win for big tech firms. Tech company CEOs say they can't find enough talent at home to fill the positions they need.</p><p>The legislation also scraps regulations requiring companies to make a good faith effort to find American workers before hiring from abroad. That now only applies to companies that hire foreign nationals for more than 15 percent of the workforce.</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum, millions of undocumented workers would be granted registered provisional immigrant status, meaning they can stay in the country legally. They can work in this country legally. After a decade, they would become eligible for a green card and three years later full citizenship.</p><p>The bill also establishes a new visa program for low skilled workers on America's farms and elsewhere.</p><p>Judiciary Committee member Jeff Sessions, a Republican, he voted against the measure. He is worried authorizing millions of undocumented workers to take jobs legally will push down already stagnant wages. That hurts low skilled Americans, he says, the most vulnerable people in this workforce right now.</p><p>As he put it, quote, \"My Republican colleagues seem oblivious to the free market.\"</p><p>Ana Navarro is a CNN contributor and a Republican strategist.</p><p>Ana, you are a Republican in favor of immigration reform. You got to tell me, how divided is your party on this issue right now? How do the factions stack up here?</p><p>ANA NAVARRO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: You know, Christine, I think the division is highly exaggerated. I don't see the level of division that I saw in 2007 or that I have seen in the past.</p><p>Most Republicans agree that what we have right now is de facto amnesty, that it is a broken system and that it needs to be resolved. There are some differences on how to resolve that, but there is almost consensus on the first part.</p><p>And I would tell you that the Republicans that matter, the ones that draft policy, the ones that shape the agenda, are very committed to moving something and passing something.</p><p>ROMANS: I will say you do not see the heat and sort of the public interest and also misinformation that you saw in 2007. This has been moving quickly and sort of under the radar, wouldn't you agree?</p><p>NAVARRO: I think a few things are happening. First of all, there is a lot of things going on at the same time. It is almost hard to keep up with the scandal du jour in Washington.</p><p>But I also think having my senator, I think having Marco Rubio in the mix is making a huge difference because he is uniquely situated to explain this and to talk about this bill and the benefits of this bill as a Hispanic, as a Republican, and as somebody that really understands and communicates and identifies with the base of the Republican Party.</p><p>ROMANS: He doesn't agree with another senator that has a voice on this, too.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAVARRO: -- conservative host.</p><p>ROMANS: When you look at the two different positions of Senator Cruz and Senator Rubio, it sort of illustrates what Republicans are grappling with right now.</p><p>NAVARRO: You know, I have been somewhat surprised by the attitude and the votes of Senator Cruz. I think he has changed somewhat from when he was back in 2000, working in the Bush campaign, but also, he is -- at this point he is in the minority in the Republican faction of the Senate. You're seeing that this thing is moving along.</p><p>What we saw this week is we saw the four members of the Senate Gang of Eight who were also members of the Judiciary Committee stick together and protect the integrity of the deal they crafted. They swatted away anything that would be a poison pill amendment.</p><p>On -- both two Democrats did it as well as the two Republicans that were in the committee. So there is great commitment to getting this deal through.</p><p>ROMANS: All right, Ana Navarro, nothing more interesting and controversial than when you put politics, jobs and immigration all in one discussion. Certainly this discussion will only get louder and more interesting over the next few weeks. Thanks, Ana. NAVARRO: Thank you.</p><p>ROMANS: Some in government want to take a bigger bite out of Apple.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHN MCCAIN, (R) ARIZONA: It is past time for American corporations like Apple to reorganize their tax strategies, to pay what they should and invest again in the American economy.</p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL, (R) KENTUCKY: I frankly think the committee should apologize to Apple.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Is this a greedy company, a broken tax system? The truth about big corporate tax loopholes, next.</p><p>ROMANS: I have here in my hands the U.S. tax code. This big binder is one of 16, 16 binders, 74,000 pages is the U.S. tax code. It is a confusing maze for both individuals and corporations.</p><p>The top tax rate for businesses is 35 percent. But many companies don't pay that. They don't pay that because within all of these books, within all of these words, within 74,000 pages are scores, hundreds, thousands of loopholes for companies. And companies don't pay those top tax rates, including Apple.</p><p>This week a Senate committee grilled Apple CEO Tim Cook on the company's tax practices. The committee wrote a scathing report that found Apple uses subsidiaries in Ireland to avoid paying taxes, all legal because of all of these books here behind me.</p><p>Senator John McCain coauthored that report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCAIN: America's tax system is broken and uncompetitive and I have long supported efforts to modernize it. However, I will not allow that position to be used as an excuse to turn a blind eye to the highly questionable tax strategies used by Apple.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: But Apple CEO Tim Cook defended his company.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, APPLE CEO: We pay all of the taxes we owe, every single dollar. We not only comply with the laws, but we comply with the spirit of the laws. We don't depend on tax gimmicks. We don't move intellectual property offshore and use it to sell our products back to the United States to avoid taxes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Apple isn't doing anything illegal. It is simply doing what every U.S. company does, take advantage of all of these loopholes that Congress itself created. It is a point Senator Rand Paul made during one of the hearings more fire-breathing moments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. RAND PAUL, (R) KENTUCKY: I frankly think the committee should apologize to Apple. I think that the Congress should be on trial here for creating a bizarre and byzantine tax code that runs into the tens of thousands of pages, for creating a tax code that simply doesn't compete with the rest of the world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: So this is that tax code, and Paul went on to say that Congress doesn't need to be having a hearing. It needs to be looking in a mirror. It needs a mirror because it is time for Congress to take a good look at itself before castigating companies for legally navigating the system.</p><p>David Cay Johnston is a columnist for \"Tax Analysts\"; Jeanne Sahadi is a senior writer for CNN Money.</p><p>David, Congress creates tax laws, and now senators are grilling Apple over loopholes in the laws.</p><p>Is that fair? Isn't tax reform really the answer here?</p><p>DAVID CAY JOHNSTON, COLUMNIST, \"TAX ANALYSTS\": Well, of course tax reform is the answer. But, remember, the companies are the ones who go and give campaign contributions and hire relatives of lawmakers to get all these complexities.</p><p>For 100 million of the 140 million tax returns filed in this country by individuals, it's so simple you can put it on one page. In fact, I have written you could eliminate tax filing.</p><p>But companies like Apple engage in strategies that are, to cite the title of my book on the subject, \"Perfectly Legal,\" but have the same effect of not paying taxes. And that means you and I either have to get less government services, pay higher taxes or have the government take on more debt while Apple defers its taxes.</p><p>And I have a column laying out how this hits your pocketbook, how Apple is costing you money; that's at the nationalmemo.com today.</p><p>ROMANS: And you can draw that direct connection, you draw the direct connection with complicated and sometimes not very complicated tax strategies, usually involving Ireland, that keep a company's tax below and my tax bill where it stands now?</p><p>JOHNSTON: And here is the simple way to think about it. Imagine if, instead of having your taxes taken out of your check before you got it, you could keep that money and pay the government 30 years from now.</p><p>If you invested that money at 3 percent, it would be 2.5 times as large in the future, but the taxes would be the same. It is a zero interest loan. You would actually make money off the tax system.</p><p>And that's what Apple and other big companies do. The tax system is a profit center, and indeed Enron called its tax department a profit center.</p><p>ROMANS: Jeanne Sahadi is here with me, and I have to say that when I talk about taxes and budgets, Jeanne is the one. We just chat about taxes and budgets all the time. Apple's complex tax strategies really draw -- it's an example of what's wrong with our tax code. Explain to me how U.S. multinationals take advantage of these loopholes in the system.</p><p>JEANNE SAHADI, SENIOR WRITER, CNNMONEY.COM: Well, one of the big things that we discussed on Tuesday when Apple was on the Hill was something called a cost-sharing agreement. U.S. multinationals choose to share things like the costs of research and development, whether they are offshore subsidiaries that are located in low tax or, in the case of Ireland, it's in no tax countries.</p><p>What the problem with that is, tax experts say, is that they give the offshore subsidiaries a sweetheart deal that they would not give an outside party. So if I am going to invite you in to get in on the ground floor of my next great product, I will make you pay for that.</p><p>What happened in the case of Apple is that they -- the offshore subsidiaries pay a little bit more than 50 percent of the costs but they earned about 15 times the profits on their investment; whereas the U.S.-based operation only earned about eight times.</p><p>So that sort of raises a red flag to tax experts, saying is that really a fair market price that you charge your subsidiaries?</p><p>And that offshores profits that then, as David noted, don't get paid -- U.S. taxes are not paid on that for years and years and years because they don't bring the money back home.</p><p>ROMANS: David, what this all tells me, what I learned week, listening to those hearings, listening to fire-breathing senators angry about a tax code that they created, what it just cements, in my opinion, is that executives in charge of tax departments at major corporations are probably the most important people in business today.</p><p>Do you agree?</p><p>JOHNSTON: They're certainly very, very important. They are very well paid. GE has it is estimated more than 800 tax lawyers. This is a huge waste of human capital we should be putting into other things. But what we shouldn't do is just cut tax rates, because if we just cut tax rates, everything that's wrong will stay in place.</p><p>We need to have real fundamental reform. We should have, I believe, something called signal company accounting that would end the practice Jeanne described, by the way, much better than any of the newspapers I read this morning.</p><p>And we should end deferrals. We require companies to keep two sets of books, one for shareholders, one for the IRS. I think we should go to unified accounting.</p><p>ROMANS: All right, well, let's come back and talk taxes again sometime soon because I think it is not going away. One thing certain, death, taxes, and fighting about the taxes. Thanks so much, David and Jeanne.</p><p>Coming up, Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer promises the company won't screw up Tumblr. But what do Tumblr users really want to know? What happens with all of that adult content? That's next.</p><p>ROMANS: It is official. Tumblr is becoming part of Yahoo!. Now what? Yahoo! bought the blogging website for $1.1 billion this week, but Tumblr might be worth even more to Yahoo!. Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer promised Tumblr users that her company, quote, \"won't screw this up,\" but users are skeptical.</p><p>CNNMoney's technology correspondent Laurie Segall sat down with Tumblr CEO David Karp this week.</p><p>And I think it is so interesting this kid didn't even go -- didn't even finish high school and now he is negotiating with Marissa Mayer, probably one of the most famous female tech executives, for his company. What was her role in all of this?</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT, CNNMONEY.COM: Marissa Mayer has for some reason this charge in the tech industry. You see, all of these young entrepreneurs going to Yahoo! now, and Yahoo! wasn't able to get a lot of these younger start-ups to get involved. It wasn't cool to be acquired by Yahoo!.</p><p>And I will say this. David Karp really defines cool. He is a New York-based entrepreneur. He used to drive a Vespa around the streets; he's got this beautiful girlfriend.</p><p>ROMANS: A gray hoodie.</p><p>SEGALL: Yes, exactly, he wears a hoodie. He is very much cool. And so Yahoo! really wants to be cool. When I spoke to him -- I sat down with him and he said really it wasn't just about Yahoo!. It was Marissa Mayer, formerly Google and now she's at Yahoo!. Listen to what he said to me. Christine.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID KARP, FOUNDER AND CEO, TUMBLR: Not only is she a genius of the geniuses, she is something that I really value, which is she was one of the most uniquely happy and productive people I have ever met, certainly in this industry. And that's something that we just strive for in our team is that sense of eternal optimism and purpose. She just brings that in a profound way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: So interesting because, you know what, I think people think he's made maybe $250 million of his own money on this.</p><p>Here's a kid, born and raised in Manhattan; his parents let him drop out of high school because, you know, high school wasn't really feeding his brain. They let him work on his own and make his own programs. This is not your typical kid.</p><p>SEGALL: Absolutely not. I will say when he showed up to the interview, he brought his mom. They're from the Upper West Side here. He said he doesn't suggest that entrepreneurs should drop out.

Exactly. Look, people are worried. The Tumblr users, there is a certain user base. They have fiercely independent people pouring their hearts out on these blogs. And a lot of people went to WordPress, which is their biggest competitor.</p><p>And I had the opportunity to sit down with the founder of WordPress, Matt Mullenweg.

Like I said, blogging platforms have huge potential, and they have fantastic engagement as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEGALL: So if you look in the future, could Tumblr have sold for not $1.1 billion but tens of billions of dollars? That's what Matt says. And he says that this was very bittersweet, because this kind of platform, you look in the future, it could have -- it could be very, very successful and for advertisers, too.</p><p>ROMANS: We know there is a lot of adult content on Tumblr. Should users expect big changes?</p><p>SEGALL: I asked him that. And I will say this. He was a little bit awkward about that answer. I thought maybe it was because I was asking him about the porn problem on Tumblr in front of his mother.</p><p>But what he really said was nothing is going to change. Those guidelines are strict. But I think we're -- honestly I think it will take time. We'll look, because people are posting a lot of times illegal material on Tumblr. Now it is part of a big public company. You just can't ignore that now.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes. All right. Laurie Segall, such an interesting interview. I'm glad you got us a chance to sit down with him.

Yet an internal discussion thread leaked to Breitbart News reveals Google regularly intervenes in search results on its YouTube video platform - including a recent intervention that pushed pro-life videos out of the top ten search results for 'abortion.' The term 'abortion' was added to a 'blacklist' file for 'controversial YouTube queries,' which contains a list of search terms that the company considers sensitive. According to the leak, these include some of these search terms related to: abortion, abortions, the Irish abortion referendum, Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters, and anti-gun activist David Hogg. </p><p>The existence of the blacklist was revealed in an internal Google discussion thread leaked to Breitbart News by a source inside the company who wishes to remain anonymous. A partial list of blacklisted terms was also leaked to Breitbart by another Google source. In the leaked discussion thread, a Google site reliability engineer hinted at the existence of more search blacklists, according to the source. 'We have tons of white- and blacklists that humans manually curate,' said the employee. 'Hopefully this isn't surprising or particularly controversial.' Others were more concerned about the presence of the blacklist. According to the source, the software engineer who started the discussion called the manipulation of search results related to abortion a 'smoking gun.' The software engineer noted that the change had occurred following aninquiry from a left-wingSlatejournalist[3]about the prominence of pro-life videos on YouTube, and that pro-life videos were replaced with pro-abortion videos in the top ten results for the search terms following Google's manual intervention. 'TheSlatewriter said she had complained last Friday and then saw different search results before YouTube responded to her on Monday,' wrote the employee. 'And lo and behold, the [changelog] was submitted on Friday, December 14 at 3:17 PM.' The manually downranked items included several videos from Dr. Antony Levatino, a former abortion doctor who is now a pro-life activist. Another video in the top ten featured a woman's personal story of being pressured to have an abortion, while another featured pro-life conservative Ben Shapiro. TheSlatejournalist who complained to Googlereported[4] that these videos previously featured in the top ten, describing them in her story as 'dangerous misinformation.' Since theSlatejournalist's inquiry andGoogle's subsequent intervention, the top search resultsnow[5]feature pro-abortion content from left-wing sources like BuzzFeed, Vice, CNN, andLast Week Tonight With John Oliver.In herreport[6], theSlatejournalist acknowledged that the search results changed shortly after she contacted Google. The manual adjustment of search results by a Google-owned platform contradicts a keyclaim[7]made under oath by Google CEO Sundar Pichai in his congressional testimony earlier this month: that his company does not 'manually intervene on any search result.' A Google employee in the discussion thread drew attention to Pichai's claim, noting that it 'seems like we are pretty eager to cater our search results to the social and political agenda of left-wing journalists.' One of the posts in the discussion also noted that the blacklist had previously been edited to include the search term 'Maxine Waters' after a single Google employee complained the top YouTube search result for Maxine Waters was 'very low quality.' Google's alleged intervention on behalf of a Democratic congresswoman would be further evidence of the tech giant using its resources to prop up the left. Breitbart News previously reported on leaked emails revealing the company targeted pro-Democrat demographics in its get-out-the-vote efforts in 2016. According to the source, a software engineer in the thread also noted that 'a bunch of terms related to the abortion referendum in Ireland' had been added to the blacklist - another change with potentially dramatic consequences on the national policies of a western democracy. youtube_controversial_query_blacklist At least one post in the discussion thread revealed the existence of a file called 'youtube_controversial_query_blacklist,' which contains a list of YouTube search terms that Google manually curates. In addition to the terms 'abortion,' 'abortions,' 'Maxine Waters,' and search terms related to the Irish abortion referendum, a Google software engineer noted that the blacklist includes search terms related to terrorist attacks. (the posts specifically mentions that the 'Strasbourg terrorist attack' as being on the list). 'If you look at the other entries recently added to theyoutube_controversial_query_blacklist(e.g., entries related to the Strasbourg terrorist attack), the addition of abortion seemsout-of-place,' wrote the software engineer, according to the source. After learning of the existence of the blacklist, Breitbart News obtained a partial screenshot of the full blacklist file from a source within Google. It reveals that the blacklist includes search terms related to both mass shootings and the progressive anti-second amendment activist David Hogg. This suggests Google has followed the lead of Democrat politicians, who haverepeatedly pushed tech companies[8]to censor content related to the Parkland school shooting and the Parkland anti-gun activists. It's part of a popular new line of thought in the political-media establishment,which views the public as too stupid to question conspiracy theories for themselves[9]. Here is the partial blacklist leaked to Breitbart:2117 plane crash Russian 2118 plane crash 2119 an-148 2120 florida shooting conspiracy 2121 florida shooting crisis actors 2122 florida conspiracy 2123 florida false flag shooting 2124 florida false flag 2125 fake florida school shooting 2126 david hogg hoax 2127 david hogg fake 2128 david hogg crisis actor 2129 david hogg forgets lines 2130 david hogg forgets his lines 2131 david hogg cant remember his lines 2132 david hogg actor 2133 david hogg cant remember 2134 david hogg conspiracy 2135 david hogg exposed 2136 david hogg lines 2137 david hogg rehearsing 2120 florida shooting conspiracyThe full internal filepath of the blacklist, according to another source, is: //depot/google3/googledata/superroot/youtube/youtube_controversial_query_blacklist Contradictions Responding to a request for comment, a YouTube spokeswoman said the company wants to promote 'authoritative' sources in its search results, but maintained that YouTube is a 'platform for free speech' that 'allow[s]' both pro-life and pro-abortion content. YouTube's full comment:YouTube is a platform for free speech where anyone can choose to post videos, as long as they follow ourCommunity Guidelines[10], which prohibit things like inciting violence and pornography. We apply these policies impartially and we allow both pro-life and pro-choice opinions. Over the last year we've described how we are working tobetter surface news sources[11]across our site for news-related searches and topical information. We've improved our search and discovery algorithms, built new features that clearly label and prominently surface news sources on our homepage and search pages, and introduced information panels to help give users more authoritative sources where they can fact check information for themselves.In the case of the 'abortion' search results, YouTube's intervention to insert 'authoritative' content resulted in the downranking of pro-life videos and the elevation of pro-abortion ones. A Google spokesperson took a tougher line than its YouTube subsidiary, stating that 'Google has never manipulated or modified the search results or content in any of its products to promote a particular political ideology.' However, in the leaked discussion thread, a member of Google's 'trust ...fety' team, Daniel Aaronson, admitted that the company maintains 'huge teams' that work to adjust search results for subjects that are 'prone to hyperbolic content, misleading information, and offensive content' - all subjective terms that are frequently used to suppress right-leaning sources. He also admitted that the interventions weren't confined to YouTube - they included search results delivered via Google Assistant, Google Home, and in rare cases Google 's organic search results. In the thread, Aaronson attempted to explain how search blacklisting worked. He claimed that highly specific searches would generate non-blacklisted results, even controversial ones. But the inclusion of highly specific terms in the YouTube blacklist, like 'David Hogg cant remember his lines' - the name of an actual viral video - seems to contradict this. Aaronson's full post is copied below:I work in Trust and Safety and while I have no particular input as to exactly what's happening for YT I can try to explain why you'd have this kind of list and why people are finding lists like these on Code Search. When dealing with abuse/controversial content on various mediums you have several levers to deal with problems. Two prominent levers are 'Proactive' and 'Reactive':Proactive: Usually refers to some type of algorithm/scalable solution to a general problem E.g.: We don't allow straight up porn on YouTube so we create a classifier that detects porn and automatically remove or flag for review the videos the porn classifier is most certain ofReactive: Usually refers to a manual fix to something that has been brought to our attention that our proactive solutions don't/didn't work on and something that is clearly in the realm of bad enough to warrant a quick targeted solution (determined by pages and pages of policies worked on over many years and many teams to be fair and cover necessary scope) E,g.: A website that used to be a good blog had it's domain expire and was purchased/repurposed to spam Search results with autogenerated pages full of gibberish text, scraped images, and links to boost traffic to other spammy sites. It is manually actioned for violating policy These Organic Search policies and the consequences to violating them are public[12] Manually reacting to things is not very scalable, and is not an ideal solution to most problems, so the proactive lever is really the one we all like to lean on. Ideally, our classifiers/algorithm are good at providing useful and rich results to our users while ignoring things at are not useful or not relevant. But we all know, this isn't exactly the case all the time (especially on YouTube). From a user perspective, there are subjects that are prone to hyperbolic content, misleading information, and offensive content. Now, these words are highly subjective and no one denies that. But we can all agree generally, lines exist in many cultures about what is clearly okay vs. what is not okay. E.g. a video of a puppy playing with a toy is probably okay in almost every culture or context, even if it's not relevant to the query. But a video of someone committing suicide and begging others to follow in his/her footsteps is probably on the other side of the line for many folks. While my second example is technically relevant to the generic query of 'suicide', that doesn't mean that this is a very useful or good video to promote on the top of results for that query. So imagine a classifier that says, for any queries on a particular text file, let's pull videos using signals that we historically understand to be strong indicators of quality (I won't go into specifics here, but those signals do exist). We're not manually curating these results, we're just saying 'hey, be extra careful with results for this query because many times really bad stuff can appear and lead to a bad experience for most users'. Ideally the proactive lever did this for us, but in extreme cases where we need to act quickly on something that is so obviously not okay, the reactive/manual approach is sometimes necessary. And also keep in mind, that this is different for every product. The bar for changing classifiers or manual actions on span in organic search isextremelyhigh. However, the bar for things we let our Google Assistant say out loud might be a lot lower. If I search for 'Jews run the banks' - I'll likely find anti-semitic stuff in organic search. As a Jew, I might find some of these results offensive, but they are there for people to research and view, and I understand that this is not a reflection of Google feels about this issue. But if I ask Google assistant 'Why do Jews run the banks' we wouldn't be similarly accepting if it repeated and promoted conspiracy theories that likely pop up in organic search in her smoothing voice. Whether we agree or not, user perception of our responses, results, and answers of different products and mediums can change. And I think many people are used to the fact that organic search is a place where content should be accessible no matter how offensive it might be, however, the expectation is very different on a Google Home, a Knowledge Panel, or even YouTube. These lines are very difficult and can be very blurry, we are all well aware of this. So we've got huge teams that stay cognizant of these facts when we're crafting policies considering classifier changes, or reacting with manual actions - these decisions are not made in a vacuum, but admittedly are also not made in a highly public forum like TGIF or IndustryInfo (as you can imagine, decisions/agreement would be hard to get in such a wide list - image if all your CL's were reviewed by every engineer across Google all the time). I hope that answers some questions and gives a better layer of transparency without going into details about our 'Pepsi formula'. Best, DanielThe fact that Google manually curates politically contentious search results fits in with a wider pattern of political activity on the part of the tech giant. In 2018, Breitbart News exclusively published a leaked video from the company that showedsenior management in dismay at Trump's election victory[13], and pledging to use the company's power to make his populist movement a'hiccup' in history[14]. Breitbart also leaked'The Good Censor,'[15]an internal research document from Google that admits the tech giant is engaged in the censorship of its own products, partly in response to political events. Another leak revealed that employees within the company, including Google's current director of Trust and Safety,tried to kick Breitbart News off Google's market-dominating online ad platforms[16]. Yet another showed Google engaged intargeted turnout operations[17]aimed to boost voter participation in pro-Democrat demographics in 'key states' ahead of the 2016 election. The effort was dubbed a 'silent donation' by a top Google employee. Evidence for Google's partisan activities is now overwhelming.President Trump has previously warned Google[18], as well as other Silicon Valley giants, not to engage in censorship or partisan activities. Google continues to defy him. Allum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.

In an interview with EL UNIVERSAL, he states that only a legal environment that is stable will allow the government to complete the investment that the country requires, otherwise not all the needs that Mexico has will be met. \"Having a stable, predictable regulatory legal environment that gives investors confidence and allows Mexico to supplement with external and private savings the deficits it has in terms of domestic savings and would not be able to finance all investment needs,\" says the official in responding to the country's main economic challenge by 2020. It asserts that certainty for investors is joined by two other challenges, the control of which is not the responsibility of the government and which are the trade relationship between China and the United States and the approval of the T-MEC.  ---XXX---  Young people call for Big Tech-style financial services MEXICO CITY, January 8.- The bad experience of the services offered by traditional banking in Mexico, both in physical and digital channels, does not convince users, mainly the youngest, who seek a service similar to those of global giants like Amazon or Google. </p><p>According to Rafael Roncancio, Director of Industry and Financial Services at Capgemini de M\u00e9xico, although banking has invested and tried to improve its services, it is not evaluated as a positive experience on the part of its users, as the degree of satisfaction is 33%. \"The parameter for consumers is that of big tech companies on how to use and interact with financial services, easily and targetedly.\" He explained that the developments of technology financial companies that have introduced novel products to the market and the Digital Collection (CoDi) platform show alternatives to improve the user experience.  ---XXX---  \"This year will continue social discontent in AL,\" Moody's says MEXICO CITY, January 8 .- Moody's Investors Service foresees that social discontent in Latin America will continue to increase in 2020, in the face of low growth in the countries of the region, which has impacted on job creation and income improvement in the region. \"Increased social discontent across the Latin American region affected the investment outlook and contributed to the growth cuts seen over the past year. Moody's expects this to remain a key point for 2020 and beyond, because relatively low growth is not expected to significantly improve employment dynamics, or to reduce income inequality,\" said Signature. In his view, this year in Latin America social discontent will limit the ability of governments to set measures for substantial fiscal consolidation. \"An increase in social discontent can result in increased political risk, which in turn can affect sovereign credit profiles. Dissatisfaction with the political class led to the election of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador in Mexico, candidates &amp;external;' that made the fight against corruption a key element of their political agendas,\" the agency said.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-10239782</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY0-G631-JBJN-M0VX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"555\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 8, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0009P6T</classCode><className>MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0008ZIE</classCode><className>CAPGEMINI SA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION &amp;

The research \u2013 based on survey responses from 130 senior decision makers representing a diverse range of financial companies across the UK \u2013 reports that a vast majority (84%) are investing in Open Banking products and services. 44% are also considering launching new products or services to improve the Open Banking experience for customers. A significant majority (77%) say Open Banking and PSD2 is one of the most radical changes in recent history for financial services, with 35% saying they strongly agree. </p><p> However, more than half (53%) of respondents say the industry has found it difficult to adapt to these new regulations. Despite high levels of enthusiasm and investment, many financial services firms \u2013 both banks and non-banks such as fintechs and payment services providers \u2013 are struggling to formulate and implement comprehensive strategies to deal with Open Banking. Two thirds (62%) say they do not have a comprehensive strategy in place and 13% have no investment strategy at all.   Looming competitive threats, including from big tech  Financial services companies are also clearly worried about competitive threats in the wake of the implementation of Open Banking, the research finds. In particular, banks see \u2018big tech\u2019 companies \u2013 such as Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple \u2013 as the biggest perceived competitive threat in the Open Banking space (63%). 45% of non-banks agree. Other threats come from within the existing ecosystem of banks, challengers and fintechs.  Two thirds (66%) of respondents believe the market will ultimately become more consolidated with larger banks and corporates buying fintech businesses and smaller banks to keep pace with the level of innovation and speed of product development required to make a success of Open Banking.    Even amidst myriad challenges and competitive threats, respondents suggest Open Banking is on track to achieve the aspirations of the industry's regulators.  More than two-thirds say that Open Banking, once fully implemented, will bring greater innovation to the industry (70%) and more choice for customers (65%), while half agree it will enable greater customer control of banking data and services (50%) and easier industry collaboration (48%). Overall, a large majority (72%) believe that Open Banking has been a positive step forward for the industry.  David Gardner, partner in the financial services team at TLT, says: \"Our research reveals the true scale of disruption that financial services companies are grappling with, alongside the opportunities that these far-reaching changes have created \u2013 provided that companies can keep up with the pace of change. It is encouraging to see that the vast majority of respondents hold Open Banking up as a positive initiative and \u2013 despite the challenges with defining a clear Open Banking strategy \u2013 the industry is not standing still.     \"Innovation is happening all the time as more participants define their strategy and find new ways to collaborate,, which is creating a huge sense of anticipation in the market. The race is on for every participant to identify their position and launch a \"killer app\" or product to capture that opportunity. Open Banking will open up the market to new participants and continue to drive disruption for all. This could result in a more polarised market, split between niche offerings and financial services platforms, and between those who embrace agile transformation and those that are more reactive and slower to adapt.   \"There are considerable challenges for existing players and new entrants \u2013 from complying with regulatory technical standards to identifying market opportunities and potential partnerships and making sure that customer data is adequately protected. Customer confidence and trust must be a major area of focus in order to realise the potential benefits that Open Banking can deliver. Would-be Open Banking champions need to consider their position, their partners and their strategy carefully, but make sure they can act and react quickly enough to take full advantage, before someone else does.\"  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN632506220181123</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TTC-SKP1-J9XT-P3MM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"758\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 23, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

A further 1300 people were injured, and 350,000 displaced by damage to their homes. The quakes caused massive infras truc ture damage, es timated to be Rp5000bn ($342.6m).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In response to this, Ms Sri Mulyani set about modernising the country's response to natural disasters through a new disaster risk financing and insurance strategy. Announced in October 2018, the strategy will insure public buildings from 2019, protecting them and helping to speed up the recovery process. Under the previous system, the country relied on a contingency fund of Rp3100bn annually, set aside from the budget to cover repairs after natural disasters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The finance ministry itself suffered tragedy when 20 employees were killed on a Lion Air flight from Jakarta, which crashed in October 2018. Ms Sri Mulyani met with the family members of the passengers, and pledged the ministry would monitor the search mission and identification of bodies in order to assist the bereaved.</p><p>While dealing with human tragedy, the country has still seen impressive growth. The gross domestic product deficit for 2018 is forecast to be about 1.86%, lower than the 2.19% estimated in the 2018 State Budget.</p><p>The coming years hold ambitious plans to boost the position of Indonesia as a major Asian market. To boost income and stimulate growth, Ms Sri Mulyani has made a series of changes to the taxation system to increase revenues. One aim is to boost taxpayer compliance to 82.5% in 2019 - a sizeable increase from the 74% recorded in 2014. To facilitate this growth, the payment process will be simplified, and the number of locations where payments can be made will be increased. In recognition of the complex legal and taxation systems in place, Ms Sri Mulyani also announced plans to reduce bureaucracy after the Global Competitiveness Report 2017 ranked Indonesia 41st out of 138 countries by this measure, a fall of four places on the previous year.</p><p>Tax cuts have been passed onto other areas to stimulate growth and support the economy. Income tax rates were cut for small and medium-sized enterprises, while a digital tax is to be imposed on e-commerce companies operating from overseas. The tax will impact 'big tech' service providers, as these companies often avoid paying taxes quite legally due to having no physical presence in the county. The aim is to create a more competitive operating environment for domestic providers.</p><p>The tax facilities on Indonesian-owned export services has been reduced to 0% VAT rates in a bid to stimulate these businesses. Services covered in the exemption include legal, accounting and IT.</p><p>The changes to the tax system are integral to the finance minister's aims of boosting state revenues by 12.9% to $146.5bn in 2019, with the increased income from tax predicted to represent 80% of the target.</p><p>CENTRAL BANKER OF THE YEAR, AMERICAS Alejandro Diaz de Leon, MexicoMexico's central bank governor, Alejandro D\u00edaz de Le\u00f3n, has had his work cut out for him. When he took the helm of Banco de M\u00e9xico in December 2017, after having previously served as its deputy governor, trouble was stirring.</p><p>Rising interest rates in the US were spurring investors to rethink their emerging markets exposures; the future of the North American free-trade agreement - on which the Mexican economy relies on - was uncertain; and Mexico was entering an election year that could have placed a potentially market-unfriendly president in charge.</p><p>Throughout such volatile times, Mr D\u00edaz de Le\u00f3n ensured markets could anticipate monetary policy decisions. Banco de M\u00e9xico's strategy has been to foster \"an orderly adjustment of the Mexican economy to the different external and internal challenges that we have faced\", he says.</p><p>Prompt and clear communication is vital to the success of stronger corrective actions to control inflation, and to improve transparency and accountability the central bank has introduced additional measures. From February 2018, it began releasing inflation forecasts, both for consumer price index and core inflation, for the eight quarters ahead.</p><p>These serve not only as an indication of the future trajectory envisaged by the bank, but also as a reference to better communicate the size and implications of potential future shocks once threats emerge, and how monetary policy might adjust to them. Full transcripts of monetary committee discussions will be available three years after they take place, earlier than in some other markets; statements and minutes will simultaneously be available in Spanish and English; and all board member speeches will be available online.</p><p>Central banks' actions can help keep economies on a healthy path, but some of the global and national challenges that countries face are beyond monetary institutions' remit. The Bank of Mexico governor believes that despite the social frustration that current conditions in Mexico and elsewhere have caused, \"we need to avoid quick fixes or mirages, and double down on the right set of policies and maintain strong fundamentals\".</p><p>These, he says, include keeping economies open to trade and capital flows; embracing technological change; a resilient financial sector; improving social mobility; and promoting strong institutions. \"In this regard, an autonomous central bank with the objective of providing stability as a public good is essential,\" he adds.</p><p>CENTRAL BANKER OF THE YEAR, ASIA-PACIFIC Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus, Malaysia Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus, Malaysia's central bank governor, only came to office in July 2018 but since then, has undertaken a raft of reforms with the aim of boosting gross domestic product (GDP) and tackling poverty.</p><p>Ms Nor Shamsiah came into the central bank after being integral to the 1MDB investigations that shook Malaysia in 2017. With this background she has been urging greater transparency in banking, and is seen as being a solid choice in pushing for stronger regulations and accountability in the country's banking system.</p><p>To fight black market cash payments, she has reduced the threshold for transactions that must be reported to the central bank: deposits of RM25,000 ($5970) and above will have to be explained from January 2019 - half the amount that has to be reported under existing laws. The country is also taking steps to reduce money laundering, as it has some of the highest rates in the world. Senior officials are now also required to show greater levels of accountability in the operation of their businesses.</p><p>Ms Nor Shamsiah's policies have the population's needs in mind. Foreign insurers operating in Malaysia must comply with stricter rules, in an attempt to give better healthcare to the whole population and are now required to contribute to the National Health Protection Fund, which provides aid to the poorest 40% of households in the country. (If they do not they will have to divest their stake.) From January 2019, Malaysia will also provide coverage against critical illnesses and hospital care for its most vulnerable citizens.</p><p>The country's growth has attracted international recognition, with the World Bank reporting Malaysia is showing signs of becoming a high-growth country. This prediction is backed by Ms Nor Shamsiah, who forecasts the country will register GDP growth of 4.8% for the full-year 2018, and 4.9% in 2019.</p><p>Looking to the future, Ms Nor Shamsiah plans to strengthen the country's use of technology, recognising that it can be implemented for a range of services. Tying in to her plans on strengthening the country's regulatory landscape, the move towards digital payments is hoped to reduce the dependence on cash and tackle financial crime.</p><p>CENTRAL BANKER OF THE YEAR, MIDDLE EAST Mohammad Y Al-Hashel, Kuwait Mohammad Y Al-Hashel, the winner of the 2019 Middle East Central Bank Governor of the Year award, has emerged as a regional rising star.</p><p>Since taking the helm of the Central Bank of Kuwait in 2012 at the age of 37, Mr Al-Hashel has steered the country's financial sector through the turbulence of the post-financial crisis period into calmer waters. In doing so, he has nurtured one of the strongest banking sectors anywhere in the world. Today, Kuwaiti banks are well capitalised, profitable and boast excellent asset quality. This favourable position owes much to the work of Mr Al-Hashel and the central bank through their efforts to stabilise the wider financial system.</p><p>Under Mr Al-Hashel's guidance, the central bank has improved the country's capital adequacy regime. By early 2018, Kuwaiti banks enjoyed a capital adequacy ratio of about 18.3%. Additional capital requirements have been placed on systemically important banks, while other measures - including the introduction of a simple leverage ratio to ensure banks do not become over-leveraged - exceed global benchmarks.</p><p>As noted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), each of these regulatory requirements are carefully weighted by the central bank in terms of costs and benefits, and are periodically reassessed to ensure resilience is developed in an efficient way.</p><p>Beyond regulation, Mr Al-Hashel has become a leading advocate for the growth of Islamic finance in Kuwait and around the world. This has seen the Central Bank of Kuwait partner with a number of international organisations, including the IMF and the Islamic Financial Services Board, to host events and seminars to promote the growth of sharia-compliant financial products and services on a global scale. Today, about 40% of Kuwait's banking sector assets are shariacompliant, pointing to the growth of the country as a hub for Islamic finance.</p><p>Meanwhile, in November 2018, the central bank launched Kuwait's first fintech regulatory sandbox. The rationale behind the sandbox is to offer fintech entities a safe environment in which to test products and services linked to electronic payment activities. The sandbox functions over a four-stage process in which applications are made and reviewed by the central bank, followed by a technical security and supervisory assessment.</p><p>CENTRAL BANKER OF THE YEAR, AFRICA Abdellatif Jouahri, MoroccoMorocco's economic trajectory continues to exhibit strong, underlying fundamentals, even as the country grapples with a number of developmental challenges.</p><p>The impact of a severe drought dented economic growth in 2016, which came in at just 1.2%. But improving weather conditions ameliorated the overall outlook for the country in 2017 when gross domestic product expanded by 4.4%. Figures from the central bank, Bank Al Maghrib, expect growth to reach about 3.5% in 2018 before dipping slightly to 3.1% in 2019.</p><p>Under these conditions, the country's banking sector has also been strengthened, largely as a result of work by the central bank and its governor, Abdellatif Jouahri. Though Moroccan banks registered modest Tier 1 capital and capital adequacy ratios of about 9.4% and 12%, respectively, midway through 2018, other indicators remain strong. The sector's liquidity coverage ratio stood at 152% by the end of 2017, while problem loans were at 7.5% midway through 2018, falling for the first time since 2010 according to rating agency Moody's. Encouragingly, the agency expects these problem loans to fall further in the coming years.</p><p>Meanwhile, the central bank has been working towards currency liberalisation by abandoning its nominal exchange rate (pegged to the euro, at 60% of the basket, and US dollar, at 40%) in pursuit of an inflation-targeting regime. This is expected to take a number of years.</p><p>In an important step in this exercise, the central bank loosened the currency fluctuations around the peg to 2.5% each way in January 2018. This gradual process of currency liberalisation should improve the competitiveness of the economy and promote higher levels of investment and diversification of trade flows with Africa, according to Moody's.</p><p>In a testament to Mr Jouahri's steady hand at the helm of the central bank, inflation has remained consistently low in recent times. Over the past decade it has averaged just 1.5%. Policy rates in Morocco have been maintained at 2.25% since March 2016.</p><p>In addition, the central bank has partnered with the national telecommunications regulator to jointly launched a national mobile wallet at the end of 2018; mobile wallet payments in Morocco are expected to hit $5.3bn by 2023.</p><p>FINANCE MINISTER OF THE YEAR, EUROPE M\u00e1rio Centeno, Portugal Portuguese finance minister Mario Centeno can look back on his first 12 months as president of the Eurogroup with well-earned satisfaction. Marathon negotiations involving eurozone finance ministers in early December ended with the most significant reforms to the single currency bloc since the sovereign debt crisis. Agreement was reached on dozens of issues based around preventing and managing future financial crises.</p><p>Mr Centeno is gearing up for two even bigger policy challenges in 2019; one a pillar of the banking union, the other intended to buttress the credibility of the whole euro project. \"Now we can concentrate on the European Deposit Insurance Scheme and the eurozone budget,\" he says.</p><p>Mr Centeno was an unusual choice by his peers for one of the bloc's most prestigious posts. He is the first Eurogroup head from southern Europe and the first from a country bailed out during the financial crisis. The election of the Portuguese economist, who has a doctorate from Harvard, was an acknowledgement of Portugal's astonishing economic recovery.</p><p>Unemployment has more than halved to below 7%, from a 2013 peak of more than 17%. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) predicts Portugal's gross domestic product (GDP) growth will remain \"broadly stable\" at about 2% in 2019 and 2020, supported by growth in consumption and exports. \"The fiscal deficit is expected to disappear by 2020 and the debt-to-GDP ratio is on a firmly declining path,\" adds the OECD.</p><p>Since 2015, his Socialist Party has governed in coalition with junior partners the radical Left Bloc and Portuguese Communists on an anti-austerity platform.</p><p>Mr Centeno's first priority was to restructure and recapitalise four of the five largest banks in Portugal during 2016 and 2017. Capital flowed in from investors in China, the US and Spain but the government also injected (EURO)3.9bn into state-owned Caixa Geral de Dep\u00f3sitos, the country's largest bank by assets. The minimum wage and pensions were raised while taxes on corporations and those on a low income were lowered. To ease the strain on public finances, infrastructure spending was slashed, but has started to recover since 2017.</p><p>Mr Centeno has won praise for his chairing of the 19-member Eurogroup, and for being more conciliatory than his sometimes abrasive predecessor, Jeroen Dijsselbloem.</p><p>\"I firmly believe in institutions and making them better,\" says Mr Centeno says. \"Compromises are of the essence in making progress.\"</p><p>FINANCE MINISTER OF THE YEAR, AMERICAS Felipe Larrain, Chile In a rollercoaster year for politics and financial markets in Latin America, Chile remained a beacon of stability. While raising its economic prospects for 2018, it also pushed ahead with an important reform agenda.</p><p>This included a new banking law that will strengthen capital requirements and improve oversight, bringing the sector closer in line with international standards. It also included new rules that simplify the tax payment process and the creation of an independent fiscal council - measures that will improve the efficiency and soundness of the fiscal system. The ultimate aim is to reduce the country's fiscal deficit and control the growth of public debt.</p><p>Chile has also remained a positive force for regional integration and an example of how openness and international trade can benefit national economies. Beside its role within the Pacific Alliance with Peru, Colombia and Mexico to foster trade and financial markets integration - which benefits from Chile's broad and well-established financial sector - Chile has grown its international ties. Its free-trade agreements now include 64 countries that represent more than 85% of global gross domestic product and 95% of Chilean exports.</p><p>Finance minister Felipe Larrain played an important role in keeping the country firmly on its economic path, which has garnered him The Banker's recognition as Finance Minister of the Year, Americas.</p><p>\"In a world that risks a retreat to inwardlooking policies, we are deeply committed to trade liberalisation within the Latin American region and beyond,\" says Mr Larrain. \"Chile is a small, open and financially integrated economy that has significantly benefited over time from greater engagement with the global economy. We are also working actively to convert Chile into a regional financial centre and a dynamic exporter of financial services.\"</p><p>Mr Larrain is well aware of the difficulties ahead stemming from the patchy global economic outlook. \"These are challenging times for the global economy, especially for emerging countries, as some downside risks to global growth cloud the horizon. Our resolve and determination as policy-makers will surely be tested,\" he says. Nonetheless, his resolve is unchanged: \"Our goal is to convert Chile into a developed nation, escaping the middleincome trap, for the benefit of all Chileans.\"</p><p>FINANCE MINISTER OF THE YEAR, MIDDLE EAST Moshe Kahlon, Israel Israel's economy has been ticking along at a respectable pace in recent years. In 2017 it expanded by 3.4%, driven by healthy domestic demand and solid global growth, according to the International Monetary Fund. Encouragingly, the outlook for 2018 and 2019 is even more positive, and the World Bank is anticipating growth of 3.6% and 3.5%, respectively.</p><p>This is occurring as the government's finances are in excellent shape; the budget deficit remains within the government target, coming in at 2.9% in 2017, and is expected to remain at the same level for fullyear 2018. Public debt, meanwhile, fell to 61% of gross domestic product in 2017, from levels as high as 90% in 2002.</p><p>Challenges exist, however, with levels of poverty and inequality in the economy exceeding the norms of other developed markets. But Israel's economy was rightly praised by the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development in 2018, for being \"strong\" and for registering a \"remarkable\" macroeconomic and fiscal performance in recent times. This achievement is the result of many years of hard work by the Israeli authorities. But more recently the economy's success has come under the auspices of finance minister Moshe Kahlon, who has held the post since 2015.</p><p>Under his guidance, Israel's Ministry of Finance has balanced fiscal discipline with the need to address some of the country's most pressing development problems. This includes allocating expanding technical training in schools and the further growth of the earned income tax credit programme, which is a tool to promote participation in the labour market. Both received a boost in the country's 2019 budget. In addition, the country's 2018 budget saw an expansion of funds for after-school childcare, as well as for disability benefits.</p><p>Cumulatively, these measures are tackling persistent and widening social inequalities in Israeli society while stimulating access to the labour market for under-represented groups. Reforms of this nature should, over the longer term, strengthen the economy at the expense of mild fiscal expansion in the short term. For these actions and other reasons, Moshe Kahlon comfortably emerged as the winner of the Middle East Finance Minister of the Year for 2019.</p><p>FINANCE MINISTER OF THE YEAR, AFRICA Mohamed Maait, EgyptEgypt's ambitious programme of economic reform continues to win plaudits from around the world, with good reason. In the space of a few short years, the country has enacted some of the most wide-reaching structural reforms in its recent history. Admittedly, this has led to a high degree of short-term pain for Egyptian consumers - high inflation has emerged, for instance, as a result of the free float of the pound - but these reforms are undoubtedly paving the way for a brighter future for the country. And at the forefront of this reform story is Egypt's finance ministry.</p><p>The current minister, Mohamed Maait, took office in June 2018, replacing Amr El Garhy. Though his tenure has been short, Mr Maait has continued the work of his predecessors to ensure that Egypt's reform programme remains on track. As such, the 2019 African Finance Minister of the Year award reflects both Mr Maait's personal contributions to this story, in tandem with the ministry's wider push to reform the economy. Indeed, the ministry's efforts to improve public finances saw Egypt post its first primary budget surplus (which excludes interest payments on government debt) in 15 years in July 2018. This came as tough fuel and electricity subsidy cuts, among other measures, helped to shore up Egypt's fiscal situation, and rating agency Moody's expects Egypt to return to sustain primary fiscal surpluses moving forward.</p><p>Underpinning this performance is a reduction in the energy subsidy bill, which is expected to fall below 1% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020, from about 4.1% of GDP in the 2017 fiscal year. Meanwhile, price hikes on fuel have seen the government achieve cost recoveries in this space of between 70% and 80%, up from just 30% in 2013.</p><p>These measures, and others, are expected to alleviate the government's high levels of public debt. According to Moody's, high GDP growth (which reached 5.2% in the fiscal year 2017/18), in tandem with the government's reforms, should see public debt burden fall to 82% of GDP by 2020, down from 103.5% in the 2017 fiscal year.</p><p>Encouragingly, the country's favourable outlook shows no signs of dimming. Moody's expects the impact of these reform measures to nudge GDP growth to about 6% in the coming years.</p><p>to boost incomE and stimUlatE growth, sri mUlyani indrawati has madE a sEriEs of changEs to thE taxation systEm to incrEasE rEvEnUEs</p><p>wE nEEd to avoid qUick fixEs or miragEs, and doUblE down on thE right sEt of policiEs Alejandro Diaz de Leon</p><p>nor shamsiah mohd yUnUs camE into thE cEntral bank aftEr bEing intEgral to thE 1mdb invEstigations that shook malaysia in 2017</p><p>mohammad y al-hashEl has bEcomE a lEading advocatE for thE growth of islamic financE in kUwait and aroUnd thE world</p><p>morocco's banking sEctor has bEEn strEngthEnEd, largEly as a rEsUlt of work by thE cEntral bank and its govErnor, abdEllatif joUahri</p><p>i firmly bEliEvE in institUtions and making thEm bEttEr M\u00e1rio Centeno</p><p>in a world that risks a rEtrEat to inward-looking policiEs, wE arE dEEply committEd to tradE libEralisation within thE latin amErican rEgion and bEyond Felipe Larrain</p><p>UndEr moshE kahlon's gUidancE, israEl's ministry of financE has balancEd fiscal disciplinE with thE nEEd to addrEss somE of thE coUntry's most prEssing dEvElopmEnt problEms</p><p>thoUgh his tEnUrE has bEEn short, mohamEd maait has continUEd thE work of his prEdEcEssors to EnsUrE that Egypt's rEform programmE rEmains on track</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BANKER-144715338</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BANKER2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V3D-P8G1-DYTY-C200-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234197</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3884\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Banker</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59210\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 1, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;
