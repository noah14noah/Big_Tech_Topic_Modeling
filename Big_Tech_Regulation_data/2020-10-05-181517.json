Only 25 percent of investors surveyed are confident that firms\u2019 digital transformation strategies will be effective, and less than 1 percent believe the plans are both clear and credible. The need to invest and build the firm of the future is pressing, but the window to deliver is closing and a reckoning is inevitable, said Ted Moynihan, Managing Partner and Global Head of Financial Services. According to the report, When Vision and Value Collide, financial services firms spend an average of 5 percent of revenue per year on transformation -- but investors say they do not understand what firms are investing in, or why. They don\u2019t know what transformation includes or what the endgame looks like.

Only 25 percent of investors surveyed are confident that firms' digital transformation strategies will be effective, and less than 1 percent believe the plans are both clear and credible.</p><p><br/><br/>'The need to invest and build the firm of the future is pressing, but the window to deliver is closing and a reckoning is inevitable,' said Mathieu Vasseux, Head of Financial Services in the Middle East and Africa. 'While some breakthroughs are occurring, macroeconomic conditions are going to put a lot of pressure on investment in areas where there has not been a positive enough impact yet on the bottom line.'<br/>Investor Disconnect<br/><br/>According to the report, When Vision and Value Collide, financial services firms spend an average of 5 percent of revenue per year on transformation -- but investors say they do not understand what firms are investing in, or why. They don't know what transformation includes or what the endgame looks like. Investors don't receive useful metrics on progress, and they are distrustful of the cost-benefit case of significant technology investments.<br/><br/>The ambitious, large-budget transformation programs banks talk about and the actual return they produce have left the investor community struggling to make sense of what is really happening. Ninety-eight percent of European banks mentioned 'digital' in their external communications, compared to only 27 percent of analyst research reports.<br/>The Window is Closing<br/><br/>This disconnect is happening at a time when valuation growth among big tech and fintech firms has eclipsed financial services. Since 2010, price-to-earnings ratio for fintechs have steadily risen, with multiples now twice financial services firms. Banks have seen the price-to-earnings multiple fall from 14 times to 11 times.<br/><br/>In mature markets, low interest rates have already delivered cyclical revenue declines that are worse than any digital disruption. Oliver Wyman estimates that 75 percent of the value erosion in European banking has come from macro factors and regulation, and only 25 percent from new entrants, fintech and margin compression. A further downturn could have a severe impact on investment budgets.<br/>The major recessions and financial crises of the past 30 years have coincided with single-year losses for banks of between 10 and 50 percent of revenue, likely far exceeding the funds available to invest.<br/><br/>While revenue growth is low and macroeconomic conditions are deteriorating, the need for financial services firms to invest in transformation remains pressing. Challenging returns and overcapacity mean a step-change in productivity is often needed. Longer-term, the increasing competitive pressure from technology companies will increase the pace of financial services offerings being brought to the market.<br/><br/>When Vision and Value Collide, Which Will Win?<br/><br/>Some firms have backed their vision mindset and spent aggressively on innovation and transformation efforts, often with disappointing bottom-line results. In other firms the value mindset has dominated, leading to a myriad of small changes with known but often low-impact outcomes.<br/><br/>Firms will need a mix of both vision and value mindsets to succeed over the short and long term. Right now, firms are struggling to get investment to their strategic priorities, with 40 percent of change budgets still going toward mandatory regulatory changes. Light touch management of digital initiatives will come to an end, and a more disciplined, interventionist approach will emerge.<br/><br/>Oliver Wyman see five keys for firms to get the balance right: 1) take a surgical approach to investment, avoiding me-too digital capability building; 2) focus on a smaller number of well-funded growth initiatives; 3) increase focus on productivity gains from investment in technology; 4) develop better science on how to measure and manage change; and 5) improve external communications so investors can better understand what drives performance and allow progress on long-term change to be tracked.<br/><br/>'Winning firms will need a mix of both the vision and value mindsets, but many will get the balance wrong,' concluded Vasseux. 'Each company needs to find the right mix to bring vision and value together and agree on a path forward - all while the threat of big tech looms, a recession may be coming, and investors are growing increasingly impatient.'<br/><br/><br/>MENAFN2701202000702288ID1099607627</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MENENG-1099607627</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MENENG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2V-86B1-JCNX-30MP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300954</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"768\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MENA English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38985\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(Graphic: Business Wire)</p><p>\"The need to invest and build the firm of the future is pressing, but the window to deliver is closing and a reckoning is inevitable,\" said Ted Moynihan, Managing Partner and Global Head of Financial Services. \"While some breakthroughs are occurring, macroeconomic conditions are going to put a lot of pressure on investment in areas where there has not been a positive enough impact yet on the bottom line.\"</p><p>Investor Disconnect</p><p>According to the report, When Vision and Value Collide, financial services firms spend an average of 5 percent of revenue per year on transformation -- but investors say they do not understand what firms are investing in, or why. They don't know what transformation includes or what the endgame looks like. Investors don't receive useful metrics on progress, and they are distrustful of the cost-benefit case of significant technology investments.</p><p>The ambitious, large-budget transformation programs banks talk about and the actual return they produce have left the investor community struggling to make sense of what is really happening. Ninety-eight percent of European banks mentioned \"digital\" in their external communications, compared to only 27 percent of analyst research reports.</p><p>The Window is Closing</p><p>This disconnect is happening at a time when valuation growth among big tech and fintech firms has eclipsed financial services. Since 2010, price-to-earnings ratio for fintechs have steadily risen, with multiples now twice financial services firms. Banks have seen the price-to-earnings multiple fall from 14 times to 11 times.</p><p>In mature markets, low interest rates have already delivered cyclical revenue declines that are worse than any digital disruption. Oliver Wyman estimates that 75 percent of the value erosion in European banking has come from macro factors and regulation, and only 25 percent from new entrants, fintech and margin compression. A further downturn could have a severe impact on investment budgets.</p><p>The major recessions and financial crises of the past 30 years have coincided with single-year losses for banks of between 10 and 50 percent of revenue, likely far exceeding the funds available to invest.</p><p>While revenue growth is low and macroeconomic conditions are deteriorating, the need for financial services firms to invest in transformation remains pressing. Challenging returns and overcapacity mean a step-change in productivity is often needed. Longer-term, the increasing competitive pressure from technology companies will increase the pace of financial services offerings being brought to the market.</p><p>When Vision and Value Collide, Which Will Win?</p><p>Some firms have backed their vision mindset and spent aggressively on innovation and transformation efforts, often with disappointing bottom-line results. In other firms the value mindset has dominated, leading to a myriad of small changes with known but often low-impact outcomes.</p><p>Firms will need a mix of both vision and value mindsets to succeed over the short and long term. Right now, firms are struggling to get investment to their strategic priorities, with 40 percent of change budgets still going toward mandatory regulatory changes. Light touch management of digital initiatives will come to an end, and a more disciplined, interventionist approach will emerge.</p><p>Oliver Wyman see five keys for firms to get the balance right: 1) take a surgical approach to investment, avoiding me-too digital capability building; 2) focus on a smaller number of well-funded growth initiatives; 3) increase focus on productivity gains from investment in technology; 4) develop better science on how to measure and manage change; and 5) improve external communications so investors can better understand what drives performance and allow progress on long-term change to be tracked.</p><p>\"Winning firms will need a mix of both the vision and value mindsets, but many will get the balance wrong,\" concluded Moynihan. \"Each company needs to find the right mix to bring vision and value together and agree on a path forward - all while the threat of big tech looms, a recession may be coming, and investors are growing increasingly impatient.\"</p><p>About the Report</p><p>When Vision and Value Collide is Oliver Wyman's 23rd annual State of the Financial Services Industry report. This year's report features insight from a survey of investors, analysts, and management teams and analysis of investment levels and progress. The report is broken into three sections - investor pressure, the closing window to deliver, and how companies can make the vision/value mindset collision work for them. The report will be discussed at a panel during the World Economic Forum Annual Global Meeting in Davos on Tuesday, January 21.</p><p>About Oliver Wyman</p><p>Oliver Wyman is a global leader in management consulting.

They are increasingly hated by all sides of the political spectrum, and so the only question now is how severe the backlash will be, not whether it will happen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Left hate the size and profits of Big Tech, want it to pay more in tax, are upset at its employment practices, and are incensed at what they believe, with limited evidence, was its role in Donald Trump's victory. The Right resent how Twitter is dominated by an elite that is hostile to capitalism, conservatism and Brexit, are angry at the technology establishment's Left-wing politics, and hate the industry's cultural conformity. Libertarians, who ordinarily have great respect for entrepreneurs, are terrified about the abolition of privacy, the rise of a surveillance society, and the fact that data could easily fall into the wrong, authoritarian hands; hawks are concerned that mass automation means the West is exposing itself to devastating Russian or Chinese cyber-attacks.</p><p>In other words, nobody is happy, except for, by and large, consumers, who continue to lap it all up, buying from Amazon or signing up to Netflix in droves. But as Sadiq Khan's attack on Uber reminds us, consumers are never a powerful enough constituency when all other groups want to target an industry. We are about to witness an avalanche of crude anti-trust attacks, based on obsolete economic ideas, much higher taxes, often on revenues rather than profits, an economically stupid approach, and a generalised legislative onslaught. Some of this will help; but much will do more harm than good, and merely slow innovation. The Brussels-led assault on Microsoft in the Noughties proved the uselessness of this approach: regulators chased the wrong issues, not realising that another new technology - the internet - would make Microsoft's power over the desktop irrelevant.</p><p>There is a better way, and that is to apply intelligent centre-Right thinking to reforming tech. We need to create a real free-market in data: we need more and better capitalism, not less. We must empower individuals, not bureaucrats, by changing the rules of the game. History should be our guide.</p><p>Progress through the ages has come from extending, refining and spreading property rights to as many people as possible. Instead of tribal chiefs, kings, the Church or a few noble families owning all of the land, the dispersion of property over the centuries helped create the conditions for an explosion in economic growth, liberalism and democracy.</p><p>As ideas became more important, we extended ownership to intellectual property, incentivising inventions and creativity. We are now at another turning point: we live in a data society and yet haven't started to think about who should own it. Should information about people - what they eat, where they drive, how they vote - be treated as \"unowned\", in what John Locke described as the state of nature, ready to be homesteaded by the big tech firms in return for better services or \"free\" apps? Or is such an approach an outrage akin to the imperialism of yore, when Westerners seized resources that should have been owned by local populations, and employed them as a consolation prize?</p><p>If the answer is the latter, the good news is that economists are working on solutions. Luigi Zingales and Guy Rolnik of the University of Chicago, for example, want to make it easier for new social networks to be created, and for users to switch, by changing the ownership of the data and social relationships contained in people's accounts. In the early days of the mobile phone, numbers were owned by providers, and it was hard for customers to shift to a competitor. They would have to inform all of their contacts of their new number, cumbersome for individuals and lethal for businesses.</p><p>All of this changed with mobile phone portability, when consumers were given ownership of their numbers. Our notion of property rights was upgraded: our mobile number is now part of our identity. Zingales and Rolnilk similarly want to reallocate the ownership of people's \"social graph\" - our networks and data, including pictures - from Facebook, Twitter or Microsoft's LinkedIn to the individual user. Our digital relationships would be ours, just like our homes, our postal addresses and our phone numbers.</p><p>Social media companies would become like telecom operators: users would no longer be locked in, forced either to sign up to whatever terms and conditions are imposed by the company or to quit altogether. It would radically constrain corporate power while avoiding the madness of nationalisation or forcible break-ups.</p><p>In a separate paper, economists, including Imanol Ibarra and Jaron Lanier, argue that user data is typically treated as capital, entirely created by and thus owned by firms from observing willing individuals who have signed away their rights to privacy. Yet this \"neglects users' role in creating data\", they explain, reducing incentives for consumers to help produce more of it, and fuelling mistrust. The solution? Classify data at least partly as the product of labour - in other words, make it part-owned by consumers. Data is a collaboration: without consumers, there wouldn't be any, and ditto without the tech firms.</p><p>Gaspard Koenig, of French think tank G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Libre, goes further still. He believes individuals should own all of the data they disclose about themselves, not the big tech firms that collate and distill it. He wants to give users a choice: they could refuse to hand over any data and instead be asked to pay a fee to use formerly free software, such as an email account; or they could rent their data, in exchange for a regular payment; or go the whole hog and sell it, for a bigger sum. A real market would be created - rather than an automatic trade of data for a free service - and a meaningful price for information would emerge.</p><p>The tech world is in crisis, but the answer isn't more taxes, government meddling and socialism. It's to create a free-market in data by making us own all of the information that we disclose, and by allowing us to choose whether we want to hand it over to companies and at what price. Radical? Of course, but the alternative - a Corbyn-style neutering of the tech industry - doesn't bear thinking about.</p><p>FOLLOW Allister Heath on Twitter @AllisterHeath; READ MORE at <url

Technologies such as cloud, artificial intelligence and machine learning will help fill the gap of India's \"missing middle\", Chandrasekaran writes in his latest book, Bridgital Nation: Solving Technology's People Problem, co authored by Roopa Purushothaman, chief economist of the Tata Group.These Bridgital workers will help create 30 million jobs by 2025 if the model is applied successfully, Chandrasekaran and Purushothaman tell ET during a freewheeling conversation that included subjects as diverse as technology and its impact on jobs, the disruption caused by the new economy, and fostering entrepreneurship beyond select geographies. Edited excerpts:Your book Bridgital Nation highlights the use of digital to create employment opportunities. How do you see that reaching people across the economic strata in India?N Chandrasekaran: I feel you cannot fix shortage either by building more capacity or by putting more money because time is not on our side, the demand supply ratio is so huge - like hospital to doctors, or schools to teachers, or the number of judges. </p><p>It will take a lot of time to build that kind of capital or talent required. We have most of our jobs in the informal sector which is almost 77%. Not all these jobs are secure or high paying and mostly they are invented by individuals themselves.On the one hand, we have high-end talent and low-end pool of workers and this is what we call the \"missing middle\". The solution lies in coming up with a framework that guarantees no resource is wasted and is put to maximum use. Bridging the gap with technology can solve the problem. And that is possible through cloud, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Bridgital is the method to bridge using technology the gaps to access jobs.How would you implement this model?NC: We have the methodology, and have even run pilots and tested it in the last five years. This has been done in areas like cancer care, primary care. Take, for example, the passport work. \" Today, the process has been demystified.\"So that has created a new category of professionals empowered with technology. We have to demystify the job like the way passports are processed where specialisation comes in probably at the last stage. And those people who are typically low-skilled and execute most of the work till the last leg form a new category of empowered bridgital workers.So ordinary workers can be empowered in a processified and digitised world and trained to work in a digital environment. So these are a new set of professionals who are not necessarily technocrats.Job creation through Bridgital to be in both traditional and service sectors to create the missing middle.You mention in the book how the startup and entrepreneurial spirit has to move beyond Bangalore. Do you believe that technology innovation has not filtered down to all sections of the society?NC: If startups are working in technology and IT, why can't they work in every other environment? We gave an example of the textile worker Amit in the book, which goes back to looking at what entrepreneurship means. How do you create this entrepreneurial zeal in every sector and every part of India and make more entrepreneurs flourish.Roopa Purushothaman: Traditionally we have focused on getting more land, functions like HR, finance and taxation can be taken up by the need to build a more main street set of workers compared to Bangalore's IT kind of employees. So how do we take the success seen there and take it to more people. So the textile workers can focus on not just design, but HR, finance and back office operations. It is about creating entrepreneurs in every part of India and increasing the number of employees at these SMEs, which is currently at a dismal two and a half per cent.Tell us a bit about Tata Digital...NC: Right now we are not ready to talk about it. It is a new company, like a platform.While you talk of job creation with the help of technology, we are also seeing a lot of backlash by the incumbents against the internet economy, across e-commerce, food delivery. So how do you deal with disruption that comes along with technology?NC: Every business is getting reinvented. I call it the importance of ecosystems. What is happening is that companies were set up around products. Now every industry is being controlled by an ecosystem, and it doesn't come from the product side but from the consumer side.The ecosystem is serving the customers' choice; they go back and source products.The power is shifting from the product creator or owner to the ecosystem. It is my firm belief that every company across industries has to study what their ecosystem is. Either they have to create it or be an anchor or be a significant participant in the ecosystem; otherwise they will lose. You look at restaurants- now when we want to go out and dine, many times we just order in ... Whether you like it or not, it's happening.The issue is not to avoid the disruption.And while this ecosystem is getting built at the same time it is not fully successful. Look at Uber, it doesn't make money, Ola, Oyo, don't make money. The point is there is traction for these businesses because customers use them, but the business models are not yet proven. It will evolve but the traditional players cannot ignore them.What about data privacy? You've spoken about the US, EU and China models. Are you worried about Big Tech and data? What should India follow?NC: As you solve problems of scale, data privacy will be the foundation.Data privacy will need to be embedded in the way we build solutions. It can be done, at the same time privacy is critical.Security and privacy are two sides of the same coin.Regulations have to be formed but more importantly, it's about the enforcement.So it's how the terms of reference are put together by technology companies or the Big Tech, and how well documented these terms are for the people.Coming back to the book, it falls into the techno optimist category...NC: It is a pragmatic book.It is similar to whether you are pro or anti ecosystem.As chairman of Tata Motors, I can say all of this (ride hailing) will eventually fail; so let me have world class service stations and dealers. Or I can take the view, whether I am a part of the ecosystem or not, it (changes) will happen.I have taken the view that AI and ML will influence all industries, it will impact every market and industry at varying speeds. So how do we embrace it so that they are put to use.Given India's low per capita income, why is the percentage of women in the workforce dropping - a central point in the book?RP: There are largely three reasons, responsibility for unpaid work in India is huge, the safety and mobility concerns and the underlying gender context of preference for males. You don't see that in all countries as much as India.... Getting women into the workforce can solve half the issue of the missing middle.In India, we have two major challenges. First, there is an access issue. There is a huge shortage. You can't fix shortage building more capacity. Look at the doctors-to-patient ratio, teacher-to-student, the number of judges. It takes a lot of time to build capacity. Second is that we have a lot of talented people. There is a huge demand for services...Who is tasked with the onus of creating these skills? Where does the government come in and how do corporates such as the Tatas pitch in?NC: The idea of putting out the book with all the details was that it can get debated and adopted so that it solves problems. I definitely want to do a few projects on this scale where digital can be put to use. We are also setting up the Indian Institute of Skills, which the government asked us to do. The approval has come in and we want to design the curriculum about not just vocational skills but also bring in the concept of digital skills for all sectors.

Technologies such as cloud, artificial intelligence and machine learning will help fill the gap of India's \"missing middle\", Chandrasekaran writes in his latest book, Bridgital Nation: Solving Technology's People Problem, co authored by Roopa Purushothaman, chief economist of the Tata Group.These Bridgital workers will help create 30 million jobs by 2025 if the model is applied successfully, Chandrasekaran and Purushothaman tell ET during a freewheeling conversation that included subjects as diverse as technology and its impact on jobs, the disruption caused by the new economy, and fostering entrepreneurship beyond select geographies. Edited excerpts:Your book Bridgital Nation highlights the use of digital to create employment opportunities. How do you see that reaching people across the economic strata in India?N Chandrasekaran: I feel you cannot fix shortage either by building more capacity or by putting more money because time is not on our side, the demand supply ratio is so huge - like hospital to doctors, or schools to teachers, or the number of judges. </p><p>It will take a lot of time to build that kind of capital or talent required. We have most of our jobs in the informal sector which is almost 77%. Not all these jobs are secure or high paying and mostly they are invented by individuals themselves.On the one hand, we have high-end talent and low-end pool of workers and this is what we call the \"missing middle\". The solution lies in coming up with a framework that guarantees no resource is wasted and is put to maximum use. Bridging the gap with technology can solve the problem. And that is possible through cloud, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Bridgital is the method to bridge using technology the gaps to access jobs.How would you implement this model?NC: We have the methodology, and have even run pilots and tested it in the last five years. This has been done in areas like cancer care, primary care. Take, for example, the passport work. \" Today, the process has been demystified.\"So that has created a new category of professionals empowered with technology. We have to demystify the job like the way passports are processed where specialisation comes in probably at the last stage. And those people who are typically low-skilled and execute most of the work till the last leg form a new category of empowered bridgital workers.So ordinary workers can be empowered in a processified and digitised world and trained to work in a digital environment. So these are a new set of professionals who are not necessarily technocrats.Job creation through Bridgital to be in both traditional and service sectors to create the missing middle.You mention in the book how the startup and entrepreneurial spirit has to move beyond Bangalore. Do you believe that technology innovation has not filtered down to all sections of the society?NC: If startups are working in technology and IT, why can't they work in every other environment? We gave an example of the textile worker Amit in the book, which goes back to looking at what entrepreneurship means. How do you create this entrepreneurial zeal in every sector and every part of India and make more entrepreneurs flourish.Roopa Purushothaman: Traditionally we have focused on getting more land, functions like HR, finance and taxation can be taken up by the need to build a more main street set of workers compared to Bangalore's IT kind of employees. So how do we take the success seen there and take it to more people. So the textile workers can focus on not just design, but HR, finance and back office operations. It is about creating entrepreneurs in every part of India and increasing the number of employees at these SMEs, which is currently at a dismal two and a half per cent.Tell us a bit about Tata Digital...NC: Right now we are not ready to talk about it. It is a new company, like a platform.While you talk of job creation with the help of technology, we are also seeing a lot of backlash by the incumbents against the internet economy, across e-commerce, food delivery. So how do you deal with disruption that comes along with technology?NC: Every business is getting reinvented. I call it the importance of ecosystems. What is happening is that companies were set up around products. Now every industry is being controlled by an ecosystem, and it doesn't come from the product side but from the consumer side.The ecosystem is serving the customers' choice; they go back and source products.The power is shifting from the product creator or owner to the ecosystem. It is my firm belief that every company across industries has to study what their ecosystem is. Either they have to create it or be an anchor or be a significant participant in the ecosystem; otherwise they will lose. You look at restaurants- now when we want to go out and dine, many times we just order in ... Whether you like it or not, it's happening.The issue is not to avoid the disruption.And while this ecosystem is getting built at the same time it is not fully successful. Look at Uber, it doesn't make money, Ola, Oyo, don't make money. The point is there is traction for these businesses because customers use them, but the business models are not yet proven. It will evolve but the traditional players cannot ignore them.What about data privacy? You've spoken about the US, EU and China models. Are you worried about Big Tech and data? What should India follow?NC: As you solve problems of scale, data privacy will be the foundation.Data privacy will need to be embedded in the way we build solutions. It can be done, at the same time privacy is critical.Security and privacy are two sides of the same coin.Regulations have to be formed but more importantly, it's about the enforcement.So it's how the terms of reference are put together by technology companies or the Big Tech, and how well documented these terms are for the people.Coming back to the book, it falls into the techno optimist category...NC: It is a pragmatic book.It is similar to whether you are pro or anti ecosystem.As chairman of Tata Motors, I can say all of this (ride hailing) will eventually fail; so let me have world class service stations and dealers. Or I can take the view, whether I am a part of the ecosystem or not, it (changes) will happen.I have taken the view that AI and ML will influence all industries, it will impact every market and industry at varying speeds. So how do we embrace it so that they are put to use.Given India's low per capita income, why is the percentage of women in the workforce dropping - a central point in the book?RP: There are largely three reasons, responsibility for unpaid work in India is huge, the safety and mobility concerns and the underlying gender context of preference for males. You don't see that in all countries as much as India.... Getting women into the workforce can solve half the issue of the missing middle.In India, we have two major challenges. First, there is an access issue. There is a huge shortage. You can't fix shortage building more capacity. Look at the doctors-to-patient ratio, teacher-to-student, the number of judges. It takes a lot of time to build capacity. Second is that we have a lot of talented people. There is a huge demand for services...Who is tasked with the onus of creating these skills? Where does the government come in and how do corporates such as the Tatas pitch in?NC: The idea of putting out the book with all the details was that it can get debated and adopted so that it solves problems. I definitely want to do a few projects on this scale where digital can be put to use. We are also setting up the Indian Institute of Skills, which the government asked us to do. The approval has come in and we want to design the curriculum about not just vocational skills but also bring in the concept of digital skills for all sectors.

If you're not familiar with the kind of neighborhood South Beach is these days, in 2016 the IRS collected 7,020 returns from ZIP code 94105, and 2,180 of them were from households earning an adjusted gross income exceeding $200,000 a year.</p><p> Since March 13, these households have been packing public meetings in opposition to the plan. This week they shouted down the mayor.</p><p> Their complaints have been the usual NIMBY-ish stuff about how visible poors need to go somewhere else.</p><p> After years of housing crisis, there is a growing sense in California that this kind of rhetoric won't help us solve our problems.</p><p> That's probably why the residents decided they needed insurance in the form of litigation.</p><p> On March 20, Wallace Lee created a GoFundMe campaign called Safe Embarcadero for All to collect lawyer's fees for a fight against the city. Lee lives near many senior technology executives, Stanford professors, human resources VPs and others who have been eager to throw money at the problem of being forced to see unhoused people on a daily basis. As of Friday afternoon, the fundraiser had collected $94,500.</p><p> \"My clients are certain this is not the right spot for this,\" Andrew Zacks, the residents' lawyer, told me. \"My clients feel like they should bear some of the city's problems, but to put 200 beds on this site and not have plans for other locations for other parts of town is wrong.\"</p><p> Lee's fundraiser also caught the eye of an Outer Richmond resident named William Fitzgerald.</p><p> A former Google public policy and communications staffer, Fitzgerald is fluent in both San Francisco's passive-aggressive doublespeak as well as the language of internet trolling. He was perfectly prepared for this incident.</p><p> \"A legal fund to stop people from getting shelter just seemed crazy,\" Fitzgerald told me. \"I thought it would be a way to show that San Francisco is not this terrible place where people are just spending money to prevent other people from getting their basic human rights.\"</p><p> Fitzgerald launched his own GoFundMe fundraiser, called SAFER Embarcadero for All, on March 28.</p><p> When I asked him why the proceeds are going to the Coalition on Homelessness, Fitzgerald said it is because \"they'll continue to spend this money to fight for housing for everybody in San Francisco.\"</p><p> Already, we were at Defcon Three for San Francisco's current readiness condition: wealthy, progressively minded San Franciscans claiming they supported homeless efforts everywhere but their own neighborhoods; unreasonable demands for the democratic process; the use of technology to inflict unseen violence on one's neighbors and a fundraiser as meme generator.</p><p> Then Big Tech jumped in.</p><p> GoFundMe decided to support Fitzgerald's campaign with a $5,000 donation. San Francisco's favorite billionaire son, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff, weighed in with $10,000.</p><p> Benioff opened the floodgates, bringing Twilio co-founder Jeff Lawson and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey along with him. The national media started pontificating, and we are now at Defcon Two \u2014 the point at which a heated local spat becomes A Battle for San Francisco's Soul\u2122.</p><p> A well-worn tale is comforting. But there are a few wrinkles in this one.</p><p> The first change is the fact that Big Tech is taking part in politics at all.</p><p> It's happening under duress, of course. Just last year, Dorsey was campaigning against Proposition C, the homeless services tax.</p><p> But everywhere you go, lawmakers are turning on tech, whether it's Facebook bracing for global regulations or the Board of Supervisors seeming loath to renew the Twitter tax break. Tech leaders are wising up and realizing that the best way to seem responsible is to look charitable for the right causes.</p><p> That brings us to the second change: Building homeless shelters in wealthy neighborhoods now looks like the right cause.</p><p> The South Beach residents are absolutely correct about the fact that for too long, San Francisco has forced just a few neighborhoods to bear the burden of providing the city with not just homeless services but also new housing and office space and all the growing pains that come with them.</p><p> Fitzgerald's neighborhood, for example, has no Navigation Center. His supervisor, Sandra Fewer, has no plans to welcome one.</p><p> That's unfair, and it has to change.</p><p> But it's also true that well-heeled South Beach residents have never imagined they'd be responsible for accommodating others.</p><p> Now, it's not just the city's government but their own peers saying they must.</p><p> That's a huge difference, and it's one that the rest of the city's residents are clearly relishing. Fitzgerald's fundraiser is at $167,875 and counting.</p><p> Caille Millner is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

the most popular in the world - users must first turn on the device location setting, which enables GPS and could allow Google to determine their locations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">More than one million have signed up for the Protect Scotland app - around a quarter of the adult population of the nation.</p><p>The Scottish Government insist that individuals privacy \"will be protected as it uses Bluetooth technology to anonymously alert users if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19 and advises them to self-isolate.\"</p><p>Users of the app who test positive will get a call from a contact tracer to confirm their details and who they have been in close contact with.</p><p>They say the app does not store details on an individual or their location but \"uses encrypted, anonymised codes exchanged between smartphones to determine all close contacts\".</p><p>Close contacts are defined as people who have been within two metres of someone who has tested positive for 15 minutes.</p><p>READ MORE:\u00a0Test and Protect Scotland: Here's what Scots think of new coronavirus tracking app</p><p>The Herald on Sunday can reveal that when people agree to the terms and conditions in using the app, they are also automatically agreeing to Amazon Web Services accessing \"personal information\".</p><p>The details are revealed in an associated privacy notice, that reveals that personal information \"is shared with the third parties set out below\"... including Amazon Web Services.</p><p>The document highlights that the \"personal information\" being a mobile phone number, estimated date of infection, an authorisation code, the IP address, the exposure notification and confirmation of app use will go to the NHS.</p><p>Included as a \"party with whom personal information is shared\" is Amazon Web Services \"who host the app\" under contract with the NHS.</p><p>It also states that none of the information is retained.</p><p>The Scottish Government, when told about the privacy notice insists Amazon does not get any personal information which they say is encoded.</p><p>\"It may say that, but only NHS Education for Scotland has the data anything Amazon is getting is anonymised codes.</p><p>The Scottish Government has been asked why, then, the \"personal information is shared\" disclaimer is\u00a0required.</p><p>The privacy notice links to \"how we use your personal information\" details which explains the purpose for having that information.</p><p>It states: \"We will only use your personal information when the law allows us to do so and to the minimum extent possible.\"</p><p>It says mobile phone numbers are used to \"send an authorisation code for exposure notifications to be provided to other app users\" if an individual receives a positive Covid-19 test result.</p><p>But it also states that the app itself does not use your mobile phone number.</p><p>The estimated date of infection is used to \"identify the relevant time period during which other app users could have been infected\" if they were near someone who has received a positive COVID-19 test result. This is likely to be either the test date or the date of first symptoms.</p><p>It says the infectious time period is used to identify the relevant \"random ID\" from the app user's device who have tested positive, to allow exposure notifications to be provided to those who could be at risk.</p><p>The IP address is used to \"send information from your phone to the app server to allow exposure notifications to be provided to other app users and to collect metric data\".</p><p>And exposure notifications are used to \"inform you that you have been at risk of contracted the virus and to collect metric data\".</p><p>A user's confirmation of the use of the app is also used \"to collect metric data\".</p><p>Amazon CloudWatch monitors the use of apps run on Amazon Web Services using metric data. The notice says that after the setup of the app on a device, the IP address is stripped off so the confirmation of use is anonymous.</p><p>Privacy campaigners have been concerned that Google's location requirements add to privacy and security concerns with virus-tracing apps.</p><p>Government officials and medical experts believe the apps can be a helpful complement to public health efforts to stem the pandemic.</p><p>READ MORE:\u00a0NHS Scotland Test and Protect coronavirus app: What is it and how does it work?</p><p>But human rights groups and technologists have warned that aggressive data collection and security flaws in apps across the world put hundreds of millions of people at risk for stalking, scams, identity theft or oppressive government tracking.</p><p>Google has said apps using Bluetooth scanning signals to detect smartphones that come into close contact with one another - do not need to know the devices' locations at all.</p><p>But since 2015, Google's Android system has required users to enable location on their phones to scan for other Bluetooth devices because some apps may use Bluetooth to infer user location.</p><p>For instance, some apps use Bluetooth beacons in stores to help marketers understand which aisle a smartphone user may be in.</p><p>The concern is that once Android users turn on their location, Google can determine their locations, using Wi-Fi, mobile networks and Bluetooth beacons, through a setting called Google Location Accuracy, and use the data to improve location services.</p><p>Google has said that apps that did not have user permission could not gain access to a person's Android device location.</p><p>It says that on Android 10 and earlier, the Exposure Notifications System uses the phone's location setting and bluetooth but there were ways to manage your privacy.</p><p>According to Google it and Apple have \"built in safeguards\" to ensure that government contact tracing apps built with the Exposure Notifications System cannot infer your location.</p><p>The Scottish wing of the Open Rights Group which protects the digital rights of people in the UK including privacy and free speech online, said it was important that Scotland does all it can to produce \"clear, transparent information\" about their app to \"maintain public trust\".</p><p>That means documentation such as the source code, the Data Protection Impact Assessment, Equality and Human Rights Impact Assessments and clear communication of the principles behind the app should be \"seen as a priority\".</p><p>The Open Rights Group said it understood that these documents are imminent for publication and the reason for their failure to appear at launch was that the app was released faster than expected following a speedy approval from Apple and Google. The Scottish Government said that certain documents were published on Friday.</p><p>In an early analysis they had initially believed that there was no usable data available to Amazon, but was concerned that system designs mean that apps continue to run geolocation services.</p><p>The group's Scottish director Matthew Rice said: \"We have to acknowledge that this app for better and worse is still firmly in the ecosystem of big tech firms and so Scotland is unable to control aspects of this development and the app's functions.</p><p>\"While certain factors are out of the control of the Scottish Government, what they can do, they have done well, but they must ensure to give clarity going forward and give all the transparency they can through supporting documents and clear communications to everyone in Scotland.\"</p><p>De-centralised apps have been favoured by privacy campaigners because the matching process takes place on users' smartphones rather on a central computer, providing a greater degree of anonymity.</p><p>In an analysis Mr Rice adds: \"We have to remember that with this app we are living in the world created by Google and Apple, for better and worse. For better, because the de-centralised operation of the app is a core condition of the operation of the exposure notification - which England learned the hard way.</p><p>\"And for worse because system design from these providers have been found to continue to run geolocation services for those devices running Android 10 or earlier operating systems.</p><p>\"It is Google and Apple's world, Protect Scotland is just operating in it as best as it can.</p><p>\"Because of this it is vitally important that Scotland does what it can to produce clear transparent information to maintain public trust.\"</p><p>The European Data Protection Board, an independent body whose purpose is to ensure consistent application of the General Data Protection Regulation, set recommendations on clarity in the adoption of proximity tracing apps, which Mr Rice said \"the Scottish Government would do well to follow\".</p><p>These include recommendations that States adopting proximity tracing applications should adopt \"meaningful safeguards\" including a reference to the voluntary nature of the application, explicit limitations and on the further use of personal data and \"clear identification\" of the data controller.</p><p>\"Much of that has been done with the privacy notice and will be clearer still with the DPIA (data protection impact assessment) publication.</p><p>\"The app is a voluntary undertaking for the population, as it should be. That means relying on the trust of the Scottish public in the standards and governance of the application. \"Ultimately we need to see that the app is here not as a permanent fixture in our lives, but as a temporary tool in fighting the spread of coronavirus and like the virus something that will eventually, be shut down and rid from our lives.\"</p><p>Irish company NearForm developed the base technology for the Scottish apps, which uses Bluetooth signals to anonymously alert smartphone users if they have been in close contact with someone who has since tested positive for coronavirus.</p><p>A Scottish Government spokesman said: \"The Scottish Government takes the privacy of app users incredibly seriously. That is why a deliberate choice was made that Protect Scotland would use the privacy-first 'decentralised' Google/Apple Exposure Notification System, and why an ethical framework was adopted for the development of Protect Scotland.</p><p>\"A number of privacy groups were engaged throughout the development of Protect Scotland, as were the Information Commissioners Office.\"</p><p>It said a \"full Data Protection Impact Assessment\" has now been published alongside a detailed explanation of how people's data is used.</p><p>It has also made available the source code used to develop the Protect Scotland app.</p><p>\"Whilst Amazon Web Services(AWS) do process some data, as set out in the Privacy Notice and the DPIA, this is done using an existing NHS Education for Scotland (NES) cloud storage account provided by AWS.</p><p>\"Only NES control access to this and the data stored in the app backend is entirely anonymised codes. It complies to all NHS Scotland and GDPR data standards, in the same way that all other data that is handled by NHS Scotland and its contracted providers does. Users' mobile number, test code (and the relevant date) and IP address are not stored by the app and they are not made visible by the app to anyone, including AWS.</p><p>\"In NearForm and AWS, we are using trusted suppliers used by multiple governments, with all of our work complying with GDPR. We have also carried out a detailed security assessment, with advice from the UK National Cyber Security Centre.</p><p>\"In addition, apps running on Android devices which use the Exposure Notifications System (ENS) are not permitted to request permission to use your device's location. Google and Apple have built-in safeguards to ensure that government contact tracing apps built with ENS cannot infer your location.\"</p><p>Protect.scot's 'how the app works' detail</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HRDSCL-18734001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HRDSCL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WC-CC01-F0JC-M1BM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464262</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2003\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 NewsQuest Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Herald Scotland</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"2880\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 20, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This is something. Therefore, we must do it.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So it has proved for successive UK governments when it comes to cracking down on the endless deluge of problematic and illegal online content - from radicalising videos and images of child abuse to \"revenge porn\", images of self-harm and bullying mobs. Except the something has thus far amounted to nothing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big Tech takes the blame for many evils - but in this case it is governments, not Silicon Valley, that deserves our frustration for not taking a step that works: setting laws governing what material can be hosted online.</p><p>For years now, the British and Irish governments have been outsourcing a fundamental duty - deciding the limits of free expression - to unaccountable technology companies overseas.</p><p>In reality, technology companies are good at policing some content. They do not deserve credit or reward for this, because the content they are good at policing is the content they are compelled to remove by law.</p><p>Facebook, Google and the others have made collaborative and rapid efforts to remove the overwhelming majority of child abuse images and videos from their networks, usually before any user has seen them. Similar efforts exist to curt ail radicalisation and murder videos. The tech companies are similarly good at making material that infringes copyright disappear.</p><p>When a government acts to set the limits of legal content, and creates a duty on tech companies to enforce it, they are more than capable of deploying the resources to make that happen.</p><p>When Germany made its laws stricter against material denying the reality of the Holocaust, technology companies opposed it at every turn - and then, once the new laws were passed, they complied. The law reportedly required Facebook and others to hire tens of thousands more human moderators than before, but thanks to their multibillion-dollar profits, they could afford to do so.</p><p>Boris Johnson's UK administration waded into the quagmire last week, launching an ambitious plan to handle \"online harms\" by obliging technology giants to have a \"duty of care\" towards their users, and requiring them as a result to regulate more actively the activities on their platforms.</p><p>Rapidly, however, media outlets and talking heads began criticising the proposals as an attack on free speech, a return of the nanny state, or similar. The plans were shelved, pending a rethink. Which, for now, was a sensible decision.</p><p>The trap the government had fallen into was seeing two separate problems as one. It is clear we have allowed a small handful of US-based companies to have disproportionate power over the new public sphere - and that they are making disproportionate profits as a result. It is also clear that we need to shape the online realm, the new town square, to make sure it fosters healthy, free expression, while restricting malign content. The reason we have struggled to handle either of these issues is that we try to solve both at once.</p><p>Reining in Big Tech covers numerous issues beyond protecting users from malicious content and bullying. It will come to involve stronger privacy rights, and in time will probably require a fundamental rethink about the ownership of our personal data and its commercial exploitation.</p><p>It will require us to think about how we audit the algorithms that increasingly govern our lives. It will require - as even Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged last week - tech giants to pay more tax.</p><p>Yet those conversations are very different from those about governing what we should and should not see on the internet. The latter are really conversations about us, the public, not the technology companies.</p><p>We need to find a way of making tech billionaires accountable, and forcing them to be part of society, rather than online gods hovering above it. But the more urgent need is to protect ourselves from each other - not tech companies - when we're on the internet, whether that involves body image, racist or homophobic abuse, self-harm or myriad other issues.</p><p>If these do not sound like \"internet\" problems, it is because they are not. The internet is, for many if not most of us, where much of life happens now. It is unrealistic and unhealthy to expect American technology companies to be the arbiters of dialogue on any of these issues, let alone all of them.</p><p>For government, the way out of the dilemma is to look at what works: when government sets laws on content, technology companies comply with them, providing the cost of doing so is less than the money that can be made from operating in that country.</p><p>The UK has a population of nearly 70 million and is the world's fifth-largest economy. There's plenty of money to be made here. If it decides what is legal to say online, tech companies will enforce it.</p><p>James Ball is the author of The System: Who Owns the Internet and How It Owns Us, to be published by Bloomsbury on May 14</p><p>Germany has outlawed content that denies the Holocaust</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Mark Zuckerberg concedes Facebook should pay more tax</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-157535367</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y72-R5H1-DYTY-C21P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"842\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 16, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Therefore, we must do it.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So it has proved for successive governments when it comes to cracking down on the endless deluge of problematic and illegal online content - from radicalising videos and images of child abuse to \"revenge porn\", images of self-harm and bullying mobs. Except the something has thus far amounted to nothing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big Tech takes the blame for many evils - but in this case it is the government, not Silicon Valley, that deserves our frustration for not taking a step that works: setting laws governing what material can be hosted online.</p><p>For years now, our government has been outsourcing a fundamental duty - deciding the limits of free expression - to unaccountable technology companies overseas.</p><p>In reality, technology companies are good at policing some content. They do not deserve credit or reward for this, because the content they are good at policing is the content they are compelled to remove by law. Facebook, Google and the others have made collaborative and rapid efforts to remove the overwhelming majority of child abuse images and videos from their networks, usually before any user has seen them. Similar efforts exist to curtail radicalisation and murder videos. The tech companies are similarly good at making material that infringes copyright disappear.</p><p>When a government acts to set the limits of legal content, and creates a duty on tech companies to enforce it, they are more than capable of deploying the resources to make that happen.</p><p>When Germany made its laws stricter against material denying the reality of the Holocaust, technology companies opposed it at every turn - and then, once the new laws were passed, they complied. The law reportedly required Facebook and others to hire tens of thousands more human moderators than before, but thanks to their multibillion-dollar profits, they could afford to do so.</p><p>Boris Johnson's administration waded into the quagmire last week, launching an ambitious plan to handle \"online harms\" by obliging technology giants to have a \"duty of care\" towards their users, and requiring them as a result to regulate more actively the activities on their platforms.</p><p>Rapidly, however, media outlets and talking heads began criticising the proposals as an attack on free speech, a return of the nanny state, or similar. The plans were shelved, pending a rethink. Which, for now, was a sensible decision.</p><p>The trap the government had fallen into was seeing two separate problems as one. It is clear we have allowed a small handful of US-based companies to have disproportionate power over the new public sphere - and that they are making disproportionate profits as a result. It is also clear that we need to shape the online realm, the new town square, to make sure it fosters healthy, free expression, while restricting malign content. The reason we have struggled to handle either of these issues is that we try to solve both at once.</p><p>Reining in Big Tech covers numerous issues beyond protecting users from malicious content and bullying. It will come to involve stronger privacy rights, and in time will probably require a fundamental rethink about the ownership of our personal data and its commercial exploitation.</p><p>It will require us to think about how we audit the algorithms that increasingly govern our lives. It will require - as even Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged last week - tech giants to pay more tax.</p><p>Yet those conversations are very different from those about governing what we should and should not see on the internet. The latter are really conversations about us, the public, not the technology companies.</p><p>We need to find a way of making tech billionaires accountable, and forcing them to be part of society, rather than online gods hovering above it. But the more urgent need is to protect ourselves from each other - not tech companies - when we're on the internet, whether that involves body image, racist or homophobic abuse, self-harm or myriad other issues.</p><p>If these do not sound like \"internet\" problems, it is because they are not. The internet is, for many if not most of us, where much of life happens now. It is unrealistic and unhealthy to expect American technology companies to be the arbiters of dialogue on any of these issues, let alone all of them.</p><p>For government, the way out of the dilemma is to look at what works: when government sets laws on content, technology companies comply with them, providing the cost of doing so is less than the money that can be made from operating in that country.</p><p>The UK has a population of nearly 70 million and is the world's fifth-largest economy. There's plenty of money to be made here. If we decide what is legal to say online, tech companies will enforce it.</p><p>                   James Ball is the author of The System: Who Owns the Internet and How It Owns Us, to be published by Bloomsbury in May                 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-60397499</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7R-3WM1-F021-64R5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"841\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 16, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It is clear we have allowed a small handful of US-based companies to have disproportionate power over the new public sphere - and that they are making disproportionate profits as a result. It is also clear that we need to shape the online realm, the new town square, to make sure it fosters healthy, free expression, while restricting malign content. The reason we have struggled to handle either of these issues is that we try to solve both at once.</p><p>Reining in Big Tech covers numerous issues beyond protecting users from malicious content and bullying. It will come to involve stronger privacy rights, and in time will probably require a fundamental rethink about the ownership of our personal data and its commercial exploitation.</p><p>It will require us to think about how we audit the algorithms that increasingly govern our lives. It will require - as even Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged last week - tech giants to pay more tax.</p><p>Yet those conversations are very different from those about governing what we should and should not see on the internet. The latter are really conversations about us, the public, not the technology companies.</p><p>We need to find a way of making tech billionaires accountable, and forcing them to be part of society, rather than online gods hovering above it. But the more urgent need is to protect ourselves from each other - not tech companies - when we're on the internet, whether that involves body image, racist or homophobic abuse, self-harm or myriad other issues.</p><p>If these do not sound like \"internet\" problems, it is because they are not. The internet is, for many if not most of us, where much of life happens now. It is unrealistic and unhealthy to expect American technology companies to be the arbiters of dialogue on any of these issues, let alone all of them.</p><p>For government, the way out of the dilemma is to look at what works: when government sets laws on content, technology companies comply with them, providing the cost of doing so is less than the money that can be made from operating in that country.</p><p>The UK has a population of nearly 70 million and is the world's fifth-largest economy. There's plenty of money to be made here. If we decide what is legal to say online, tech companies will enforce it.</p><p>James Ball is the author of The System: Who Owns the Internet and How It Owns Us, to be published by Bloomsbury on May 14</p><p>Germany has outlawed content that denies the Holocaust</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Mark Zuckerberg concedes Facebook should pay more tax</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-157537763</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y72-R5H1-DYTY-C39V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"838\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 16, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This is something. Therefore, we must do it.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So it has proved for successive governments when it comes to cracking down on the endless deluge of problematic and illegal online content - from radicalising videos and images of child abuse to \"revenge porn\", images of self-harm and bullying mobs. Except the something has thus far amounted to nothing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big Tech takes the blame for many evils - but in this case it is the government, not Silicon Valley, that deserves our frustration for not taking a step that works: setting laws governing what material can be hosted online.</p><p>For years now, our government has been outsourcing a fundamental duty - deciding the limits of free expression - to unaccountable technology companies overseas.</p><p>In reality, technology companies are good at policing some content. They do not deserve credit or reward for this, because the content they are good at policing is the content they are compelled to remove by law. Facebook, Google and the others have made collaborative and rapid efforts to remove the overwhelming majority of child abuse images and videos from their networks, usually before any user has seen them. Similar efforts exist to curtail radicalisation and murder videos. The tech companies are similarly good at making material that infringes copyright disappear.</p><p>When a government acts to set the limits of legal content, and creates a duty on tech companies to enforce it, they are more than capable of deploying the resources to make that happen.</p><p>When Germany made its laws stricter against material denying the reality of the Holocaust, technology companies opposed it at every turn - and then, once the new laws were passed, they complied. The law reportedly required Facebook and others to hire tens of thousands more human moderators than before, but thanks to their multibillion-dollar profits, they could afford to do so.</p><p>Boris Johnson's administration waded into the quagmire last week, launching an ambitious plan to handle \"online harms\" by obliging technology giants to have a \"duty of care\" towards their users, and requiring them as a result to regulate more actively the activities on their platforms.</p><p>Rapidly, however, media outlets and talking heads began criticising the proposals as an attack on free speech, a return of the nanny state, or similar.

The Internet is our new public square. In the public square of old, journalists and editors served as gatekeepers and acted as referees. </p><p>Human news aggregators set the agenda and provided audiences with credible information and a diversity of views. We trusted them because of the professionalism and integrity of their editorial processes. In the new public sphere, this model of journalism - and of journalism's role in sustaining democracy - has become obsolete. Traditional media no longer play a dominant gatekeeping and agenda-setting role. Fake news can reach multiple jurisdictions at once. But so can public and private measures that censor speech. The challenge is to redefine the parameters of civil discourse in the new public sphere without restricting pluralism. Recent examples highlight the risk of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Despite the ominous headlines, the influence of fake news on political decision-making appears to be limited. According to the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford, the reach of such content is largely restricted to groups of believers seeking to reinforce their own views and prejudices. But that does not make digital deception any less dangerous. Fake news feeds - and is fed by - polarization, and, paradoxically, the more it is discussed, the more disruptive it becomes. That is because fake news undermines trust in all forms of media and reinforces the view that it is impossible to discern fact from fiction. When people do not know what they can believe, journalists' ability to police the powerful is weakened. This trend will only worsen as \"deep-fake news\" - bogus images and videos that appear real - becomes more ubiquitous. Clearly, the vulnerabilities of the digital public sphere must be addressed. Some argue that the solution is to block questionable websites or demote search results. Facebook, for example, censors duplicitous posts and has created an election \"war room\" to fight disinformation. Other global platforms, like Google and Twitter, have considered similar steps, and all three are being pressured to give authorities access to the private data of users who publish fake news or make defamatory statements. But we believe that these steps, while seemingly prudent, are deeply misguided. At the heart of any strong democracy is a political consensus and arbitration that depends on the public's ability to debate and disagree. It is not up to private entities - or public institutions, for that matter - to censor this process. Rather, we should be working to ensure that citizens have access to a broad array of opinions and ideas and understand what they are reading, viewing, or hearing. Freedom of expression includes the right to receive and impart information without interference, which implies the corollary values of media freedom and media pluralism as enshrined in the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights. A March 2018 report to the European Commission by the High-Level Group on Fake News and Online Disinformation, offered a roadmap, and the recent European Commission Action Plan provides a good starting point. But more needs to be done. For example, professional media must do more to guarantee the veracity of their coverage. Fact-checking technology can help, as long as it is kept free of political and economic influence. Google, Facebook, and Twitter should stay out of the fact-checking business. Big Tech is starting to take responsibility by committing to a Code of Practice based on the ten key principles from the High-Level Report. But \"Big Tech\" can contribute in other ways, such as by providing client-based interfaces for curating legitimate news, ensuring diversity in social-media timelines, and making a high priority of reposting fact-checked information. Platforms can also improve transparency in how they use data and code algorithms. Platforms must also clearly identify news sources, especially paid political or commercial content. We also need new international collaboration and better jurisdictional rules to ensure that laws and regulations protect victims of fake and offensive news without restricting free speech or undermining the rights of whistleblowers. Finally, platform companies should cooperate with schools, civil-society groups, and news organizations to strengthen the public's media literacy. Well-intentioned efforts to scrub the new public square of disinformation will certainly backfire; only consumers can marginalize fake news. We cannot allow private companies or governments to decide what people should know. The history of democracy is clear on this point: pluralism, not private or public censorship, is the best guarantor of truth.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Statesman.

Successive governments have failed to secure effective protection for children from what he describes as \"invisible predators\" online.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Speaking at the NSPCC last week, Mr Javid set out five challenges to social networks in tackling child sexual exploitation online. He demands that companies block child abuse material as soon as it's uploaded; stop online grooming; shut down live-streaming of abuse; better cooperate with law enforcement; and increase transparency and share best practice within industry. Sounds good.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These demands indicate that Government is moving in the right direction. It is vital that it does not falter. A forthcoming White Paper is to set out laws to regulate social networks.</p><p>But the Home Secretary said in his speech last Monday: \"How far we legislate will be informed by the action and attitude that industry takes.\" That is disappointing. In other sectors where users are put at risk, whether by payday lenders or energy drinks, action is taken.</p><p>We have seen 13 different self-regulatory initiatives introduced since 2005. Our experience tells us the tech companies will not take action until and unless they are forced to do so.</p><p>I urge the Government to hold its nerve and deliver tough legislation regardless of any warm words from tech giants. Much focus has been on taking down images or videos of abuse, which is a vital part of tackling online child sexual abuse. But this is not enough. Once abuse has been documented on camera, harm has already been done. Lives have been ruined. Preventing abuse from happening in the first place is what urgently needs to happen.</p><p>NSPCC research shows that every day there are an average of nine offences of Sexual Communication with a Child in England and Wales alone. That means there could be more than 1,000 more offences recorded by Christmas. Legislation must force social networks to apply technology to detect grooming to stop abuse before it escalates.</p><p>Even if huge corporations take action to stop abuse from happening, children must be protected wherever they are online. In the past year, a total of 80 different platforms were recorded by police in England and Wales as being used to send sexual messages to children. That is why we need a regulator that can hold all social networks, big and small, to a minimum set of safety standards and to uphold a duty of care to their young users. And that regulator must have teeth.</p><p>To properly tackle abuse, social networks must be forced to tell us the scale of abuse on their sites. Via annual transparency reports, we need to know how many child users they have, how many child endangerment reports they receive, how those reports are dealt with and how swiftly they are dealt with.

But there's a catch: If Parler gets sued over something you post online, the company could make you pay its legal fees.In recent days, several prominent conservatives have proclaimed that they will join Parler, which has been actively recruiting right-wingers who are disgruntled with the supposed anti-conservative bias on Twitter \u2014 a baseless right-wing grievance[2] that has been accelerated by Twitter's new, albeit occasional, practice of noting that some of President Donald Trump's tweets are 'misleading[3]' orthreaten[4] or glorify violence[5].The Trump campaign is reportedly[6] considering building up a presence on Parler's platform, and Trump's 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale,already has an account[7]. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany announced[8] on Thursday that she had created a Parler account, joining such Republican politicians and Trump allies as Reps. Devin Nunes, Thomas Massie, Jim Jordan, Elise Stefanik and Matt Gaetz, Sen. Ted Cruz, and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley.According to Parler[9], Twitter has become 'a Tech Tyrant, stepping on our Freedoms to push their agenda driven narrative.' </p><p>Parlerclaims[10]that, by contrast, its platform offers 'free speech social media focused on protecting user's rights.'In fact, Parler'suser agreement[11] and community guidelines[12] ban several forms of speech protected under the First Amendment. And it reserves the right to 'remove any content and terminate your access' to the platform 'at any time and for any reason or no reason.'Unlike Twitter or Facebook, Parler requires users to 'agree to defend and indemnify Parler, as well as any of its officers, directors, employees, and agents, from and against any and all claims, actions, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to all attorneys fees) arising from or relating to your access to and use of the Services.'In order to use Parler, individuals must also forfeit their right to sue Parler in court or join a class-action claim and instead must settle disputes in arbitration, a secretive process[13] that typically favors businesses over individuals bringing complaints. (Neither Twitter nor Facebook requires arbitration in their terms of service.)Parler was founded in 2018 in Henderson, Nevada, by software engineers John Matze and Jared Thomson. The company's website says they were 'exhausted with a lack of transparency in big tech, ideological suppresssion [sic] and privacy abuse[14]' so they created their own alternative.But as Matze and Thomson apparently realized, running a minimally regulated social media platform that allows users to spread disinformation and violent threats is a risky endeavor.'Every time anyone tries to say, 'This is the platform that really protects free speech,' they're lying. I mean, they have the same rules and regulations as most other companies with a few more thrown in \u2014 and the indemnification clause on top of that,' Mary Anne Franks, a professor at the University of Miami School of Law, said in an interview. 'It's a false statement to begin with to say that there's anything meaningfully different about this space.'Parler did not respond to a list of questions about its user agreement.If enforced as written, the platform's indemnity clause could be financially devastating for the average American. Although Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act[15] largely protects social media companies from legal responsibility for what people say and do on their platform, the companies can still be sued and it costs money to successfully fight cases in court.Twitter, for example, spent more than a year[16]defending itself in a lawsuit brought by Rep. Nunes over parody Twitter accounts that made fun of him before a judge ruled that the company was protected by Section 230. (The California lawmaker has urged his followers[17] on Twitter to 'SAY NO TO SOCIALISM[18]' and join him on Parler.)If Nunes decided to sue Parler for letting people make fun of him on its platform, Parler would probably win in court, just like Twitter did. But under its user agreement, the company could try to force the user who mocked the congressman to pay its legal fees.'Parler gives users a false sense of safety that they can be controversial and less unmoderated than other platforms, but Parler in reality passes all costs of this unfettered speech onto the speakers,' Carrie Goldberg, a New York-based lawyer with expertise in online harassment, told HuffPost.If Parler gets sued by someone outside the U.S., in a country without a law similar to Section 230, there's a higher risk the company would lose the case and face a costly judgment \u2014 which it could try to pass on to the user whose post prompted litigation.'Absolute free speech on a commercial platform is demonstrably harder than people think. Parler shows one way to plug the leak is with your users' money,' wrote Twitter user Wolf Lawyer[19], who firstflagged Parler's indemnity clause[20].Some free-speech warriors may be willing to risk going bankrupt paying for Parler's lawyers in exchange for access to a social media platform that allows them to post whatever they want. But Parler doesn't even offer that. Its community guidelines[21] warn users to avoid spam, blackmail, bribery, plagiarism, support for terrorist organizations, spreading false rumors, suggesting people should die, describing 'sexual organs or activity,' showing 'female nipples,' and using language or visuals 'that are offensive and offer no literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.' Parler also advises users against 'any other speech federally illegal in USA,' which the platform incorrectly claims includes doxing and 'content glorifying violence against animals.'Parler's guidelines 'appear to be written to make it misleadingly look like wholly discretionary aspects of their moderation policy are legally required,' Julian Sanchez, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, wrote on Twitter[22].If it wanted, Parler could legally allow much of the content it restricts in its community guidelines. But like other private companies, it has made a business decision against providing a completely unregulated, unmoderated platform.Perhaps the greatest irony of Parler positioning itself as a free-speech haven for people who are outraged by Twitter attaching a warning to a few of the president's most unhinged tweets is the fact that Parler grants itself the right[23] to remove any post or ban any user from its platform for literally 'no reason.'With terms of service at least as restrictive as mainstream tech platforms, the real allure of Parler appears to be the hope that in actively recruiting far-right individuals \u2014 including some who have been kicked off Twitter for being too racist[24] \u2014 Parler is suggesting it won't enforce certain parts of its community guidelines. And so far, it hasn't[25].A quick search shows that Parler has become another space for white supremacist propaganda and conspiracy theories \u2014 including calls to 'gas the kikes,' start a 'race war' and 'red pill boomers on Jews and the anti-white agenda,' as well as claims that the police killing of George Floyd was a 'hoax.'But at least the president might finally find a safe space to post about deploying the military to shoot American citizens[26]who are exercising their First Amendment right to protest.

They push extremist content, they are complicit in human rights abuses, they spread spurious information, they undermine democracy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Angus has also seen social media transform his enormous northern Ontario riding, often for the better. He is an avid user of Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, chatting and advertising to connect with his constituents in remote First Nations communities. And he has been amazed as the constituents - especially Indigenous youth - use the platforms to talk to each other, gaining confidence and knowledge.</p><p>He is hooked by social media's potential to link disparate peoples together, to generate ideas, to collaborate, to start businesses with global reach. But not so hooked, he says, that he is going to sit on the sidelines and take potshots while the technology behemoths steamroll over small business, privacy rights and the roots of democracy.</p><p>\"The days when they can ignore corporate, legal and moral obligations are over. Democratic governments are showing a willingness to take them on with legislation and to break up the monopoly if necessary,\" Angus warns in a press release in which MPs from all parties summon the corporations and experts for an \"international grand committee\" in Ottawa at the end of the month.</p><p>Canadian legislators are looking for a better way, and they are poised to move from the theoretical to the practical. But they are torn between a strong-arm European approach to cracking down on the corporations and how they operate, and a \"wild west\" American approach that relies on voluntary good behaviour.</p><p>Rather than pick a lane, Canada will try to ride the median.</p><p>While there is popular appeal in standing up strong in favour of privacy protections and against the might of powerful corporations (see Europe), there is also a need to be flexible in the face of rapidly changing technology so that businesses can take full advantage of the benefits of technology (see the U.S.).</p><p>And given that the United States is so integrated into the everyday lives and business of Canadians, compatibility is also a top priority.</p><p>Last Thursday in Paris, a day after signing on to the \"Christchurch call for action\" against online hate speech and extremism, the prime minister vaguely announced his government's intention to set up a \"digital charter\" that would set out some principles for big tech to adhere to.</p><p>It was a clear indication of taking a middle way and the start of a process that will pick up momentum in the next few weeks.</p><p>\"By allaying people's fears and anxieties, and by restoring trust in the digital world, we can focus on the incredible benefits of technology,\" Justin Trudeau said. \"We can have better banking, more streamlined search, innovative medicine and barrier-free business.\"</p><p>Details of the charter will come from Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains on Tuesday, but the government has already indicated it will set out principles such as accessibility, privacy protection, transparency and control over personal information. It will be mainly aspirational rather than prescriptive, but that part will come, too.</p><p>At the end of May, in the context of the international grand committee and global meetings on the responsibilities of digital platforms, Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould will roll out more details about legislative steps that could be taken to give the government more clout.</p><p>Trudeau has also indicated that government should be able to impose meaningful financial penalties on big digital companies that don't respect the rules.</p><p>The package of proposals will be deeply inspired by the new U.K. model centred on \"duty of care,\" which makes companies responsible for keeping users of their services safe. A regulator sets safety standards.

Highlights from this week's activities include:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Women's and gay-rights are represented as a new generation of Lebanese vote for the first timeDecriminalising homosexuality, abolishing child marriage and introducing secular laws were among the issues backed by independent candidates in legislative elections in Lebanon on May 6th. The independent candidates ran against the established political parties that have presided over the country for decades. The prior election was in 2009--when the iPhone was two years old and Barack Obama was just six months into office. A total of 595 candidates competed for 128 seats; some 66 candidates classed themselves as independent. Read our story here. </p><p>  A posting on why comically skewering Donald Trump is proper free speech\"Calls for press-corps civility are in fact calls for servility, and should be received with contempt,\" argued one of our Washington, DC correspondents, about criticism over the comedian Michelle Wolf's scathing remarks at the annual White House Correspondents' Dinner. \"In open societies, self-censorship--in the name of civility, careerism or access preservation--is a much greater threat to the media than outright repression,\" he wrote here. </p><p>  An online debate on whether the big tech firms should be heavily regulatedThe debate ended with 76% believing that the tech giants like Facebook, Google, Amazon and others should come under heavier regulation. \"These private companies are acquiring superpower status,\" argued Andrew Keen, a critic of the companies. But commenters were persuaded by Roslyn Layton of Strand Consulting's view that \"innovation and competition topples monopolies faster than anything else.\" Read the closing arguments here.</p><p>  A podcast on how big data and AI erodes privacy even as it tackles humanity's grand challenges There is a province in China where the security-camera footage and artificial intelligence enable the authorities to monitor people's movements at unprecedented scale. In the West, Facebook, Google and other big web companies track users to serve them relevant advertisements, a sort of \"surveillance capitalism.\" Finding ways to prevent the misuse of data is critical, since the benefits of using machine learning and AI to improve healthcare, alleviate climate change and improve society are so great. Listen to the programme here. </p><p>  The press is being killed around the world but the victims are the public and free speech itselfAfter a bomb explodes in Afghanistan, the media descends. But recently a second explosion took place 40 minutes later in Kabul, by a suicide bomber disguised as a television cameraman. Ten reporters were among the 31 people killed. The attacks bring to 26 the number of journalists killed worldwide so far in 2018. The rate has generally been declining since a peak in 2009. See our data visualisation here. </p><p>  Making a case for free trade by helping its losers \"Free trade increases the size of the pie. The overall amount of material wellbeing expands. But just because the size of the pie expands, it doesn't mean that everyone is better off,\" explained John Van Reenen of MIT, in an interview. \"There are going to be some losers whose slice of the pie is so much smaller that they would have been better off with less trade. However, because the overall size of the pie has got bigger, the government can compensate the losers which can still make everyone better off.\" Read the interview here. </p><p>  Other news: French handshakes and \"Enochonomics\" What the French decision to deny citizenship to an Algerian woman because she refused to shake the hand of the presiding official says about liberal values. Also, the British politician Enoch Powell is reviled as a racist, but his economic thinking (call it \"Enochonomics\") is more complex--with lessons for liberals.   </p><p>  Up next on Open Future: an online debate on the global trading systemOur week-long online debate starting on May 7th examines whether the global trading system is broken. Arguing that it is indeed broken is Greg Autry of the University of Southern California and a member of President Donald Trump's transition team. Against the motion is Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Be sure to comment, vote and join the conversation.

You got it: The three big tech names report earnings after today's close.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Back on Sept. 28, Apple warned investors that fourth-quarter earnings would fall \"substantially\" short of expectations. Yesterday, ahead of its actual earnings announcement, Apple closed down $1.38, or 6.4%, at $20.13.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Shares of America Online touched a 52-week low yesterday, amid concerns about the slowdown in dot-com advertising spending. AOL and Time Warner (TWX:NYSE) still await U.S. regulatory approval for their merger, which is expected to close this fall. America Online plunged $9.01, or 17.1%, to $43.60, in advance of its earnings report. Time Warner, which also reports today, also plunged, dropping $12.24, or 15.7%, to $65.56.\u00a0</p><p>Microsoft got a small boost yesterday from Goldman Sachs analyst Rick Sherlund, who said the software giant might be due for a \"relief rally.\" Sherlund predicted that Microsoft might rebound from the 52-week low of $49.56 it hit Monday, if there is no bad news in its earnings report today. Mister Softee finished up 6 cents to $50.44 yesterday.\u00a0</p><p>In the economic arena, the September Consumer Price Index -- a key inflationary measure -- headlines today's events.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Expected Earnings Reports This table includes S&amp;P 500 companies only.

Tim Ryan of Ohio is dropping out of the presidential race.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Ryan, who failed to gain traction and qualify for recent Democratic debates, announced his withdrawal on Twitter Thursday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> He said he will instead seek reelection next year to his U.S. House seat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Ryan says he ran to give voice to the forgotten people and businesses in the country that have been left behind and he wants to continue that in his congressional race.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The congressman's most recent fundraising report showed he had only $158,000 on hand.</p><p> Mayor Kenney endorses Elizabeth Warren for 2020</p><p> Mayor Jim Kenney this week announced that he is endorsing Elizabeth Warren for the presidency in 2020.</p><p> \"Our nation is in crisis,\" he said in a video posted on his personal Twitter account. \"We need strong and steady leadership in the White House We need a new president with big vision and bold ideas who will put power in the hands of working Americans \u2014 not the 1% at the top. We need a new president who will bring us together and build an America that works for everyone.\"</p><p> Kenney said he believes Warren fits the bill.</p><p> \"She will bring us together and put power in the hands of working families,\" he said.</p><p> Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, is currently among the front-runners in the Democratic race for the White House.</p><p> Bernie Sanders plans to release health records</p><p> DES MOINES, Iowa \u2014 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is planning to release his health records by the end of the year.</p><p> The White House hopeful addressed his health Thursday in Iowa ahead of his first appearance in an early voting state since suffering a heart attack earlier in the month. The 78-year-old Vermont senator has repeatedly promised to release his health records at some point, but he outlined a likely timeline in an interview with The Associated Press.</p><p> \"I want to make it comprehensive,\" Sanders said in explaining the delay. \"The answer is I will, probably by the end of the year.\"</p><p> Campaign manager Faiz Shakir later said more definitively that Sanders does plan to release the records by the end of December. He expects the statement from Sanders' physician to show Sanders has made a \"full recovery\" from the heart attack.</p><p> Sanders' health condition adds another layer of complexity to the Democratic Party's crowded 2020 presidential primary election.</p><p> Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, has maintained a place near the top of the field for much of the year, although most polls suggest he's currently trailing establishment favorite Joe Biden and progressive rival Elizabeth Warren.</p><p> In reversal, Biden campaign opens door to super PAC support</p><p> Joe Biden's campaign is rolling back his opposition to an independent political action committee that would allow wealthy individuals and corporations to boost his 2020 Democratic presidential bid.</p><p> A top Biden aide says in a lengthy statement Thursday that it's \"not surprising\" some Biden supporters are considering financing a super PAC on his behalf.</p><p> Biden has previously opposed such a move.</p><p> Kate Bedingfield's statement doesn't explicitly endorse a super political action committee but notes President Donald Trump and Republicans already are spending considerable sums \"to intervene directly in Democratic primaries\" against Biden.</p><p> The former vice president trails his top primary rivals Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in total fundraising and cash-on-hand.</p><p> Sanders and a top progressive group that supports Warren each blasted the notion of a Biden super PAC.</p><p> Pete Buttigieg calls Facebook's political ad policy 'mistake'</p><p>NASHUA, New Hampshire \u2014 Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg said Thursday that he believes Facebook's policy to not filter out phony political ads is \"a mistake\" and that breaking up big tech companies should be \"on the table.\"</p><p> The social media giant has \"a responsibility to pull false advertising and ... to intervene when there is advertising that would contribute to voter suppression,\" Butttigieg told reporters after hosting an economic policy event in New Hampshire.</p><p> The mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has come under criticism from 2020 rival Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who charges that Buttigieg is too cozy with Facebook. Buttigieg's aides confirmed this week that his campaign hired two digital analytics staff recommended by Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan.</p><p> Zuckerberg has defended Facebook's refusal to take down content it considers newsworthy \"even if it goes against our standards,\" in an effort to steer clear of criticism that Facebook was infringing on First Amendment rights to free speech. In response to a question last week on fact-checking during his appearance at Georgetown University, Zuckerberg said, \"We think people should be able to see for themselves.\"</p><p> Warren also has called for breaking up Zuckerberg's conglomerate, which includes Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p> Buttigieg, at 37, is the first candidate of the Facebook generation, and was an early adopter of the social media platform. But he said Thursday that federal regulators, with the power to protect consumers and address \"anti-competitive practices,\" should consider remedies that include a breakup.</p><p> Bill Weld: I'd vote for Biden 'in a heartbeat' against Trump</p><p>HANOVER, N.H. \u2014 One of President Donald Trump's Republican challengers says he'd vote for Joe Biden \"in a heartbeat\" against Trump in the 2020 general election.</p><p> Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld says, \"Could I vote for a Democrat? Hell yes. If it's Trump against Joe Biden, I'm with Biden in a heartbeat.\"</p><p> Weld's comments came during an appearance at the CITIZEN by CNN conference. He was joined onstage by former South Carolina governor and congressman Mark Sanford and former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh. They are also seeking the Republican presidential nomination against Trump.</p><p> Weld says he'd never support Trump \"for any office under any circumstances\" but could \"very well\" support a third-party candidate.</p><p> If the matchup were Trump against Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Weld says, \"I suppose I'd rather have her, with a couple of modifications in her platform.\"</p><p> Sanford and Walsh both said Warren is the toughest Democratic opponent for Trump at the moment.</p><p> \"I think she's articulate and bright and quick,\" Sanford said.</p><p> \"She's got the energy and the fire,\" Walsh said.</p><p> Weld said Trump's strongest opponent is Biden because \"he's a lunch-pail Democrat. He's a good guy. He's a centrist, and Trump is not going to be able to play the socialism card against him.\"</p><p> Candidate's campaign office in New Hampshire broken into</p><p>MANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign says its headquarters in Manchester, New Hampshire, was broken into, along with other offices in the same building.</p><p> Andrew Taverrite, Warren's New Hampshire communications director, says in a statement that the break-in occurred Wednesday night and \"we have no reason to believe this was targeted to the campaign or is anything further than a regular break-in.\"</p><p> A Manchester Police Department electronic log shows a burglary reported shortly after 9 a.m. Thursday. The campaign says it is \"working with authorities.\"</p><p> Warren is campaigning in New Hampshire and has an afternoon town hall scheduled at Dartmouth in Hanover, about 75 miles northwest of Manchester.</p><p> The state hosts the nation's first presidential primary on Feb. 11.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKPA-fe2798beb0f2a6e7423c9151e3a16bd32df0eb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2899D9772552F0 NWBKPA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XC0-PW21-DXVP-V38N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1250\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Philadelphia Tribune<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

We need a new president who will bring us together and build an America that works for everyone.\"</p><p>Kenney said he believes Warren fits the bill.</p><p>\"She will bring us together and put power in the hands of working families,\" he said.</p><p>Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, is currently among the front-runners in the Democratic race for the White House.</p><p>Bernie Sanders plans to release health records</p><p>DES MOINES, Iowa - Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is planning to release his health records by the end of the year.</p><p>The White House hopeful addressed his health Thursday in Iowa ahead of his first appearance in an early voting state since suffering a heart attack earlier in the month. The 78-year-old Vermont senator has repeatedly promised to release his health records at some point, but he outlined a likely timeline in an interview with The Associated Press.</p><p>\"I want to make it comprehensive,\" Sanders said in explaining the delay. \"The answer is I will, probably by the end of the year.\"</p><p>Campaign manager Faiz Shakir later said more definitively that Sanders does plan to release the records by the end of December.

Elizabeth Warren, who charges that Buttigieg is too cozy with Facebook. Buttigieg's aides confirmed this week that his campaign hired two digital analytics staff recommended by Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan.</p><p>Zuckerberg has defended Facebook's refusal to take down content it considers newsworthy \"even if it goes against our standards,\" in an effort to steer clear of criticism that Facebook was infringing on First Amendment rights to free speech. In response to a question last week on fact-checking during his appearance at Georgetown University, Zuckerberg said, \"We think people should be able to see for themselves.\"</p><p>Warren also has called for breaking up Zuckerberg's conglomerate, which includes Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>Buttigieg, at 37, is the first candidate of the Facebook generation, and was an early adopter of the social media platform.

Bill Weld says, \"Could I vote for a Democrat? Hell yes. If it's Trump against Joe Biden, I'm with Biden in a heartbeat.\"</p><p>Weld's comments came during an appearance at the CITIZEN by CNN conference. He was joined onstage by former South Carolina governor and congressman Mark Sanford and former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh. They are also seeking the Republican presidential nomination against Trump.</p><p>Weld says he'd never support Trump \"for any office under any circumstances\" but could \"very well\" support a third-party candidate.</p><p>If the matchup were Trump against Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Weld says, \"I suppose I'd rather have her, with a couple of modifications in her platform.\"</p><p>Sanford and Walsh both said Warren is the toughest Democratic opponent for Trump at the moment.</p><p>\"I think she's articulate and bright and quick,\" Sanford said.</p><p>\"She's got the energy and the fire,\" Walsh said.</p><p>Weld said Trump's strongest opponent is Biden because \"he's a lunch-pail Democrat. He's a good guy. He's a centrist, and Trump is not going to be able to play the socialism card against him.\"</p><p>Candidate's campaign office in New Hampshire broken into</p><p>MANCHESTER, N.H. - Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign says its headquarters in Manchester, New Hampshire, was broken into, along with other offices in the same building.</p><p>Andrew Taverrite, Warren's New Hampshire communications director, says in a statement that the break-in occurred Wednesday night and \"we have no reason to believe this was targeted to the campaign or is anything further than a regular break-in.\"</p><p>A Manchester Police Department electronic log shows a burglary reported shortly after 9 a.m. Thursday. The campaign says it is \"working with authorities.\"</p><p>Warren is campaigning in New Hampshire and has an afternoon town hall scheduled at Dartmouth in Hanover, about 75 miles northwest of Manchester.</p><p>The state hosts the nation's first presidential primary on Feb. 11.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2325238846</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">46477ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XRX-9RW1-DYR7-81DY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1242\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Philadelphia Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Philadelphia Tribune (Pennsylvania)</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0746956X</issn><aggregationName>Ethnic NewsWatch</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 25, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Others</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General Information</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC000262S</classCode><className>ASSOCIATED PRESS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC7383 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>CNN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Georgetown University</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democratic Party</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>South Carolina</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trump, Donald J</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Indiana</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sanders, Bernard</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Kenney, Jim</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Chan, Priscilla</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Vermont</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New Hampshire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Buttigieg, Pete</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States--US</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Massachusetts</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Ohio</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Illinois</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sanford, Mark</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Zuckerberg, Mark</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Warren, Elizabeth</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Walsh, Joe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Biden, Joseph R Jr</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Iowa</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Candidates</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congressional elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Primaries &amp;

She plans to enact the \"College for All Act\" if elected, allowing free tuition for most Americans at a four-year public college. Harris also hopes to lift the Middle Class Act, which would create a direct tax break for the middle and lower class. She is also advocating for universal pre-K and immigration reform.</p><p>Bernie Sanders, current Senator from Vermont and former congressman is no stranger to his presidential campaign efforts. As the runner-up in the 2016 Democratic Primary, Sanders is doing well in recent polls, just barely trailing behind former Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce his candidacy. Sanders, the Democratic Socialist, will be focusing his efforts on Medicare-for-All, free college tuition, the Green New Deal, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and raising taxes on the wealthy.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, current Senator from Massachusetts and identified capitalist, has also announced her candidacy. Warren's focus if elected will be to uphold the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act, by banning Congress and White House staff from owning individual stocks while in office. This Act would also require presidential candidates to release eight years of their tax returns to the public, as reported by Christina Wilkie for CNBC.</p><p>Warren is a strong supporter of the rights of workers, and introduced the Accountable Capitalism Act in 2018. This Act would require \"that employees be given seats at the board of directors of some of the nation's biggest companies\" According to CNBC. She has also endorsed Medicare-for-All, the Green New Deal, a $15 minimum wage, and higher taxes on the wealthy.</p><p>Beto O'Rourke, the moderate former congressman from Texas, has made a name for himself when he came within a three point margin of defeating Ted Cruz in the Texas Senate election. O'Rourke has made it a point to speak out against the wall and if elected will focus his presidency on immigration reform by supporting the Dream Act. He is endorsing stricter gun control laws, marijuana legalization, raising the minimum wage to $15, and criminal justice.</p><p>Due to his own misfortunes in his 20s, O'Rourke believes in second chances and advocates for rehabilitation for offenders recently released from prison, including restoring their right to vote, as Maggie Astor states in The New York Times. He also hopes to eliminate bail and opposes the death penalty.</p><p>Other Democratic candidates to be reckoned with include former mayor of Newark, and current moderate New Jersey Senator Cory Booker. He has his visions set on tackling criminal justice reform, by introducing the Reverse Mass Incarceration Act in 2017.</p><p>This bill would offer $20 billion in federal grant money to essentially cut prison populations and encourage low crime rates. He is also a strong advocate for a nationwide legalization of marijuana, Medicare-for-All, the Green New Deal, and a job guarantee bill.</p><p>Current Mayor of South Bend, Indiana Pete Buttigieg is testing the waters and if elected, will become the youngest openly gay president ever at 37-years-old. He wants to be a fresh voice for the Millennial generation.</p><p>Former housing secretary and Mayor of San Antonio, Juli\u00e1n Castro, plans on focusing his efforts on universal health care, pre-kindergarten for all, and criminal justice and immigration reform.</p><p>John Delaney, a former congressman from Maryland, is continuing his efforts in running for president as the first politician to announce his candidacy back in 2017. As a businessman himself, he plans on restoring the gap dividing the two parties and ensuring that everyone has an equally fair chance in the competitive job market.</p><p>Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard from Hawaii, is centering her campaign around foreign policy. As an Iraq War veteran with much experience in foreign affairs, she hopes to reduce the American military's interference overseas, mainly in Afghanistan and Syria.</p><p>Former congresswoman and current moderate Senator of New York, Kirsten Gillibrand is running in 2020. Gillibrand's motto, as she puts it, \"I'm going to fight for other people's kids as hard as I would fight for my own.\" She is known as the #MeToo Senator for her focus on advancing women in the workplace and tackling sexual assault within the military, college campuses, and Congress.</p><p>Gillibrand also supports eliminating corruption within the government. She wrote and Passed the Stock Act back in 2012, which makes it illegal for members of congress to profit from insider trading.</p><p>Amy Klobuchar is the current moderate Senator from Minnesota and former Hennepin County, Minn., attorney. Klobuchar is setting herself apart from her opponents by centralizing her efforts on taking on big tech, and guaranteeing consumer protection. She wants companies like Facebook and Twitter to have to answer to identities being stolen and individual's data being mined.</p><p>On a county level Klobuchar hopes to make drunk driving a felony in Hennepin. As for the Senate, she is advocating for abortion rights, sweeping legislation in green jobs in infrastructure, and called for the president to rejoin the Paris Agreement.</p><p>Other opposing democratic candidates include: Self-help author, Maggie Astor; Former tech executive, Andrew Yang; Former governor of Colorado and former mayor of Denver, John Hickenlooper; and current Governor of Washington State and former congressman, Jay Inslee.</p><p>As for the Republicans, the two leading frontrunners include current President Donald J. Trump, and former governor of Massachusetts and federal prosecutor, William F. Weld.</p><p>Weld has been highly critical of Trump's deportation policies and is in support of the federal government issuing more H1B visas. Weld might just have what it takes to appeal to moderate Republicans who feel alienated from their party, according to Alexander Burns in The New York Times.</p><p>As candidates start competing for the public's approval, campaigning fearlessly to replace Trump as the next presidential leader, it is important to keep in mind key factors such as: party platforms, conservative priorities, and voter turnouts.</p><p>Associate Professor of Government and Political Affairs at Millersville, Adam Lawrence was able to provide some insight into these main topics brought up at the kickoff of the 2020 campaign trail.</p><p>As the main Republican candidate frontrunner, Lawrence believes President Donald Trump will focus his campaign on the same policies he supported back in 2016, including: cracking down on immigration policies and deporting undocumented immigrants, building a wall along the southern border of U.S. and Mexico, lowering taxes for the middle class, reducing federal regulations, imposing tariffs on imports, and repealing or possibly replacing the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>As for where conservatives stand, Lawrence thinks as of today, there is a good reason to believe Independents will be more influenced to cast their vote for the primary Democratic nominee rather than President Trump.</p><p>The best way of measuring Presidential approval ratings to determine the voting intentions of Independents in 2020 is through the Gallup Poll, according to Lawrence.</p><p>\"Based on the Gallup Poll conducted March 1-10, 33 percent of Independents approve of President Trump's performance in office. Whether the Democrat will be able to win 67 percent, or anything close to that, depends on whom they nominate\" Lawrence states.</p><p>He elaborates the best chance Democrats have at bringing over more conservatives during their campaigning is by nominating a moderate-to-somewhat-liberal candidate who is well-liked among the general public.</p><p>Regarding higher voter turnout among young adults in 2020, Lawrence breaks down the statistics over the past recent years. Voter turnout in the 18-29 year-old age group has remained fairly consistent over the past presidential elections. The highest voter turnout amongst young people was during Obama's presidential race in 2008, with a high of 51 percent who voted and 49 percent who did not.</p><p>In 2012 these figures shrunk to only 45 percent and in 2016 only increased by 1 percent. Contrastingly, 71 percent of the 65 and up age demographic, and 66 percent of those between 45-64 made their contribution by voting that year. This data points to a projected low voter turnout among young adults in 2020.</p><p>Adam Lawrence concludes this presidential discussion with an impactful message to Millersville students:</p><p>\"Imagine how different our politics would be - how much more attention our elected officials would pay toward the issues, causes, and concerns of young people - if voter turnout among those ages 18 to 29 were just, say, 20 percent higher. It would be, as the saying goes, a 'game changer.'\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4116520</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRS-B7J1-DY7P-T2BN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1599\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Snapper: Millersville University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 28, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Millersville</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>PA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Even though it's still in its infancy stages, Tech Bloc has already affected policy change through its push to bring back Uber and Lyft.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So where did Tech Bloc come from and where is it going?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Striking A Nerve</p><p>Last year, then-mayoral candidate Mike Villarreal reached out to David Heard, chief marketing officer at local tech firm SecureLogix.</p><p>\"He looked at the tech industry as a potential industry group that could be base support for his agenda, which was urban and tech friendly,\" Heard told the San Antonio Current last week. \"Long story short, I began organizing a concept, like, why don't we throw a tech rally around the mayoral race and see if we get a lot of the urban, techcentric young adults to get more involved.\"</p><p>Little did Heard know that a fledgling movement was blossoming.</p><p>In May, Tech Bloc held its first rally, attracting hundreds of people including Lew Moorman, the former president of Rackspace, who rallied techies around bringing back Uber and Lyft - the rideshare companies that pulled out of San Antonio, complaining that regulations passed by City Council were burdensome.</p><p>\"Uber and Lyft leaving was the galvanizing moment,\" Moorman told the Current.</p><p>Then Tech Bloc held another rally last month. More than 1,000 people showed up, including Mayor Ivy Taylor and other politicos from the city and county.</p><p>By the end of that month, Lyft had worked out a deal with the city to return under a nine-month pilot program. Uber is supposedly still in talks with the city while it continues to operate in smaller enclaves like Alamo Heights and Windcrest.</p><p>But back to that meeting between Heard and Villarreal.</p><p>\"Around the same time, unbeknownst to me, Lew and Lorenzo Gomez, who runs Geekdom, they had been having some coffee discussions around the idea of writing some press editorials ... around the need for an agenda of technology innovation and growth in San Antonio,\" Heard said.</p><p>Heard, Moorman and Gomez started meeting regularly, even bringing on additional tech leaders.</p><p>\"Here's the thing, it became almost immediately apparent that we were not organizing an event. We were in fact organizing a movement that had legs way beyond an individual rally,\" Heard said. \"We were kind of tapping into a reservoir of latent energy around the need to have an ongoing agenda and movement around urban livability, a strong central core and technology and innovation ... that we could all embrace city-wide.\"</p><p>Next Generation City</p><p>While Tech Bloc's momentum arguably influenced city officials to work it out with Lyft, there's still more to be done.</p><p>\"We love Lyft, but we want the full fleet of ride-share back on the streets ... hopefully over the next month or two,\" Moorman said with a confident tone.</p><p>However, there's more to the organization than transportation network companies.</p><p>Moorman said Tech Bloc is involved with economic development organizations and is creating what he calls a \"sales deck\" around why tech companies should set up shop in San Antonio.</p><p>Then there are discussions about revitalization.</p><p>\"We believe we need lots of urban core development,\" Moorman said.</p><p>Tech Bloc is also tackling the issue of annexation.</p><p>\"There are a lot of big complicated issues we're trying to get a handle on,\" Moorman explained. \"Another piece that we're really interested in is we really think that Central Texas should be a super region ... one of the great super regions in the country.\"</p><p>Tech Bloc is also excited about Lone Star Rail - the long-sought commuter train that would run from SA's South Side to Georgetown, north of Austin.</p><p>\"That's a way to brand the region to get companies from California,\" Moorman said, explaining that the proposed railway would bolster the concept of a Central Texas \"super region.\"</p><p>And since Tech Bloc is saturated with millennials, Moorman said the organization will work to increase the youth vote.</p><p>\"We want members registered and voting,\" he said. \"If we don't vote, we won't get anything ... and the young professional demographic has a bad history on voting.\"</p><p>Lastly, Tech Bloc will explore ways to work with UTSA, Trinity, Alamo Colleges and other institutions of higher learning to bolster workforce development in an effort to make San Antonio an irresistible place to build a company.</p><p>\"These are things we're putting time and energy in, and we're going to get active,\" Moorman said. \"Anyone who thinks we're politically going to go away - it's not going to happen.\"</p><p>Not Without Criticism</p><p>While Tech Bloc struck a chord with San Antonians and grew into a movement that rebooted the conversation over what it means to be a 21\" century city, not all tech-minded people are convinced it's on the right track.</p><p>Christian Rios, who owns an arcade called Dreamanoids on the West Side, said he thinks Tech Bloc's priorities are misplaced.</p><p>\"There's this huge emphasis on bringing outside resources in to make it look like we're other places and we don't want to get involved in our own community,\" Rios said. \"And what's really disheartening, coming from the South Side of San Antonio, is that there is more than enough interest, more than enough capability out there that literally just gets pushed aside because they won't be given opportunities.\"</p><p>Throughout his life and in college at the University of Incarnate Word, Rios, who previously worked at Apple corporate headquarters, said he felt marginalized in the tech world.</p><p>\"I felt like a huge social outcast because I was brown, trying to be, you know, in this tech realm where almost nobody saw me,\" Rios said.</p><p>That's why Rios runs an arcade.</p><p>\"I realized that here in San Antonio, there isn't a place for me. There just isn't,\" Rios said. \"I won't name any places by name. I've gone to a lot of these tech places and the non-verbal attitude toward me is immediately felt.\"</p><p>If Rios ran an organization like Tech Bloc, he said he'd search within the Alamo City to tap and promote local talent.</p><p>\"We really need to reach out to these school districts, and I'm not talking about Alamo Heights or NEISD where these kids, they all have computers at home. They have all the resources in the world,\" Rios said. \"We need to go to these places where these kids don't have any of that.\"</p><p>Go to any library on the West Side, South Side or downtown and you'll see the need, Rios said.</p><p>\"It's like an adventure for them,\" Rios said, explaining that those libraries are often used by people seeking Internet access for entertainment, education, employment and other real-life needs.</p><p>\"If you could get a youth a computer and internet in some capacity, he might go to college and graduate. It's that simple,\" Rios said. \"I really believe that because as much as San Antonio wants to be this big tech beacon, I mean, just look around, man. Our people, our heart and our soul, some of them, they don't even know how to use the internet.\"</p><p>In Rios' view, San Antonio will never be that beacon without improving access to technology in marginalized communities. And if Tech Bloc overlooks that factor, in Rios' eyes, it will just perpetuate the cycle of looking outward for success rather than within.</p><p>Food for thought.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mreagan@sacurrent.com\">mreagan@sacurrent.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photographs</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRRNT-3825367921</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRRNT2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5H30-M561-JD2T-F3W3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315076</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1385\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2015 San Antonio Current</copyright><publicationName>Current (San Antonio)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"09\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>September 16, 2015 - September 22, 2015</dateText><date day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2015\"/></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Feature</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Tech Bloc-San Antonio TX</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>San Antonio Texas</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Grass roots movement</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technological change</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Advocacy</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>NAICS:813319</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-terms\"><classificationItem><className>Tech Bloc-San Antonio TX</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

I do not think any reader is unaware of yesterday's announcements by the European Commission relating to the development of new tools in the competition and the ex ante regulation arena (see here[1] and here[2]). As these debates gather momentum, the OECD has set up a panel on an issue that is central to them. You will be able to find here[3] all the info on the upcoming round table (Monday of next week), including a background note[4] and a set of videos featuring, among others, yours truly (feedback most welcome!)</p><p>. The presentation I used in the video can be found here[5]. Big thanks, by the way, to Chris Pike[6](OECD), who also prepared the background note. The panel is devoted to line of business restriction, that is, the different regulatory techniques used to limit the ability of a firm to take part in an adjacent activity. It is a topic address in Martin Cave[7]'s legendary 'Six Degrees of Separation', still one of the best titles of all time for a paper (see here[8]). The topic is a classic one in utilities regulation. A substantial fraction of debates in telecoms relates to the separation of the local loop from other activities (in particular, retail activities like broadband). In the energy sector, the separation of natural monopoly segments (transmission and distribution) from the rest of the activities (generation and supply) is also a central aspect. The idea of separation has made a comeback. Some advocate the same approach to separation in relation to online platforms. Some advance the idea that Big Tech firms like Google or Amazon should be subject to some form of separation across their different activities. In my presentation, I introduce the various degrees of separation as points along a spectrum: from the least intrusive (transparency obligations) to the most intrusive (structural divestiture). This is how I see it:The fundamental point I make in the presentation is that the choice between one end of the spectrum or the other seems to depend on two factors: the rate of innovation and the efficiencies resulting from the activity. In particular, the greater the degree of innovation on a particular market or industry, the greater the reluctance to go for the most intrusive options. It is not a surprise that telecoms authorities have so far been very cautious about mandating the structural separation of the local loop from the rest of activities. What about online platforms? What lessons can we draw from utilities regulation? First, they are closer to telecoms in terms of innovation than to any other network industry. Thus, we should be greatly cautious about structural separation. Second, online platforms makes the task of separation much more difficult. For all the innovation and the efficiencies, the set of problems in telecoms is relatively narrow and well-defined, and similar solutions make sense across the board. In the context of online platforms, on the other hand, markets are much more heterogeneous. An online platform can be dominant in its core segment and have a marginal role in an adjacent one. As a result, the adoption of regulatory solutions can be considerably trickier. It is not clear how they can be crafted. And with that open question, I leave it for the panel discussion I look forward to your comments!

In El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio. So once again Donald Trump and his fellow politicians are turning to more fascist proposals to solve the issue of these young people shooting up places and killing people. </p><p>More gun regulations, background checks and 'Red Flag' laws, none of which will help to prevent the violent episodes. The dysfunction going on now is mainly a result of government intrusions and government interventionism in the first place, so just how will more government intrusions and interventions solve any problems? They won't. Bureaucrats will only make things worse, as they are now. Why would we want to trust government agencies and their government databases to do background checks on people, when the bureaucrats and enforcers themselves are not entirely trustworthy and not particularly competent? The El Paso alleged shooter bought his gun(s) legally[2], and last year's Florida school shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz also passed[3] a background check. The FBI were given a heads up by the Russian government on the Boston Marathon bombers, the Tsarnaevs, but the FBI did nothing with the information. So much for 'Red Flag' laws. But 'Red Flag' laws will help disgruntled co-workers or ex-workers, or spouses going through nasty divorces, or neighbors who don't like a particular neighbor, to report targeted individuals to the government or to the police. We already have 'Zero Tolerance' laws in the schools, in which teachers and staff report a kid to the police (not to the principal's office, but police) who has carved a pastry into the shape of a gun or points his finger and says, 'bang, bang.' And sheeple neighbors now report a lone child, playing outside or walking along the street, to the police and police arrest the kid's mother at home for being 'negligent.' We have those things now, because society in Amerika is dysfunctional, irrational, and many people are quite ignorant and their critical thinking skills and common sense have been suppressed or punished by the authoritarian enforcement of political correctness in the schools. Just read through any of John Whitehead's columns[4] from the Rutherford Institute[5], and you'll get a good sense of the police state in the government schools and in Amerika. Trump mentioned the Internet[6] and video games in his press conference this week. What are we going to do, ban video games and censor the Internet? Big Tech SJWs are already censoring those they feel are 'triggering' or are guilty of 'hate,' mainly those whose political or social views the Big Tech censors disagree with. And we know how crazy some of those tech people are[7] now. So now in addition to censoring, the tech authorities will use 'Red Flag' laws to report 'suspicious' activity to the police, giving police the users' IP addresses and access to their social media accounts, and so on. Get ready for The Purge, everyone. But what is causing these young people to go postal at the government schools, at shopping malls or movie theaters? I've already discussed[8] the connection between psychiatric drugs and these shootings. I know, the killer is responsible for his own actions, but the drugs are having the effect of numbing their judgments and self-control. But police don't or won't 'go there' because either they like Big Pharma's exploiting people's problems in the name of greedy profits, or, as was mentioned in this article[9] regarding Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza, maybe police are like the state of Connecticut's bureaucrats who refused to release Lanza's medical records, denying a parents rights organization's request 'because 'it would cause a lot of people to stop taking their medications'.' And Donald Trump mentioned the video games, like taking them away will change anything. In this article, I wrote[10] about Adam Lanza: Regarding Adam Lanza and his incessant video game playing, there are several articles online which seem to be distorting or exaggerating his use ofviolentvideo games. For instance, thisGuardianarticle[11]states that Lanza was obsessed with mass murder and listed only violent video games based only onsomeitems police actually found in the Lanza home, while thisTechdirt article[12]clarifies that he also had non-violent video games such asDance Dance Revolution, and it was that video with which the article claims Lanza actually was obsessed. ThisHartford Courantop-ed[13]agrees based on witness interviews that Lanza's real obsession was for the non-violent video games, especiallyDance Dance Revolution.Declare Your Independence! Profit outside the rigged system! Protect yourself from tyranny and economic collapse. Learn to live free and spread peace!Counter Markets Newsletter - Trends ...rategies for Maximum FreedomSo, Adam Lanza was most obsessed with his non-violent video Dance Dance Revolution, but he didn't exactly go into the Sandy Hook School and dance for the kids, did he? Nope. And I also wondered whether Adam Lanza may have been 'brainwashed,' like from video games: connections[14]between the recent mass killings and implications of government-infiltration of media and use of drugs to 'trigger' violent behavior in people, some of whom have claimed no knowledge of their even having committed violent acts. Which should not be too hard to fathom, by the way, given that wenow know[15]that the NSA has not only collected video gamers' chats, buddylists and geolocations but also NSA agents themselves participate and role-play in games and discussions as a means of extracting personal information and metadata and recruiting informants, specifically in Xbox Live andWorld of Warcraft. We also know that governments haveinstilled[16]their propaganda in these video games. And I think Trump said something about video games 'desensitizing' the kids and young adults to violence and murder. But what about the military? Since the early 1990s especially the U.S. military has gone over to the Middle East, bombing and shooting and mass killing, especially in Iraq, murdering or causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocents. And the death and destruction was revitalized when the George W. Bush started new wars against Iraq and Afghanistan, and to this day their drone bombers, and Obama's drone bombers, and now Trump's drone bombers continue to murder mostly innocent people. Talk about 'desensitized'! The U.S. military intentionally desensitizes[17] and suppresses the consciences of military members. And Trump also said something about looking at 'mental illness.' Why do Trump and others want to disarm people who are supposedly 'mentally ill'[18] and make them defenseless? We already have sitting ducks in the 'gun-free zone' schools and other mandatory 'gun-free' places \u2014 why put targets on the backs of 'mentally ill' people? And who is to decide who has 'mental illness'[19]? Local law enforcement, some of whom are Iraq War vets and who have PTSD? Psychiatrists? Yeah, right. I would trust the average psychiatrist[20] to determine who is mentally ill as far as I could throw him. Like in the old Soviet Union[21] (and the United State[22]), those who criticize the Regime in Washington will be diagnosed as having a 'mental illness,' as will those who continue to use correct-gendered pronouns, those who identify as Christian or conservative or those who homeschool their kids. You get the idea, and it's not too far-fetched. We know how brainwashed many people are now in today's culture of nonsense, irrationality and pathological political correctness. But the police state in Amerika has grown exponentially especially since 9/11, with little children being terrorized by sicko perv molesters and gropers at the airports, and being made to fear every little thing. The government schools are terrorizing the kids into fearing that the end is near with climate change extinction. The schools are indoctrinating the kids to accept 'transgender' as a normal aspect of life when it is no such thing, and the kids know this deep down. The kids are intentionally being made by the government schools to be confused about gender and sexuality, they are being labeled with made-up diseases and conditions such as 'ADHD,' 'ADD,' 'PhD,' and told they are 'autistic,' when in fact they are just normal, growing kids. So, we have a lot of them, mainly[23] boys[24], who are being tormented by an increasingly dysfunctional and corrupt society. This in addition to their brains being poisoned by pharmaceutical drugs such as Xanax and Zoloft and Adderall, and the vaccine adjuvants such as aluminum are also interfering with their normal brain development. My conclusion is that government has played a large role in these societal problems. Government schools[25], government-Big Pharma colluding, government's invasions of other countries for no good reason and murders of innocent foreigners, government's own violence[26] and intrusions into the lives and liberty of its own people in the United State of Amerika. So, the solution includes getting rid of government schools[27]. End the wars and occupations abroad and the police state at home, dismantle the national security state, and end the government's support of the pharmaceutical industry.

In these discussions with Google - and we hope Facebook also takes part in similar talks - we are confident that 2020 will mark a turning point for media sustainability in the modern digital world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The agreements reached this year will come from the government's response to the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission's inquiry into digital platforms.</p><p>News Corp has led the global debate about the need for a rebalancing of the relationships between the tech giants and publishers to ensure a strong and vibrant media sector.</p><p>The ACCC's inquiry was a world first and ACCC chairman Rod Sims said: \"Google and Facebook have grown to have almost unfettered market power with significant impacts on consumers.\" Consequently, the government's directive that platforms must enter codes of conduct with publishers offers a serious opportunity to address many of the concerns raised by media companies.</p><p>At the heart of publishers' concerns is the need for media companies to be compensated appropriately by platforms such as Facebook for how they use the journalism created by publishers.</p><p>Digital disruption and the tech titans' rise over the past two decades have dismantled the traditional journalism business model, cost thousands of jobs and closed many media outlets across the world.</p><p>These discussions are timely, and recent commercial arrangements with Facebook in the US and Apple have shown a constructive new path for relationships between publishers and platforms. In the US, we are seeing early, but welcome, signs of how this issue is shifting, with digital platforms such as Facebook and Apple recognising the value of journalism to society.</p><p>As News Corp's global chief executive, Robert Thomson, noted just last week, while News's commercial deals with Facebook in the US and Apple are evolving, they have set a precedent for how media companies can be compensated via commercial arrangements for their journalism.</p><p>The federal government, in its response to the ACCC inquiry, has been explicit in its intent that the proposed codes of conduct can set frameworks for the negotiation of such terms.</p><p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Prime Minister Scott Morrison have both expressed their -expectation that codes will be agreed between publishers and platforms voluntarily. However, if this does not happen, the government is prepared to implement a mandatory regulatory outcome.</p><p>\"This code will cover such things as how revenue is shared, how content is accessed and -presented, as well as forewarning about changes to algorithms that go to how the content is ranked online,\" Mr Frydenberg said when announcing the federal government's response to the ACCC inquiry.</p><p>\"The government will be seeking an update from the ACCC on the development of these voluntary codes by May and we are expecting that an agreed code will be entered into by November.\" News Corp's position remains clear that the best solution for the industry - and for society - is for the tech companies such as Google and Facebook to enter arrangements that pay a premium for use of premium journalism.</p><p>The conduct codes are a -regulatory mechanism to compel the parties to enter into negotiations to achieve these business outcomes. The talks that publishers such as News Corp and the platforms are now starting come at a critical time in history and for democracy. Australians need a strong media able to support journalism that informs a nation, holds the powerful to account, scrutinises how our taxes are spent, exposes corruption, campaigns for good causes and justice, gives a voice to the disadvantaged and celebrates our country's -successes.</p><p>The current situation, sadly, is unsustainable - and the government and ACCC have recognised this fact.</p><p>Without change, many media outlets won't survive -because, while their content has helped and is helping the platforms grow their businesses, the returns and compensation for the publishers are inadequate.</p><p>The solution is now clear, fair and will be mandated if necessary: Big Tech should pay publishers from the profits and in the process secure a strong, sustainable media industry and a healthy society.Michael Miller is executive chairman of News Corp Australasia, publisher of -- ---The Australian</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-ac53a30c4a4211ea878395d9090ea49fd8a4c24eb52cd5e1b721c82bc6e41451</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y5M-SWW1-F0JP-W563-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"767\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 10, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

This short-sighted policy will threaten market competition for small businesses and entrepreneurs, and will only apply to internet service providers and not big internet companies. </p><p>It is time for a bipartisan effort to ensure open internet rules that actually protect consumers. In 2017, new FCC Chairman Ajit Pai put an end to Obama era net neutrality regulations. The FCC changed course, reversing the 2015 rules in favor of a regulatory environment that would foster innovation and market competition. But Democrats responded to this rightful reversal with the same answer they always rely on - more government. Earlier this month Nancy Pelosi unveiled the 'Save the Internet Act,' in a misguided attempt to push back against Chairman Pai. Pelosi and the Democrats want to put an end to this era of internet prosperity and free-market liberated internet by once again smothering it with too much government red tape. In truth, the Save the Internet Act will do more harm than good. It will result in uncertainty and risk that will hurt needed internet and broadband investment\u2014especially harmful in rural areas of our state. It will create unnecessary bureaucracy and burdensome regulation that will impede market competition and remove the choice of internet services and benefits from the consumer. And it won't go far enough in making sure that these open internet rules apply equally to everyone, especially the big tech companies that have effectively become the gatekeepers to today's internet.Fortunately, the Democrats are not the only ones who want a long-term solution for net neutrality. Republican Members of Congress, like Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, believe it's time for net neutrality regulation too, but are not convinced that the FCC should be responsible for enforcing those regulations. McMorris Rodgers is urging bipartisan support to pass legislation that includes the three'bright line' rules[1]that were part of FCC net neutrality regulations under President Obama, and gives oversight of net neutrality regulation to the Federal Trade Commission. Many Republicans agree that net neutrality rules are important, and many Democrats too, but letting the government regulate the internet, a crucial highway that contributes to our nation's economy, is not the answer. Not when the free-market driven internet is successfully promoting competition and investment. Net neutrality is important for ensuring consumer protection and fair business practices. But we cannot let the Democrats use unnecessary big government to achieve that goal. This is why it is imperative that our strong conservative members of Congress, like Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler, stand against the liberal efforts to embarrass the GOP and raise money from their radical base. Congress must vote against the 'Save the Internet Act,' and seek a bipartisan solution that is in the best interest of all Americans.

This short-sighted policy will threaten market competition for small businesses and entrepreneurs, and will only apply to internet service providers and not big internet companies. </p><p>It is time for a bipartisan effort to ensure open internet rules that actually protect consumers. In 2017, new FCC Chairman Ajit Pai put an end to Obama era net neutrality regulations. The FCC changed course, reversing the 2015 rules in favor of a regulatory environment that would foster innovation and market competition. But Democrats responded to this rightful reversal with the same answer they always rely on - more government. Earlier this month Nancy Pelosi unveiled the 'Save the Internet Act,' in a misguided attempt to push back against Chairman Pai. Pelosi and the Democrats want to put an end to this era of internet prosperity and free-market liberated internet by once again smothering it with too much government red tape. In truth, the Save the Internet Act will do more harm than good. It will result in uncertainty and risk that will hurt needed internet and broadband investment especially harmful in rural areas of our state. It will create unnecessary bureaucracy and burdensome regulation that will impede market competition and remove the choice of internet services and benefits from the consumer. And it won't go far enough in making sure that these open internet rules apply equally to everyone, especially the big tech companies that have effectively become the gatekeepers to today's internet.Fortunately, the Democrats are not the only ones who want a long-term solution for net neutrality. Republican Members of Congress, like Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, believe it's time for net neutrality regulation too, but are not convinced that the FCC should be responsible for enforcing those regulations. McMorris Rodgers is urging bipartisan support to pass legislation that includes the three'bright line' rules[1]that were part of FCC net neutrality regulations under President Obama, and gives oversight of net neutrality regulation to the Federal Trade Commission. Many Republicans agree that net neutrality rules are important, and many Democrats too, but letting the government regulate the internet, a crucial highway that contributes to our nation's economy, is not the answer. Not when the free-market driven internet is successfully promoting competition and investment. Net neutrality is important for ensuring consumer protection and fair business practices. But we cannot let the Democrats use unnecessary big government to achieve that goal. This is why it is imperative that our strong conservative members of Congress, like Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler, stand against the liberal efforts to embarrass the GOP and raise money from their radical base. Congress must vote against the 'Save the Internet Act,' and seek a bipartisan solution that is in the best interest of all Americans.

The platforms and their tools that connect us to customers worldwide have boosted our launch and accelerated our growth. So I'm more than a little surprised that Congress and other elected officials are attacking online platforms and very concerned that government actions against the big companies may hurt small businesses like mine.</p><p>Our business idea was borne of frustration. My kids sleep in bunk beds and every morning they struggled to make their beds. After searching the internet and not finding a solution, I decided to create something that worked for my kids \u2014 an \"all-in-one zipper bed set.\" I worked with my mom and we sewed one for our family, but when several neighbors asked where they could buy one I realized we might have stumbled on to a business opportunity. I reached out to a friend and we decided to start our own company.</p><p> Several years and hundreds of prototypes later, we finalized our design and found a manufacturer, and then we started a Kickstarter campaign. We raised more than $100,000 from nearly 300 frustrated bedmakers, but retail stores would not even meet with us and they certainly wouldn't put our product on their shelves. After our Kickstarter success, we were confident that consumers would buy this if they knew about it, so we got on board the e-commerce train. It's been a wild and remarkably successful ride.</p><p> Since day one, our company has used digital tools to attract and engage customers, sell product and take returns, and manage our reputation and brand. We had no money for advertising or marketing, so we took to social media to get the word out. We used Facebook, Pinterest, Google, Houzz, Instagram and Twitter to promote our products and showcase our designs that work with every home decor. Our YouTube \"how to\" videos help people understand our product before they buy. Yelp, Facebook and Google host reviews. And for the very few customers who might be unhappy, FreshDesk helps manage returns.</p><p> People love our bedding! We sell all over North America and also in England, New Zealand and Australia. We get more than 3 million monthly views on Pinterest and we have more than 250,000 Instagram followers. All of these platforms require our team's input and management, but their global reach and analytics are incredibly complex, way beyond the know-how of our small company and remarkably low-cost (sometimes free!).</p><p> For our 15 employees and thousands of customers, the benefits of digital technology and platforms are obvious. Without our digital partners we would never have started this business, and likely we could not continue in business without them. We are 100% online \u2014 primarily because that's where our customers are.</p><p> I honestly don't know the words to communicate how crucial the digital platforms and tools are to our business. By sharing our story and the details of our journey, I hope that Congress and our public officials will understand and appreciate the value that Facebook, Google and other digital companies deliver to small businesses \u2014 not just our business but thousands or millions more. It is so important that policymakers take account of small businesses, and as they consider whether to regulate big tech companies they ensure small companies are not harmed inadvertently.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKUT-7ba1eedd45625a58b9a421e14b50c29234eaf14e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C87D78E2008 NWBKUT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNR-SNY1-DXVP-V23J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"565\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Daily Herald.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

I don't mean this as a criticism, just a statement of fact.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the great things about America is that politics \u2013 never mind political philosophy \u2013 isn't a big part of most people's lives. Associating a body of ideas with the institutions (political parties) that are directly charged with putting ideas into action is a pragmatic way to cut to the chase. Paying attention to what the eggheads and theorists of the left and right want the parties to do is only worthwhile if you're especially interested in politics.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The challenge for conservatives these days is that the Republican Party really doesn't know what it's for, beyond defending President Trump and opposing Democrats and socialism. While the fight over impeachment sucks up all of the oxygen in public, there's a robust battle behind the scenes about what it means to be a conservative.</p><p> Some of it has spilled out into public view, usually centering on nationalism \u2013 what it means, what it requires in terms of policy, how it differs from traditional conservatism or whether it differs at all. Sens. Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio, for example, have offered thoughtful versions of \"economic nationalism,\" pitting it against libertarianism (both real and imagined).</p><p> There are many different schools of thought here, but a common theme is the idea that government should be more interventionist in the economy: Policymakers should be more willing to overrule the marketplace on everything from big tech to child care to trade.</p><p> Republicans were outraged by the way the Obama administration \"picked winners and losers\" in the economy. Some were appalled when Obama bailed out automakers with a massive handout. Donald Trump has now given more aid to farmers than Obama ever gave Detroit, and if an elected Republican has complained about it, I missed it. In fairness, the farmer bailouts were necessitated by the president's trade wars. But that just demonstrates Republicans' willingness to substitute their judgment for the market's.</p><p> There's a cultural version of the nationalist project as well. Some conservative intellectuals \u2013 mostly, but not exclusively, Catholic \u2013 believe the state has a role in imposing its judgment in the marketplace of ideas.</p><p> I have strong views about all of this, but I thought it might be helpful to offer a few humble suggestions about how to think about such things as these debates heat up.</p><p> First, the root of conservatism is conservation. The great conservative philosopher Roger Scruton, who died earlier this month, said, \"Conservatism starts from a sentiment that all mature people can readily share: the sentiment that good things are easily destroyed, but not easily created.\" This sentiment is at the heart of traditional conservatism, but it's not constrained by ideology or partisanship. Many liberals (and even some socialists) have displayed this temperament.</p><p> Second, with the great divide in conservative theory, there are those who are anti-left and those who are anti-state. For a crude illustration, some people are opposed to public schools because they don't think education is a proper task for the state. (Milton Friedman called them \"government schools.\") Others on the right think public schools are fine; they just object to how progressives operate them, filling kids' heads with objectionable ideas.</p><p> Obviously, most libertarian purists are in the anti-state camp, but for most conservatives it's a balancing act. A consistent conservative can be libertarian on nearly all policy questions and still favor heavily regulating or even banning pornography.</p><p> Another fault line revolves around the question, \"Which state are we talking about?\"</p><p> If I may show my cards a bit, outside of foreign policy, I'm very libertarian at the national level, mostly libertarian at the state level and pretty communitarian at the local level. Letting people live the way they want to live where they actually live, so long as basic civil rights are respected, has always struck me as the best way to maximize happiness and democratic accountability.</p><p> This raises a final question: Can the state actually do what you want it to do?</p><p> At the core of the conservative critique of the left has always been a basic skepticism that top-down planning from Washington can work. It used to be that the champions of such planning were mostly on the left. That's not true any longer. And it remains to be seen whether top-down planning from the right works any better than it does from the left.</p><p> Jonah Goldberg is editor-in-chief of The Dispatch and the host of The Remnant podcast.

The move paved the way for China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization one year later. We\u2019ve been living with the consequences of that fateful decision ever since.</p><p><br/>PNTR has been implicated in some of the most significant and distressing trends of American life in this century: millions of well-paying manufacturing jobs lost; declining family formation and rising deaths of despair; soaring real-estate prices and medieval levels of urban inequality; increased political polarization and populist movements, left and right; and faltering faith in the power of liberal democracy to respond to these and related challenges. To pin all this on a single trade agreement would be a step too far, of course. And yet the imprint of what\u2019s come to be known as the \u201cChina shock\u201d can be seen on all these trends, either through its first-order effects, or its reverberations through the body politic.<br/>At the time, though, to oppose PNTR was to make company with the anti-globalization left. It was an unserious position for unserious people, the kind who read Noam Chomsky by night and opined about \u201cneoliberalism\u201d by day. In contrast, serious people understood that free trade with China would be a boon for American consumers, put pressure on the Chinese Communist Party to democratize, and forestall any future conflict with the rising military power. Congress ultimately supported PNTR by a wide margin, bolstered by a record-breaking advertising blitz from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the support of more than three-fourths of Republican lawmakers.<br/>It was, at any rate, inevitable. \u201cThe Logic of Human Destiny,\u201d as Robert Wright put it in the subtitle to his 1999 bestseller,\u00a0Nonzero, showed \u201cwin-win\u201d games between people and nations were in the driver\u2019s seat of human history, steering us toward a peaceful era of global interdependence. The book was a personal favorite of President Clinton\u2019s, but has since become a too-perfect cultural artifact of the Whiggish ethos of the late 1990s.<br/>Interdependence still tends to promote peace, and gains from trade are still real. But as abstractions, these principles turn out to elide crucial complexities. As trade tensions with China intensify, America is learning this the hard way. In the process, a fascinating realignment is taking place that has many on the right sounding like they\u2019ve dusted off their Chomsky Readers. What are those complexities, exactly, and what do they foretell about the future of American politics?<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THE RICARDIAN VICE</emphasis><br/>The great American economist Walter Heller once quipped that an economist is someone who sees an idea work in practice but, before believing it, asks to see it work in theory. Nowhere is this more true than in issues of international trade and development. According to 19th-century economist David Ricardo\u2019s classic theory of comparative advantage, free trade between two countries allows each to specialize in what it does best. Even if one country has an absolute advantage in all areas of production, specialization creates surpluses that can be exchanged to make both countries better off, making even unilateral trade liberalization in a country\u2019s self-interest.<br/>China engineered its meteoric rise by rejecting this conventional Western advice. As a low-wage country, it was consigned by Ricardian logic to embrace labor-intensive work. This may be a necessary first stage in a country\u2019s escape from poverty?\u2014?sweatshops are better than nothing?\u2014?but as a development strategy, it\u2019s a recipe for falling into the middle-income trap. Like the successful development stories of Japan and South Korea before it, China therefore did (and continues to do) the exact opposite, promoting\u00a0diversification\u00a0into new and higher-value lines of production through aggressive industrial policies and economic planning. The reason Western economists dubbed the Northeast Asian growth stories a \u201cmiracle\u201d may therefore be that those countries did something that worked in practice, even if it did not yet work in theory.<br/>The miracles in Northeast Asia can be usefully contrasted with the relatively disappointing development stories of Southeast Asian countries like Bangladesh. In 1980, Bangladesh was slightly richer than China in GDP per-capita terms, and in the decade that followed it joined its neighbors in passing a series of impressive trade liberalizations. John Williamson, then-chief economist for South Asia at the World Bank, offered a progress report in a 1999 paper for the Peterson Institute:<br/>I believe that most foreign economists who have looked at Bangladesh\u2019s trade performance in the last 8 years have concluded that its trade liberalization since 1990 has been a textbook case of success. Exports have increased at double-digit rates, and imports have increased in parallel, leaving the trade balance largely unchanged in dollar terms. These exports have been heavily concentrated in the garment industry, which is an industry well-suited to Bangladesh\u2019s comparative advantage in view of its heavy use of abundant unskilled labour. GDP growth has accelerated. What more could anyone ask for, apart from more of the same?<br/>And more of the same is what they got. When they\u2019re not being upended by global financial flows, Southeast Asian countries like Bangladesh, Indonesia, and the Philippines remain hubs for low-wage, labor-intensive work, from garment manufacturing to call centers, and have contemporary GDP per-capita figures that range from a fifth to a third of China\u2019s. The typical Southeast Asian worker is no doubt much richer than he was three decades ago. But acceding to the allocative efficiency of global supply chains has meant that the development of home-grown industries has suffered. This has had lasting consequences. Elites in these countries reap outsized gains by brokering connections with government officials and multinational corporations, deepening patron-client systems, and entrenching existing industries. The \u201ctrap\u201d middle-income countries fall into is political in nature, but in a way that interacts with a development model based on unbalanced growth.<br/>Joseph Schumpeter called the habit of applying simple models to complex realities the \u201cRicardian vice,\u201d named for the economist\u2019s propensity for \u201cheroic abstraction.\u201d An analogous case of Ricardian vice has taken hold in the United States, leading to our own narrow form of specialization.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HUMAN CAPITAL FLIGHT</emphasis><br/>Look at the back of an iPhone box and you\u2019ll read: \u201cDesigned by Apple in California/Assembled in China.\u201d This encapsulates the so-called \u201copen-innovation model,\u201d in which the U.S. specializes in intangible sectors like basic research, software, design, marketing, law, and finance. Our intellectual property can then be employed to fabricate real-world goods in tangible factories abroad.<br/>Adopting this model has given the United States a comparative advantage not just in highly skilled labor, but in a very specific kind of college-educated human capital. The college wage premium has thus grown considerably since the 1980s, while wages for less-educated workers have stagnated. Following the IT-driven productivity boom of the late 1990s, capped off by PNTR, large amounts of routine work were thus either automated or outsourced, causing the college wage premium to spike once again. Since 2000, the college wage premium has stabilized, while wages for workers with advanced degrees continue to rise. Unfortunately, the subsequent increase in wage inequality is not something that can be easily rectified through taxes and transfers. As Paul Krugman and Maurice Obstfeld note in their undergraduate economics textbook, \u201cthe United States is abundantly endowed with highly skilled labor and\u2026low-skilled labor is correspondingly scarce. This means that international trade tends to make low-skilled workers in the United States worse off?\u2014?not just temporarily, but on a sustained basis.\u201d<br/>A high-school graduate in America is still more productive than a Bangladeshi sweatshop worker, thanks in part to the capital intensity of the American economy. Because of this, proponents of PNTR with China predicted the agreement would have minimal impact on U.S. workers. After a decade of importing cheap Chinese consumer products under their \u201cmost favored nation\u201d status, we\u2019d get more of the same.<br/>But China had different ideas. Determined to avoid the middle-income trap, they responded to the trade certainty PNTR provided by investing in the productivity of their export sector, causing what economists Justin Pierce and Peter Schott describe as \u201cthe surprisingly swift decline of U.S. manufacturing employment.\u201d The number of Americans employed in manufacturing had held steady at 17 to 18 million since the 1970s, but fell by about 3 million, or 17%, in the first few years following PNTR. Depending on the specification, 45% to 55% of these job losses can be directly attributed to Chinese import competition.<br/>As deindustrialization accelerated, the wages of the third of the population with post-secondary education pulled away from the rest. This has had its own impact on our politics by entrenching the interests of the \u201ccreative class\u201d of post-industrial knowledge workers, most of whom cluster in a handful of globally integrated and increasingly expensive cities. Meanwhile, in the regions where import competition was most concentrated, marriage rates fell, deaths from suicide and overdose rose, and voters polarized along party lines. Measures of congressional attitudes toward China show they are now more hostile than in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square Massacre. The most acute effects of the China shock may have worn off by the 2016 election, yet trade-related layoffs from years prior still robustly correlated with Donald Trump\u2019s vote share. Workers, unlike widgets, have memories.<br/>Categorizing workers as either high- or low-skill has always been misleading. Human capital is not a spectrum, but instead displays as much heterogeneity as the goods and services it produces. An electrician cannot do the job of a plumber or vice versa. Likewise, Chinese manufacturing workers are highly skilled in their own right, just not in things that will be found in any American college curriculum. Apple CEO Tim Cook made this point well in a 2017 interview at the Fortune Global Forum in China:<br/>The popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labor cost. I\u2019m not sure what part of China they go to, but the truth is China stopped being the low labor cost country many years ago. And that is not the reason to come to China from a supply point of view. The reason is because of the skill, and the quantity of skill in one location, and the type of skill it is. The products we do require really advanced tooling\u2026and the tooling skill is very deep here. In the U.S. you could have a meeting of tooling engineers, and I\u2019m not sure we could fill the room. In China you could fill multiple football fields.<br/>Of course, the sad irony of Cook\u2019s remarks is that America was the birthplace of modern machine tooling. After the embargo of 1807 disrupted trade between the U.S. and Britain, the American businessman Francis Cabot Lowell traveled to England and Scotland to study their textile industries. Unable to acquire drawings of their innovative weaving machines, he committed the designs to memory, returned home at the onset of the War of 1812, and established the Boston Manufacturing Company the following year. While Lowell was building America\u2019s first integrated textile mill, Eli Whitney was inventing the first true milling machine, the cotton gin, kick-starting the American industrial revolution in earnest.<br/>By the beginning of the 20th century, the U.S. had surpassed Britain as a hub for manufacturing excellence. The massive investments in manufacturing innovation spurred by World War II cemented that lead. Between the U.S. military and its civilian partners, America invented modern machine tooling and built the world\u2019s largest forgeries, among a host of other advances.<br/>As hardware entrepreneur Nick Pinkston notes, \u201c[I]t was partly WW2\u2019s immense capital equipment investment that modernized American manufacturing infrastructure that led to a jump in post war productivity.\u201d Yet by the 1970s, declining government investment and the burgeoning outsourcing craze allowed Japan to take the helm, using many of the same strategies later employed by China. The loss of America\u2019s dominance in precision tooling wasn\u2019t inevitable, but now that this dominance is gone, it will be exponentially harder to bring back.<br/>The decline of U.S. manufacturing and the de-skilling of the human capital it employed thus has implications for our ability to innovate. \u201cBoth the design process and production process generate useful information, and dislocation makes it difficult for that information to circulate,\u201d notes writer and China analyst Dan Wang:<br/>What happens when we stop the flow of knowledge up the stack? I think that the weakness of the U.S. industrial robotics sector is instructive. The U.S. has little position in making high-end precision manufacturing equipment. When it comes to factory automation systems, machine tools, robot arms, and other types of production machinery, the most advanced suppliers are in Japan, Germany, and Switzerland. I think the reason that the U.S. has little position can be tied directly to the departure of firms from so many segments of manufacturing. How do engineers work on the design of automation systems if they don\u2019t have exposure to industrial processes?<br/>Others will argue that the manufacturing jobs the United States lost to China were destined to disappear at some point, anyway. When steel jobs disappeared in the 1980s, workers moved to places like Hickory, North Carolina, to manufacture furniture. When the furniture factories disappeared, it was assumed that they would make a similar transition. But this time was different. Some workers no doubt found better jobs, but many more languished, falling back on disability insurance or lower-paying service-sector work. Adjust for the falling cost of living from cheaper imported goods, and the situation looks a bit better (though, as in the case of Bangladesh, one cannot help but wonder about the counterfactual). From a skills perspective, however, the China shock didn\u2019t just represent the loss of particular jobs. It represented a permanent hit to our stock of human capital, causing various forms of process knowledge that might have been retooled to be lost for good.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHOCK THERAPY</emphasis><br/>The Ricardian vice shows up again and again in economists\u2019 sanguine view of workers\u2019 ability to adjust to shocks. After the Soviet Union collapsed, for example, Western economists flocked to Moscow to assist in Russia\u2019s transition to a market-based economy. Central to this effort was the Harvard Institute for International Development, a think tank internal to Harvard University that received funding from the United States Agency for International Development. HIID was headed by a young Jeffrey Sachs, the economics prodigy who earned a reputation for advising transitioning countries to reform as quickly as possible. The formula was to cut subsidies, eliminate price controls, deregulate industries, privatize state-owned assets, and open up to foreign investment. This approach, known as \u201cshock therapy,\u201d gained credence after it seemed to work in Poland. But reforming Russia would prove a more difficult challenge.<br/>The impact of shock therapy on Russia is complex and hotly contested, even to this day, but few now argue that it worked as intended. The Soviet economy had been organized in an economically haphazard way, with factory \u201cmonotowns\u201d dotting Russia\u2019s hinterland as vestiges of 70 years of centrally planned industrialization. In the years following the first jolt of reforms, output fell by as much as half, poverty skyrocketed, and households saw their savings wiped out by hyperinflation. \u201cVoucher privatization,\u201d a scheme to provide households with shares in the sale of state-owned assets, wound up enriching a small class of oligarchs who were able to move their wealth abroad. And while economic growth eventually returned, Russia\u2019s GDP per capita didn\u2019t surpass its 1990 level until 2004.<br/>Russia\u2019s experience with shock therapy makes the American China shock look downright pleasant in comparison. But despite obvious differences in magnitude, some striking parallels stand out. Shock therapy and the China shock both represented epochal shifts in the forces shaping each economy. Both spurred rapid de-industrialization, with harms geographically concentrated in rural regions. Both hardened attitudes toward globalization, laying the foundation for the rise of illiberal political leaders years later. And both witnessed a rise in deaths of despair, driven by opioids in the U.S. and alcohol abuse in Russia. Indeed, the Russian state monopoly over alcohol was repealed in 1992, massively increasing the supply for unemployed workers. According to a 2009 report from the\u00a0Lancet, Russia\u2019s average life expectancy fell by approximately five years from 1991 to 1994. As the opioid crisis metastasized into a crisis of cheap, Chinese fentanyl, for the first time in modern history U.S. life expectancy fell as well, in two of the last three years.<br/>Proponents of PNTR can be forgiven for underestimating the size of the China shock. For most of our living memory, the U.S. has been a \u201clarge, closed economy\u201d in the terminology of international trade theory, producing a quarter or more of global GDP with 5% of the world\u2019s population. This gave the United States power to set its own terms of trade, and to be shielded from foreign trade shocks by sheer size. This is perhaps how we got away with pitiful trade-adjustment programs and an industrial policy on autopilot for so long. But with China and other emerging markets coming online, the U.S. economy behaves more and more like a \u201csmall, open economy,\u201d putting stress on our legacy institutions and thus our traditional political alignments.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THE REALIGNMENT</emphasis><br/>Shock therapy and the \u201cneoliberal\u201d development model have always had their critics in the West, particularly on the far left. Naomi Klein\u2019s 2007 book,\u00a0The Shock Doctrine, is a case in point, as it weaves the history of neoliberal reforms in Eastern Europe and Latin America into a farfetched and conspiratorial critique of \u201cdisaster capitalism.\u201d Yet in a curious shift, many of these traditionally left-wing criticisms are now being made by prominent figures on the American right. More and more conservative commentators are even attacking \u201cneoliberalism\u201d by name, hiding the genealogy of their critique behind nationalistic rhetoric. The election of Donald Trump no doubt played a large role in sparking this realignment, but the forces behind it predate Trump and will continue long after he\u2019s gone.<br/>In short, Democrats tend to cluster in cities, and increasingly so. The correlations among population density, educational attainment, and party identification are at all-time highs. The base of the Democratic Party has thus come to overlap with the \u201cabundant factor\u201d of the free-trade status quo, while the Republican Party balances a tenuous coalition of business interests and the remnants of a disaffected white working class. Progressives still purport to care about economic justice, but they largely focus on issues with an urban and educated bent, like transfer programs for the urban poor, the rising cost of child care, and student-debt forgiveness. The broader prioritization of\u00a0social\u00a0justice has in turn opened a window for conservatives to discover a taste for class analysis.<br/>\u201cNeoliberalism?\u2014?the hegemonic ideology of the transatlantic elite?\u2014?pretends that class has disappeared in societies that are purely meritocratic, with the exception of barriers to individual upward mobility that still exist because of racism, misogyny, and homophobia,\u201d writes Michael Lind in his 2017 essay \u201cThe New Class War.\u201d \u201cUnable to acknowledge the existence of social class, much less to candidly discuss class conflicts, neoliberals can only attribute populism to bigotry or irrationality.\u201d<br/>Lind describes the conservative backlash to identity politics in essentially Marxist terms. Consciousness of one\u2019s place in the hierarchy of intersectional oppression displaces consciousness of class, subdividing worker solidarity. Multinational corporations and Big Tech, as vehicles for \u201cwoke capital,\u201d can thus shift profits abroad and offshore production with impunity, so long as they signal their commitment to the social-justice cause of the moment. The Twitter left\u2019s problem with Nike, for instance, is not that they employ sweatshop labor, but that they would design a sneaker with the Betsy Ross flag. When Nike succumbed to progressive outrage and canceled the shoe\u2019s production, conservatives took a page from Naomi Klein\u2019s 1999 book,\u00a0No Logo, by identifying the corporation\u2019s appeasement as a cynical case of brand bullying.<br/>The right\u2019s growing embrace of cultural criticism is part of the same trade-induced realignment shaping the flirtation with class analysis. Young, multicultural cities are not just hubs for educated professionals. Cities are the center of gravity for modern consumer capitalism, pulling the corporate sector toward cultural progressivism for the simple reason that there is just more disposable income in cities. Cultural conservatives have thus formed something like a new counterculture; their objections to cultural homogenization and pressures to conform echo the left\u2019s classic critique of consumerism.<br/>As \u201cintangible assets\u201d like brand equity make up an ever-larger share of the stock market\u2019s capitalization, representing the wrong values often poses a greater risk to a company\u2019s quarterly earnings than do taxes and regulation. In a sign of the times, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce recently made the first major change in 40 years to how it ranks lawmakers, adding a bonus for \u201cbipartisanship\u201d designed to distance itself from conservative populists. The Koch donor and advocacy network made a similar shift, signaling an intent to work with Democratic lawmakers on issues like comprehensive immigration reform and criminal justice. And most recently, the Business Roundtable released a statement signed by 181 CEOs moving away from the principle of shareholder primacy, a position they had previously affirmed every year since 1997.<br/>Negative partisanship is a powerful force. President Trump\u2019s attacks on illegal immigration and foreign trade agreements have caused a corresponding boost in support for immigration reform and free trade among registered Democrats. As conservative intellectuals begin to reframe their rhetoric around a critique of neoliberalism, progressive intellectuals are mounting a spirited defense. In 2019, for example, Harvard University Press published\u00a0Open: The Progressive Case for Free Trade, Immigration, and Global Capital, by Kimberly Clausing, a professor of economics at Reed College. In true Whig form, Clausing argues that globalization is a force for good, lifting the fortunes of the world\u2019s most vulnerable. To the extent that it creates domestic winners and losers, she argues, the Earned Income Tax Credit and higher marginal tax rates can close the gap. Older-school liberals who\u2019ve noticed this trend have been put in a tricky spot: question the economic elite, or show sympathy to the white working class and risk appearing deaf to the pressing cultural issues of our time.<br/>This tension was nicely illustrated by a debate within the offices of the\u00a0New Republic\u00a0magazine, long a barometer for the state of American liberalism. It was 2014, and Apple\u2019s Tim Cook had just announced he was gay. \u201cI see the celebration of his announcement, while entirely justifiable, as another sign of what\u2019s happened to liberalism today, where rights/identity liberalism trumps economic liberalism,\u201d noted writer Alec MacGillis to his colleagues on an internal email listserv. \u201cThis is, after all, a guy who embodies so much of what\u2019s amiss in the age of inequality?\u2014?pulling down $378 million in 2011 alone; Apple skirting taxes more brazenly than anyone else?\u2014?yet those revelations have caused barely a stir.\u201d Minutes later Chris Hughes, the Facebook co-founder and then-owner of the magazine, responded to MacGillis by agreeing his points were valid but arguing that there was no evidence that Apple had broken the law. \u201cCompanies have an obligation to their shareholders to maximize shareholder value, including through strategic tax planning,\u201d he wrote, pushing MacGillis to drop the issue. The\u00a0New Republic\u00a0later published a piece describing Cook\u2019s coming out as \u201cinspirational,\u201d particularly when \u201c[t]he corporate world in America is still male-dominated, and predominately white.\u201d<br/>The left\u2019s hypocrisy is one thing, but conservatives are walking a fine line of their own. The backlash to identity politics and the rise of nationalist rhetoric could presage an embrace of a more egalitarian and pro-worker economic vision, or it could reflect a backlash to multiculturalism per se, amid the demographic twilight of America\u2019s white majority. Attacks on Big Tech could be about issues of market power and consumer rights, or could boil down to petty grievances over liberal bias. Opposition to financialization could signal increased support for tangible sectors like manufacturing, or it could provide populist cover for a conventional, less-than-populist agenda of tax cuts and deregulation. The path the conservative movement takes will depend on which ideas and leaders succeed in the years ahead.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REDISCOVERING HISTORY</emphasis><br/>If nothing else, conservatives are compelled to become more genuinely conservative. An element of Burkean pragmatism has always received lip service from the American right but was hard to square with initiatives like Social Security privatization and foreign-policy adventurism. As economist and scholar of institutional development Peter Murrell notes, \u201c[S]hock therapy is nothing less than a revolutionary strategy for the complete reconstruction of the economic arrangements of a country.\u201d And what could be more conservative than opposing revolution?<br/>In retrospect, the era of the neoliberal \u201cWashington consensus\u201d looks like an aberration. The Cold War demanded unanimous faith in the American system, compressing elite ideology around a continuum that ranged from the classical liberalism of Locke to the high liberalism of Rawls. Without a clear external threat, and with liberal democracy appearing more dysfunctional than ever, that spectrum has blown open to include modern Jacobins and Jacobites alike.<br/>It would not be the end of the world if American political alignments looked more like European ones. But it would be a travesty if the failures of neoliberalism took \u201csmall-l\u201d liberalism down with them. Free markets and international trade really have helped produce unprecedented levels of peace and prosperity the world over. But for liberalism to survive, it must reckon with past mistakes and commit to transcending its Ricardian vice. That starts with revisiting the methodological dispute that engendered the vice in the first place.<br/>At the end of the 19th century, classical economists were locked in a heated debate over the appropriate role of theory versus history in the study of human action. On the side of theory, the Austrian economist Carl Menger argued that economists should reason from first principles to produce general laws of social science. As products of a priori deduction, economic laws would hold universally and across a range of historical circumstances. This methodological statement came to define the emerging Austrian school of economics, but has had an immense influence on the self-conception of mainstream, neoclassical economists as well.<br/>Against the Austrians was the German historical school, a largely forgotten tradition outside of household names like Max Weber and Joseph Schumpeter. The historicists were every bit as liberal as their positivist counterparts, but perhaps for that very reason distrusted theories that were not derived from historical experience. The German political economist Gustav von Schmoller, considered the leader of the school, defended an inductive approach to social science, informed by a careful, comparative study of how institutions evolve and the \u201cethical communities\u201d in which they are embedded.<br/>Schmoller\u2019s works were rarely translated into English, but were widely read in Japan, having been translated by legal scholars at the University of Tokyo decades before the Second World War. Japan adapted the historical school\u2019s insights to its postwar reconstruction, leading to a development model that paired rapid industrialization with cultural conservation. In fact, the historical school was influential on reformers throughout Northeast Asia. As Joe Studwell argues in his study of the Asian growth miracle,\u00a0How Asia Works, South Korea\u2019s success owes as much to its close reading of Friedrich List, the scholar of America\u2019s 19th-century industrial policy and predecessor to the historical school, as it does to Adam Smith.<br/>While the historicists were liberal reformers, their approach was fundamentally conservative in temperament. Evolutionary, bottom-up institution building took the place of shock therapy; social order took the place of revolution. Of course, this perspective can take pathological forms, too, as the suppression of peaceful demonstrations in Hong Kong reminds us. But as in all things, virtue lies in moderation, and thus the need to reconcile order with chaos, tradition with reform, creation with destruction.<br/>For American conservatives, a commitment to history will always retain a kernel of the founders\u2019 revolutionary spirit. But in the long shadow of PNTR, it\u2019s clear that our old doctrines about trade and development have failed in practice, even if they worked in theory. For free trade to be truly positive-sum, for example, experience shows that labor markets must be buttressed with robust re-employment supports and continuous investments in a wide variety of human capital. In other words, the demand side matters just as much as the supply side.<br/>Likewise, our financial system may excel at matching savers with investors, but it can over-optimize investments around existing production possibilities. This \u201callocative efficiency\u201d comes at the expense of \u201cinnovative efficiency,\u201d like an organism narrowly adapted to a static environment. As Schumpeter famously argued, fundamental innovation rarely arises from perfect competition, and instead depends on decisive investments that coordinate market actors around a new technological frontier.<br/>Demand curves still slope down, from Boston to Beijing. Nonetheless, by re-grounding economics in history, conservatives can reconstruct an economic agenda that begins with markets as embedded in, and mediated by, our shared institutions. The exact contents of that agenda will no doubt be a matter of intense debate for years to come, but in some ways that\u2019s the point: Abstractions can help create consensus, but in so doing disguise the hard work of statecraft?\u2014?a muscle that, if not flexed, will atrophy.<br/>Samuel Hammond is the director of poverty and welfare policy for the Niskanen Center.<br/>The post Op-Ed: The China Shock Doctrine appeared first on Niskanen Center.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-77771</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7C-0JC1-JBJN-M4JP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5266\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Niskanen, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Niskanen Center</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 8, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>In the News</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Print</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp;

Yet the San Francisco Board of Supervisors is considering legislation to significantly       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://limit the ability of law enforcement to fight crime with video cameras\">limit the ability of law enforcement to fight crime with video cameras</url>. It also bans any use of facial recognition technology by the city.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Concerned residents should contact their supervisor and ask them to rethink this legislation. </p><p>The so-called \"<url normalizedValue=\"http://Stop Secret Surveillance Ordinance\">Stop Secret Surveillance Ordinance</url>\" might sound good to a public that is more concerned than ever about privacy. And we can't pretend that facial recognition technology is perfect, especially when it has trouble properly identifying people of color. The American Civil Liberties Union found that Amazon's software       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://mismatched 28 members\">mismatched 28 members</url> of Congress with mug shots in a criminal database. The FBI's facial recognition technology had a 14 percent failure rate as of 2016, according to a U.S. General Accounting Office       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://report\">report</url>. </p><p>But is a ban the best action? Technology is always improving. Refinements that address today's shortcomings could make facial recognition a useful security tool when deployed in conjunction with well-crafted public policy. A ban precludes any thoughtful regulation: It's just throwing the baby out with the bathwater.</p><p>The proposed legislation also effectively keeps the city from using traditional security video. The expense and burden of the required audits and reports - not to mention approval from the full Board of Supervisors - would make it nearly impossible to set up a city-operated security camera in San Francisco.</p><p>The proposed ordinance is rooted in good intentions, however. San Francisco champions personal freedom over government control like nowhere else because San Franciscans don't want to compromise civil liberties in the quest for public safety. For example, the People's Republic of China relies on video surveillance in a way that San Francisco could never tolerate. </p><p>Yet we must find a balance between Beijing and San Francisco extremes to enjoy both safety and freedom. This proposed legislation will create a cascade of unintended consequences, given the importance of video footage in crime cases.</p><p>Valuable video footage, such as that which captured the 2017 murder of photographer Ed French on Twin Peaks, could determine justice. Such footage might not exist in future cases if the ordinance curtails the use of city-operated cameras.</p><p>What about cameras on private homes and businesses? The proposed law requires the city to develop a use policy and receive Board of Supervisors approval before \"entering into agreement with a non-city entity to acquire, share, or otherwise use surveillance technology.\" This broad language could restrict the city from using information provided by an outside source that doesn't adhere to our policies or uses technology we ban.</p><p>The greater danger is in the difficulty San Francisco would have partnering with other law enforcement agencies. The politically charged Board of Supervisors would have to approve every instance of cooperation. The law has an exception that allows the city to use surveillance technology in emergencies for seven days. But is that enough time to thwart a terrorist attack?</p><p>Beyond cameras, the ordinance broadly applies to other essential public safety tools, including license-plate readers, gunshot-detection hardware, DNA-capture technology and radio-frequency-ID scanners.

Yet the San Francisco Board of Supervisors is considering legislation to significantly limit the ability of law enforcement to fight crime with video cameras. It also bans any use of facial recognition technology by the city.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Concerned residents should contact their supervisor and ask them to rethink this legislation.</p><p> The so-called \"Stop Secret Surveillance Ordinance\" might sound good to a public that is more concerned than ever about privacy. And we can't pretend that facial recognition technology is perfect, especially when it has trouble properly identifying people of color. The American Civil Liberties Union found that Amazon's software mismatched 28 members of Congress with mug shots in a criminal database. The FBI's facial recognition technology had a 14 percent failure rate as of 2016, according to a U.S. General Accounting Office report.</p><p> But is a ban the best action? Technology is always improving. Refinements that address today's shortcomings could make facial recognition a useful security tool when deployed in conjunction with well-crafted public policy. A ban precludes any thoughtful regulation: It's just throwing the baby out with the bathwater.</p><p> The proposed legislation also effectively keeps the city from using traditional security video. The expense and burden of the required audits and reports \u2014 not to mention approval from the full Board of Supervisors \u2014 would make it nearly impossible to set up a city-operated security camera in San Francisco.</p><p> The proposed ordinance is rooted in good intentions, however. San Francisco champions personal freedom over government control like nowhere else because San Franciscans don't want to compromise civil liberties in the quest for public safety. For example, the People's Republic of China relies on video surveillance in a way that San Francisco could never tolerate.</p><p> Yet we must find a balance between Beijing and San Francisco extremes to enjoy both safety and freedom. This proposed legislation will create a cascade of unintended consequences, given the importance of video footage in crime cases.</p><p> Valuable video footage, such as that which captured the 2017 murder of photographer Ed French on Twin Peaks, could determine justice. Such footage might not exist in future cases if the ordinance curtails the use of city-operated cameras.</p><p> What about cameras on private homes and businesses? The proposed law requires the city to develop a use policy and receive Board of Supervisors approval before \"entering into agreement with a non-city entity to acquire, share, or otherwise use surveillance technology.\" This broad language could restrict the city from using information provided by an outside source that doesn't adhere to our policies or uses technology we ban.</p><p> The greater danger is in the difficulty San Francisco would have partnering with other law enforcement agencies. The politically charged Board of Supervisors would have to approve every instance of cooperation. The law has an exception that allows the city to use surveillance technology in emergencies for seven days. But is that enough time to thwart a terrorist attack?</p><p> Beyond cameras, the ordinance broadly applies to other essential public safety tools, including license-plate readers, gunshot-detection hardware, DNA-capture technology and radio-frequency-ID scanners. It would even affect the body cameras worn by police officers.</p><p> As nearby cities use the technology we seek to ban and limit, criminals will commute to San Francisco as the place where they can conduct their criminal activities unnoticed. They already flock to San Francisco to break into cars because they think our judges and prosecutors don't take property crime as seriously as other cities.</p><p> While it's noble to protect people from the failings of facial recognition technology, this proposed law goes too far with traditional security video.</p><p> Neighborhood groups and individuals can also join the advocacy work of Stop Crime SF, which facilitates the installation of video cameras on merchant corridors and heavily trafficked tourist areas.</p><p> Standing against Big Brother and Big Tech is politically popular, but supervisors need to know their constituents understand that making good law requires attention to nuance.</p><p> Joel P. Engardio is vice president of Stop Crime SF and the Court Watch program, a coalition of San Francisco residents and neighborhoods focused on crime prevention and criminal justice accountability.

Rather than relying on sound economic or antitrust reasons, these candidates are appealing to people's political fears. But such policies would be harmful to American consumers in a number of ways. Let's count them:</p><p> 1. For decades, antitrust enforcement has focused on costs and benefits to consumers. Many innovation economy companies have provided valuable services to consumers at low cost, frequently driving the prices of goods lower. Some of the most valuable services \u2014 such as search engines and access to social media \u2014 have been free.</p><p> 2. The innovation economy is vibrant and competitive. The economic graveyard is littered with companies that once seemed dominant, but died for failing to keep up with consumer demand. If consumers are not being hurt, the government should let competition decide whether companies rise or fall, succeed or fail.</p><p> 3. Sen. Warren has not presented much logic for her technology proposal other than she does not like successful innovation economy employers. These companies became big and successful because they were meeting the needs of consumers and customers, including, ironically, those of Sen. Warren.</p><p> 4. Regulation of privacy concerns should be addressed with focused legislation that applies to a broader group of companies. Privacy challenges should not be addressed with antitrust regulation of a few, very successful innovation economy companies.</p><p> 5. All industries should operate fairly and in a way that allows open competition. We should avoid blanket statements that suggest improper business practices absent clear evidence.</p><p> 6. All companies should be viewed on a case-by-case basis. Instead of a one-size-fits-all standard, we should work within existing antitrust laws, which apply to all industries and actively prevent collusion, restraint of trade, and monopolies.</p><p> 7. Sen. Warren's proposal assumes that if the government starts breaking up big companies, in the future that process will proceed without purely political motivations. That assumption should not be made.</p><p> 8. Companies that Sen. Warren has talked about breaking up have not been in business very long. They have grown rapidly because they have continued to innovate and serve customers while offering many services that did not exist until recently. If they stop meeting customer needs, then customers will select other services.</p><p> 9. If the reward for business success in America is destruction of a company \u2014 determined through political campaigns and not the marketplace \u2014 that's a chilling message for future entrepreneurs. They will believe that the more successful their innovations are, the more likely they are to have politicians and government bureaucrats decide their future, not their customers.</p><p> 10. Europe provides an example of many advanced economies that are heavily regulated. These countries do not have the global business leadership of the U.S.</p><p> America's innovation economy is the envy of the Earth. It benefits customers and consumers through innovation and job creation.</p><p> Relentless attacks motivated by polling and politics may gain headlines. In the meantime, innovators and entrepreneurs will continue to make headway in meeting the needs of our customers and consumers.</p><p> Carl Guardino is CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, a consortium of nearly 350 innovation economy employers ranging from struggling start-ups to global iconic brands.</p><p> We invite you to express your views in a letter to the editor.

Then Apple and Microsoft. And now Facebook. At this point, it seems easier to list tech companies that haven't been caught eavesdropping on their customers \u2014 through smart speakers, Skype, Facebook Messenger and more. The five companies named could affect more than 3 billion users.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In case it's not already clear, let me spell it out: Big Tech will violate your privacy until they're caught red-handed \u2014 and then do it again.</p><p> I don't know what I find more disappointing: that these companies are caught misusing consumer data \u2014 or that the general public no longer seems outraged by it. We seem to have become apathetic about such intrusions, having gone from \"How could they do this?\" to \"Oh, they did it again?\"</p><p> Perhaps it's because we read about a major data breach every other week. Or it could be because we have normalized the idea of tech companies selling your data to advertisers: If a service is free of charge to the user, of course the user is the product. But while it's true that targeted advertising pays for many of these services, it's a leap to say we should accept being spied on.</p><p> So what should you do about it? Danah Boyd, the founder of the Data &amp; Society Research Institute, put it best when she said that our information is \"public by default, private through effort.\" The greatest threat isn't that tech companies will continue collecting and misusing our data, though they will. It's that we will become passive, accept it as the new normal, and do nothing about it.</p><p> If the companies cannot refrain from abusing our data, then the onus is on users to protect themselves. We don't share our ATM personal identification numbers because we don't want others to know our financial history. We have curtains and blinds because we don't want people looking into our homes. Why should it be different when it comes to our online data and privacy?</p><p> Maybe it's because for most people, the effort \u2014 to change how they search, shop, connect with others, and consume content \u2014 is just too great.</p><p> So start small: Check your privacy settings, turn off microphones and cameras on your apps and devices when they're not in use, and do the same for the less tech-savvy people in your life. These are the first steps toward a true digital privacy reckoning.</p><p> Let's not be tricked into thinking the problem is too deeply entrenched for individuals to solve. We should all speak up as citizens to demand legislation that protects consumer privacy. Push for laws that give individuals, not Big Tech, ownership and control of data.</p><p> Make it mandatory for companies to get opt-in consent before collecting, storing or using any customer data. Mandate clear and simple terms of service that consumers can actually read and understand. (A study by my company showed that over 80% of Americans don't read the terms of service. That needs to change.) Make sure consumers can find out what data companies have gathered about them, how they got it, what they did with it, and with whom they have shared it.</p><p> If we throw our hands up in despair, the tech giants will have succeeded in fundamentally undermining our right to privacy. Starting somewhere small is better than doing nothing at all. The future truly becomes bleak only when we stop wanting to take control of our data.</p><p> I am reminded of the arguments made in the 1990s against the \"Do Not Call\" list. Consumers were annoyed by the proliferation of intrusive calls to their homes, but telemarketers argued that they gave them opportunities to hear about great deals and products. Once the regulation passed, though, people signed up for the list in droves. It became obvious that industry malpractice could be fixed with consumer action and a little help from lawmakers.</p><p> If we push for strong consumer data protections today, I believe we can have similar hopes for the future of privacy.</p><p> Harold Li is a vice president of the online security company ExpressVPN.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-6011b591d366247b8b783128e4c28cf2d498e34</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WX5-RGF1-DXVP-V3JS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"656\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Then Apple and Microsoft. And now Facebook. At this point, it seems easier to list tech companies that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">haven't</emphasis> been caught eavesdropping on their customers - through smart speakers, Skype, Facebook Messenger and more. The five companies named could affect more than 3 billion users.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In case it's not already clear, let me spell it out: Big Tech will violate your privacy until they're caught red-handed - and then do it again.</p><p>I don't know what I find more disappointing: that these companies are caught misusing consumer data - or that the general public no longer seems outraged by it. We seem to have become apathetic about such intrusions, having gone from \"How could they do this?\" to \"Oh, they did it again?\"</p><p>Perhaps it's because we read about a major data breach every other week. Or it could be because we have normalized the idea of tech companies selling your data to advertisers: If a service is free of charge to the user, of course the user is the product. But while it's true that targeted advertising pays for many of these services, it's a leap to say we should accept being spied on.</p><p>So what should you do about it? Danah Boyd, the founder of the Data &amp; Society Research Institute, put it best when she said that our information is \"public by default, <url normalizedValue=\"http://private through effort\">private through effort</url>.\" The greatest threat isn't that tech companies will continue collecting and misusing our data, though they will. It's that we will become passive, accept it as the new normal, and do nothing about it.</p><p>If the companies cannot refrain from abusing our data, then the onus is on users to protect themselves. We don't share our ATM personal identification numbers because we don't want others to know our financial history. We have curtains and blinds because we don't want people looking into our homes. Why should it be different when it comes to our online data and privacy?</p><p>Maybe it's because for most people, the effort - to change how they search, shop, connect with others, and consume content - is just too great. </p><p>So start small: Check your privacy settings, turn off microphones and cameras on your apps and devices when they're not in use, and do the same for the less tech-savvy people in your life. These are the first steps toward a true digital privacy reckoning.</p><p>Let's not be tricked into thinking the problem is too deeply entrenched for individuals to solve. We should all speak up as citizens to demand legislation that protects consumer privacy. Push for laws that give individuals, not Big Tech, ownership and control of data. </p><p>Make it mandatory for companies to get opt-in consent before collecting, storing or using any customer data. Mandate clear and simple terms of service that consumers can actually read and understand. A study by my company showed that <url normalizedValue=\"http://over 80% of Americans\">over 80% of Americans</url> don't read the terms of service. That needs to change. Make sure consumers can find out what data companies have gathered about them, how they got it, what they did with it, and with whom they have shared it.</p><p>If we throw our hands up in despair, the tech giants will have succeeded in fundamentally undermining our right to privacy. Starting somewhere small is better than doing nothing at all. The future truly becomes bleak only when we stop wanting to take control of our data.</p><p>I am reminded of the arguments made in the 1990s against the \"Do Not Call\" list. Consumers were annoyed by the proliferation of intrusive calls to their homes, but telemarketers argued that they gave them opportunities to hear about great deals and products. Once the regulation passed, though, people signed up for the list in droves. It became obvious that industry malpractice could be fixed with consumer action and a little help from lawmakers. </p><p>If we push for strong consumer data protections today, I believe we can have similar hopes for the future of privacy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A man walks past a sign on the Facebook campus in Menlo Park. </p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SFCHRN-B613951145Z</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SFCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WX6-9591-JC8F-517V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8172</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"642\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 San Francisco Chronicle All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Francisco Chronicle (California)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4092\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 23, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

So the Conservative party election manifesto, published on Sunday, was cause for hope in at least some respects. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said that his think-tank would have described the tax and spending proposals in it \u201cmodest\u201d for a single-year budget. \u201cAs a blueprint for five years in government the lack of significant policy action is remarkable\u201d, <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/TheIFS/status/1198644916529901568\"> he said</url>.</p><p>To the extent there were plans set out, they generally were regarded as \u201cpro-enterprise\u201d, our chief corporate correspondent reports. There is a \u201cfundamental review\u201d of business rates promised along with extra support for small businesses. Downsides \u2014 the shelving of a planned cut to corporation tax and a digital service tax targeting big tech \u2014 are seen as minimal compared to the perceived threat of Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell (more on which below).</p><p>There were grumbles about the manifesto being \u201clight on business\u201d, and on detail. But, despite the Conservatives\u2019 commitment to Brexit, plans which leave business well alone are likely to be far more welcome than plans to nationalise utilities and impose employee part-ownership of large companies.</p><p>Briefly</p><p>It\u2019s decision day for <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Uber</emphasis>. The ride-hailing company\u2019s licence to operate in London expires at midnight on Monday night. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Transport for London</emphasis> is set to rule on whether to renew it on Monday, and frantic negotiations were continuing over the weekend. TfL only renewed the licence for two months in September \u2014 an unexpectedly short period \u2014 and has form in denying Uber the right to operate. In 2017 after scandals at the company, TfL determined Uber was not a \u201cfit and proper person\u201d to operate in the UK capital. Uber overturned that decision in June 2018, but has been stuck with increasingly strict conditions on its licence since.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Just Eat</emphasis> has sent its formal rebuttal to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prosus\u2019s</emphasis> hostile takeover offer to shareholders, urging them to take no action. The takeaway ordering platform\u2019s share price currently stands around 753p a share, which doesn\u2019t exactly make the cash offer from Prosus, the Amsterdam-listed arm of Naspers, of 710p look appealing as it is. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Takeaway.com</emphasis>\u2018s rival bid is in shares.</p><p>The (predictable) backlash from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UK investors</emphasis> over dual class shares is here. Downing Street looked at allowing the structures for London-listed companies as a way to attract more high-growth tech groups, which have proved stubbornly resistant to the entreaties of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">London Stock Exchange</emphasis>. With many big investors now able to invest in private companies as well as public ones, however, they\u2019re less keen to see standards on public markets slip. WeWork has also served up a reminder of the dangers of founder control. Investors described dual-class stock as \u201cthe scourge of corporate governance\u201d and \u201csmack against everything the corporate governance code stands for\u201d.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Grid</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SSE</emphasis> aren\u2019t waiting around. It\u2019s still almost three weeks until the earliest possible date that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn could be installed in Number 10. But the energy networks have already moved large parts of their UK operations into offshore holding companies to defend against the risk of nationalisation by a Labour government. SSE has shifted its UK networks arm into a Swiss holding company while National Grid\u2019s UK business has been put into holding companies in Luxembourg and Hong Kong, in moves that were first reported by the Sunday Times.</p><p>Job moves</p><p>The hiring spree at the UK\u2019s accounting watchdog continues. The <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Financial Reporting Council</emphasis> has recruited the former director of investigations at the Financial Conduct Authority, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jamie Symington</emphasis>, as the body tries to recover from criticism it is too close to the industry it regulates. Mr Symington served nearly two decades at the FCA before joining the London office of Brown Rudnick. His work at the regulator included high-profile investigations into Barclays arrangements with Qatar during the financial crisis.</p><p>Beyond the Square Mile</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tiffany</emphasis> has officially said \u201cyes\u201d to a $16.6bn proposal from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LVMH</emphasis>. The largest-ever luxury deal will see Europe\u2019s richest man Bernard Arnault take control of the American jeweller for an equity value of $16.2bn, plus $350m of debt. Tiffany\u2019s brand has been tarnished somewhat in recent years, falling from the top rank of global luxury. LVMH will probably seek to restore its former lustre, with the acquisition deepening the conglomerate\u2019s presence in jewellery.

Since 2016, large foreign banks have been forced to move most of their US operations into something called intermediate holding companies or IHCs. Four European banks \u2014 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Deutsche Bank</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Credit Suisse</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UBS</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Barclays</emphasis> \u2014 have reduced assets in their IHCs by more than 34 per cent in the last three years.</p><p>When Taylor Swift wrote to her 200m followers on social media last week as part of a bitter dispute with her record company she mentioned <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carlyle Group</emphasis> by name. \u201cI\u2019m especially asking for help from The Carlyle Group, who put up money for the sale of my music.\u201d The private equity group is one of a number of investors that are flocking to the music industry as revenues from streaming help it rebound from a 15-year slump. But what is less quantifiable than the revenues from streaming is the cost of celebrity drama.</p><p>Closing quote \u2014 essential comment before you go</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Hill</emphasis> The opportunity to play with small coloured Lego bricks for an afternoon was an appealing alternative to more conventional conference panels and talks organised by the Global Peter Drucker Forum.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Patrick Jenkins</emphasis> The TSB farrago shows that banks need more tech knowhow on boards.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thanks for reading.

Capacity in the first half of the year will only increase 1.5 per cent rather than the 1.7 per cent expected. Fuel is another headwind. But overall, the direction of travel is positive. Revenue per seat (the key industry performance metric) for the first half, which ends in March, will be better than previously thought.\u00a0</p><p>Revenues were boosted by a number of operational improvements, including sorting out its German hub. Constrained capacity growth helped support prices. Passengers also proved willing to shell out for bags and allocated seats. Finally Thomas Cook's administration provided a helping hand. Total group revenue increased 9.9 per cent to \u00a31.43bn, with ancillary growth about 1 percentage point ahead of passenger revenue. Easyjet still expects to make a first half headline loss.

Now, as it reports its full-year results in the wake of that \u00a3250m capital raise, it still looks far from saved.</p><p>Turnrounds are an expensive business, it turns out. A year ago Kier posted pre-tax profits of \u00a3106m. This year losses were \u00a3245m. Much of that was the cost of getting better.</p><p>Kier took \u00a3341m in charges, including \u00a356m in restructuring costs and \u00a3172m related to selling operations or getting divisions ready for sale or closure (it is in talks to sell its residential housebuilding division Kier Living). It is leaking cash: \u00a334m over the past year, and \u00a332m in the next seven years. Kier did its rights issue to help with its net debt, which had soared to \u00a3624m at the end of last October. But the average month end net debt was still \u00a3422m for the year to June, though net debt at year end of \u00a3167m was 10 per cent lower than last year. Cost savings of \u00a355m a year won't come through until the 2021 financial year.</p><p>Kier has new management in place, and will soon have a new chairman. Its current chair <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Philip Cox</emphasis>, has told the board he wants to step down once they find him a successor, the company said today.</p><p>The company says it is \"building firm foundations for the future\". It is executing a plan to \"future proof Kier\" and concluded at a strategic review in June it needed to improve cash generation and reduce net debt, among other things. Shareholders will hope achieving that gets cheaper.</p><p>Briefly</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Saga</emphasis> is also in the midst of an epic transformation. It announced in April it was overhauling its insurance business, as a more internet-savvy generation of over-50s rebelled against buying expensive insurance from a brand they associated with their elderly parents. Saga's cruise business was its big hope. That too is struggling. Brexit uncertainty has hit customer demand. Profits for the first half of the year halved from the same time a year ago. Saga is sticking to its full-year guidance of underlying pre-tax profits of between \u00a3105m-\u00a3120m \u2013 but it's still missing a chief executive to steer the ship, and cruise ships aren't exactly easy to manoeuvre.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Next</emphasis> is looking much sprightlier for an ageing former mail-order retailer. It has successfully made the shift online. Bricks and mortar stores are now the smallest part of its profits after a 24 per cent year-on-year fall, after online and finance. Shops, at \u00a356m, now make less than a third of the amount of profit as internet sales (\u00a3177m). Pre-tax profits were 4 per cent at \u00a3327m for the half-year to July, while statutory sales were 2.7 per cent higher.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KPMG UK</emphasis> is planning to make about a third of its 630 administrative assistants redundant as part of a wave of cost-cutting. Between 200 and 250 administrative support staff are expected to leave in the savings drive at the Big Four accounting firm. The restructuring means some partners, particularly in non-client facing roles, will no longer have access to a personal assistant. Partners are also being encouraged to file their own expenses as part of the changes \u2014 perish the thought.</p><p>Finally, after wreaking havoc on the global news industry, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google </emphasis>is investing \u201cseveral million dollars\u201d into a joint venture with a British local news publisher. The venture called Project Neon will be fully funded by Google but controlled by\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Archant</emphasis>, the Norwich-based publisher behind the Eastern Daily Press and several local titles in London. Read the full story\u00a0 here.</p><p>Job moves</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Just Group</emphasis> has made its interim chief executive permanent.\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Richardson</emphasis> took over the role when\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rodney Cook</emphasis> quit in April after a turbulent year for the life insurance company. Mr Richardson said he was \"delighted\".</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">We're looking to feature more job moves. If you're in senior management and moving jobs or you know someone who is, let us know about it at\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>Beyond the Square Mile</p><p>Big Tech is facing the prospect of broad sectoral regulation that goes well beyond the narrow antitrust focus that has defined government interest in the industry in recent decades, according to Brad Smith,\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis>\u2019s president and top lawyer. Speaking in an interview this week, Mr Smith, who joined Microsoft in 1993, predicted a return to a period when government set broad rules governing how particular industry sectors operate \u2014 rather than focusing on individual cases of economic harm caused by monopolists.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FedEx</emphasis> shares plunged 13 per cent on Wednesday \u2014 wiping lost about $6bn off its market value \u2014 after the logistics group reported its weakest sales growth in a decade and alarmed investors with a gloomy assessment of the global economy. FedEx, which handles more than 15m shipments each day, predicted annual world trade volumes would contract this year for the first time since 2009.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Deutsche Bank</emphasis> is paying \u20ac50m for a 4.9 per cent stake in open-banking start-up Deposit Solutions in a transaction that values the Hamburg-based start-up at more than \u20ac1bn ($1.1bn). The deal turns Deposit Solutions, whose software allows banks to collect deposits from people across Europe who are not their direct customers, into Germany\u2019s second most highly valued fin-tech after Berlin-based lender N26.\u00a0 Read more.</p><p>Closing quote \u2014 essential comment before you go</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Royal Air Farce </emphasis>Ministers should permit the takeover of Cobham, founded by Sir Alan Cobham (pictured), with some important stipulations: the refuelling arm, its intellectual property and some other defence businesses must stay in the UK. The model would be the US defence unit of BAE Systems, says Lex and our Due Diligence newsletter takes a deeper look at government reviews in M&amp;A.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Mackenzie</emphasis> Many will recall that troubles in the repo market, where banks and investors borrow cash overnight using Treasuries as collateral, were a symptom of funding problems for investment banks in 2008. This week's action by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u00a0 is not the current situation but ultimately it means the US Federal Reserve will have to resume buying more Treasury debt.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thanks for reading.

But up to now Lloyds has offset weakness in the mortgage market with growth in higher-returning areas such as unsecured consumer lending. A previously announced \u00a32.5bn charge related to payment protection insurance also weighed on its returns.\u00a0</p><p>Briefly\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Diageo\u00a0</emphasis>has been fined\u00a0 $5m by the US securities regulator after \u201cmaterially misleading\u201d investors about demand for its drinks by concealing sales of unwanted stock to distributors. The Securities and Exchange Commission said the North American arm of the world\u2019s largest spirits maker had been charged with violating securities law by failing to disclose key information to shareholders.</p><p>The soaring price of palladium helped\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anglo American\u00a0</emphasis>report better than expected\u00a0 annual results on Thursday. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation \u2014 the figure most closely watched by analysts \u2014 rose 9 per cent to $10bn, roughly $100m higher than consensus forecasts.</p><p>Job moves\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Katharine Poulter</emphasis>, current chief operating officer of Laura Ashley, has been appointed as chief executive officer with immediate effect. Ms. Poulter has 25 years of retail experience with companies including Marks and Spencer, Home Retail Group, Kingfisher, Habitat and Wilko. She succeeds Kwan Cheong Ng who will become a non-executive director. The retailer also reported widening losses and falling sales for the 26 weeks to December 31.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Axa</emphasis> has replaced the head of Axa XL, the business created in 2018 after the French group bought Bermuda-based XL.\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Hendrick</emphasis>, who had been chief operating officer of XL Group and stayed on to lead the business after the deal, will be replaced by\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scott Gunter</emphasis> who joins from rival insurer Chubb.</p><p>Beyond the Square Mile\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UBS\u00a0</emphasis>has appointed ING chief executive Ralph Hamers (pictured above) to replace Sergio Ermotti, one of Europe's longest-serving bank bosses. Mr Hamers will take over on November 1 from Mr Ermotti, who has spent almost nine years turning round the Swiss lender after it was bailed out during the financial crisis and creating the world\u2019s largest wealth manager with $2.6tn in assets.</p><p>Big tech companies\u00a0 will be forced to open up their troves of data to smaller rivals, the European Commission has said, just as financial services companies already do. The proposals are aimed at breaking apart monopolies such as\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon\u00a0</emphasis>and\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google</emphasis> but are likely to add to the growing sense of US irritation that Europe is picking on its tech champions.</p><p>French prosecutors have\u00a0 ratcheted up their investigation into the alleged misuse of funds at Renault by Carlos Ghosn, the carmaker\u2019s former boss and fugitive from Japanese authorities. The Nanterre prosecutor\u2019s office said in a statement on Wednesday evening that it had opened a probe into suspicious financial flows linked to Renault by an unnamed person, including the abuse of corporate assets, abuse of trust and money laundering between 2009 and 2020.</p><p>Closing quote \u2014 essential comment before you go</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lex</emphasis><br/>The bet by Britain's best known hedge fund manager Crispin Odey on the eccentric Yorkshire mining venture Sirius Minerals highlights a declining trend among investors \u2014\u00a0 stock picking.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lombard\u00a0</emphasis><br/>Metro\u2019s new broom has more\u00a0 mess to sweep up than most, following the departure of chairman Vernon Hill amid a toxic combination of accounting whoopsies and governance worries.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-78283c2c53bc11ea90ad25e377c0ee1f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y80-0C71-JB77-K0P3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"649\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 20, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002CUN</classCode><className>AXA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000D2U3</classCode><className>TALLGRASS ENERGY CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009RX8</classCode><className>HOME RETAIL GROUP PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0001WLY</classCode><className>MARKS &amp;

The budget airline says it is \"trying to avoid the unreliable optimism of some competitors\". It has narrowed the window for full-year profit growth. Whereas at its quarterly results it estimated profit after tax would be between \u20ac750m and \u20ac950m, now it reckons the figure will be between \u20ac800m and \u20ac900m. Last year post-tax profits were \u20ac1.02bn.\u00a0</p><p>Ryanair has been hit by the delayed arrival of the Boeing 737 Max planes, which promised increased fuel efficiency and so lower costs. Back in July, Ryanair\u00a0 cut its estimates for growth over the 2020 summer season as likely delivery dates for the planes became later and later. At that time it expected it might receive 30 planes before the summer; now the airline reckons it will get more like 20.\u00a0</p><p>Airlines have been under pressure for some time now from overcapacity, fuel prices and competition on fares. Ryanair has a characteristic solution to the latter: charge passengers for as many add-ons as you can. Fares fell 5 per cent in the six months to September, while ancillary revenues were up 16 per cent, leaving revenue per passenger 1 per cent higher. That should get better still through the rest of the year: full-year revenue per passenger should increase by 2-3 per cent. Overall in the first half of the year, profit after tax was \u20ac1.15bn, flat on last year, while revenues were 11 per cent higher as the number of passengers climbed.</p><p>Briefly</p><p>The nightmare before Christmas.\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KPMG</emphasis>'s latest cost-cutting measure will be to cut a tenth of its UK partners before the festive break, our accountancy correspondent\u00a0 reports. Around 45 partners leave every year anyway, either out of choice or because they're pushed into retirement. But this cull of around 65 partners is an unusual active step taken during the first few weeks of the firm's financial year as it battles to emerge from a reputational crisis. Twenty-five partners escape the chop, however: when a list of who would be let go was first drawn up by KPMG's chief operating officer, it had 90 names on it.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Woodford Patient Capital Trust</emphasis> has been forced into a yet another writedown. Link Fund Solutions, the fund's corporate director, is writing down the value of WPCT's stake in Industrial Heat, a cold fusion company that has been one of its most controversial holdings. The writedown \u2014 the\u00a0 second\u00a0 on that particular holding in three months \u2014 comes in the wake of Neil Woodford's resignation as manager.\u00a0 Schroders' appointment as manager can't come soon enough for investors.\u00a0</p><p>In other airline news,\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IAG</emphasis> has\u00a0 struck a deal\u00a0 to buy Spanish airline\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Air Europa</emphasis> from Globalia for \u20ac1bn in cash. IAG, which owns both\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">British Airways</emphasis> and\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Iberia</emphasis>, said the deal would transform its Madrid hub into a rival to Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Heathrow and Paris CDG and strengthen its position in Europe-LatAm and Caribbean routes.</p><p>Finally,\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mothercare</emphasis>'s UK business will go into administration today, though the listed company will still carry on trading. Mothercare says the UK retail operations of the group, which include 79 stores, can't return to a level of sustainable profitability as they are, and are not attractive enough for a third party partner to take on at arms length.</p><p>Job moves</p><p>Gambling group\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GVC</emphasis> has appointed retail veteran\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JM Barry Gibson</emphasis> as its new chairman. Currently, Gibson is chair of FTSE 250 group Homeserve. He will replace long-serving chairman\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lee Feldman</emphasis> in February.</p><p>Beyond the Square Mile</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">McDonald\u2019s</emphasis>\u00a0 has dumped its chief executive\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Steve Easterbrook</emphasis> after he engaged in a relationship with a colleague. Mr Easterbrook, a British accountant\u00a0 who has been credited with doubling the company\u2019s share price since becoming chief executive in March 2015, had demonstrated \"poor judgement\" in engaging in the consensual relationship with another McDonald\u2019s employee and had \"violated\" company policy, it said in a statement. The outgoing CEO will be replaced by Chris Kempczinski, previously president of McDonald\u2019s US business.</p><p>The launch of the initial public offering process for\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Saudi Aramco</emphasis> in Dhahran on Sunday was marked by a\u00a0 hard sell to Saudis who might be keen to have a slice of a national champion as well as foreign investors who are more sceptical about how Riyadh values the state energy company.\u00a0</p><p>Regulators are pressing\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Deutsche Bank</emphasis>\u2019s Christian Sewing to\u00a0 give up his dual role as chief executive and investment bank head because of fears his twin responsibilities could undermine the group\u2019s radical restructuring. The European Central Bank and German regulator BaFin warn there is a potential conflict of interest between the two roles and want them to be separated in the next year or two, according to three people familiar with internal discussions.</p><p>Closing quote \u2014 essential comment before you go</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Hill</emphasis><br/>Anecdotes and data, like Deloitte's\u00a0 latest survey of millennials and Generation Z, suggest young staff have similar aspirations to those of their counterparts of 15 or even 30 years ago. In other words, the job-hopping caricature \u2014 and indeed, much else about generational stereotyping \u2014\u00a0 does not stand up to scrutiny.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rana Foroohar</emphasis><br/>It has been a long time coming but\u00a0 the tide has finally turned against Big Tech.

That is a good thing: financial services regulation is complicated, there are lots of different parts to the industry which have different aims, and it needs attention. (If you\u2019re not up on what all the fuss is about, check out this handy explainer.)</p><p>It is early days. But things don\u2019t seem to be going well so far. The EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier warned the Brits not to \u201ckid themselves\u201d over hopes of securing permanent access to the bloc\u2019s markets. Treasury officials have insisted they didn\u2019t expect a permanent ruling, not least because the UK wants to diverge from EU rules. \u201cSelective equivalence\u201d, a piecemeal solution to secure access in some areas, may be the answer, says our Lex column\u2014 but don\u2019t expect that to keep everyone happy either.</p><p>Briefly </p><p>A Canadian investment group is listing a $350m healthcare fund in London. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DRI Capital</emphasis> is listing the DRI Healthcare closed-end investment company on the LSE.

Jonathan Fayman, Glen Point\u2019s co-chief investment officer, headed Stateside a couple of years back. But that was viewed as a possible mis-step by some people close to the firm. Last year Glen Point, which manages $2.5bn in assets, posted a 3.3 per cent loss in its main fund, after losing money with bets on Argentina. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Premier Oil</emphasis> is on course for a clash with a hedge fund that is attempting to block the company\u2019s refinancing and blockbuster acquisition on Wednesday. The oil group\u2019s lenders will vote on a plan to give it an extra 2.5 years of breathing space on its loans. That is set to pass, as hedge fund Asia Research and Capital Management has acknowledged. But the fund, which has a huge short position in Premier\u2019s stock, has vowed to continue the fight in court. </p><p>Also out on Wednesday are updates from FTSE 250 groups <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Plus500</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Babcock</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dunelm</emphasis>. </p><p>Job moves </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sainsbury\u2019s Bank</emphasis> is on the hunt for a new chair. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Roger Davis</emphasis> has told the board he plans to step down after almost seven years.

Earnings from its telecoms unit and other businesses helped offset unrealised losses at the $100bn Vision Fund, which has been hit by a soured investment in US office-sharing company WeWork. The results are the first since it emerged last week that $40bn hedge fund Elliott is pressing SoftBank for a $20bn share buyback and governance changes.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission has demanded information from the five largest US companies \u2014 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft</emphasis> \u2014 about acquisitions of smaller companies as part of a review into possible anti-competitive behaviour in the technology sector.

And thank you to the Bank Al-Maghrib - which is celebrating its 60th anniversary this year - for hosting this conference.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're pleased to join you here in Rabat, as we continue a series of conferences that we're convening this year in every region, worldwide. The purpose of our conferences is to promote broad discussions on - and develop a better understanding of - how our member countries are incorporating the high-level considerations proposed in the Bali Fintech Agenda in their national frameworks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Promoting progress in Fintech will surely be a daunting challenge for policymakers - as we aim to reap the potential benefits of new financial technologies, while also managing their risks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This conference will give us an opportunity to reflect on the relevance of the elements of the Bali Fintech Agenda (what we refer to as the \"BFA\") to each economy's conditions; to share experiences; to voice concerns and explore challenges; and to discuss various policy approaches.</p><p>Technological change, along with market developments, present us with a wide range of new options - and an array of new risks. With the BFA outlining an integrated approach, our task now is to adjust the policy framework in a comprehensive manner around these trends - aiming to grasp the full, positive potential of Fintech for the good of society.</p><p>The BFA started in response to the call - by many member countries of the World Bank Group and the IMF - to have a high-level conceptual framework that can tie together the many challenges inherent in the digitalization of financial services.</p><p>Maintaining the momentum of the BFA - after its launch last October at our Annual Meetings - the Bank and the Fund have already started to set this agenda into action.</p><p>We've already conducted a survey - with more than 100 responses - that will provide insights into how our membership sees the agenda's priorities. The survey results - combined with a summary of recent Fintech developments and regulatory responses - will soon be presented in a formal paper to our Executive Board. We are also furthering our understanding of Fintech issues through our dialogue with national authorities in the context of our Article IV consultation and FSAP reports. And we've been working closely with standard-setters in each of their respective areas.</p><p>In facing the challenges ahead, everyone has a role to play. Given the diversity within our global membership, the experiences of policymakers with Fintech vary widely. Some jurisdictions have been at the frontier, with pro-active and sometimes experimental proposals - while others, until now, have observed from the sidelines.</p><p>There are important public-sector initiatives underway that provide a sound footing for private-sector fintech activities - including payment-systems modernization in Egypt and Morocco. In other jurisdictions, including the UAE, legal frameworks are being constructed to ensure that fintech developments observe prudential principles. In the next two days, we hope to learn more about this.</p><p>We'll also discuss a very promising area, where Fintech seems ready to provide a major benefit to the region - promoting Financial Inclusion. Making financial services available to populations that now have little, or no, access to finance is a profoundly important priority in global development. Those services include making payments, as well as ensuring easier access to credit - through peer-to-peer networks, for example. Some countries in the region have made enormous strides in mobile payments, while others are still catching up.</p><p>Those benefits, however, are accompanied by new challenges. For instance: Since those broader types of access to financial services are provided by non-bank firms - such as telecom operators and lending platforms - new regulatory issues have arisen. Financial regulations, in the past, have been focused more on licensed institutions - principally, banks. So how should these new areas be regulated? And should there be relatively high barriers to entry to mitigate unknown risks -or does financial innovation require more flexible solutions, including regulatory sandboxes?</p><p>Amid today's discussions, we're looking forward to hearing your thoughts about the Financial Inclusion theme - as well additional issues in financial development. They include new ways of raising funds, managing risks, and prioritizing national development strategies. We're also mindful of ensuring that the new landscape is competitive, so that we can realize the full value of the new efficiencies promised by new technologies.7</p><p>Another opportunity that we'll discuss today - where the potential for cost savings and time efficiency is enormous - is cross-border payments. That includes remittances, which play a very significant role in the region. Banks currently play a major role in international money transfers - but banks' role is changing in light of new entrants, including telcos, Big Tech, and other firms. In the region, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are spearheading fintech initiatives to facilitate cross-border settlements.</p><p>This area includes a wide array of policy challenges that, by their nature, require a coordinated international framework. We must seek ways</p><p>to improve the payments infrastructure, to enable greater efficiency;</p><p>to broaden access to, and review the oversight of, this infrastructure to new entrants - and ensure the interoperability of systems to maximize the benefits of innovation;</p><p>to oversee and appropriately address the transformation of the banking business due to new technologies; and</p><p>to mitigate the risk of money laundering in the new payment channels.</p><p>In addition, some fundamental services of central banks relate to the issuance of currencies - specifically, the question of whether central banks should issue digital currencies (or \"CBDCs\"). According to a recent survey by the Bank for International Settlements: 70 percent of central banks are currently involved in - or soon will be involved in - this complex area, with one-third of them now seeing the issuance of CBDCs as likely.</p><p>In today's discussions, we'll explore the costs and benefits of CBDCs - along with the implications for \"banking as we know it.\" Panelists will delve into the implications of Fintech for providing central-bank services - as well as for developing robust data infrastructures, to address privacy and cyber risk concerns.</p><p>With all of these new developments occurring around us, we must also change what regulators and supervisors monitor and analyze. Classic prudential reporting frameworks, which rely on statutory powers, will need to be complemented by new data-collection frameworks. They must cover new entrants and new channels - and the legal basis for doing so, may not yet be in place.</p><p>Similarly, issues regarding the regulatory perimeter must be addressed. For example: What is the appropriate regulatory approach to crypto assets - and, more generally, to new products and activities? What are the stability implications - and, as we identify new risks, how can we mitigate them? Such adjustments should be embedded in strong institutional and legal frameworks that guarantee financial integrity.</p><p>After considering all of these issues: Our final session of the day, will be devoted to a roundtable, in which participants will be invited to share their experiences and ask further questions.</p><p>As we start developing our work program, to follow-up on the Bali Fintech Agenda, we can begin our efforts by taking three specific steps.</p><p>First: Given the comprehensive nature of these challenges, and these opportunities, it would certainly be useful for all jurisdictions to begin consultations with all of the relevant parties in this area - with central banks, regulators, and private-sector participants - to come up with country-specific approaches. Taking into account the comparative advantages and specific situations of each jurisdiction, the priorities are likely to differ from country to country, and the focus will have to shift to meet their specific needs. For some countries, AML/CFT issues may be the top priority; for others, financial inclusion may be the central concern; for still others, the leading priority may be infrastructure.</p><p>Second: Another concrete step would be to have regional consultations and cooperation efforts.</p><p>And third: We can commit ourselves to sharing knowledge, and to engaging in more events like this one, to reach beyond our own specific countries' conditions and concerns. Agreeing to pursue a robust program of publications by our respective institutions can be very helpful, as well, in promoting broader knowledge-exchange.</p><p>I'm looking forward to our discussions over the next two days, and I'll be eager to keep in touch with all of your institutions - as we move forward in the months to come, to advance this exciting agenda.</p><p>Before concluding, I should also mention that, as you may already know, the IMF and Morocco have started a broad partnership towards hosting the 2021 IMF Annual Meetings in Marrakesh. This conference is one of many events that will be organized in Morocco and the region to build momentum for this global event, and we are happy to have the Moroccan authorities as our partners.</p><p>Thank you once again for your participation, and for your warm welcome here in Rabat.</p><p>With that, I'll wish you well, hoping that we'll have productive discussions.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>SOURCE International Monetary Fund (IMF)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=20190313088&amp;Transmission_Id=201903130928PR_NEWS_AFPR____20190313088&amp;DateId=20190313\"/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRAF-2019031308820190313</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRAF2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMM-D9W1-DXP3-R05M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">407420</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1591\"/><timeReceived>9:28 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 PR Newswire Association LLC.
