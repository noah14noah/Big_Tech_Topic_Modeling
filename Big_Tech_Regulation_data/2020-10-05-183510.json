And then toss the garbage can through the window of a Facebook executive.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's an eye-opening look into the way social media is designed to create addiction and manipulate our behavior, told by some of the very people who supervised the systems at places like Facebook, Google and Twitter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tim Kendall, a former president of Pinterest, admitted that years ago he couldn't get off his phone even when he came home, despite having two young kids. \"I am going to work during the day and building something that then I'm falling prey to,\" he says in the film. \"I couldn't help myself.\"</p><p>The documentary is a well paced, absorbing look at the deep costs of Big Tech - fake news, election security concerns, radicalization, polarization and much more. Only in trying to dramatize those costs does it slip up badly. Director Jeff Orlowski interviews former tech execs, historians and social scientists but apparently doesn't trust them enough to tell the story.</p><p>So he also employs a gimmicky family of five actors - two parents, three teens - to dramatize the lure of social media in a clunky way.</p><p>Worse, he also employs an actor - a weirdly cast Vincent Kartheiser of \"Mad Men\" fame - to pretend to act like the computer software, sending alluring phone alerts from a console to one of the teens and cuing up videos he knows will be clickbait, while ominous music plays.</p><p>\"Yes, perfect,\" Kartheiser purrs after sending a video of epic skateboard fails to the teen. \"He's primed for an ad!\" Later: \"Don't show him any more sports updates. He doesn't engage.\"</p><p>But we know - from the very talking heads - that this is an algorithm with no agency other than its program. Why humanize code?</p><p>And why humanize code by portraying it as a sleazy middle-aged man who acts like a mid-level officer in \"Minority Report\"?</p><p>The film then steps on itself. When one of the fake teens falls for a fake online conspiracy and attends a fake demonstration, it's juxtaposed against real footage of real violence and real demonstrations, muddying the water between fake and real - a terrible decision given what this film is about.</p><p>Orlowski would have done better interviewing real teens buffeted by social media and real people caught up in conspiracies. Insulting our intelligence about artificial intelligence is not the way to go.</p><p>The silly dramatizations mar an otherwise excellent documentary that shows how so many Silicon Valley leaders designed ways to keep us engaged online and that led to such things as Pizzagate, international destabilization, higher suicide rates in young people and a boom in depression.</p><p>The film reveals much more than why you go from Googling the best sofa one minute to finding sofa ads on your Facebook stream the next.</p><p>That so much online seems free is part of the trap: It's our private data that's being sold. As Aza Raskin, former Firefox and Mozilla Lab worker says: \"Advertisers are the customers. We're the thing being sold.\"</p><p>The film nicely delves into how algorithms that seek to maximize advertising revenue tap into psychology to keep us addicted to our screens.</p><p>Did a friend just tag me? I got an alert!</p><p>Hey, Facebook just invited me to an event.</p><p>Those are all \"positive intermittent reinforcements\" and they keep us checking our phone for more, like a gambler hoping for a windfall at a Vegas slot machine.</p><p>Whether or not these techniques were actively employed, stumbled upon or just a byproduct of a user-engagement model is a little murky.</p><p>The film offers all sides as to whether software makers consciously exploit human vulnerabilities: The guy who helped create the \"like\" button for Facebook says he wanted to spread love in the world but a former Facebook executive admits purposely creating dopamine-driven feedback loops.</p><p>If there is a hero here it is portrayed by Tristan Harris, an ex-Google executive who is now co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology and who hopes to change the system.</p><p>He and critics like Jaron Lanier, author of \"Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now,\" explain what the possible consequences are if we continue using our individual digital pacifiers - lots of cat videos, yes, and also civil war.</p><p>Stick around after the film is over to hear lots of recommendations from former tech leaders who built the mess we're in: They turn off their notifications. They delete many apps. They urge regulation. They don't let their kids use social media. Think about that.</p><p>\"The Social Dilemma,\" a Netflix release, is rated PG-13 for some thematic elements, disturbing/violent images and suggestive material. Running time: 94 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Skyler Gisondo appears in a scene from \"The Social Dilemma.\"Netflix via AP</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKRI-091820B05art3xml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2897ED0E7A3C96 NWBKRI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W0-JM81-DXVP-V4BN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409758</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"789\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Westerly Sun, The (RI)<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Mr Corbyn suggested the tax, as well as a digital licence fee, would fund independent \"public interest journalism\", and would be enforced should the government fail to reach an agreement with big tech firms as France did with Google in 2013.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Former French President Francois Hollande and Google's ex-chief executive Eric Schmidt settled an ad revenue dispute with the creation of a \u00a352m fund to finance French digital publishing innovation. A similar deal was reached in Belgium after a six-year copyright battle in 2012. These settlements were hard-won, so it is far from certain whether they could be replicated between the tech titans and a new Labour government.</p><p>Corbyn's suggestion of a windfall tax must, then, be taken seriously - and he is by no means alone in a national chill towards American tech firms. Earlier this month, Treasury minister Mel Stride suggested a digital revenue levy on Google-owner Alphabet (US:GOOGL) and Facebook (US:FB.). In June, ITV's (ITV) chief executive Dame Carolyn McCall called for American tech giants to operate on a level tax and regulatory playing field in Britain.  </p><p>But current UK tax systems are not fit to deal with the big international tech firms: this year Amazon paid just \u00a31.7m in tax despite a near-trebling of profits. The UK and the EU are working to introduce a new global system, with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which advises on international taxation. Yet the data and platforms that the so-called FAANG stocks (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet's Google) possess give them innate structural advantages that will take some time to regulate. It is therefore unlikely that a British windfall tax, if enforced, would severely hurt the FAANGs. But Mr Corbyn's proposal is another sign of mounting tension between European politicians and American tech titans.</p><p>The opposition leader's speech also targeted the political influence of media organisations in the UK. He suggested enforced shareholder dilutions of all outlets over a certain size, with equity and board membership handed to staff and readers. In the Trumpian age of 'fake news', Mr Corbyn envisions that this move will cut off the power of \"media barons\" and make editors more accountable to their staff and audience.  </p><p>An enforced dilution would see a per share decline in earnings and book value and weaken the claim of existing shareholders on earnings and assets - a further blow for UK newspapers, as the demand for traditional print journalism declines and ad revenue suffers at the hands of Facebook and Google.  </p><p>Mr Corbyn claimed that limiting proprietors' and editors' control of their outlets was a necessary reform to end the \"stranglehold of elite power and billionaire domination over large parts of our media\". However, it is worth noting that this proposal, and his others, were vague. The lecture left out key details, for example the size of media companies that would require an enforced dilution. Tom Watson, deputy leader of the Labour party, stressed that they were not formal policy propositions.</p><p>Mr Corbyn's hypothetical reforms should be viewed with a degree of scepticism, as the prospect of an outright Labour majority - though far from unthinkable - still seems unlikely, even given a potential impasse in the ongoing Brexit negotiations. However, there is plenty of room for change between now and the next general election in 2022, and if the Commons palate did switch from blue to red, the Labour leader wouldn't be a voice in the wilderness on this issue - he might even attract a degree of cross-party support in some areas. The combined regulatory and political momentum building in Europe against US tech firms is undeniable, particularly in light of continued negative perceptions over their lowly corporate tax rates, in addition to fears over the misuse of personal data following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVONL-46816830</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVONL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T4T-H651-JCJY-G400-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459686</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"692\"/><timeReceived>12:26 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investorschronicle.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 29, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

Desultory users risked losing their Twitter handles and having to start building their social media presence all over again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But there was another implication: inactivity might also mean that the person behind the profile is no longer alive.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bereaved people reacted badly. Those who had log-in details or device access rushed to post tweets that would preserve the profiles, their messages materialising on deceased people's feeds like voices from beyond the grave.</p><p>Not everyone could do this, though. \"I don't have my dad's login,\" Drew Olanoff lamented in an article on TechCrunch. \"I can't 'wake up' his account to keep it safe.\"</p><p>Twitter back-pedalled just a day later, saying that it hadn't anticipated the impact on the bereaved. But the emotional significance of such digital remains shouldn't be news to anyone in Silicon Valley.</p><p>Back in 2013 Google instituted an Inactive Account Manager, and Facebook followed suit with Legacy Contact the next year, allowing users to appoint a kind of digital executor. Facebook used to delete profiles upon death but changed its policy based on user feedback following the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007. Instagram memorialises accounts now too, and Twitter appears set to do the same.</p><p>Social media companies didn't mean to become digital cemeteries - they exist to connect living users, sell them things, and profit from their data. But 100 per cent of social media users will eventually die, and there are no virtual worms to nibble away all trace of our online lives: the email accounts, search histories, comments, posts, message threads, GPS tracking, and health data.</p><p>According to scholars at the Oxford Internet Institute, digitally stored information grows four times faster than the world economy, and the fact that this data glut includes millions of online ghosts is an increasing issue for the companies that house them.</p><p>Facebook may be an empire of social media now but it will eventually become the empire of death: the digital remains of 4.9bn people may be \"buried\" there by the end of the century, far outnumbering living users.</p><p>The big dog of social media companies isn't the only one with problems. Innumerable businesses hoover up data without considering the end from the beginning, and most lack fit-for-purpose systems governing how to handle the data of the deceased.</p><p>They aren't helped by lack of guidance. Unhelpfully, GDPR kicked the can down the road. In this regulatory void, companies can do whatever they want, often developing policy reactively and hastily, usually in the wake of PR problems like Twitter's gaffe last year.</p><p>The existence of these persistent digital legacies means that we carry our lost loved ones with us, in the palms of our hands. Our smartphones serve as both amusement parks and cemeteries.</p><p>Contrary to popular misconceptions about grief, maintaining a connection with those gone before is generally neither abnormal nor unhealthy, and continuing bonds with people's digital legacies is common.</p><p>Now that we write few letters and print few photos, our memorabilia tend to be stored as binary code and mediated by service providers.</p><p>People may be outraged when digital remains disappear from online platforms, but of course they surrendered control over this eventuality long ago, when they agreed to the T&amp;Cs which they probably didn't read.</p><p>Blanket preservation, however, may not be the answer. Our digital legacies are often fully-fledged identities rather than mere footprints, and their contribution to the overheating of the world's servers is not the only issue - they are also brimming with personally identifiable and often sensitive information.</p><p>Companies can currently monetise or otherwise exploit the data of the dead, analysing it for market insights, using it to train artificial intelligence models, or holding onto it to retain living users who are loath to desert the lost loved ones that still reside on the platform in digital form.</p><p>In its October report, the Data Ethics Commission in Germany recommended that service providers be obliged to handle the data of the deceased appropriately, that quality assurance standards be set for digital estate planning services, and that post-mortem data protections be instituted by the state. What this will look like in practice, in Germany and elsewhere, is all to play for.</p><p>If the concept of \"digital estate planning services\" sounds unfamiliar, you're not alone, but it's time we get acquainted with the idea. Until recently, we had no more need of it than the dead had need of privacy, but the worm has turned. It should be our testamentary right to dispose of a lifetime's corpus of highly personal digital information as we see fit, but seizing back control may be harder than we think, and it may not happen without first breaking up the big tech companies that have succeeded the medical establishment and funeral industry as the new masters of death.</p><p>\u00a3 Elaine Kasket is a psychologist, speaker, and the author of All the Ghosts in the Machine: The Digital Afterlife of Your Personal Data (2019).</p><p>There are no virtual worms to nibble away all trace of our online lives</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CITYAM-156270281</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYAM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XX9-X8S1-JCBW-N22D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">372494</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"866\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 City A.M.

Nydia Velazquez in the tone of a scolding kindergarten teacher.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Shaming the CEOs of America\u2019s largest tech companies \u2014 Facebook, Apple, Google, Amazon, Twitter, and YouTube are the usual targets \u2014 has become all too fashionable on both sides of the political spectrum. Everyone from radio host Dennis Prager to Elizabeth Warren has no shortage of bones to pick with Big Tech, whether over political bias and censorship, screen-addicted teens, election interference, pornography, sex trafficking, or a dozen other things.</p><p>Some of these concerns have limited merit \u2014 Twitter\u2019s \u201clearn to code\u201d debacle, in which users were temporarily banned for joking about the employment prospects of clickbait journalists, comes to mind. Others rely on junk science and moral panic: There is no domestic sex-trafficking epidemic unless all women willfully engaged in prostitution are counted as victims. Regardless, the solutions on the table \u2014 whether antitrust investigations or a repeal of Section 230, a legal provision that shields online content providers from some liability by classifying them as platforms rather than publishers \u2014 won\u2019t fix what\u2019s wrong with Big Tech. That\u2019s because the platforms are not ultimately responsible for the fact that people often abuse the powers and privileges these companies provide.</p><p>Increasingly lost in the conversation about social media\u2019s effect on the world is any semblance of personal responsibility. Too many people proceed as if Facebook is the first communicative space to allow disinformation. Ever heard of cable news? Talk radio? The New York Journal's 1898 coverage of the sinking of the Maine? Social media\u2019s infinite scroll function did not turn well-mannered youth into maladjusted creeps. In fact, before the era of social media, teens were vastly more likely to risk personal injury \u2014 e.g., by drunk driving \u2014 to connect with their friends. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey didn\u2019t create cancel culture. Behind every social media mob lurks not an algorithm, but a human being.</p><p>At last week\u2019s hearing, none relished the opportunity to beat up on Zuckerberg more than Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who was widely viewed in the media as having scored a killing blow. \u201cOcasio-Cortez Stumps Zuckerberg,\u201d asserted the Guardian, while that veritable font of truth Rolling Stone declared that she had \u201cexposed\u201d the mogul\u2019s delicate web of lies. In reality, she did no such thing.</p><p>Their exchange concerned Facebook\u2019s decision to allow misleading political ads on the platform, an entirely reasonable move on Zuckerberg\u2019s part given that any top-down effort to separate truthful-enough ads from outright disinformation would likely open up the company to further accusations of political bias.</p><p>\u201cSo, you won't take down lies or you will take down lies?\u201d asked Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cI think that's just a pretty simple yes or no.\u201d</p><p>Zuckerberg might have countered by pointing out that Ocasio-Cortez is herself an aggressive spreader of misinformation: Three of her five most recent public statements were judged by PolitiFact to be lies, and the other two were deemed \u201chalf truths.\u201d Instead, he politely explained that in lieu of having Facebook determine what counts as truthful, he would rather let users decide. Indeed, Zuckerberg noted, it may even be beneficial to allow people to see that their elected officials are willing and eager to peddle dishonesty.</p><p>\u201cCongresswoman, in most cases, in a democracy, I believe people should be able to see for themselves what politicians they may or may not vote for are saying and judge their character for themselves,\u201d he said.</p><p>Ocasio-Cortez treated this like a confession of wrongdoing and then moved on to accuse Zuckerberg of hosting \u201congoing dinner parties with far-right figures\u201d and white nationalists because he solicited feedback from some conservative pundits about what Facebook could do to ease concerns about bias on the platform. The idea that Zuckerberg is kowtowing to the far-right is a ridiculous smear.</p><p>Unfortunately, it\u2019s also the kind of paranoid nonsense that dominates the liberal narrative about social media\u2019s pernicious influence on democracy and American politics. To wit: The Left has recently become concerned that Facebook and YouTube in particular are essentially alt-right recruiting devices. A widely read New York Times piece from June, \u201cThe Making of a YouTube Radical,\u201d blamed the platform\u2019s recommendation algorithm, which proposes the next video to be played, for steering vulnerable young men toward white nationalist content. One minute, an unsuspecting internet surfer is watching a Dave Rubin or Jordan Peterson video, and in the next, they are consuming neo-Nazi race realism.</p><p>\u201cCritics and independent researchers say YouTube has inadvertently created a dangerous on-ramp to extremism by combining two things: a business model that rewards provocative videos with exposure and advertising dollars, and an algorithm that guides users down personalized paths meant to keep them glued to their screens,\u201d warned Times columnist Kevin Roose.</p><p>There\u2019s no doubt that some people were radicalized \u2014 or \u201cred-pilled,\u201d to borrow a phrase from The Matrix that has come to describe the process of awakening to some non-leftist realization \u2014 by watching YouTube videos. But a recent paper by Penn State political scientists Kevin Munger and Joseph Phillips casts doubt on the notion that this is a widespread problem. They found that YouTube users who started watching a video presenting some non-leftist alternative perspective and continued for five more recommended videos only arrived at a white nationalism one every 1,700 times.</p><p>\u201cFor a random walker beginning at a \u2018control\u2019 video from the mainstream media, the probability [of encountering alt-right content] is so small that it is difficult to see on the graph,\u201d they wrote. \u201cBut it is certainly no more common than one out of every 10,000 trips.\u201d</p><p>According to Munger and Phillips, viewership of far-right content on YouTube peaked in 2017 and has subsequently declined.</p><p>As for mainstream conservative content, the Right\u2019s success on social media has bred not just envy but suspicion from the Left. Judd Legum, a progressive writer, recently implied that the Daily Wire\u2019s huge success on Facebook was partly attributable to a \u201cclandestine network of 14 large Facebook pages\u201d that exclusively promote Daily Wire content. Since these pages are not upfront about their loyalty to the Daily Wire, Legum considers them to be engaged in \u201ccoordinated inauthentic behavior,\u201d a violation of the platform\u2019s terms of service. Legum also suggested that perhaps Zuckerberg had taken no action against this because he wants Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro to defend him from conservatives.</p><p>These specific pages may well be doing something underhanded. But they only contribute to the Daily Wire\u2019s success in small ways. Most of the site\u2019s traffic is due to promotion from Shapiro\u2019s own Facebook page. It\u2019s not some secret cabal of fake pages or Zuckerberg looking the other way. With more than 5 million Facebook followers, Shapiro is just really popular.</p><p>In saner times, right-leaning media\u2019s incredible success on social media would prompt celebration from conservatives. The Right has its own news outlets and can get its message directly in front of the American people without having to count on traditional media gatekeepers.</p><p>And yet the whining about social media companies supposedly not treating conservatives fairly has become incessant. Leading the charge is Prager, whose PragerU videos promote conservative ideas on YouTube. Prager has sued Google, which owns YouTube, for restricting some of its content. YouTube has a feature that allows users to avoid seeing adult content, and thus videos that are labeled as such are invisible to these users, which constitute about 1.5% of the total. Prager and his team are free to quibble with this moderation, but the suit essentially demands that the company be treated as a public utility and subjected to government regulation. This is quite the slippery slope, and a conservative intellectual who frequently, and correctly, criticizes governments for meddling in private businesses ought to know better.</p><p>Many conservatives have rightly mocked the idea that algorithms are driving defenseless teens into the waiting arms of the alt-right. But all too many have succumbed to algorithm panic when similar claims are made, including the idea that social media is making teens anxious and depressed.</p><p>There is no more obvious example than Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, the crusading leader of the populist anti-corporate faction of the GOP. Hawley has put forth a spate of bills and policy recommendations that would empower a government panel to adjudicate Big Tech\u2019s political biases (one wonders how Hawley thinks this would go under a Warren administration), kill several of the supposedly addictive features of social media, and prompt platforms to close comments sections in order to deal with increased libel risk. Why anyone thinks that last item would protect conservative speech is a mystery.</p><p>Hawley\u2019s Social Media Addiction Reduction Technology Act (SMART) would ban infinite scroll and autoplay, two features that remove natural stopping points from a user\u2019s social media experience. It would also target \u201cstreak badges,\u201d which are icons that appear as rewards for engaging in continuous conversation on apps such as Snapchat.</p><p>Supporters of Hawley\u2019s approach contend that social media is uniquely addictive and harmful for teens. The psychologist Jean Twenge believes that young people who came of age after the advent of smartphones, and the constant, ubiquitous access to social media they provide, suffer from depression and anxiety. In her 2017 book iGen, Twenge writes that today\u2019s super-connected teens are less rebellious and happy (indeed, that\u2019s in the subtitle of the book).</p><p>It may be true that people who stay up all night exchanging snaps or scrolling through Facebook aren\u2019t sleeping enough and thus have mental health issues. But the science of tech addiction and mental health is wildly unsettled. The American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders labels tech and social media overuse a \u201ccondition for further study,\u201d not a recognized addiction. It is not clear that people are addicted to social media in the same way that alcoholics are addicted to alcohol. There needs to be much more research done on the biological, neurochemical effects of social media. In the meantime, the mundane observation that children really like chatting with their friends is hardly the basis of an addiction epidemic.</p><p>In fact, lost in all the panic over social media addiction is a plain truth: Using Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat is fun and beneficial for millions of teens who use the technology to keep in touch with their friends. While Twenge\u2019s research often presumes that teens are enviously consuming their friends' content and become sick with jealousy or fears of abandonment, a recent study essentially negates this claim. Candice Odgers, a professor of psychological science at the University of California-Irvine, found \u201cno connection between the amount of time that young people spend online using digital technologies and mental health symptoms like depression, anxiety.\u201d Teens who were sending more messages appeared to have better mental health. Engaging with their friends, even on social media, probably makes people happier in the long run.</p><p>Too much of a good thing can be a bad thing, sure. Social media can interfere with homework, jobs, family, and other obligations. But the same is true of a whole host of other activities. Importantly, legislators do not have an impressive track record when it comes to regulation in these areas: comic books, video games, etc. Responsible people do not delegate their obligations to the federal government. Parents must restrict their children\u2019s smartphone usage when necessary, not expect the authorities to ham-fistedly do so for everyone, everywhere, when there\u2019s very little evidence of a crisis.</p><p>For those who seek to blame their problems on others, the sheer bigness of Big Tech provides an appealing target. Rather than grapple with her failure to win what should have been a slam-dunk presidential election, Hillary Clinton retreated to the idea that pernicious tech factors, specifically Russian bots and ads, swung the election to Donald Trump. Warren is already gearing up to do the same in the event she is the Democratic candidate. A Warren administration would undoubtedly prosecute the case against Big Tech with gusto.</p><p>But conservatives have also fallen into the trap of knee-jerk condemnation whenever there is a feature or policy that irks them. The solution can hardly be to invite the government to make itself czar of Big Tech. </p><p>Robby Soave is an associate editor at Reason magazine and author of the book Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2310952381</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XD9-32R1-DY0W-41CW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2200\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

What exactly does Mr. Murphy imply for noncompliance? Harsh new regulations? Antitrust inquiries?</p><p> Tax audits?  The word for this, as Justin Raimondopoints out[1], is extortion. Big Tech, however, is fully complicit in this era of growing 'soft censorship' by ostensibly private companies. In the past 48 hours, several social media platforms- including Facebook, twitter, YouTube (Google) and iTunes (Apple)- banned provocateur Alex Jones from their platforms. Jones often promoted guests like Dr. Ron Paul, Lew Rockwell, and Peter Schiffin the 1990s, when alternative voices were few and far between. Twitter also suspended the accounts of Ron Paul Institute director Daniel McAdams, Antiwar.com editor Scott Horton, and retired US Foreign Service officer Peter Van Buren, threeprominent libertarian and non-interventionist voices. Senator Murphy did not have to lift a finger. Yes, tech companies are private organization with shareholders.Yes, nobody has a right to a platform, or a microphone, or an audience. Yes, nobody in America is being put in jail or fined by government for speech-yet(so-called hate speech laws already are in place across the West, and supported by many voters in the US). We do not advocate regulation of social media or technology companies under common carrier/utility theories or public accommodations laws. But the unholy nexus of state and corporate power is at the core of the libertarian critique. Big Tech isdeeply involved[2]with government at many levels, from data collection to spying to developing weapons and AI to providing cloud space to noxious federal agencies. Tech companies derive their economic, social, and cultural power not only from their competence in the marketplace, but increasingly from their connection to the state as well. It is precisely this alliance that gives rise to justified criticisms of a power elite[3]. Taken to its ultimate conclusion, the alliance becomes openly fascist. In this sense libertarians have every justification to oppose consolidations of economic power- and the blurring betweenFirst Amendment violations by express state actors and de-platforming of alternative voices by state-connected actors. Is the MisesInstitute next? Will we be de-platformed, shadow banned, or otherwise erased for promoting views-proudly radical, anti-state, and anti-war- that the power elite cannot abide? The answer lies in building independent platforms. Mises.org was a veryearly pioneer online, providing a critical forumfor libertarian and Austrian writersbeginning way back in October 1996. As a result, the site had a head start in becomingamong the most-visited economics hubs in the world. Much of our site traffic is organic: visitors either direct their browser to the home page, or arrive at a particular page through search engines like Google. Unlike newer sites, mises.org is less dependent on social media feeds to drive traffic- less than20%. And while our site traffic is robust, that percentage drops associal media platforms adjust their algorithms to punish content sites and keep you distracted rather than clicking through. So while the site could and would survive being de-platformed by social media companies, it would not take much for search engines to 'disappear' our content. Imagine typing 'Austrian economics' or 'Mises' into Google and finding no mises.org results- or having those results shunned to the twentieth page of results. You can help fight back by taking small steps today: set mises.org as your homepage, and visit frequently to make sure you're seeing articles and content that social media outlets hide from your feeds. When you do see our articles pop up, help us by clicking through. And circulatethem via email to acquaintances using direct links, rather than simply sharing social media posts that in many cases simply disappear down a rabbit hole. The state and its cronyist friends have built a world that seeks to silence our perspectives. We must recognize that arguments and content mean nothing if conduits for disseminating them are shut down.

Great to see you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's it for us. Have a great weekend. See you Monday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(MUSIC)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS HOST: Welcome to this special edition of \"Hannity\", Countdown to the Election. I'm Tammy Bruce, in tonight for Sean.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After four very long days, the Democratic National Convention has finally, mercifully come to an end. Last night, Joe Biden capped off the week with the mostly forgettable speech, short on policy details but full of negative platitudes against President Trump and the state of our country today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump, however, responded. Take a look at this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Joe Biden grimly declared a season of American darkness, and yet, look at what we've accomplished. Until the plague came in, look at what we've accomplished, and now, we are doing it again.</p><p>Where Joe Biden sees American darkness, I see American greatness. We've seen heroic doctors and nurses racing into action to save lives. We've seen first responders helping strangers in need. We've seen the passage of historic legislation to save 50 million American jobs. We've mobilized American industry like never before.</p><p>It's time to reject the anger and hate of the Democrat Party. We have the biggest election coming up of our lifetime.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE: President Trump also fiercely criticized what Joe Biden conveniently left out of his remarks.</p><p>Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: But the biggest part of last night's speech was what Joe Biden didn't talk about. He didn't talk about law enforcement. He didn't talk about bringing safety to Democrat-run the cities that are totally out of control and they have no clue.</p><p>China was never mentioned in any way, shape, or form. China will own our country if he gets elected, they will own our country, and we're not going to let that happen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE: Yeah, boy, what a difference in attitude there.</p><p>So, ultimately, Biden was so short on details because the radical Democratic agenda is downright frightening.</p><p>As former Governor Chris Christie remarked, it scares that the bejesus out of people.</p><p>Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR: You didn't hear any specifics last night for Joe Biden and the reason for that is because his specifics would scare the bejesus out of America and he knows it. It's a crazy left wing liberal agenda that he has been captive of now and he gave into an order to get the nomination and that he will pursue if he's elected.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE: Joining us now with reaction is American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp, and FOX News contributor Charlie Hurt.</p><p>Guys, thank you so much for joining me tonight.</p><p>You know, it is nice at the convention is over even though President Trump got this really nice bump during the convention which was, of course, interesting in and of itself.</p><p>But, Matt, let me start with you. You know, when we talk about their lack of willingness to talk about policy details, isn't it possible that they've been promising both the left and their so-called pragmatic moderates the same thing? That they're both in charge and that they can't talk about details because it would offend or frighten their -- part of their own base? Matt?</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: Yeah, that's exactly right, Tammy, which is if you look at this socialist manifesto that Bernie Sanders and AOC negotiated with Biden, it's the most extreme policy document that we've ever seen in politics. If it got -- you know, if it got the sunshine that it deserves, people would be appalled.</p><p>Chris Christie says they would scare the bejesus out of people, they're actually not really into bejesus at all. If you look at what policies would do for economic recovery, you can't raise taxes on everybody in this country and also say you're going to bring the economy back. You can't say you're going to take all of those Obama era regulations that Trump has taken off the economy to stop domestic energy production, to allow small businesses to prosper.</p><p>If you put those all back on the economy, there's no way we're going to have a recovery because America won't become competitive again. If America isn't competitive, that helps China's -- China and our adverse -- economic adversaries overseas.</p><p>And how about this, Tammy? Does it make any sense to make nuns pay for the abortions in this country? Can't we have some kind of zone of First Amendment freedom to practice your religion or to not practice your religion?</p><p>BRUCE: Yeah.</p><p>SCHLAPP: What is wrong with these radicalized socialist Democrats? I'll tell you what, I think if the American people know more, they will vote for Donald Trump.</p><p>BRUCE: Yeah. Well, look, this is not I think, you know, unknown to the American people, Charlie. And that this is the Obama-Biden administration which not so long ago, we know what they did. We know what a disaster it was. Biden has been in for 47 years in government.</p><p>We know the difference Donald Trump has brought forward. We know what has happened now with China and the China virus. Do you really think the American people can be gas-lit in this way? That they don't want answers or don't want specifics, how long can Joe Biden get away with this?</p><p>CHARLIE HURT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah, I have a really hard time thinking American voters are not on to this. Voters are very smart, much smarter than Washington politicians ever give them credit for being. It's a real strange gambit that Joe Biden is trying to play here.</p><p>On the one hand, he's talking about how racist America is, how awful America is, how unfair America is, and then, on the other hand, he has to acknowledge which you pointed out, he's been part of the problem in Washington for 47 years. And if America is this horrible place, he's never done anything to fix any of it. In eight of those years, he was the number two guy in the White House.</p><p>So, whatever it is that he's attacking Donald Trump for, he has to take some credit for that himself, which is why really all of this is political, it's all nonsense. You know, Barack Obama on the night that he spoke said that he -- when he blamed Donald Trump for 170,000 deaths in America because of the Wuhan plague, I thought to myself wow, Barack Obama doesn't want Joe Biden to win, because he would never say that if you wanted a politician to win.</p><p>And then Joe Biden turns around and says it himself. It's such a nasty line of attack and it's so hopeless and so dishonest. I think the American people realize that. In fact, there's no doubt in my mind that the American people realize how dishonest that is.</p><p>BRUCE: Well, it's dishonest and I think it can be confusing. If you think that America is racist, you're talking about Americans being racist --</p><p>SCHLAPP: That's right.</p><p>BRUCE: -- you're talking about this country being a pit that cannot be saved, what is it exactly that is worth saving? He doesn't seem to -- he seems to be contradicting himself about the nation.</p><p>SCHLAPP: This is the problem with systemic racism, it's a term they throw out there but it's an indictment of the entire American experience because what the systematic racism means, Tammy, and you know this. It means I can't choose to be virtuous in my treatment of other human beings because the system is so bad that I'm just going to get caught up in the rottenness of the system so that a young black man or person of color can't rise above their problems in life because the system is so rotten, it makes people of color not try as they should and not feel hope, it makes white people feel like no matter what they do, they are rotten and they stink.</p><p>BRUCE: Yeah.</p><p>SCHLAPP: And that's exactly the opposite of what America believes.</p><p>BRUCE: It is -- it's the ultimately disaster, because what you're doing is you're condemning everyone immediately that there is no hope. Gone is the hope and change dynamic of Barack Obama.</p><p>With Joe Biden, everything is already lost, which Americans -- we reject this. It's certainly not the American way that's not how we ensure our future. That will be a gambit as you said, Charlie. It's an interesting way to put it, we'll see.</p><p>Gentlemen, thank you for joining me. Matt Schlapp, Charlie Hurt, I appreciate it. Thank you very much.</p><p>Now, unlike Joe Biden, President Trump will actually visit another state during his convention. On Monday as the RNC formally kicks off, the president will head north to North Carolina to visit local farmers.</p><p>And joining us now with the preview of next week's events is RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel.</p><p>Ronna, welcome aboard. Thanks for joining me.</p><p>RONNA MCDANIEL, RNC CHAIRWOMAN: Thanks for having me. Great to be with you.</p><p>BRUCE: Well, you've been very busy. You've been very steady. You've been a great voice during this process, because there are different messages clearly.</p><p>The Democrat message is that everything is lost. America is a hellscape. That we can't make any difference for it, it's done.</p><p>And then you got President Trump who is reminding us about the American ideal, about what we want for the future, about the power of the American sensibility.</p><p>What can we actually expect now for this next week coming up? What will the approach of the president be?</p><p>MCDANIEL: Well, I think your point at the beginning was exactly right. Donald Trump is going to be in North Carolina on Monday. Donald Trump was also in Wisconsin, the state where Joe Biden has his convention that he never showed up to, and President Trump continues to travel this country and bring messages of hope and talk about the greatness of America, throughout the country.</p><p>So, in our convention, you're going to see this aspirational message, the president is going to put forward a plan for the next four years. He's going to talk about how his policies have directly affected real people. It's going to be the American story, not the Hollywood script and fiction that was put forward by the Democrats this past week.</p><p>BRUCE: You know, what I do love about him and I think one of the many reasons why he won in 2016 was we saw him fall in love with the country through the campaign. I don't know what he thought maybe at the beginning of the campaign, but when he began to meet us, he realized the potential in who we were and that we were worth saving.</p><p>And we recognize that as well, even though we've been told for a number of years prior through the Obama-Biden administration that we weren't really worth saving.</p><p>And, you know, his travel to states, I think this speaks to that as well, recognizing the value and importance of the states as they exist versus an overarching federal response to things. Would you agree with that?</p><p>MCDANIEL: Absolutely, the president loves this country, but more importantly, he loves the people of this country and he ran because of those people who didn't have a voice in Washington, that didn't have a lobbyist, that weren't the elite from the coasts that were the voices from Hollywood or big tech.</p><p>He ran for the farmer, for that blue collar worker on the line in Michigan. He ran for the everyday man who didn't have a voice in Washington. And he said, you deserve better, you deserve better from your politicians, I'm going to drain the swamp and I'm going to do things better.</p><p>And he has with regulation and cutting taxes and policies that have unleashed our energy independence and made people's lives better across the country.</p><p>Democrats were so dishonest in their convention, talking about the Obama- Biden administration and all the things they did to hurt our country.</p><p>BRUCE: Yeah.</p><p>MCDANIEL: Donald Trump has brought us back and he's going to do it again after this pandemic.</p><p>BRUCE: Yeah, I think that's clear, he kept promises. At the same time, of course, he also made Republicans mad on occasion. I think the RNC is learning a bit when it comes to the nature of how to approach the American people outside of that beltway and it's making all of us better.</p><p>Ronna, thank you so much for joining me tonight. I appreciate it.</p><p>MCDANIEL: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BRUCE: Now, coming up, the Democrats -- my pleasures. The Democrats this week at their convention ignore completely the lawlessness plaguing liberal cities across this country. Emily Compagno, Leo Terrell, and Austan Goolsbee join us next as this special edition of \"Hannity\" continuous.</p><p>BRUCE: Welcome back to this special edition of \"Hannity.\"</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the Democrats completely ignored the lawlessness plaguing liberal cities at their convention this week as we saw brutality continue to unfold in our streets. A vicious attack on a truck driver in Portland was captured on video Sunday night, the prime suspect in that case, Marquise Love, surrendered to the police this morning.</p><p>And in New York City this week, another debacle. A retired NYPD sergeant was horrifically, brutally beaten in the garment district. That's pretty much midtown. The incident was captured by security cameras.</p><p>Now, amid the growing violence, the media finally asked Biden about the \"defund the police\" movement. Here's what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I don't want to defund police departments. I think they need more help. They need more assistance.</p><p>But we have to make it clear that this is about protecting neighborhoods, protecting people, everybody across the board. The only guy that actually put in a bill to actually defund the police is Donald Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE: Well, that's a little bit of a shift. Oh, yeah, Joe? Then why did the National Association of Police Organizations endorse Trump after they backed you and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012?</p><p>And let's not forget that Biden previously said that he would be willing to, quote, redistribute funds away from police departments, saying that police had become the enemy, while Kamala praise the defunding of the LAPD. So, why is -- you saw her nodding as he was talking, why is Biden ignoring the crime wave and chaos in America's major cities?</p><p>Well, joining me now with reaction, attorney and Fox News contributor Emily Compagno, civil rights attorney, a man with very little to say, Leo Terrell, and former chair of the Council of Economic Advisors to President Obama, Austan Goolsbee.</p><p>Everybody, welcome aboard, thanks for joining me tonight. I appreciate it.</p><p>Now, let me start actually Austin with you. You know, I've heard Barack Obama make specific statements that what is happening now and even in violence that is occurring during his administration was not the way to go, that this was not acceptable, that things had to be done differently.</p><p>And yet, not only in the convention, but in general, we haven't heard leading Democrats and the party except about the defunding the police when the messaging prior to that had been the opposite. Are they realizing now, it's a bigger problem that they looking at the polls, why suddenly the shift?</p><p>AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, FORMER CHAIR OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISORS: Well, I don't know that there was a shift. I mean, you started by trying to portray that as a partisan thing, I would point out that eight of the ten highest violent crime rates are red states and if you take the reddest city in America, it's Oklahoma City, it has the same population as Portland, Oregon, and its murder rate is double that in Portland.</p><p>Crime is a bad issue. I think Democrats were more focused on the lawlessness coming out of the White House than they were on general lawlessness or the crime rate.</p><p>BRUCE: Well, I -- it's a little bit of a jog, Americans see what's going on, Emily, throughout the country. Mostly, if it's blue states, they see Portland certainly, they see Seattle, it's New York, we see Chicago. It's not in red states, you've got Texas, but you got Austin, a blue city.</p><p>Regardless, we've got at least President Trump taking action against that with Operation LeGend, being very aggressive in that regard but Democrats seem to be silent or passive.</p><p>Emily, can they continue being silent on the violence that's going on?</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, if they do so, it will be with the consequence that they will lose votes in November. And to respond Austan's point, it's actually aptly said, and the focus indeed is on the federal government, but to the point where it's missing the voter, we absolutely understand we are being ignored, all of the cities that are being rocked by violence.</p><p>I don't understand why there's an inability to acknowledge that there can be zero tolerance for violence and also a commitment to amplification of black voices and also a commitment to synthesis and participation and a whole host of other things were so many things can be true at the same time, I think the average voter isn't a partisan hack and isn't totally obsessed with President Trump and therefore deserves a nuance, acceptable answer.</p><p>I think hearing Joe Biden's comments made sense and it was interesting why he isn't saying it before. And for Kamala Harris referring to herself at the top cop, but then, of course, it's telling that the police union isn't enforcing them, or isn't endorsing them because as they say, they are sick of being considered a punching bag.</p><p>So, I think they are losing millions of voters, frankly, with the inability to articulate that many things can be true at the same time as well as a commitment to law and order.</p><p>BRUCE: Well, and, Leo, it's also -- we think about the issue of law and order versus safety. Regardless of who you are, if you live in an urban area, if you live in the suburbs, regardless of your complexion, your sex, sexual orientation, whatever, this is now an issue of safety. Are you going to be safe in your own city and can there be law enforcement and can they be empowered?</p><p>Leo, you and I come from the same general area in Los Angeles and, you know, people are afraid everywhere now. What would you say being from the West Coast, we know what's going on here on the East Coast, what's happened to Los Angeles and nature of the Los Angelinos responding to mayhem in general that's unfolding everywhere?</p><p>LEO TERRELL, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Well, the same thing is happening in all these Democratic cities, Los Angeles, Portland and Seattle.</p><p>And, Austan, for you to bring up Oklahoma City, that's just a -- you're trying to do smoke and mirrors. Let's be clear, the Democrats go to the convention, didn't say one thing about the chaos in those cities -- why? Because they are basically supporting Black Lives Matter.</p><p>Austan, Black Lives Matter? Which black lives? Black, the black police officer or is there black on black crime in Chicago? And what about the Police Officer David Dorn?</p><p>For Austan to come in and talk about Oklahoma City and not talk about the chaos -- the Democrats cannot talk about crime in these cities because they are run by Democratic mayors.</p><p>The thing that is amazing about it, they play the race card throughout the entire convention, isn't it amazing, Austan? I hope you answer my question, is that Chicago is run by black people, black police chief and you call it racism.</p><p>So, all the Democrats try to do is talk about racism in Democratic cities and ignore the crime in Democratic cities.</p><p>One last point, President Trump offered help to these Democratic cities.</p><p>BRUCE: I want to get Austan here to respond, yeah.</p><p>TERRELL: But they also didn't want anything with it.</p><p>Austan, answer my question. Let's not talk about Oklahoma, talk about Chicago, Seattle, and Washington, please?</p><p>BRUCE: Austan, go for it. What do you have to say?</p><p>GOOLSBEE: Well, you had quite a few questions in there so let me try to address some of them. I still don't see how you get away from the fact that eight of the ten most violence take place in red states. That is a problem that we must -- that is a problem that we must address across partisan lines.</p><p>Now in Portland, the president sent in federal agents and caused a violent crime.</p><p>TERRELL: To protect a federal building, to protect a federal building --</p><p>GOOLSBEE: It wasn't just to protect a federal building. That was the problem.</p><p>TERRELL: Answer the question, answer my question.</p><p>GOOLSBEE: I'm not playing games.</p><p>BRUCE: Leo, I beg your pardon, just a minute.</p><p>Gentlemen, thank you very much. Bottom line is when federal agents were withdrawn, the violence continued and it continued against local law enforcement, completely debunking the myth that the federal agents were somehow responsible for the violence in Portland, that's already been debunked. We've been seeing now weeks later that they are going after local law enforcement.</p><p>So, gentlemen, thank you. Obviously, this is something Democrats don't want to discuss because it deals with policy, liberal attitudes, and restrictions on police and what it is they are able to do and blaming, of course.</p><p>Now, coming up, thank you, all of you. Appreciate it.</p><p>Coming up, the liberal media could not contain their excitement this week and last night, they were fawning over Joe Biden's remarks. We will play the tape as this special edition of \"Hannity\" continues.</p><p>BRUCE: Welcome back to the special edition of \"Hannity\".</p><p>Now, after Joe Biden last night showed he could read a teleprompter without any disastrous blunders, the mob in the media immediately proclaimed it a momentous achievement, all while they worked overtime to pretend that this week's DNC was anything but a depressing debacle.</p><p>Here's just a sample from CNN. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: To me, I agree with you, I think this is maybe the best speech Joe Biden has ever delivered.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I thought his speech, I though he nailed it, opening with that elevator quote.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And we were prepared for it to be a terrible speech as long as he didn't embarrass himself -- he didn't have to make anything up tonight, Joe Biden did that thing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I am a hard-core fiercest partisan here, if I could jump out of the chair -- this is the best night for Joe Biden ever.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE: Wow, it's like the toddler just took a step, isn't it?</p><p>Yes, and \"The Washington Post\" took things a step further with their theater critic calling the virtual DNC, quote, \"award-worthy television.\" But, of course, everything they always do is worthy of an award, isn't it?</p><p>Now, Biden's adoring fans in the press will defend him at all costs even as he makes it clear he's not interested in taking any of their questions. So, ask yourself, why is that?</p><p>Much of the media is refusing to critically cover Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, why is it that they ignore the violent crime and rioting, plaguing America's Democrats run cities and why is it that they downplay the historic achievements under President Trump?</p><p>Like the recent UAE-Israeli peace deal, remarkable achievement. Why is it they continue to ignore Joe Biden's decades of failure inside the Washington swamp?</p><p>It's because the mob in the media are nothing more than an arm of the Democratic Party, reciting the same talking points, repeating the same fake news narrative and living in the same echo chamber.</p><p>But the good news is, you get the final say, because in 74 days, we will vote in the most important choice election of our lifetime and you have the opportunity to shock the world again.</p><p>Now, joining me now for reaction, media reporter for \"The Hill\", Joe Concha, and Trump 2020 director of communications, Erin Perrine.</p><p>Welcome aboard to both of you. Thanks for joining me tonight.</p><p>Very busy week, right? We kind of knew what would happen with the media and, Joe, of course, you've been a very busy guy, as lead into this.</p><p>Now, we also know what to expect coming up next week, which will be that the sky is falling and everything is awful. How are we going to be able to look at the media and is there going to be any point where we can take them seriously going into the RNC next week?</p><p>JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER FOR THE HILL: Well, you had a great headline on there, Tammy, as far as \"The Washington Post\" calling it \"award-winning television.\"</p><p>I like to look at numbers a lot, I'm a numbers guy. And the bottom line is that Joe Biden's acceptance speech was viewed by 21.8 million people and you say, oh, wow, that's a pretty good number, until you that put that number into context -- 21.8 million for Biden is 21 percent lower than Hillary Clinton's acceptance speech in 2016, nearly 40 percent lower than President Trump's acceptance speech in the 2016 RNC.</p><p>BRUCE: Wow.</p><p>CONCHA: Then you say, well, a lot more people are watching streaming and watching on their phones.</p><p>All right. Let's use a 2020 to 2020, apples-to-apples comparison. The president's State of the Union Address, pre-pandemic, mind you, when people could actually go out, 37 million people watched compared to Joe Biden, it's about 22 million -- a 15 million viewer difference. That's what we're seeing here. And again, we're in a pandemic, people are at home, not a lot of options.</p><p>And then you look at the substance of the Biden speech.</p><p>BRUCE: Yeah.</p><p>CONCHA: Again, 24 minutes in the teleprompter, the shortest speech, by the way, that we've seen since Walter Mondale in 1984. And if the theme is \"I'm a decent man\", look, we're not voting for a priest, we're voting for president. And this was a convention of grievances, and airing of grievances, a Festivus, and therefore, a show about nothing.</p><p>So, I would imagine, next week, Trump 2020, Republicans are looking at this and saying, OK, we need a message with teeth with it, and drawing contrast between Democrats and Republicans, Biden and Trump.</p><p>BRUCE: Yeah.</p><p>CONCHA: Democrats will raise taxes and there will be anarchy in our streets if we continue allow this ticket to actually get to the White House.</p><p>BRUCE: Right.</p><p>CONCHA: We will do the opposite, keep taxes low and address the anarchy in our streets, that's what the Trump campaign hopes to draw in terms of a contrast when we get to Monday.</p><p>BRUCE: OK, all right. And, you know, that's a very good example, because really the viewers in the way, the American people, Erin, are really the deciders, right? They're going to watch something that makes them hopeful, that gives them a sense of why one goes on living, why you take that next step, why the next step should matter.</p><p>And it's not going to be very difficult for the president to come up with a message that's hopeful. That seems to be his foundational premise from the start.</p><p>ERIN PERRINE, TRUMP 2020 DIRECTOR OF PRESS COMMUNICATIONS: I mean, that's absolutely right. You heard the president say it today, and I think it was just a poignant line -- where Joe Biden sees American darkness, he sees American greatness, and that's just a little bit of a look ahead of the message that you always hear from President Trump but you will certainly hear from him coming up next week as he reaccepts that nomination to lead the Republican Party and America for four more years.</p><p>The contrast is clear: Joe Biden took a dark and divisive tone, and it was really hard to tell where the media ends and Democrats begin with all of their tripping over themselves, applauding the bare minimum participation trophy effort that Joe Biden gave, reading a teleprompter speech. Congratulations, Joe, you managed to do it.</p><p>But let's look at the facts here, he was dark and he was dismissive and he didn't talk about what's actually going on in this country, the greatness achieved under President Trump. He had to try to veil that.</p><p>He couldn't even respect the office, he called him the occupant of the office. Hey, a friendly reminder, Joe, there's a big difference between you and President Donald J. Trump and it's not just the fact that the president is Donald J. Trump as a direct rebuke of the Obama-Biden administration, is that America has great leadership with President Trump, something Joe Biden has never done in his 47 years in the swamp.</p><p>BRUCE: Yeah, I think Kellyanne Conway noted the difference between 47 months of President Trump versus 47 years with Joe Biden.</p><p>The American people, obviously, will decide and we're looking forward to that certainly.</p><p>Erin, Joe, thanks for joining me tonight.</p><p>Now, up next, last night, Joe Biden said, if elected, he will institute a national mask mandate. Plus, he is now vowing to shut down the country again, what a surprise, if necessary because, of course, of COVID.</p><p>Congressman Steve Scalise and Andy Biggs join us next. Stay right there.</p><p>BRUCE: Welcome back this special edition of \"Hannity\".</p><p>As the dismal DNC comes to an end this week, thank goodness, and the GOP ramps up in preparation for the RNC next week, coronavirus response has become a political hot topic, obviously, with Democrats slamming the president at every turn.</p><p>If elected, Joe Biden has some far left drastic plans to deal with the virus, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN: We'll have a national mandate to wear a mask, not as a burden but as a patriotic duty to protect one another. In short, we'll do what we should have done from the very beginning.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE: In short, they'll implement the control they wanted all along and in keeping with the Obama-Biden economic record, sleepy Joe was perfectly fine with shutting down the whole country all over again. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID MUIR, ABC NEWS ANCHOR: If your sworn in come January, and we have coronavirus and the flu combining, which many scientists have said is a real possibility, would you be prepared to shut this country down again?</p><p>BIDEN: I would be prepared to do whatever it takes to save lives.</p><p>MUIR: So, if scientists say shut it down?</p><p>BIDEN: I would shut it down. I would listen to the scientists.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE: Wow.</p><p>Joining me now with reaction, House minority whip, Congressman Steve Scalise, and House Freedom Caucus chairman, Congressman Andy Biggs.</p><p>Gentlemen, welcome aboard.</p><p>REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA): Thank you.</p><p>REP. ANDY BIGGS (R-AZ): Welcome. Good to be with you, Tammy.</p><p>BRUCE: Now, Congressman Scalise, I have to say that, you know, Americans understand, we know Americans care about the coronavirus, and we are concerned about it, we remain concerned about our health and the health of our family. We -- a super majority of us want people to wear masks and that is what we've been guided to do. There is guidance and suggestions.</p><p>And there's Democrats moving to mandates, to enforcing something. What are your thoughts on that?</p><p>SCALISE: Well, first, when Joe Biden says that he would listen to the scientists -- look, he was the first one to criticize Donald Trump when President Trump took decisive action to block flights coming in from China. When Dr. Fauci and others testified under oath that President Trump made the right decision, and in fact, that President Trump's decision saved American lives, not just blocking flights from China, blocking flights from Europe, those are all things that Joe Biden criticized, and it was scientists that actually said President Trump saves lives.</p><p>So, Joe Biden has been all over the board on this, but what he's really been is wrong on this from the very beginning. He just wants to criticize the president when he talks about -- you know, he's now saying he's not for defunding the police, he was just on video a few weeks ago saying he wants to reallocate money away from the police. That's defunding police.</p><p>BRUCE: Exactly.</p><p>SCALISE: And, of course, we know Kamala Harris wants to defund police as well.</p><p>Whatever position he says he's going to take today, he's been all over the board. What he's done is embrace the radical left agenda on all of these items and if Joe Biden was running things, more Americans would have died.</p><p>And again, Dr. Fauci himself testified under oath that President Trump's decision to ban flights from China saved American lives. Joe Biden would not have done that.</p><p>BRUCE: Yeah, thank you.</p><p>You know, Congressman Biggs, I mean, what's interesting too is that if you listen to the science early on, they told you don't wear masks. They said that's like a problem, you don't need to -- stop it.</p><p>So, you're going to get whiplash if you're making decisions every now and then based on what scientists are going to be saying -- the Europeans science, the American science. But Americans agree our instinct is -- we understand the situation, we tend to agree.</p><p>But Joe Biden seems to be pandering in a certain way, he wants to say he'd do something differently but with President Trump being successful, he doesn't quite know where to go with this.</p><p>BIGGS: That's exactly right, Tammy. President Trump has been strong proactive leader on this right from everything from the flight bans to reducing regulation, et cetera, and allowing public-private partnerships to develop cures and prophylaxis as well.</p><p>But here's the thing, Joe Biden wants control. That's what the mask mandate is.</p><p>And President Trump understands very clearly while he -- while he's the president, he doesn't have authority to issue a nationwide mask mandate. And so, he has respected state sovereignty on some of those issues like masks.</p><p>And that's really part of the key to all of this that I don't think Joe Biden gets and I don't think the Democrats get. They just want the power. They just want the control and I think if they are going to start shutting down over flu every year as well, you're going to have a big problem going forward with centralized power.</p><p>BRUCE: Yeah, these are knee-jerk reactions without the thought about the cure being worse than what's been going on. In addition, we do have history with the Obama-Biden administration with the H1N1 flu, and their own health experts saying that had been really just luck that that didn't turn into worse than what it was because they had no idea what they were doing.</p><p>So, we do have a history. That is good news.</p><p>Thank you, gentlemen, for joining me and I appreciate it. Obviously, this conversation is going to continue.</p><p>Now, up next, Lori Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli were sentenced today for their role in the college admission scandal. We'll have a live report.</p><p>Next, plus, Hollywood elites prove just how out of touch and how unfunny they really are at this week's DNC.</p><p>Stay right there.</p><p>BRUCE: Welcome back to the \"Hannity\" special.</p><p>Now, it's a story that rocked Hollywood and college campuses around the country. Now, actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli have both been sentenced for their role in the college admission scandal.</p><p>Jonathan Hunt is standing by at our Los Angeles bureau with more -- Jonathan.</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Tammy.</p><p>For the first time today, we heard Lori Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli apologize for using their wealth and privilege to cheat their two daughter his way the University of Southern California.</p><p>Loughlin told the court, quote: I made an awful decision. I went along with a plan to give my daughter my daughters an unfair advantage in the college admissions process and in doing so I ignored my intuition and allowed myself to be swayed from my moral compass.</p><p>And Giannulli saying, quote: I do deeply regret the harm that my actions have caused my daughters, my wife, and others. I take full responsibility for my conduct, I'm ready to accept consequences and move forward with the lessons I've learned from this experience.</p><p>According to U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling, Giannulli was more active than his wife in the cheating scheme. Lelling saying Giannulli directed bribe payments and, quote, personally confronted his daughter's high school counselor to prevent the scheme from being discovered, brazenly lying about his daughter's athletic abilities.</p><p>As a result, Giannulli was sentenced to 5 months in prison along with a $250,000 fine and Loughlin two months in prison and a $150,000 fine.</p><p>Tammy, the total of those two fines is less than they paid it to cheat their daughters way into college and deprive students of those places, students whose parents didn't have a spare half a million dollars lying around -- Tammy.</p><p>BRUCE: Well, Jonathan, thank you very much.</p><p>Interesting that he was the main mover when she was certainly the main focus of most of the media, because she's, I suppose, more famous. Thank you for that update very much.</p><p>Now, per usual, we saw a lot of Hollywood elites making an appearance at this week's DNC and unsurprisingly it was more awkward than ever. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS, ACTRESS: What did you think about Kamala Harris' speech last night?</p><p>ANDREW YANG, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It was tremendous, I was happy for her.</p><p>LOUIS-DREYFUS: I know, me too. She's fabulous. I cannot wait to see her debate the current Vice President Mika Pines, or is it Paints?</p><p>WANG: It's pronounced Punch I believe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRUCE: Wow.</p><p>Joining us now for reaction, that was painful, FOX News contributor Rachel Campos-Duffy, and Democratic pollster Doug Schoen.</p><p>You know, you guys, Rachel, I'll start with you, I've always worried there because Hollywood is always so good and smart and clever and creative and they can, you know, charm you -- that went out some window somewhere. Rachel, what happened to them?</p><p>RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I don't know, I used to think there was nothing she couldn't do, now I know there is, she can't put on a performance at the DNC convention without making me cringe.</p><p>You know, what I picked from this -- what I picked up from this, Tammy, is look, they are elitists. They had elite celebrities there.</p><p>You know, hearing Eva Longoria and, by the way, Michelle Obama who is also celebrity these days lecturing us about income inequality was -- was laughable. All of them -- both of them could redistribute their wealth or live more modestly, but they choose not to.</p><p>What I really gather from this is that there is a real difference in these parties and the greatest legacy Donald Trump has is that he wrestled the Republican Party away from country club Republicans like Mitt Romney and the Bushes and he handed it to the working class. The Republican Party is the party of the working class, of the truckers, of the machinists, of at home moms. That's -- that's the difference I think we're going to see between this week and next week.</p><p>BRUCE: Well, thank you, Rachel, great points.</p><p>Doug, you know, you're a Democrat. You watched some of that, you probably loved a lot about that didn't like some of it, you had to be somewhat disappointed in how awkward the celebrities were and why wasn't Cher or Barbra Streisand there? I mean, it's almost like there's no enthusiasm even amongst the big celebrities. They didn't have to leave their house.</p><p>DOUG SCHOEN, DEMOCRATIC POLLSTER: Well, I just say, Tammy, that I thought the Democrats missed a real opportunity, with the celebrity culture, they forgot about the working man, blue-collar voters, the voters without college educations who are interested in jobs. I mean, these jokes fell flat, the celebrity culture doesn't work and I would advise my party move away from that and talk about real issues that people care about, not cheap jokes at the expense of the sitting vice president.</p><p>BRUCE: Yeah.</p><p>SCHOEN: It didn't work, it's counterproductive.</p><p>BRUCE: You know, Doug, that's -- that bit of advice could actually save them but I don't think they're going to take it. Great seeing both of you tonight. Thank you very much.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE: Coming up, today, President Trump -- President Trump held a funeral at the White House for his younger brother Robert.

In the introduction, the presenter, mathematician Hannah Fry speaks to the camera.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"With the help of thousands of volunteers, we are about to simulate the outbreak of a fatal contagion throughout the UK. That might seem like a funny thing to want to do, but if we can succeed, this will save lives when, not if, a real pandemic hits. Global outbreaks of deadly flu are a very real threat.\" Some 10,000 volunteers downloaded an app that tracked GPS data anonymously, as well as submitting information on age, gender and others with whom they had come into contact.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"With this kind of information, you can make really important decisions - things like, have you got enough hospital beds, do you need to close the airport, have you got enough antivirals? Or how many body bags are you going to need,\" Fry explained.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The research was conducted by epidemiologists and a paper, 'Contagion! The BBC Four Pandemic - the Model Behind the Documentary' was subsequently published in the journal Epidemics.</p><p>Fry, author of Hello World, Being Human in the Age of Algorithms, now says the work is proving instrumental in helping scientists to model the spread of Covid-19. It serves to exemplify how scientists harness statistical and computational models - algorithms - to save lives, enhance systems and improve medicine. But only if they have data.</p><p>\"Before the experiment, the academics were using a paper survey that had been done 20 years ago and from that, they extrapolated upwards. It was woefully inadequate,\" she told Review.</p><p>\"I don't think people are against the idea of their data being shared ever, ever. It's the idea of your data being used against you, or algorithmically working out who you are and exploiting you based on that knowledge that makes people uncomfortable.\"</p><p>It is that potential for harm and exploitation that can make us feel cynical about our algorithm society. When debates rage about whether we give our data too freely, experiments like Contagion are a reminder that the operation of algorithms goes far beyond merely matching us on dating sites and suggesting movies.</p><p>Still, our modern-day symbiotic relationship with algorithms can feel as intrusive as it is empowering.</p><p>We fear we're being spied on by our home assistants, we suspect our fitness trackers are telling tales, we believe we're being judged by our music providers and we wonder if Google is mapping our lives. This may not all be paranoia. In 2019, it was revealed that some voice-enabled assistants had been recording when users were not aware. Some of those conversations had subsequently been listened to by contractors (users can now opt-out of \"human reviews\".) The concerns extend beyond privacy.</p><p>In the US in 2016, a groundbreaking ProPublica investigation assessed a software known as Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions, an algorithm used by probation officers and parole boards to determine the risk of re-offending.</p><p>The outcome, ProPublica discovered, was that \"black defendants were far more likely than white defendants to be incorrectly judged to be a higher risk of recidivism, while white defendants were more likely than black defendants to be incorrectly flagged as low risk.\"</p><p>There is clearly vast potential for ill. But there is also vast potential for good.</p><p>********** For instance, Ireland has published or is developing research on algorithms that enable authorities to apprehend key figures in child porn rings, sensors to diagnose diabetes earlier, compute the environmental factors for optimum grass growth and more efficient evacuation routes based on crowd dynamics. Much of this is funded by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI), the statutory body set up in 2003. It has been good at predicting what's coming next.</p><p>\"SFI invested in the semantic web, data analytics, 15 years ago. We invested in research into the microbiome before it was on the front of magazines,\" explains Dr Ruth Freeman, director of strategy and communications at SFI.</p><p>It is thanks to funding from SFI that we have centres like ADAPT and the newly minted Centres for Research Training in Artificial Intelligence (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.crt-ai.ie\">www.crt-ai.ie</url>), which began enrolling 120 students over four years on PhD programmes last year with (EURO)14m in funds from SFI and (EURO)3.3m from industry.</p><p>Somewhat surprisingly, there is, as yet, no national AI strategy. A spokesperson for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation said there is a working title of 'AI-Here For Good' and that 85 online submissions were received in a public consultation, which closed late last year. The strategy is due for publication in the first quarter of this year, subject to government approval.</p><p>In its absence, research continues - work like Continued on Page 4 Condren Continued from Page 3 that of Professor Derek O'Keeffe. He and the Digital Diabetes team at NUI Galway want to make diabetes easier to diagnose and are using algorithms to do it.</p><p>\"Traditionally diabetes is measured with serum biochemical markers - you draw blood, process it and you check if it's above or below a threshold,\" he says.</p><p>\"We're proposing a new paradigm, using continuous glucose monitors to take hundreds of data points per day of your sugar profile. Then we're going to analyse that data with advanced AI and be able to say, 'Given your sugar profiles day and night, eating, exercising, etc, what's your percentage chance of developing diabetes?'\" Prof O'Keeffe - a \"physicianeer\", a doctor/ engineer hybrid - admits automation can make doctors nervous, but believes its application will lead to better medicine, not fewer medics.</p><p>\"In a lot of medicine, it's about recognition of a disease. Areas like dermatology, ophthalmology, pathology, radiology, it's about spotting patterns and making a decision,\" he says.</p><p>Can an algorithm improve the standard patient experience? A three-hospital pilot of new technology is soon to be rolled out countrywide by Yvonne Goff, the HSE's director of Integrated Information Services.</p><p>\"We can use algorithms to see patients and citizens in need of early intervention or those who will likely need readmissions in a way we couldn't previously,\" says Goff.</p><p>And it's not just medicine. The Croke Park Smart Stadium initiative, part of the Smart Cities programme, will examine and improve everything from grass growth to crowd movement.</p><p>\"Croke Park as a test bed is fantastic,\" says Dr Suzanne Little, principal investigator at the Insight Centre for Data Analytics.</p><p>\"The stadium people have come with great ideas, for example, environmental monitoring, looking at flooding, how the grass grows and how the stadium operates, through to things like the fan experience.\"</p><p>The project aims to bring about definitive improvements, but will also add to an increasing body of work on crowd dynamics. \"It's easy enough to have someone monitor movement, but if you have an instrument or a sensor, it lets you build up a better understanding of what's going on,\" says Dr Little.</p><p>\"It could build systems that alert staff to unusual patterns where crowds are not behaving how we would expect. An anomaly can be innocuous or it can indicate something that needs attention. Longer-term modelling can help design effective evacuation routes.\"</p><p>******** At the University of Limerick (UL), researchers performing analysis on communication between members of a child pornography ring have disrupted key networks, and identified and arrested key figures.</p><p>This project was a collaboration with the Federal Police of Brazil who tracked the group between 2014 and 2016. The research was conducted by the Mathematics Applications Consortium for Science and Industry at UL.</p><p>\"We have experience of working with crime networks and one of the main questions you ask is who's the most important person, the most important node in the network,\" says James Gleeson, professor of applied and industrial mathematics at UL.</p><p>\"In this particular case, who should the police be targeting in order to reduce the activity? This particular network was very dense, it was highly connected. And because it was a viewership network, there was a link whenever one user viewed the posts of another user, which made it particularly difficult to identify.\"</p><p>Since algorithms require data and can contribute to fundamental decision making, the ecosystem requires strong data protection provisions, good governance and adequate regulation.</p><p>And as the publication of the Data Protection Commission (DPC) report last week showed, critical issues remain.</p><p>The report disclosed serious data breaches by Tusla, including details of a foster parent being given to a grandparent and the disclosure of children's addresses to an imprisoned father. There was also \"inappropriate system access\" and issues with security of data.</p><p>Elsewhere, the data watchdog received 6,609 valid data breach notifications in 2019. It has 72 statutory inquiries open; 23 cross-border and 49 domestic. This year, two more have opened, one into Google and another into Tinder.</p><p>In early February, Facebook postponed its dating feature after an inspection by DPC officers. Being the effective custodian of much of Europe's data has brought controversy.</p><p>Well-documented extensive lobbying by Sheryl Sandberg in 2014, published first in the Irish Independent, and a subsequent 2017 tweet by Enda Kenny grinning alongside the Facebook COO, did not improve Ireland's image The DPC budget comes from the Department of Justice. This itself is not entirely unusual - Britain's Information Commissioner's Office receives an annual grant-in-aid from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.</p><p>But in the UK, \"statutory duties\" are funded by notification fees from data controllers.</p><p>In both cases, the fines are returned to the respective exchequers.</p><p>What is more concerning is that the DPC seems prone to the country's notoriously tidal revenue streams. In October 2019, Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon expressed her disappointment that her budget requests had not been met, increasing only (EURO)1.6m to (EURO)16.9m. This was an increase of 11pc on the previous year, but, with GDPR in force, valid complaints increased 42pc in the same period.</p><p>\"I was honestly shocked to look at the budget and realised that the DPC, considering it's the regulator responsible for the richest, largest tech companies in Europe, was given less of a budget than greyhound racing,\" says Dr Katherine O'Keefe, data governance and data protection consultant at privacy firm Castlebridge in Dublin.</p><p>\"When you look at the requirements of what the DPC does with the budget they have, not giving them what they asked for was not a good message to send.\"</p><p>******** When we decry bad technology and biased algorithms, \"more regulation\" seems a limp response. But sometimes what is boring is also effective.</p><p>In Hello World, Hannah Fry cites dubious \"algorithms\" which have previously been used by US states. She tells the story of a 2012 case taken on by the American Civil Liberties Union, in which an \"algorithm\" assessing the benefits being given to Idaho Medicaid patients had, seemingly arbitrary, reduced their claims, in some cases by as much as 30pc.</p><p>The technology, provided by a third party, refused access to the code citing commercial sensitivity.</p><p>The team eventually gained access after taking legal action and found the \"algorithm\" to be an Excel spreadsheet cobbled together from disparate sources. What probably didn't start off with malicious intent, through negligent and incompetent execution, resulted in terrible outcomes.</p><p>This is where procurement comes in. Recently, the UK's Commons Committee on Standards in Public Life heard evidence that \"requirements for technical transparency are not usually included in procurement tenders and contracts\".</p><p>Its report, 'AI and Public Standards', which was published this month, made procurement requirements fifth of its 15 recommendations.</p><p>\"This should be achieved by ensuring provisions for ethical standards are considered early in the procurement process and explicitly written into tenders and contractual arrangements,\" it said.</p><p>It is perhaps ironic to think that Big Tech might be brought to heel by what is essentially paperwork, but European regulations are seldom ignored.</p><p>The EU Commission has just published its 'European Strategy for Data', which includes legislative measures \"on data governance, access and reuse, for example for business-to-government data sharing for the public interest\".</p><p>Much of this work of certification and regularisation is the kind of painstaking collaboration that seems the very antithesis of a \"move fast and break things\" culture. It is the wonkish stuff of high-level, international committees, like the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), which has begun crafting new standards for AI technologies.</p><p>What is certain is the future will bring more paperwork, more procurement and more deliberation before new technologies are implemented. It looks like a more mature approach.</p><p>\"We're going to see more regulation,\" agrees Dr Katherine O'Keefe. \"We're going to see more requirements around ethical data management. We're already seeing the European Commission moving towards that with a need for ethical AI.</p><p>\"The big tech companies are trying to control the conversation right now to their benefit. That's not a surprise. Lobbying is happening. But here's a greater call for ethical and responsible use of people's data. So we will see more people using their rights and trying to exercise them.\"</p><p>But this isn't just about companies and indi-vidual users. There is a need for the public to articulate its views as some subjects pit competing civil liberties against each other.</p><p>Last week, a febrile argument was reignited over the use of facial recognition technology. Speaking at the launch of the 'Data Analytics and Algorithmic Bias in Policing' report by UK defence think tank RUSI, London's Metropolitan Police Chief Cressida Dick assailed critics.</p><p>\"I and others have been making the case for the proportionate use of tech in policing, but right now the loudest voices in the debate seem to be the critics, sometimes highly incorrect and/or highly ill-informed,\" she said.</p><p>\"Speaking as a member of the public, I will be frank. In an age of Twitter and Instagram and Facebook, concern about my image and that of my fellow law-abiding citizens passing through LFR [live facial recognition] and not being stored, feels much, much, much smaller than my and the public's vital expectation to be kept safe from a knife through the chest.\"</p><p>Experts believe a way forward could be another constitutional assembly, so the issues are debated thoroughly and thoughtfully, outside the current ideological coliseums. In addition to the use of technology in policing, there are questions of how we want to approach the thorny issue of algorithmic bias. Here, too, there are no simple remedies.</p><p>\"Frankly it's impossible to just 'de-bias' a dataset,\" says Dr O'Keefe. \"We need to be careful about an assumption that you can take out gender or ethnicity as a metric and then have an unbiased algorithm.\"</p><p/><p>'The big tech companies are trying to control the conversation right now to their benefit'</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Numbers game: it is a fear of exploitation that can make us feel cynical about our algorithm societyTarget: Prof Derek O'Keefe and his NUI Galway team want to make diabetes easier to diagnose using algorithmsBurden: Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon has expressed her disappointment that her budget requests were not met despite extra work dealing with GDPR rules.

The process of the market definition with regard to online platforms requires, however, revisiting the compatibility of the current competition law tool kit, particularly in the case of the hypothetical monopolist test (HMT).

In the absence of such a conversion the market definition in the case of online platforms relying on zero-pricing will be performed solely based on a qualitative evaluation of the functionalities facilitated by such platforms as seen in the Google Shopping case.

Introduction</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The ever growing and evolving digital economy, with online platforms in its midst, is currently amid substantial legal developments in the context of EU competition law.<sup>1</sup> The growing success and prominence of platforms such as Facebook, Amazon, Google and Uber is increasingly placing online platforms in the spotlight of EU competition law practice where authorities hope to preempt anti-competitive practices before these may materialise.<sup>2</sup>  In the context of EU competition law, much of the debate on online platforms is focused on the balance between the vast economic opportunities that they enable and the possible abuses of dominance such expedited economic growth can foster.<sup>3</sup>  Recently, the apprehension concerning the business practices of online platforms has gone so far as to trigger discussions concerning the need for structural changes for certain platforms.<sup>4</sup> Although such drastic measures are a matter of policy, which entails a lengthy process, abuse of dominance investigations have already been initiated against multiple online platforms by the Commission as well as national authorities in the EU.<sup>5</sup> This rather hostile approach to online platforms calls for a compatibility evaluation of the current toolkit used in the context of Article 102 TFEU in order to prevent reaching erroneous findings in ongoing as well as in future cases.    </p><p>Abuse of dominance cases are inherently dependent upon establishing the existence of a dominant position held by the concerned undertaking, which in the context of EU competition law,<sup>6</sup> requires the definition of the relevant market.<sup>7</sup> Delineating the relevant market in the case of online platforms will be challenging due to their two- or multisided nature enhanced by the online environment that accelerates scalability and expansion significantly. The difficulties concerning the market definition process for online platforms will be both substantive and instrumental. Substantive difficulties concern primarily the requirement to determine the number of markets that need to be defined in each case as online platforms deal with at least two separate customer groups, which may be part of a single or multiple relevant markets.<sup>8</sup> Instrumental difficulties concern the reduced compatibility of the legal and economic tools used for the purpose of the market definition.<sup>9</sup> The most prominent issue in this second category of difficulties is the application of the small but significant non transitory increase in price (SSNIP) test in the context of zero-pricing strategies,<sup>10</sup> which will the focus of this contribution. </p><p>The application of the price centred SSNIP test to situations where prices are absent leads to a practical impossibility. Although there is no legal obligation to make use of the SSNIP test in the context of the market definition process,<sup>11</sup> its growing importance in practice calls for exploring adjustment possibilities that would allow for the application of its logic even in the absence of positive prices. Current literature suggests that the in the presence of zero-pricing the SSNIP test should be modified from a price centred test into either a cost or quality centred test.<sup>12</sup> In this article both suggestions will be evaluated in light of their potential for application in cases concerning online platforms that rely on zero-pricing strategies. </p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this article is to examine the difficulties that the reliance of online platforms on zero-pricing strategies may create for the process of the market definition in light of the incompatibility of such pricing strategies with the SSNIP test, and provide some suggestions on how to overcome such difficulties. In order to provide a coherent evaluation and practical guidance on this matter for future cases the article, following this introduction, is structured accordingly: first the use of zero-pricing strategies by online platforms and the implications of these strategies in the context of the market definition are shortly discussed in Section II. In Section III the role of the SSNIP test in the process of the market definition is discussed together with the expected complexities following from its application in cases concerning zero-pricing strategies. Within the scope of this section, the conversion suggestion for the SSNIP test will be evaluated in light of their suitability and feasibility for cases concerning online platforms. Section IV will shortly address the implications of zero-pricing for the future state of practice in the absence of a modified SSNIP test, followed by some concluding remarks.       </p><p>II. Online Platforms and Zero-Pricing - The Inevitable Task of Defining the Relevant Market of \u2018Free\u2019  </p><p>The use of zero-pricing strategies by companies is neither a novel business practice nor one that is exclusive to online platforms. Similar to the concept of platforms, zero-priced goods and services have existed before the age of Internet.<sup>13</sup> In modern times, the use of zero-pricing has often been adopted by companies in the context of tying practices, complementary products, two- or multi sided markets and \u2018freemium\u2019 products or services.<sup>14</sup> In some cases, such use of zero-pricing strategies, mainly in tying cases, has been found to be abusive in the context of Article 102 TFEU.<sup>15</sup> The use of zero-pricing does not mean that undertakings make zero profits or no longer compete, it merely means that undertakings compete on other aspects and profits are made with regard to a different but related product or service.<sup>16</sup> However, when the need to define a market for the free product or service was discussed, it is not until recently that such markets were even considered to exist.<sup>17</sup> Today, there is an agreement that the provision of free goods or services does not stand in the way of establishing the existence of a relevant market for such products or services for competition law purposes.<sup>18</sup> Although in previous instances, the question of the market definition for zero-priced products or services was rarely addressed, in the case of online platforms it will be one that can hardly be avoided. Online platforms are currently identified and approached predominantly from an economics perspective with reference to their two- or multi sided nature.<sup>19</sup> This nature entails that online platforms constitute intermediaries which cater their services to two or more separate customer groups by facilitating an interaction between them, in some form of matchmaking,<sup>20</sup> in return for remuneration by all or part of these platform participants.<sup>21</sup> The success of online platforms as intermediaries is thus depended on their ability to get (and keep) all the parties of their matchmaking interactions \u2018on board\u2019 and internalise the indirect network effects between them.<sup>22</sup> Accordingly, online platforms will often implement a skewed pricing scheme reflecting the intensity of the indirect network effects between their various customer groups and their respective market power with regard to the platform and one another.<sup>23</sup> In practice the skewed pricing scheme means that one of the customer groups participating on the online platform, composed very often of end consumers, will do so without any charge by the online platform since their participation is subsidised by the other customer groups of the platform.<sup>24</sup></p><p>In cases where the alleged abuse of dominance may occur with respect to such a subsidized group of customers, the market definition will inevitably have to be performed with regard to the free product or service provided to them by the online platform. This is currently the case concerning the abuse of dominance investigation of Facebook in Germany where Facebook is accused of exploiting its users by violating data protection law.<sup>25</sup> Furthermore, when the alleged abuse of dominance occurs with regard to a paying customer group that is interlinked with a non-paying customer group, it may still be required to define the relevant market for the non-paying customer group in case of bi- or multilateral indirect network effects. Such indirect network effects are present where the value of the interaction facilitated by the online platform for its customer groups is dependent on the mutual participation of the respective customer groups interlinked by the interaction. For example if Deliveroo, were to be accused of charging excessive prices from restaurants, determining the market power of Deliveroo with regard to the restaurants would also require defining the relevant market for Deliveroo with regard to consumers. This is because the market power of Deliveroo vis-a-vis the restaurant owners using its platform depends upon the demand of consumers for Deliveroo and vice-versa. In absence of any market power with regard to either customer group (ie no demand) Deliveroo would simply not exist as its business model relies on the monetisation of the interaction between restaurants and consumers. Similar conditions apply, in principle, to any online platform which facilitates a bi- or multilateral matching interaction that matches members of a paying customers group to members of another customer group which does not pay to participate on the platform. Bi- or multilateral matching refers to situations where the facilitated interaction between customer groups on the platform exhibits bi- or multilateral positive indirect network effects indicating the existence of demand interdependency between those customer groups.<sup>26</sup> Such bi- or multilateral matching interactions, which allow for the participation of consumers on the platform without any monetary charge, constitute the core of most online platforms including marketplaces, travel booking platforms, meta search engines, e-learning platforms, price comparison websites, crowd funding platforms and many others.<sup>27</sup> Therefore, future cases concerning the abuse of dominance by online platforms will very likely require defining the relevant market with regard to the customer group(s) of the platform which participate on the platform without paying any monetary fee.</p><p>The methodology involved in the current market definition process relies however greatly on the SSNIP test, which is price oriented.<sup>28</sup> The dependency on the use of positive pricing therefore makes the SSNIP test unsuitable for cases concerning zero-priced products or services as is commonly the case with online platforms. Accordingly, it is important to examine how this friction between zero-pricing and the SSNIP test may interfere with the market definition process and whether the SSNIP test can be adapted in a manner that can compensate for its current shortcomings.</p><p>III. Market Definition and the SSNIP Test</p><p>The definition of the relevant market starts with defining the relevant product market which includes all the products or services that compete with those offered by the concerned undertaking.<sup>29</sup> The process is then followed by the definition of the relevant geographic market. Due to the fact the both aspects of the market definition are performed similarly,<sup>30</sup> the following addresses only the relevant product market, but the findings are equally applicable to the relevant geographic market. The level of competition between the product or service offered by the concerned undertaking and those of its closest competitions is established primarily based on demand \u2013 side substitutability.<sup>31</sup> This is because the greatest competitive constraint on the behaviour of undertakings comes from customers that are willing to switch to substitutes offered by competitors in the event of a price increase or other undesired practices.<sup>32</sup> The result of the demand side substitution assessment indicates the closest competing products or services to those offered by the concerned undertaking. Accordingly, the undertakings that offer these competing products or services, are considered to be in the relevant product market as the concerned undertaking.<sup>33</sup></p><p>Demand side substitution can be assessed based on direct and indirect evidence of substitution. Direct evidence of substitution refers to previously observed behaviour indicating substitution patterns with regard to the product or service offered by the concerned undertaking and those offered by its competitors.<sup>34</sup> When direct evidence is not available, not sufficient or not helpful, competition authorities can make use of indirect evidence of substitution. Indirect evidence of substitution includes quantitative evidence, such as price elasticity estimates, as well as qualitative evidence including the inspection of product or service characteristics and intended use.<sup>35</sup> From a legal point of view there is no hierarchy with regard to qualitative or quantitative evidence despite that the latter is often considered more accurate.<sup>36</sup> Consequently, there is a growing opinion that qualitative evidence should serve as a second check for the findings of quantitative evidence rather than being considered equal in evidentiary value.<sup>37</sup></p><p>In the context of indirect quantitative evidence, the need for an accurate economic tool for determining substitution resulted in the reliance on the hypothetical monopolist test (HMT). The test, originally developed by US competition authorities in the context of merger evaluations, has gained substantial acknowledgement worldwide including its adoption by the Commission and EU Courts.<sup>38</sup> In the context of the HMT, the defined market in each case contains the product or set of products for which a hypothetical monopolist could increase its prices in a profitable manner on a long lasting basis. The test entails three main steps and is performed based on quantitative and qualitative evidence. In the first step the candidate set of products or services controlled by the hypothetical monopolist is established. In the context of an Article 102 TFEU case such candidate set of products or services normally entails those products or services which are the subject of the alleged abuse of dominance.<sup>39</sup> In the second step, demand-side substitutability is assessed based on a hypothetical increase in the price of the candidate products or services set. Finally, in the third step, the possible effect of supply-side substitution is also brought into the picture. In practice, however, this aspect has often played a rather limited role due to fact that establishing the existence of effective supply side constraints depends on meeting several strict criteria.<sup>40</sup> The test may require several iterations, namely if the hypothetical monopolist is not capable to raise its prices profitably the candidate market is enlarged so as to include the identified substitutable products or services and the test is performed repeatedly until the market worth monopolising is found (ie demand-side substitutability is no longer present). In the framework of the HMT, which may be performed based on various quantitative approaches,<sup>41</sup> the SSNIP test constitutes perhaps the main tool for testing demand-side substitutability.<sup>42</sup> The SSNIP assess whether a small but significant non-transitory increase in price of 5-10% by the concerned undertaking could be implemented in a profitable manner. Accordingly, the SSNIP test essentially constitutes a direct form of applying the thought experiment behind the HMT, which explains the preference for this test in practice. Given the preference for the SSNIP test in practice one may thus say that it constitutes the main source of indirect quantitative evidence in the process of the market definition and therefore influences greatly the outcome of such process, particularly where direct evidence is not available, sufficient or suitable for this purpose.        </p><p>The application of the SSNIP test in the case of two-sided markets, however, has been one of the main subjects of debate concerning the definition of the relevant market in such circumstances. Currently, there appears to be no agreement on whether of the test should be applied to the entire price structure of the platform or per side and whether the test should take into account the possibility of price structure modifications by the concerned undertaking.<sup>43</sup> In the case of online platforms this difficulty seems to be accentuated by a preceding lack of clarity concerning the identification of the candidate set of products or services.<sup>44</sup> Namely it is often difficult to establish whether the interaction among various separate customer groups facilitated by the online platform constitutes a single product or multiple ones for which the HMT should be should be performed. Although these difficulties are also capable of interfering with the market definition process they are not insurmountable nor do they always arise. The SSNIP test can in principle be applied in various forms in practice after which the relevance of the outcomes can be assessed in light of other forms of evidence. Furthermore the difficulty of identifying the candidate product or service in each case is not inherent in each analysis involving online platforms and will nevertheless be eventually overcome through practical experience. </p><p>By contrast, the use of zero-pricing strategies by online platforms will inevitably eliminate any evidentiary value resulting from the application of the SSNIP since such strategy removes the core aspect of the test itself, namely the positive price charged for the product or service offered by the concerned undertaking. The SSNIP test simulates a theoretical nominal increase in the price of the product or service provided by the concerned undertaking. This exercise is however mathematically impossible when the price of the product or service is zero: an increase of 5-10% of zero is still zero. The increase of a price of zero to any positive price is no longer a nominal one but a different thing altogether, as studies show that zero-pricing has a distinct impact on the customers\u2019 decision making process. Consequently, a theoretical increase in price as is intended in the context of a SSNIP test cannot be performed when defining the market for a zero-priced product or service.<sup>45</sup> The incompatibility between the price centred SSNIP and zero-pricing is not only a mathematical one but also a logical one. Online platforms that do not charge certain customer groups in return for their participation on the platform are very unlikely to switch from zero-pricing to positive pricing regardless of their market power.<sup>46</sup> Thus, posing the underlying question of the SSNIP test (or the HMT) even as a thought experiment is not entirely sensible since the theoretic scenario depicted, namely the raise of price cannot or at least will not occur in practice with respect to those customers. This outcome is rather problematic as the SSNIP test is the main source of indirect quantitative evidence of substitution for the purpose of the market definition. Consequently, the inability to relay on the SSNIP test, or on any price cantered quantitative tools for this matter, means that the relevant market may often be defined to a great deal based on qualitative indirect evidence. In order avoid this outcome and overcome the mathematical and logical incompatibility between the SSNIP test and zero-pricing strategies, alternative approaches for the SSNIP test have been developed which rely on a nominal change in quality or cost.<sup>47</sup></p><p>Although both approaches are theoretically sound from an economic point of view, the feasibility of their application in practice may differ significantly due to their respective practical complications. Therefore it is important consider and evaluate these proposals for modification in the context of online platforms relying on zero-pricing strategies in light of the legal and business reality of such actors in order to avoid findings and suggestions which may have solely theoretical relevance.       </p><p>1. Testing Substitution Based on Information and Attention Costs - An Attractive Yet Unworkable Alternative</p><p>Modifying the price oriented SSNIP into a cost oriented test, would mean that the purpose of the test would be to assess whether the concerned undertaking is capable of imposing a small but significant non-transitory increase in cost for customers in a profitable manner (SSNIC).<sup>48</sup> In the context of such a test, the costs for customers in the case of zero-priced markets are divided into information and attention costs.<sup>49</sup> Information costs refer to the amount of data that the customer needs to provide in order to make use of the free product or service.<sup>50</sup> Attention costs refer to the exposure of customers to advertisements during their use of the zero-priced product or service.<sup>51</sup> Both types of costs can be identified in the case of zero-priced products or services offered by online platforms.<sup>52</sup> Although these costs depict the existence of a certain form of trade or exchange that resembles that of monetary exchanges,<sup>53</sup> they are not fully compatible as a yardstick for a demand-side substitutability analysis in the case of online platforms. </p><p>Asking customers, particularly consumers, to evaluate their behaviour in light of theoretical increases in price is a wholly different matter than asking them to do the same with regard to an increase in information or attention costs. In contrast to prices, information or attention costs are far less comprehensible for consumers, and so their value among consumers may differ to great extent. Accordingly, theoretical increases in such costs are difficult to evaluate in an abstract manner. This may require that consumers must first experience such increase in order to make a decision on whether they will switch over to a competing undertaking. </p><p>The obscure nature of information and attention costs will also pose a challenge when the theoretical degree of increase in either cost will ultimately have to be translated in practice in a more specific manner. Both information and attention costs can come in a variety of shapes and forms, which can also be combined. Information costs can translate into sensitive and less sensitive types of personal data and the combination thereof. Attention costs can be translated into the number of ads displayed, the length of display, size of each ad, the frequency of their appearance as well a combination thereof. Although these elements represent a form of cost, they are different kinds of cost and there is no indication with regard to the kind of cost or combination thereof that is particularly relevant for the purpose of a SSNIC in the way the prices are relevant for the purpose of a SSNIP. Accordingly, if a SSNIC is to be adopted in practice, a methodology must first be developed with regard to establishing the relevant cost in each case. In the absence of such a methodology, which determines the relevant cost in each case, there is no possibility to test the theoretical increase of such cost in a statistical manner, as there will be no set reference point. Furthermore, the meaning of a nominal increase of information or attention costs is rather challenging. On the one hand, it is uncertain whether a 5-10% change is as important for consumers as in the case of a similar price increase, particularly when taking into account the \u2018free effect\u2019 of zero-prices that has been found to lead to overconsumption.<sup>54</sup> On the other hand some types of (personal) information increases, although minimal in terms of quantity, may be considered unreasonable thus giving the, possibly mistaken, impression that an increase of data by an online platform cannot be done in a profitable manner. For example job seekers may be less averse to providing their entire work experience history compared to stating the reasons behind their (perhaps involuntary) unemployment and transfer of work placements.     </p><p>On top of these considerations, the use of information and attention costs requires looking into a situation that may not be entirely realistic in the case of the online economy in general, nor in the case of online platforms in particular. This is because the SSNIC test simulates an increase of cost with the sole purpose of maximising the profits of the concerned undertaking, as is the case of the SSNIP test.<sup>55</sup> In practice however, increases of information costs in the case of online platforms are often linked to product or service improvements. Similarly, an increase of attention costs may be moderated by the increased relevance of advertisements, which may entail a certain added value for consumers.<sup>56</sup> Moreover, while an increase in attention costs can occur in practice it is not a suitable benchmark because attention costs, meaning exposure to advertisements, are not an inherent aspect of the business models of all online platforms. While some online platforms relay on advertisements as a primary source of revenue, other see it as a secondary source of revenue and some do not use it at all.<sup>57</sup> Consequently a hypothetical increase in attention costs, even when it is measurable, will not be an adequate test for demand-side substitution with respect to all online platforms. </p><p>Finally, theorising about an increase in information costs for the sole purpose of maximising profit without any product or service improvement may also not be sensible due to the legal framework covering such a situation. Under EU law the processing of personal data by online platforms falls under the scope of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).<sup>58</sup> The GDPR requires, in Article 5, that personal data is collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes and only to the extent that the data is truly necessary for such purposes. Following the collection of personal data, the processing should be done lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner. In light of these requirements it appears that an increase in information costs based on the SSNIC logic is rather problematic. The data that a platform requests from its users (data subjects in the sense of the GDPR) must serve a specific purpose that is communicated to such users. Accordingly increasing the amount of data required from users for the purpose of profit maximising (without any intention to improve the service provided by the platform) would entail disclosing such purpose to them so as not to breach Article 5 of the GDPR. It is evident that in practice undertakings, even dominant ones, would be reluctant to take such steps in order to get access to more user data and users may be less willing to accept such surcharge when it is posed in such a transparent manner. Furthermore, the same article also states that the collection of personal data should be limited to the absolute minimum necessary for the purposes for which it is collected. Therefore, an \u2018overcharge\u2019 of data for a given stated purpose, including service development, is essentially prohibited by the GDPR in light of its data minimisation objective.<sup>59</sup> Moreover, using personal data that was collected for the purpose of product development in a manner that does not relate to achieving such progress is equally not allowed unless specifically communicated to users, which in principle must first express their consent for such use.<sup>60</sup> In light of such legal framework, simulating an increase in information costs in the form of personal data seems rather futile given that the entire exercise may concern a situation that is unnatural or illegal and thus cannot occur due to other reasons than the lack of market power. In case the increase in information costs concerns primarily non-personal data the GDPR would not apply, however, users may be rather ambivalent to such \u2018overcharges\u2019 thus possibly resulting in erroneous findings of narrow markets that are worth monopolising.        </p><p>In light of the above, it can be said that although the economic logic behind the SSNIC test appears sound in theory, it is unsuitable for application in cases concerning online platforms in practice. The increase in attention costs is very difficult to quantify and will not be a suitable for evaluating the market power of an online platform where these costs do not constitute its only or at least main source of revenue. Similarly, the use of information costs entails a myriad of complexities with regard to the quantification thereof, which are complemented by the legal hurdles of the newly adopted GDPR that significantly hampers the collection and processing of personal data solely for profit maximising purposes. Consequently, a conversion of the SSNIP into a SSNIC cannot be recommended as it will require making highly complex decisions and adaptations with no real prospect of being as reliable as the SSNIP in non-zero-priced markets. </p><p>By contrast, the suggestion to modify the SSNIP test into a quality-centred test, as discussed below, may constitute a feasible option. Although such a conversion also entails overcoming multiple practical challenges, it constitutes a more suitable test for general application. The benchmark of quality can be applied to any possible online platform and the relation between quality and substitution has long been recognized in competition law practice. Furthermore, unlike in the case of information costs, the current legal framework applicable to online platforms does not stand directly in the way of theorising changes in the quality of a product or a service. </p><p>2. Quality as a Benchmark for Testing Substitution \u2013 The Intuitive Choice That May Deliver   </p><p>Testing demand substitutability based on quality entails some similar practical complexities as in the case of a cost-based test despite the soundness of its economic foundation. In the context of a quality-oriented test, the core question will concern the effect of a small but significant non transitory decrease in quality (SSNDQ), which is comparable to an increase of price from an economic perspective.<sup>61</sup> The quality of a product or service has long been recognized as one of the main criteria based on which undertakings compete with each other in the context of digital markets, particularly in light of zero-pricing strategies.<sup>62</sup> This is to be expected since, in the absence of positive prices, consumers will inevitably make their decision to use a product or service based on some form of quality considerations. That being said, it is also true that consumers will find it more difficult to assess quality instead of prices.<sup>63</sup> Thus, using quality as a benchmark for a quantitative assessment of demand substitutability in the context of online platforms remains problematic. Similar to the case of information or attention costs, choosing the relevant quality for the purpose of the assessment is not as straightforward as choosing prices in the case of the SSNIP. Quality is a general term that can encompass a wide variety of criteria.<sup>64</sup> In the case of online platforms, the criteria covered may include privacy, user friendliness, security and others.<sup>65</sup> Given that different kinds of online platforms will compete based on different quality parameters, the relevant quality that needs to be the subject of the SSNDQ test will likely differ from case to case. Therefore, as in the case of a SSNIC, a methodology must first be developed with regard to establishing the quality that should be tested in each case. When dealing with a two- or multisided online platform, it must also be considered whether the quality that is being tested will solely concern the zero-priced side of the platform or the other sides as well. For example, reducing the user friendliness of an ordering system of a marketplace for consumers may also result in a decrease in the quality of the order system for the sellers participating in the online marketplace. Such an application would be incorrect if the purpose of the SSNDQ is to test the degree of demand side-substitution of consumers alone. In any event, however, the test should take into account the interrelation between the various sides of the platform when considering the profitability of a certain quality change.<sup>66</sup> Accordingly, when simulating a decrease of quality on one side of the platform that leads to a loss demand (customer switch) on that side of the platform, it is important to consider what is the consequence of such reduced demand with respect to the other side(s) of the platform. In other words, testing the profitability of the quality decrease by the platform should take into account the relevance of the indirect network effects between the various sides of the concerned platform.<sup>67</sup></p><p>Furthermore, the meaning of a nominal increase or decrease of quality in such cases must also be defined and translated into practice while taking into account the effect that zero-pricing has on consumers. It must be established whether a 5-10% decrease is suitable in the case of quality and how such a change can be measured in practice.<sup>68</sup> To the extent that the required decrease is higher than 5-10%, it should be considered from a policy perspective whether the results of such an assessment are comparable to those of the SSNIP test when applied to positive prices. Additionally, it should be noted that in many cases in the digital economy, it is the development of a certain product or service quality that is very costly rather than its provision to the consumers once it has been developed.<sup>69</sup> Accordingly, in such cases testing a hypothetical decrease of quality might not be representative of the true situation in practice, as an undertaking will have no incentive to reduce quality if such a reduction will not result in a significant increase of revenue.<sup>70</sup> Moreover, when dealing with the quality of a certain online platform, it is important to keep in mind that some aspects thereof are also dependent upon the customer groups present on the platform. This remains true even when the consumer is not entirely aware of the source of quality or the lack thereof. For example, an online marketplace may be in charge of curating the variety of products offered however the price, shipment costs, quality of goods and after sales services may also depend substantially on the sellers. Thus when choosing a quality that is tested in the context of a SSNDQ, the role of such shared accountability for quality between the online platform and its participants must be taken into account. In this regard the regulatory framework that applies to the concerned platform in a given case should be considered as the obligations and liabilities of online platforms may also determine the scope of qualities that can be tested. Testing a degradation of qualities that fall more within the legal ambit of the platform participants rather than that of the platform itself would be conceptually erroneous.    </p><p>In this regard it is worth noting that the term online platform, does not constitute a category of undertakings nor does it refer to a specific sector of the economy. Rather, online platforms can be best seen as the undercarriage upon which an undertaking can be developed. The undertaking that eventually emerges on the market, from both a legal and commercial perspective, depends on the value that the platform intends to create for its various customer groups and the governance of such a platform. Currently there is no platform-specific regulation,<sup>71</sup> however online platforms will generally fall under the scope of various EU and national rules in the areas of competition, consumer protection, personal data protection and free movement.<sup>72</sup> The applicability of this general legal framework is unfortunately not always consistent, as it was not designed in a manner that foresees the contractual realities of the platform economy.<sup>73</sup> Consequently, establishing the legal framework for an online platform for the purpose of determining the qualities that may be tested in the context of a SSNDQ is something that will need to be done on a case-by-case basis. In this respect, the recent case of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Uber</emphasis> demonstrates the importance of performing an inquiry into the business model and governance of the online platform. Although Uber maintained that it is an intermediary that facilitates the interaction between consumers and self-employed drivers, its platform governance led to a different legal qualification, namely one that resembles an employer.<sup>74</sup> The importance of such a legal qualification of a platform cannot be overstated in the context of a SSNDQ and a competition law analysis as a whole. The legal qualification of a platform determines namely what kind of intermediary it constitutes, if at all. In the case of Uber the spectrum of legal qualifications entails at least three options: an information society service provider as claimed by Uber; an intermediary in the field of transport as indicated by the CJEU;<sup>75</sup> and an employer in the field of transport as found by national courts.<sup>76</sup> Each of the three qualifications entails a different legal framework and consequently a potentially different scope of qualities that can be tested for the purpose of a SSNDQ. In the case of the legal qualification of Uber as an employer, Uber is in fact no longer considered a two-sided platform, which means that replacing the SSNIP for the SSNDQ is no longer needed. If Uber is no longer a two-sided platform, demand-side substitution of consumers for Uber can be tested based on the positive prices they are charged for the rides, as the drivers are no longer a separate customer group of Uber but a part of it.<sup>77</sup></p><p>In light of the above, it can be observed that the SSNDQ is sound from a substantive perspective, however, its application requires the development of an analytical and preferably also legal framework that regulate the selection of the relevant qualities to be tested in each case. In the absence of such a framework, the extensive modifications required to transform the SSNIP into a quantitative test suitable for zero-priced markets may add a layer of legal uncertainty to the existing criticism concerning the current SSNIP test.<sup>78</sup> Despite the identified hurdles in the process of adapting the SSNIP test to zero priced markets, the realisation of the SSNDQ may be a welcome step in the journey of adapting the current competition law practice to the reality online markets. In this regard it is worth noting that the importance of the abovementioned exceeds the mater of the SSNIP test alone. The complexities concerning zero-pricing depicted above can also be expected when considering other quantitative tools used for the purpose of defining the relevant market such as price correlations, co-integration analysis and critical loss analysis, since these are equally price-oriented tools.<sup>79</sup> Thus while the SSNIP test provides a straightforward example of the inevitable complexities resulting from the use of zero-pricing by online platforms for current practice, their implications may concern the entire quantitative evidence tool kit. Therefore, it is important that this conversation of the SSNIP test into a SSNDQ is pursued as a first stage to what may become the conversion of the entire quantitative tool kit in the long run so as to ensure compatibility with cases concerning zero-pricing.    </p><p>The fact that the current quantitative tools may not be suitable does not mean, however, that the market definition process cannot be performed in the case of zero-priced markets as such. Rather, this challenging situation highlights the fact that zero-priced markets, particularly in case of online platforms, will for the time being constitute cases where price oriented quantitative tests such as the SSNIP cannot be applied due to an evident absence of suitable data. Accordingly, in such cases the market definition process will have to be based primarily on non-quantitative evidence sources as it has been prior to the introduction of such tools. Although situation confirms that current practice is sufficiently flexible so as to be applied even in rather novel scenarios, it does not means that such partial compatibility is a desired or constitutes a sustainable outcome for long term purposes. </p><p>IV. Back to (Some) Basics and Plans for the Future - A Temporary SSNIP Free Market Definition </p><p>The definition of the relevant product market has initially been performed by drawing a comparison of the price, characteristics and functionalities of the product or service concerned.<sup>80</sup> In Article 102 TFEU cases, such an approach to the definition of the relevant product market even appears to prevail.<sup>81</sup> The seminal case of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">United Brands</emphasis> is a textbook example wherein the market definition was executed predominantly according to qualitative evidence.<sup>82</sup> Following the introduction of the Commission Notice on the Relevant Market in 1997, the definition of the relevant market often resulted from a combination of quantitative evidence as well as non-quantitative sources of evidence depending on the amount of available data.<sup>83</sup> According to some scholars, this combined approach will eventually lead to a shift in favour of the quantitative evidence sources, leaving non-quantitative evidence to serve as a secondary check.<sup>84</sup> It is important to note that even if one were to be convinced of such a development in practice, the increased evidentiary value and use of quantitative evidence would only be possible in situations where sufficient data is available for this purpose. When that is not the case, non-quantitative evidence will always provide the most important guidance with regard to the market definition.<sup>85</sup> The reliance on non-quantitative evidence in light of the absence of price data can be observed in the case law of the EU Courts as well as the decisional practice of the Commission.<sup>86</sup> In the context of the recent mergers dealing with free products or services in digital markets the discussion around the relevant market was based entirely on qualitative considerations regarding the various functionalities and uses of the concerned products or services.  </p><p>In the merger between Microsoft and Skype the Commission noted that competition among consumer communication services (and thus substitutability) initially depends on the offering of several key functionalities in a package that is provided without cost to consumers.<sup>87</sup> The success of the players, who fulfil these criteria and are accordingly within this relevant market, is then depended on their ability to innovate and improve such services or products.<sup>88</sup> In the merger between Facebook and WhatsApp the Commission found that the markets for consumer communication and social networking services were prone to offerings of free services.<sup>89</sup> The competitive relation between Facebook and WhatsApp was therefore assessed in light of the functionalities and size of the networks the two undertaking were offering, as these aspects were considered to be the most important for consumer choice in the absence of prices.<sup>90</sup> According to the Commission the two undertakings were not close competitors in the market for consumer communication services nor in the market for social networking services due the differences in the functionalities of the WhatsApp and the Facebook messaging applications.<sup>91</sup> This functionality focused approach was also followed in a comparable manner in the merger between Microsoft and LinkedIn when the relevant product market for professional social networks, that are also offered free of monetary charge, was defined.<sup>92</sup> Similarly, in the tying case concerning Microsoft no mention was made with regard to that use of the SSNIP test to define the relevant market for media players which consisted of both free and priced media players (basic and premium versions). The definition of the relevant market for media players in that case was equally focused on the functionalities that were included in both free and paid versions of the media players offered by Microsoft and its competitors.<sup>93</sup> Finally in the recent case of Google Shopping the Commission explicitly chose to not use the SSNIP test when defining the relevant markets for general search services and comparison-shopping services because such services are provided for consumers without charge.<sup>94</sup></p><p>The definition of the relevant market for zero-priced products or services provided by online platforms in future cases will inevitably constitute analogous situations where the data needed for quantitative tests is not adequate for their application. This challenging situation that can be expected in the case of online platforms is, however, not of such magnitude so as to completely obstruct the definition of the relevant market as is showed by the previously mentioned cases. This is due to the fact that there is no legal obligation to rely on quantitative tools such as the SSNIP test, nor do these quantitative tools possess a higher evidentiary value compared to qualitative evidence.<sup>95</sup> Accordingly the process of the market definition can be performed in future cases even in the absence of a workable SSNIP test. However, this final outcome, wherein the most basic tools of competition law practice are the most suitable for the market definition of one of the most recent and innovative business practices, is admittedly rather ironic. Nevertheless, it does not mean that the reliance on non-price qualitative evidence will lead to unsatisfactory or erroneous findings in practice, nor should this be considered as an indication that the current practice has reached an impasse. Instead, this situation should be treated as a call to further the proficiency of the existing competition law framework and tools in a more future resilient manner. Therefore, it is important that the possibility to define the relevant market without the use of a working SSNIP alternative remains the exception rather than the rule in future practice when dealing with zero-pricing. Any other attitude towards this current state of practice would imply a return to the pre-SSNIP practice signifying a deterioration of current practice rather than a necessary side step in the process of its development. Therefore, even if the market definition process is not impeded as such in the case of zero-pricing, the conversion of the SSNIP test into a SSNDQ should be pursued for the benefit of competition law practice as a whole.    </p><p>The necessity to convert the SSNIP test into a quality centred SSNDQ in order to allow for the application of the HMT in a quantitative manner in future cases involving zero-pricing may indeed eventually lead to a broader acceptance and understanding of non-price competition. The path to a successful conversion will require a better comprehension of quality based competition which is becoming increasingly important in technology markets where competition for end-consumers is predominantly determined in terms of functionalities and the quality thereof.<sup>96</sup> In this regard a better understanding of non-price competition is not only important for defining markets and evaluating market power but also, and perhaps more importantly, for assessing the anti-competitive nature or effects of practices which are investigated for constituting potential infringements of Article 101 or 102 TFEU. If competition in certain situations does not occur based on price it implies that also a potential increase or decrease of consumer welfare in the context of such investigations will equally relate to the non-price aspects of the service or product offered to consumers. Therefore while the conversion of the SSNIP test can serve as a specific element of adapting current practice to the realities of online markets, the process towards achieving this goal, if pursued, will undoubtedly have greater significance for practice than the creation of a quantitative test for assessing substitution in situation concerning zero-pricing alone.       </p><p>V. Conclusion</p><p>The application of the SSNIP test in future cases concerning online platforms will undoubtedly require overcoming multiple substantive as well as practical challenges. The two- or multisided nature of online platforms will challenge the manner in which the SSNIP is applied due to the fact that the market definition for an online platform may result in multiple markets. When that is the case the application of the SSNIP, even in cases where prices are positive, will have to take into account the indirect network effects and demand interdependency between such markets when assessing the profitability of a theoretical increase in price. </p><p>In cases where the market definition concerns a product or service which is provided by the online platform without monetary charge, thus for a price of zero, the application of the SSNIP test is no longer possible from a substantive point of view. The absence of a positive price in such cases will prevent its application both as a quantitative tool for assessing substitutability as well as thought experiment used for a similar purpose. Theorising a price increase in relative terms will lead to a mathematical impossibility while theorising a price increase from zero to any positive price will be incompatible with the characteristics of competition among online platforms. In order to overcome these conceptual problems, the SSNIP test should be converted to a non-price centred test. </p><p>The conversion of the SSNIP into a SSNIC where demand substitution is tested based on increases in attention or information costs provides an attractive yet unsuitable solution for practice due to the significant complexities and uncertainties involved in such a modification. Although both types of costs play an important role in the business reality of online platforms generally speaking they are unfit as a benchmark for market power measurement which implies the ability to maximise profits without any improvement to the offered product or service. The increase of attention costs (exposure to more advertisements) may occur in practice however such form of revenue generation is often not linked to the core service provided by the platform and thus cannot serve as a test subject of market power. Furthermore, profit maximising increases in information costs (data sharing requirements) without any prospect of product improvements are uncommon and prohibited to a great extent by the GDPR therefore equally unsuited to be used for market power evaluations.      </p><p>In this regard, the conversion of the SSNIP into a SSNDQ constitutes an attainable and desirable option as the relationship between quality and competition has already been recognized and studied extensively. Nevertheless, realizing this conversion in practice requires additional adjustments so as to correctly incorporate the distinctive legal and economic nature of online platforms. Accordingly, a concreate procedure should be developed for choosing the relevant qualities to be tested in each case concerning a SSNDQ while taking into account the legal framework of the concerned platform in each case. Despite the complexity of such adjustments, the revision of the SSNIP test should be pursued in order to ensure the completeness of the current competition law tool kit by including both qualitative and quantitative tests. Therefore the creation of such a quantitative tool would in essence ensure a certain procedural equality between the definition of the relevant market in cases concerning two- or multisided platforms and cases dealing with single sided undertakings. Passing up on the conversion of the SSNIP to a SSNDQ however would create a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">de facto</emphasis> exception for cases concerning zero-pricing for which there is no legal or economic justification. Clearly such an outcome is not desirable as the adoption of the SSNIP test was aimed at increasing the trueness of the market definition in the first place. Furthermore, beyond reinstating a SSNIP equivalent for zero-pricing scenarios, the process of conversion will likely contribute greatly to current practice by facilitating further research in non-price competition and its implications for the existing (EU) competition law framework.  </p><p>Until the adaptations discussed in this paper are implemented, the process of the market definition in the case of online platforms (as well as other undertakings which rely on zero-pricing strategies), will have to rely on qualitative indirect evidence of substitution when direct evidence is not available, not sufficient or not helpful. Whether the application of these tools in practice will lead to satisfactory results is a matter that remains to be seen, however, it is important that in the meantime this practice does not become the rule in future cases and that further development of a more future resilient competition law framework is pursued.</p><p><sup>1</sup>See eg Commission, \u2018Staff Working Document on Online Platforms Accompanying the document Communication of Online Platforms and the Digital Single Market\u2019 (2016) COM(2016) 288 SWD, 172.</p><p><sup>2</sup>See eg ibid;

That distortion has led to the collapse of the media business model, leaving a space filled with conspiracy theories, self-reinforcing filter bubbles and voter manipulation.</p><p>Essential poll: Australians losing faith in government handling of Covid</p><p>After steadfastly refusing to take accountability for the dissemination of fake news and disinformation on its platform, Facebook last week threatened to block real news from the accounts of its Australian users if pay for content becomes law.</p><p>Google too has warned users their service is at risk, making veiled threats of ending free internet search while revving up YouTube creators in suggesting they will be disenfranchised and disadvantaged if they have to explain how they make their money off news content.</p><p>Its a brazen show of strength premised on the notion that the millions of Australians who search and scroll on their platforms will continue to stare into their screens even without the fact-based journalism that for many is an anchor point of their online engagement.</p><p>So what do we human bargaining chips think? Results in this weeks Guardian Essential Report should serve as a caution to the Silicon Valley overlords, with majority support for propositions that reinforce the Morrison governments roadmap to sustain the ailing news media.</p><p>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is drafting code of conduct legislation to force technology platforms, like Google and Facebook, to pay media organisations for the news content they distribute. In response Facebook has threatened to stop its users sharing news and Google has warned its free web search is at risk. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statements?</p><p>The clear impression from the public responses to these propositions is that the public agrees there should be some form of recalibration. Not only do they think its reasonable to pay for news, a majority also believe that the platforms have too much power. While there are high numbers of uncommitted, the core statements break against the platforms 2:1.</p><p>Dig under the headline figures and two trends emerge: first, support for bringing big tech to account is skewed older (as is usage of the platforms as a primary news source); but more significantly, the issue breaks stronger with Coalition voters long conditioned to oppose regulation of any kind.</p><p>Perhaps thats a result of the simple fact it is a Morrison government initiative, bought forward with the vigorous support of the Murdoch press, which sees obvious self-interest in the legislation. But this should not be a reason to reject it out of hand.</p><p>There is a very, very narrow section on a Venn diagram showing the crossover of Murdoch self-interest and national interest but the proposition that the big tech platforms should pay for premium journalism content is bang in the middle of that graph.</p><p>While a proposition that supports News Ltds business model will stick in the craw of many progressives, the reality is that without its advocacy the Morrison government would be unlikely to be pushing this issue.</p><p>The legislation is not perfect. After rejecting another recommendation from the ACCC to adequately fund public broadcasting, the omission of the outlets from this part of the code creates a two-tier media, with the real risk that the platforms use this free content instead. More glaringly, there is no requirement the negotiated payment would be spent on actual journalists, rather than filling the pockets of shareholders something that should be persuasive in future negotiations.</p><p>Morrison warns Facebook and Google he wont respond well to any threats over news code</p><p>These reservations aside, if you believe (as I do) that these companies need to be regulated before they roll over the top of democracy, the question is: if the government wont step up with the urging of Murdoch, then when will it? Establishing a beachhead of regulation around media content is an important first step in the broader project civilising surveillance capitalism.</p><p>Second are concerns (vigorously fuelled by Google and Facebook) that the changes will give News Ltd even greater power in the Australian media, a power it repeatedly uses to pile on progressives and run partisan campaigns. But the dominance of Murdoch in the Australian media is a symptom of the medias decline, not justification for its ongoing erosion. Fair funding for the use of journalistic content is our best chance of supporting other publishers, such as Guardian Australia, to build viable models to invest in civic journalism.</p><p>And finally, to the extent that News Ltd abuses its power, it does so in plain sight: there is nothing subtle about the old-school media mogul wielding influence for power. Their nefarious activities are baked into our political system and because we understand them, we have the opportunity to respond.</p><p>In contrast, Facebook and Googles excesses occur behind the algorithm: the softly, softly seduction, the extraction of personal information and the repurposing of our reality, is done under the slick veneer of progress. Remember Cambridge Analytica ?</p><p>By drawing this line in the sand, Facebook and Google have actually fessed up to how significant these regulations are, a chance to establish not just national but global ground rules that could help quell the takeover of our public square with lies and bile.</p><p>And if they make good on their threat to walk, then maybe we will have the chance to reimagine what our public square could be. A separate question in this weeks report suggest we will find a way through.</p><p>Three-quarters of us say we will go to a news website and choose the news for ourselves, while more than half will find another social platform. Yes, the majority predict they will read less news, but 30% say they would also use Facebook less.</p><p>For companies whose value lies in their human network, these are the highest stakes. If you start using your humans as bargaining chips, you risk losing them altogether. Lose your network and you are just another website.</p><p>Peter Lewis is executive director of Essential Media and director of the Australia Institutes Centre for Responsible Technology. He will discuss this weeks results with Guardian Australia political editor Katharine Murphy at 1pm on Tuesday</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECONNW-en080911</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECONNW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PFB-KWD1-F0R9-T2D1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">173751</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1160\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 RIA OREANDA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Economic News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"51811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 8, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It is incumbent on operators now to act and put in place measures that protect their customers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If I am brutally honest, this is an area where the betting industry has not historically covered itself in glory. We can and should do more.</p><p>If anyone in the online sector has reservations about what I am saying here then I would only point to what has happened in the retail betting industry. Fixed-odds betting terminals have long been acknowledged as a social concern but not enough was done by operators over the years to mitigate their impact.</p><p>The Government was forced to act, with proposals for regulation that are likely to have a significant impact on the bottom lines of retail bookmakers. Because it is the right thing to do for our customers and because it will help to protect our long-term sustainability as an industry, Sky Betting &amp; Gaming is putting forward a four-point plan to the online gambling sector.</p><p>First, we must use customer data to understand player behaviour, and monitor for signs of harm. Second, we have to promote safer gambling by improving the accessibility, awareness and understanding of self-help tools such as deposit limits and cool-offs.</p><p>Third, we must interact with customers who show signs of harm, discuss their gambling behaviour with them, and present details of their behaviour clearly. Finally, we will have to increase our interventions with customers to stop them harming themselves in the most extreme cases.</p><p>Over the EFL playoff final weekend, we also launched a specific initiative that we hope will ensure a healthier relationship between gambling and sport. This year, we wanted to use the event to remind fans that nothing should get in the way of this enjoyment. Not even their betting.</p><p>That's why we ramped up our safer gambling marketing campaign so that throughout the weekend on TV, in the press, on the radio and at Wembley, fans could see messages reminding them to stay in control of what they spent with us.</p><p>The matches over the weekend also saw, for the first time, our new safer gambling shirt sleeve logos. These logos will be visible on every player in every game across the EFL from the start of next season. Over the course of next season, we expect more than 18m people to attend fixtures and millions more following through the media to see this message.</p><p>We also want to use our sponsorship of the EFL to help those in the game. Research shows that professional sportsmen are three times more likely to be problem gamblers, and are often the last to ask for help. That's why we've launched a new \u00a31m education programme in partnership with the EFL and its clubs, designed to ensure that players and staff understand the risks associated with gambling across all sports, the rules around betting integrity, and know how to look out for signs of potential gambling-related harm in their teammates.</p><p>I would also stress to government that our ability to intervene with problem gamblers depends on our capacity to invest in high-skilled staff and the technology of the future. This will be hampered by the Government's current proposals to raise remote gaming duty to compensate for the loss of revenue from fixed-odds betting terminals.</p><p>There are more equitable solutions out there - such as applying VAT to the marketing spend of offshore betting operators or taxing other big tech companies who don't pay their fair share of tax - and we would urge the Treasury to look at these instead. Sky Betting &amp; Gaming, for the record, is proudly based in Yorkshire.</p><p>It is a balance of sensible regulation from government and self-regulation from industry that is needed.

According to the complaint[2], ClubCorp allegedly failed to return over $10 million in membership initiation deposits to members as required by membership contracts or, if members could not be located, escheat their deposits to the state Controller's Office ('SCO'); counted members' deposits as part of their assets; and omitted the deposits in reports to the SCO. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, restitution, civil penalties, damages, and attorney's fees and costs.FTC Holds Hearing on Competition and Consumer Protection Featuring Attorneys General and Staff The Federal Trade Commission[3] ('FTC') held its final session of its Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century[4], which featured Nebraska AG Doug Peterson, Louisiana AG Jeff Landry, South Dakota AG Jason Ravnsborg, and Tennessee AG Herbert Slatery, as well as senior consumer protection, antitrust, and data privacy staffers. </p><p>According to reports[5], the AGs and staff discussed the need for greater federal and state involvement in protecting competition in the technology industry and increasing transparency regarding use of personal data, among other things. As previously reported[6], the National Association of Attorneys General submitted comments to the FTC, signed by a bipartisan coalition of 43 AGs, noting similar antitrust and data privacy concerns.Data Privacy ...curityNew York Legislature Passes Bill Expanding Data Security and Consumer Privacy Protections The New York Legislature passed the Stop Hacks and Improve Electronic Data Security ('SHIELD') Act, submitted by New York AG Letitia James[7], that would expand the state's data breach law and Internet Security and Privacy Act. The bill, S5575B[8], expands the definition of 'personal information' to include additional information such as biometric information, email addresses, and corresponding passwords or security questions and answers; expands the definition of 'data breach' to include unauthorized access to private information; applies data breach notification requirements to any entity that owns or licenses data containing private information of a state resident; and specifies reasonable data security requirements depending upon the size of a business. The bill is pending[9] the Governor's signature and, if signed, will go into effect 90 days after enactment, except for the section of the bill applying data breach notification requirements to additional entities, which will go into effect 240 days after enactmentFTC Settles With Auto Dealer Software Provider Over Allegedly Failing to Protect Consumers' Personal Information The Federal Trade Commission[10] ('FTC') reached a settlement with auto dealer software provider LightYear Dealer Technologies, LLC d/b/a DealerBuilt ('DealerBuilt') to resolve allegations that it failed to protect consumers' personal information in violation of the FTC Act and Safeguards Rule of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. According to the complaint[11], DealerBuilt allegedly failed to impose access controls or authentication protections for personal and financial data it stored and transmitted, failed to address an insecure connection to its backup network for 18 months, failed to perform adequate vulnerability testing, and failed to develop and implement written information security policies, allegedly leading to a breach of its backup database in October 2016. Under the terms of the decision and order[12], DealerBuilt must cease maintaining consumers' personal information until it implements a comprehensive information security program and submit to the FTC biennial third-party assessments of its information security program, among other things.FTC Warns that Claims of 'Participation' in International Privacy Frameworks Are False Unless Participation Is Certified The Federal Trade Commission[13] ('FTC') reached a settlement with background screening company SecurTest, Inc. and issued warning letters to 15 other companies over allegations that they falsely claimed compliance with international privacy requirements in violation of the FTC Act. According to the complaint[14], SecurTest allegedly falsely claimed on its website that it participated in the European Union ('EU')-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks\u2014which establish processes to allow companies to transfer consumer data from those foreign jurisdictions to the United States in compliance with those jurisdictions' laws\u2014when, in reality, it never received certification of compliance with the frameworks. Under the terms of the decision and order[15], SecurTest is enjoined from misrepresenting its participation in either framework and must monitor compliance with the terms of the order. In letters[16] to 15 companies, the FTC warned the companies that claims of 'participation' in international privacy frameworks, including the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor and U.S.-Swiss Harbor frameworks and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ('APEC') Cross-Border Privacy Rules system, when they are not in fact certified participants, are false and violate the FTC Act. The letters instruct the companies to remove the claims from all of their public documents.FTC Releases Agenda For Fourth Annual Workshop on Consumer Privacy and Data Security The Federal Trade Commission[17] ('FTC') released the agenda for its fourth annual PrivacyCon, a workshop on research and trends related to consumer privacy and data security. The agenda[18] details four sessions of presentations and discussions on topics such as privacy policies, disclosures, and permissions; the impact of the European Union General Data Protection Regulations on web privacy; consumer preferences, expectations, behaviors, and understanding and attitudes about digital privacy and online tracking; online advertising; mobile applications; and data vulnerabilities, leaks, and breach notifications. PrivacyCon 2019 will take place on June 27, 2019, at the Constitution Center in Washington, D.C., and is open to the public.EnvironmentCalifornia Attorney General Settles With Automotive Replacement Parts Retailer and Distributor Over Allegedly Improper Disposals of Hazardous Waste and Consumer Personal Information California AG Xavier Becerra[19] reached a settlement with automotive replacement parts retailer and distributor AutoZone, Inc. over allegations that it disposed of hazardous and universal waste at unauthorized landfills in violation of the state's Hazardous Waste Control Law and Consumer Privacy Act. According to the final judgment and permanent injunction on consent[20] ('Consent Judgment'), AutoZone allegedly disposed of hazardous and universal waste\u2014including batteries, aerosol cans, electronic devices, and receptacles containing auto fluids\u2014at landfills not authorized to accept hazardous waste, allowed its customers to deposit hazardous auto fluids and other waste into trash containers in its stores' parking lots, and disposed of customers' records without rendering customers' personal information unreadable. Under the terms of the Consent Judgment, AutoZone must pay $8.9 million in civil penalties, $1.35 million towards environmental projects, and $750,000 to reimburse investigative and enforcement costs, but may earn a $1 million credit towards the penalties by undertaking at least $2 million in environmental enhancement work not required by law, among other things.False Claims ActMaryland Attorney General Settles With Information Technology Companies Over Allegedly Misrepresenting Software to State Health Benefit Exchange Maryland AG Brian Frosh[21] and the U.S. Department of Justice[22] ('DOJ') reached separate settlements with Curm Software Ltd. and Curm Software, Inc. (collectively, 'Curm') and its parent, International Business Machines Corporation ('IBM') over Curm's role, as a subcontractor, in the failed launch of Maryland's health exchange website in violation of the federal and state False Claims Acts. According to the settlement agreement[23], Curm allegedly failed to deliver on what it promised, resulting in the botched development and launch of the website, which crashed shortly after launching in October 2013. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the parties must pay $2.8 million to the state, which includes restitution and will accrue interest, and pay $12 million to the United States. As previously reported[24], AG Frosh reached a settlement in 2015 with Noridian Healthcare Solutions LLC, the lead contractor hired to build the state's health exchange website, over similar allegations.For-Profit Colleges45 Attorneys General and CFPB Settle With Lender Over Allegedly Offering Deceptive Student Loans 45 AGs, led by Kentucky AG Andy Beshear[25], and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau[26] ('CFPB') reached separate settlements with lender Student CU Connect CUSO, LLC ('CUSO') to resolve allegations that it offered deceptive loans to students in violation of the federal Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 and the states' and the District of Columbia's unfair trade practices and consumer protection laws. According to the AGs' assurance of voluntary compliance[27] ('AVC') and the CFPB's complaint[28], CUSO allegedly issued loans to students of for-profit college ITT Technical Institute ('ITT Tech') who it knew were likely to default on their loans, did not understand the terms of their loans, or did not realize they had taken out loans. Under the terms of the AGs' AVC and the CFPB's proposed stipulated judgment[29], CUSO must forgive over $168 million in debt for former ITT Tech students, cease collecting on and discharge outstanding loans, and seek deletion of tradelines in students' credit reports relating to these loans.PharmaceuticalsNew York Attorney General Issues Cease and Desist Letters to 44 Pharmacies Over Allegedly Failing to Post Prices for Commonly Prescribed Drugs New York AG Letitia James[30] issued cease and desist letters to 44 pharmacies over allegations that they failed to post prices of commonly prescribed drugs in violation of the state's consumer protection law. According to the AG's office, the pharmacies allegedly failed to maintain and update weekly the list of prices of the most commonly prescribed drugs (the 'Drug Retail Price List') and post conspicuous signage notifying consumers that the list is available for their review. The letters, which are not publicly available, reportedly demand that the pharmacies come into full compliance within 15 days of receipt of the letter.UtilitiesNew York Attorney General Settles With Fuel Supplier Over Allegedly Failing to Deliver Fuel to Consumers New York AG Letitia James[31] reached a settlement with fuel supplier Ferrellgas Partners LP ('Ferrellgas') to resolve allegations that it failed to deliver fuel to consumers. The AG's office and news reports do not disclose the statutory authority the AG asserted to reach this settlement. According to the AG's office, Ferrellgas allegedly failed to deliver fuel to consumers, causing consumers to nearly or completely run out of fuel, and failed to provide live customer service for consumers to contact. According to the AG's office, under the terms of the settlement, Ferrellgas must pay $75,000 in costs to the AG's office, compensate consumers who experienced a disruption to their fuel supply, reimburse consumers for certain disruption-related expenses, increase its fuel storage capacity in the state, expand its customer service operations at certain locations, and obtain additional trucks to ship and deliver fuel.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, the lead on the case, was supportive of the development, but made clear that other states would manage the investigations of search and Android separately. While attorneys might see the benefit in splitting up search and advertising investigations, platforms like Google need to be understood as a coherent whole. If the state AGs case is truly concerned with the overall impact on the welfare of consumers, it will need to be firmly grounded in the unique economics of this platform. </p><p>Back in September, 50 state AGs, including those in Washington, DC and Puerto Rico, announced an investigation into Google. In opening the case, Paxton said that[2], 'There is nothing wrong with a business becoming the biggest game in town if it does so through free market competition, but we have seen evidence that Google's business practices may have undermined consumer choice, stifled innovation, violated users' privacy, and put Google in control of the flow and dissemination of online information.' While the original document demands[3] focused on Google's 'overarching control of online advertising markets and search traffic,' reports since then suggest that the primary investigation centers on online advertising. Defining the market Since the market definition is the first and arguably the most important step in an antitrust case, Paxton has tipped his hand and shown that the investigation is converging on the online ad market. Yet, he faltered when he wrote in The Wall Street Journal that[4], 'Each year more than 90% of Google's $117 billion in revenue comes from online advertising. For reference, the entire market for online advertising is around $130 billion annually.' As Patrick Hedger of the Competitive Enterprise Institute was quick to note[5], Paxton cited global revenue numbers and domestic advertising statistics. In reality, Google's share of the online advertising market in the United States is 37 percent and is widely expected to fall[6]. When Google faced scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission in 2013, the leaked staff report[7] explained that 'the Commission and the Department of Justice have previously found online 'search advertising' to be a distinct product market.' This finding, which dates from 2007, simply wouldn't stand today. Facebook's ad platform was launched in 2007 and has grown to become a major competitor to Google. Even more recently, Amazon has jumped into the space and independent platforms like Telaria, Rubicon Project, and The Trade Desk have all made inroads. In contrast to the late 2000s, advertisers now use about four different online ad platforms[8]. Moreover, the relationship between ad prices and industry concentration is complicated. In traditional economic analysis, fewer suppliers of a product generally translates into higher prices. In the online ad market, however, fewer advertisers means that ad buyers can efficiently target people through keywords. Because advertisers have access to superior information, research[9] finds that more concentration tends to lead to lower search engine revenues. The addition of new fronts in the state AGs' investigation could spell disaster for consumers. While search and advertising are distinct markets, it is the act of tying the two together that makes platforms like Google valuable to users and advertisers alike. Demand is tightly integrated between the two sides of the platform. Changes in user and advertiser preferences have far outsized effects on the overall platform value because each side responds to the other. If users experience an increase in price or a reduction in quality, then they will use the platform less or just log off completely. Advertisers see this change in users and react by reducing their demand for ad placements as well. When advertisers drop out, the total amount of content also recedes and users react once again. Economists call these relationships demand interdependencies. The demand on one side of the market is interdependent with demand on the other. Research[10] on magazines, newspapers, and social media sites all support the existence of demand interdependencies. Economists David Evans and Richard Schmalensee, who were cited extensively in the Supreme Court case Ohio v. American Express, explained[11] the importance of their integration into competition analysis, 'The key point is that it is wrong as a matter of economics to ignore significant demand interdependencies among the multiple platform sides' when defining markets. If they are ignored, then the typical analytical tools will yield incorrect assessments. Understanding these relationships makes the investigation all that more difficult. The limits of remedies Most likely, this current investigation will follow the trajectory of Microsoft in the 1990s when states did the legwork for a larger case brought by the Department of Justice (DoJ). The DoJ already has its own investigation into Google and will probably pull together all of the parties for one large suit. Google is also subject to a probe by the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee as well. What is certain is that Google will be saddled with years of regulatory scrutiny, but what remains unclear is what kind of changes the AGs are after. The investigation might aim to secure behavioral changes, but these often come with a cost in platform industries. The European Commission, for example, got Google to change its practices with its Android operating system for mobile phones. Much like search and advertising, the Android ecosystem is a platform with cross subsidization and demand interdependencies between the various sides of the market. Because the company was ordered to stop tying the Android operating system to apps, manufacturers of phones and tablets now have to pay a licensing fee[12] in Europe if they want Google's apps and the Play Store. Remedies meant to change one side of the platform resulted in those relationships being unbundled. When regulators force cross subsidization to become explicit prices, consumers are the one who pay.The absolute worst case scenario would be a break up of Google, which has been a centerpiece of Senator Elizabeth Warren's presidential platform[13]. As I explained last year[14], that would be a death warrant for the company:[T]he value of both Facebook and Google comes in creating the platform, which combines users with advertisers. Before the integration of ad networks, the search engine industry was struggling and it was simply not a major player in the Internet ecosystem. In short, the search engines, while convenient, had no economic value. As Michael Moritz, a major investor of Google, said of those early years, 'We really couldn't figure out the business model. There was a period where things were looking pretty bleak.' But Google didn't pave the way. Rather, Bill Gross at GoTo.com succeeded in showing everyone how advertising could work to build a business. Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin merely adopted the model in 2002 and by the end of the year, the company was profitable for the first time. Marrying the two sides of the platform created value. Tearing them apart will also destroy value. The state AGs need to resist making this investigation into a political showcase. As Pew noted[15] in documenting the rise of North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein to national prominence, 'What used to be a relatively high-profile position within a state's boundaries has become a springboard for publicity across the country.' While some might cheer the opening of this investigation, consumer welfare needs to be front and center. To properly understand how consumer welfare might be impacted by an investigation, the state AGs need to take seriously the path already laid out by platform economics. For the sake of consumers, let's hope they are up to the task.  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F01%2F14%2Fthe-state-ags-investigation-against-google-needs-to-put-consumers-first%2F...kname=The%20State%20AGs%E2%80%99%20Investigation%20Against%20Google%20Needs%20to%20Put%20Consumers%20Firsthttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F01%2F14%2Fthe-state-ags-investigation-against-google-needs-to-put-consumers-first%2F...kname=The%20State%20AGs%E2%80%99%20Investigation%20Against%20Google%20Needs%20to%20Put%20Consumers%20Firsthttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F01%2F14%2Fthe-state-ags-investigation-against-google-needs-to-put-consumers-first%2F...kname=The%20State%20AGs%E2%80%99%20Investigation%20Against%20Google%20Needs%20to%20Put%20Consumers%20Firsthttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F01%2F14%2Fthe-state-ags-investigation-against-google-needs-to-put-consumers-first%2F...le=The%20State%20AGs%E2%80%99%20Investigation%20Against%20Google%20Needs%20to%20Put%20Consumers%20FirstThe\">https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F01%2F14%2Fthe-state-ags-investigation-against-google-needs-to-put-consumers-first%2F...kname=The%20State%20AGs%E2%80%99%20Investigation%20Against%20Google%20Needs%20to%20Put%20Consumers%20Firsthttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F01%2F14%2Fthe-state-ags-investigation-against-google-needs-to-put-consumers-first%2F...kname=The%20State%20AGs%E2%80%99%20Investigation%20Against%20Google%20Needs%20to%20Put%20Consumers%20Firsthttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F01%2F14%2Fthe-state-ags-investigation-against-google-needs-to-put-consumers-first%2F...kname=The%20State%20AGs%E2%80%99%20Investigation%20Against%20Google%20Needs%20to%20Put%20Consumers%20Firsthttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F01%2F14%2Fthe-state-ags-investigation-against-google-needs-to-put-consumers-first%2F...le=The%20State%20AGs%E2%80%99%20Investigation%20Against%20Google%20Needs%20to%20Put%20Consumers%20FirstThe</url> post The State AGs' Investigation Against Google Needs to Put Consumers First[16] appeared first on Truth on the Market[17].

As more and more people turn to Alexa, Siri, Google Home, and other applications, the need to provide them with efficient and effective interactions is critical. That's where artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly comes into play.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With machine learning, speech-based systems can become better and more accurate over time. AI enables systems to improve as they collect more utterances, applying the data to recognize and better inform future pronunciations, speech patterns, languages, and dialects. An improved ability to grasp sentiment and context with AI is the latest hotbed of activity for technology providers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Year in Review</p><p>It's no longer unusual to be in a public setting and see people \"talking to themselves\"--or, rather, talking to their phones and devices. AI-driven speech technology is helping to make these human-to-technology interactions more seamless and effective.</p><p>Still, says Carlos Melendez, chief operating officer of Wovenware, a product development firm, \"While everyone's talking about AI, adoption is still in its early stages.\"</p><p>Companies haven't yet figured out how to use AI in a targeted way to solve business problems, and businesses need \"to get their data out of silos and clean and prepare it to run the AI programs,\" he explains.</p><p>This year RELX, a global provider of information-based analytics and decisioning tools for professional and business customers, released its second annual RELX Emerging Tech Executive Report, which highlights how executives use and view AI technologies. The report shows a jump in AI use from 48 percent in 2018 to 72 percent in 2019, with 93 percent of business leaders saying that these technologies have a very or somewhat positive impact within their industry (compared to 69 percent in 2018). AI has been used across industries, the report says, to increase efficiencies and productivity, streamline processes, and reduce costs.</p><p>It's a time for adoption, experimentation, and innovation, says Bradley Metrock, author of More Than Just Weather and Music: 200 Ways to Use Alexa and CEO of Score Publishing. The past year did see some significant AI-related highlights, he says, noting that Google moved its powerful Duplex AI to the web, where more people can take advantage of it for conversational commerce; Amazon layered new features on top of Alexa, such as \"Alexa, what am I holding?\" [which Echo Show will then show you]; and Samsung introduced a system by which voice applications for its Bixby virtual assistant actually can write themselves, with initial guidelines from a creator provided.</p><p>The speech and voice recognition market is expected to be worth $26.8 billion by 2025, growing at a compound annual rate of 17.2 percent, according to a report by Meticulous Research, which also finds that AI holds the largest share of the overall voice and speech recognition market.</p><p>Technological developments in the field of speech-related AI are creating hyper-personalized customer experiences that will dominate the growth of voice-activated devices in the coming years, the research firm concluded.</p><p>Additionally, it expects widespread acceptance of AI technology, especially in education, e-commerce, healthcare, and financial services.</p><p>A Look Ahead</p><p>Adoption of AI-powered speech and voice recognition technology is, of course, just the cost of entry. In addition to adoption, says Bill Hobbib, senior vice president of marketing at DataRobot, in 2020 there will be an increased and more concerted focus on linking AI projects to key performance indicators, such as revenue growth, cost reduction, and enhanced customer experience. \"Executives also will place greater emphasis on change management and encourage greater involvement from business users--rather than just data scientists or specialist teams--to increase their AI capabilities across more lines of business and processes,\" he says.</p><p>The new year will also see a continued focus on making the shift from conversations to conversational AI, says Joe Petro, vice president and chief technology officer at Nuance Communications. \"Conversational</p><p>interfaces will begin to enable deeper interactions between human beings, with eyes and heads away from keyboards and screens and the spoken voice making a comeback,\" he says. \"In a doctor's office, patients will become more literate hearing medical terms described to them that before only lived in the notes of an [electronic healthcare record]. Consumers will become educated investors listening to their financial advisers deliver more transparency than ever before.\"</p><p>As conversational designers enable machines to more effectively understand and predict the intent of different users--including sarcasm--we will see better adoption than ever before.</p><p>Alex Lang, cofounder and chief operating officer of Tuya Smart, providers of a global IoT platform, agrees. \"One of the ways AI technologies have advanced in recent years, and will continue to advance in the next few years,\" Lang says, \"is its integration with other technologies, like facial recognition or voice recognition, which unlock new capabilities for the AI and IoT industries.\"</p><p>For example, he says, \"We're working to help voice recognition hear voices through more layers of sound or develop specific responses customized for each device.\"</p><p>In addition, adds Melendez, AI will both enable and destroy deepfakes--the use of deep learning and massive data to create alternative versions of a face, voice, or body in images, video, audio, or other media. While technology will allow deepfakes to gain momentum, \"this technology can also be used to spot the imposters and stop them in their tracks,\" he says. \"In 2020, the tech giants, such as Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, will undertake larger initiatives to weed out and destroy deepfakes.\"</p><p>Another area likely to see some change in 2020 related to AI is regulation, experts say.</p><p>\"With the Cambridge Analytica scandal, deepfakes, and TikTok, legislators recognize the importance of regulation,\" Melendez says. In fact, he points out, \"California has already made it illegal to issue deepfakes of political candidates within two months of an election. The appetite and momentum for legislation to combat bad internet actors is expected to heighten in the new year.\"</p><p>AI will increasingly be applied to automatic speech recognition (ASR) in ways that will be disruptive, says John Milliken, CEO of Speechmatics. ASR, he says, is poised to disrupt many sectors, including contact centers, media and broadcasting, compliance, policing, and more. He points to some specific examples of how these impacts are likely to be applied:</p><p>* contact centers--providing real-time speech-to-text and data analytics to customer service representatives; and</p><p>* financial service providers--assuring compliance in real time with company, industry, and government standards.</p><p>In 2020, says Metrock, \"expect Amazon, as well as the other competitors in the voice AI space, to amp up the functionality and features they share with the public that can be done using these voice assistants. For AI to continue to develop toward being more proactive and context-driven, and ultimately more useful for humans, these big tech companies need to succeed in driving more day-to-day utility from these assistants.\"</p><p>Not yet using AI to help fuel and improve your speech technology applications?

The U.S. Patriot Act, devised and enacted only weeks after 9/11 in 2001, has become a huge symbol of the massive expansion of government surveillance in the U.S. Twelve years later, ...</p><p>Co-Founder and CEO of  Startpage , the world\u2019s most private search engine.        The U.S. Patriot Act, devised and enacted only weeks after 9/11 in 2001, has become a huge symbol of the massive expansion of government surveillance in the U.S. Twelve years later, in 2013, Edward Snowden\u2019s release of National Security Agency (NSA) material was the first major revelation that the government could illegally, and possibly unconstitutionally , seize the private records of millions of individuals who had not been suspected of any wrongdoing, and had been hiding all of this from its citizens for 12 years.     The history of mass surveillance in the U.S. runs deep. Examples include reports in 2013 from documents from Snowden detailing how the NSA is able to collect anyone\u2019s personal data via cellphones, laptops, search history, Facebook, Skype and chatrooms. According to a report from the Guardian , all of this allows the NSA to build what it calls \"a pattern of life,\" which is \"a detailed profile of a target and anyone associated with them.\"      The American government could choose to embark on more targeted surveillance, where the effects on the total population can be better monitored by overseeing institutions or judges and evaluated on a case-by-case basis, but the power enabled by mass surveillance has proven too enticing. When it became clear the information represented huge political and economic power, it led to \u201cfunction creep\u201d (when information is used for a purpose beyond the original specified one) because the lure of continuing or extending the surveillance was too strong to rein it in.    This, I believe, is ultimately why Patriot Act-related legislation was voted to be reauthorized earlier this year. The American government has chosen to let mass surveillance continue and typically justifies it by pointing to the prevention of terrorism, crime and child pornography, even if these aren\u2019t always the real reasons.    So, what\u2019s the state of mass surveillance by the U.S. government today, and where might it all go from here?    The rise of internet usage has certainly made it significantly easier for mass surveillance to take hold in a greater way. Just think about the amount of data people reveal about themselves when they use nonprivate search, for example. It\u2019s disappointing, but perhaps not surprising, that the U.S. Senate voted to allow law enforcement to continue collecting citizens\u2019 search and browsing history.     Big tech companies in particular often overlap with State interests by getting called upon to provide information in a \u201c surveillance intermediary \u201d role, but really this law suggests that any company based out of the U.S. can be forced to operate as a front post for U.S. government agencies.     Beyond nonprivate search, the data grasp easily expands with new social media and technology tools. And even when these technologies aren\u2019t based on U.S. soil, the American government often still manipulates mass surveillance to its advantage.     Take the ongoing feud between China and the U.S., which right now is being fought using intelligence and mass data as weapons. TikTok is one of the latest companies caught in the crossfire. The China-based app has been downloaded more than 2 billion times globally. Recent analysis from the Wall Street Journal found that until last November, TikTok had \" skirted a privacy safeguard in Google\u2019s Android operating system to collect unique identifiers from millions of mobile devices\" through an added layer of encryption. The tactic, which wasn\u2019t disclosed to the app\u2019s users, allowed the app to \"track users online without allowing them to opt out.\" Amid concerns that TikTok shares the data with the Chinese government, over half of adult Americans support a proposed national ban of the social media actor.     The Western world\u2019s attempts to limit the Chinese from building influence and gathering data can also be seen with the U.S. ban of Huawei\u2019s 5G wireless network equipment  and its pressure on other countries to do the same.    In both cases, if you think the bans are about protecting U.S. citizens, remember the data, information and power that are at stake, and think again. This is nothing short of digital warfare over data.    Looking forward, I believe artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning will be the next frontier for applications such as facial recognition for tracking, which is a big deal. Consider that previously you could choose not to activate the tracking on a cellphone or other device, but you can\u2019t go shopping and leave your face at home. The technology isn\u2019t perfect yet , particularly when many of us are wearing masks outside these days, but when it is, we\u2019ll be back to square one. With legislation typically way behind technological developments, it\u2019s scary to think how that data will be used without proper regulation.     While it\u2019s important not to shy away from the reality of today\u2019s state of mass surveillance, data-based power moves by the U.S. government haven\u2019t always, and won\u2019t always, win out over privacy. The most recent win was the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)  striking down the Privacy Shield in July; it felt there was too little protection against government mass surveillance in the U.S.     I support and champion the efforts made by Max Schrems and fellow Europeans defending their right to privacy and legislation to enforce it. I also recognize it\u2019s not easy nowadays to escape being a victim of mass surveillance, especially if your government prioritizes power over privacy and because technology makes it easier to carry out mass surveillance.     However, there are some steps you can take to shield your data. They involve getting educated about the level of security and protection provided by your choice of products and your country\u2019s legislation and perhaps adjusting your selections in cases, such as favoring technology companies that tend to place a higher emphasis on privacy.

State-level laws, they argue, are a Balkanized approach that could boost the power of the Big Tech players that both states and the federal government are looking to rein in.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dan Jaffe, group executive vice president of government relations for the Association of National Advertisers, has been a point man in this pushback, notably against the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The CCPA becomes law on Jan. 1 and compliance will cost businesses billions - that is, when they can figure out what to comply with, which Jaffe said remains a moving target.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jaffee spoke with Multichannel News about the implications of privacy by design, if that design is a patchwork of state approaches. Here's an edited transcript of that conversation.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: What are ANA's main problems with the California Consumer Privacy Act?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dan Jaffe:</emphasis> At the most fundamental level, it is that it is a single state law. We don't think that privacy rules work on a state-by-state basis. The business has already gone through a substantial amount of fragmentation and that is only going to increase in 2020 unless there is a federal law passed that pre-empts state laws.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: You say \"laws,\" so clearly the problem isn't just California.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DJ:</emphasis> Let me give you the quick list of what I know, and I may not be covering everything. There is CCPA, as well as a [California] data-broker registration bill that is not the same as a Vermont databroker bill. Nevada's new law goes into effect today [Sept. 30]. Maine has an ISP law and New Jersey has a major piece of privacy legislation with private-rights-of-action provisions in it. The attorney general of Ohio is talking about holding privacy hearings. ... You get the general gist.</p><p>Overlaying all of this is the [European Union's] General Data Protection Rules [which apply to any business over a certain size doing business in the EU, just as the CCPA applies to any business over a certain size doing business in the state].</p><p>I know a number of companies who have spent multi, multimillions of dollars to become GDPR compliant and are now spending millions on becoming CCPA compliant because of the differences in definitions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: Speaking of big money, the California attorney general's office has put out a regulatory impact statement. What trouble signs are in that report?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DJ:</emphasis> I have said since the outset that this was going to be a major tax on California consumers because I could see there were going to be major regulatory compliance requirements. Now the attorney general's report is talking about as much as $55 billion dollars in costs from the CCPA, and a further $16.9 billion in costs for compliance with the attorney general's [rules].</p><p>I don't want to be hyperventilating here, but the report says this is going to fall particularly hard on small business. Because of the way the act is designed, a relatively large number of relatively small businesses will be covered.</p><p>Big companies are going to be able to do well in this situation because they have compliance lawyers and IT experts and advertising experts. Companies midsize and below are going to have a very much harder time - and that is if everything goes smoothly.</p><p>Now, people may say that the privacy protections people have gotten outweigh all of these costs. I don't necessarily think that that's true.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: Obviously, you don't want this Balkanized model, but if it develops, is the free web content model sustainable?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DJ:</emphasis> For some, yes. The Tyrannosaurus Rexes survive, at least in the short run. But I don't know how Google and Amazon and all these other companies that started out in garages and dorm rooms would have done if they had faced all these restrictions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: But an already divided Congress fighting over impeachment is unlikely to come together on privacy legislation anytime soon.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DJ:</emphasis> To pass any major legislation when they don't like each other and they don't work well together is very hard. I don't know what's possible. I just know what's needed. We are going to make every effort to move [federal legislation] as far and as fast as we can. There is nothing more important that we are working on than privacy and data security issues.</p><p>A very large proportion of companies will say the same thing. And the situation is only going to get more difficult because there are 22 more states that seriously considered privacy legislation in 2019.</p><p>Unlike data security, where disparate laws still deal with a limited set of issues and, if you are complying with those requirements, you are likely complying with most data-security laws, this isn't the case with privacy. It has a large range of issues over billions and billions of transactions and an enormous number of parties from first parties to third parties to data suppliers to data trackers to publishers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCN: So the answer is national legislation.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DJ:</emphasis> Yes, and for the first time the industry is not split on that. I don't hear anybody say, \"Oh, we don't need national legislation.\"</p><p>One more thing, and this I think is a grenade that has been thrown into the process. Before the law takes effect and even before the attorney general has finished his rulemaking, Alastair Mactaggart [the California resident who pushed for the initial ballot initiative] is putting forward a new ballot initiative that will completely alter and add to the existing [CCPA]. We are in a never-ending compliance race. To use a legal term: It's a mess, and it's likely to get messier.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCHNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MCHNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X6K-84V1-DY5H-100C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">241792</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"946\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 NewBay Media LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Multichannel News</publicationName><volume>Vol. XL</volume><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 7, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000445</classCode><className>DATA PROTECTION LAWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001020</classCode><className>LEGISLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001384</classCode><className>PRIVACY RIGHTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUVFRDk5RDc1NUQ4NDE3MTk4REUxMzZEOTFGOTA5ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRCNkMxMjQzMDUxNEZCQ0I4QTkyQzJDOUYwNTA4NjE</classCode><className>Privacy Rights</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X84</classCode><className>US STATE GOVERNMENT</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA</classCode><className>State &amp;

Unlike the national government, these jurisdictions cannot print money or run deficits without violating their constitutions. States rely on sales and income taxes for revenue, which along with much of the economy has collapsed under the coronavirus pandemic . Without a big infusion of federal funds, states may have to lay off employees, take a scythe to social service programs and, who knows, maybe defund the police as well.   Federal help may not arrive soon. States received $150bn through the Cares Act for Covid-19 relief and the House passed a successor in May, the Heroes Act, which contains $915bn in flexible aid. But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has said he opposes borrowing more, suggesting instead states be allowed to file for bankruptcy.   The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, called that \u201cone of the saddest, really dumb comments of all time\u201d. Citing four-year balance of payment figures between states and the national government, Cuomo pointed out that his taxpayers \u201cput into that [federal] pot $116bn more than we take out. Kentucky takes out $148bn more than they put in. Senator McConnell, who\u2019s getting bailed out here?\u201d   Cuomo is the biggest star in a constellation of governors made famous by the pandemic. State governments are usually the neglected middle children of federalism: much of their work lacks both the drama of Washington and the fierce politics of school districts and city councils. The hollowing out of local journalism has reduced profiles further. Capital cities are for the most part midsize company towns, chosen to balance big metropolises and rural areas. Outside their states, the names of governors are usually trivia answers.   But this year, many governors are broadcasting daily briefings while Covid-19 case and death counts are tabulated by state as well as nationally. That\u2019s because states decide testing and quarantining protocols, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) must go through state, county and local governments to implement its directives. It\u2019s also because the current administration has essentially abdicated the role of the federal government in a pandemic, as set up by George W Bush and Barack Obama.   Absent a federal system to distribute medical supplies, governors compete to purchase them on the global market. They make life and death decisions about the reopening of schools, businesses and recreational areas. People protesting against Governor Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s stay-at-home order in Michigan brought their guns into the state senate gallery.   Looking beyond 30 June (and 3 November), more big decisions await. The fate of the Affordable Care Act lies with the supreme court through California v Texas, to be decided in 2021, pitting 21 state attorneys general against another 20. Reapportionment beckons too, with its implications for the balance of power and the shaping of policy agendas.   So it is a good moment to look at the powers of the states in the federal system, and how those powers have been wielded in a period of Republican dominance.   \u2022\u2022\u2022   In the last decade, Republicans built on reapportionment and a backlash against Obama to take control of many state governments. In 2010 Democrats held the governor\u2019s mansion and legislative majorities in 27 states to 14, with eight split. By 2017, Democrats held 14 and Republicans 32, with only three states divided. Today, the count stands at Republicans 21, Democrats 15 and 13 divided. The totals come to 49 because Nebraska has a unicameral legislature, elected on a non-partisan basis.   To understand the reddening of the map, it pays to go back to 1973, when the American Legislative Executive Council (Alec) began devoting attention to state politics. Alexander Hertel-Fernandez has published State Capture: How Conservative Activists, Big Businesses and Wealthy Donors Reshaped the American States \u2013 and the Nation , a detailed history of Alec; the State Policy Network, an association of more than 60 thinktanks founded in 1986; and Americans for Prosperity, the grassroots action network created by Charles Koch in 2004. Together this \u201ctroika\u201d spends $240m a year lobbying and campaigning at state level.   Alec attests to the virtues of coordinated advocacy. Hertel-Fernandez characterizes it as an uneasy yet stable coalition of business representatives, conservative activists and wealthy donors. Alec writes model bills and brings them, sometimes at all-expenses paid retreats, to state legislators who lack the experience, staff and session time to generate such on their own. Where Republicans have controlled both chambers and governorships, the bills have moved forward.   Tort reform measures were an early success. Organizational effectiveness grew when Alec sorted itself into taskforces by industry sector. Big tech focused on climate change; big oil and gas dominated energy. Another source of power lay in Alec\u2019s low public profile, which persisted until the killing of Trayvon Martin in 2012 led progressives and journalists to Alec\u2019s door via its support for \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws, the Florida version of which was successfully used as a defense for Martin\u2019s assailant, George Zimmerman.   Hertel-Fernandez\u2019s database of model bills from 1995 to 2013 reveals that the most popular topic has been education (charter schools, vouchers, cutbacks of teacher union powers), followed by medical liability. Those are big state budget items.   Still, as Matt Grossman shows in his study, Red State Blues: How the Conservative Revolution Stalled in the States , there have been limits to what Republicans have accomplished. He agrees with Hertel-Fernandez that in the 1990s the GOP became \u201ca full-throated national conservative party responsive to an activist base\u201d, united in pursuing \u201csmaller government, unfettered capitalism, less redistribution, traditional values, social restoration, nationalism, and safety through security in every state\u201d. Reviewing state governments\u2019 outputs and impacts, he finds that Republicans have enacted more abortion restrictions, loosened laws on gun use and ownership and blocked liberal initiatives. They have enlarged their political power by crushing unions and inhibiting voter registration and turnout.   These are no small things, but otherwise the GOP has not moved states right. Republicans have not gotten far on shrinking government programs and regulations. They have not overridden and reversed \u201cthe build-up of decades of policy liberalism\u201d. The minimum wage has risen. Only 6% of students are in charter schools and very few receive education vouchers. More states are taking Medicaid money.   Why? Grossman identifies a variety of factors, notably the inertia of the status quo, boosted by the constituencies for big programs they foster.   In The Divided States of America: Why Federalism Doesn\u2019t Work , Don Kettl puts these developments in historical perspective. He traces the dynamics of federalism from its inception. The current division of labor within the compound republic of James Madison\u2019s design has the federal government setting policy directions by issuing laws and regulations and dispensing money to the states, which administrate the programs with private contractors. It\u2019s a top-down but not top-heavy iteration. Since the late 1960s, the welfare state has been mediated and varied by state and local government actions.   For example, a federal agency, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, distributes one-quarter of all federal spending but has only 6,000 employees, half as many as Harvard Medical School and one-tenth that of the Mayo Clinic. The heavy lifting and often maddening complication of US healthcare results from the processing of CMS dollars. It\u2019s a similar deal with environmental policy, infrastructure, education and prisons.   \u2022\u2022\u2022   Given their overstructured and underfunded condition, what can the states do to square their budgets and better address the pandemic\u2019s havoc?   First, a state\u2019s voters can switch party control. In Virginia, a Democratic majority elected in 2019 passed measures to protect LGBTQ residents, help undocumented migrants, improve the environment, fund roads and other transportation projects via a hike in the gas tax, and become the 38th state of ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, which will put it into the constitution if the courts agree.   Nevertheless, as Grossman would predict, Virginia Democrats fell short in their ambitions. A ban on assault weapons never got a vote in the senate and failed in a house committee. Neither chamber approved a repeal of the right-to-work law. Campaign finance reform has seen little action.   Related: Lawsuit could force secretive network promoting rightwing laws into the open   Second, citizens can vote with their feet. The pandemic has accelerated telework, consumption of streamed cultural products and reliance on shipped goods, making it more palatable for people to live where costs are lower. Taxing Amazon and Netflix at higher rates would be a timely option.   Third, and most important, Louis Brandeis\u2019s adage about the states being the \u201claboratories of democracy\u201d still carries great potential. Kettl details the trailblazing record of California in enacting car emissions measures accepted by the automotive industry, which could not afford to forgo sales there. He also describes the success of Wisconsin Works, a welfare program initiated by the Republican governor, Tommy Thompson, and adopted throughout the country.   Thus, if and when a state comes up with a workable way to wriggle out of the Covid-19 squeeze, voters, residents, industries, other states and the federal government will take note. That\u2019s the American federalist approach. It\u2019s the best shot we have.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42572358901</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60B8-05B1-F07F-82S0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1680\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Yahoo!

Unlike the national government, these jurisdictions cannot print money or run deficits without violating their constitutions. States rely on sales and income taxes for revenue, which along with much of the economy has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/09/canada-coronavirus-us-justin-trudeau-donald-trump\">collapsed under the coronavirus pandemic</url>. Without a big infusion of federal funds, states may have to lay off employees, take a scythe to social service programs and, who knows, maybe <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/09/canada-coronavirus-us-justin-trudeau-donald-trump\">defund the police</url> as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Federal help may not arrive soon. States received $150bn through the Cares Act for Covid-19 relief and the House passed a successor in May, the Heroes Act, which contains $915bn in flexible aid. But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has said he opposes borrowing more, suggesting instead states be allowed to file for bankruptcy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/09/canada-coronavirus-us-justin-trudeau-donald-trump\">called that</url> \"one of the saddest, really dumb comments of all time\". Citing four-year balance of payment figures between states and the national government, Cuomo pointed out that his taxpayers \"put into that [federal] pot $116bn more than we take out. Kentucky takes out $148bn more than they put in. Senator McConnell, who's getting bailed out here?\"</p><p>Cuomo is the biggest star in a constellation of governors made famous by the pandemic. State governments are usually the neglected middle children of federalism: much of their work lacks both the drama of Washington and the fierce politics of school districts and city councils. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/09/canada-coronavirus-us-justin-trudeau-donald-trump\">hollowing out of local journalism</url> has reduced profiles further. Capital cities are for the most part midsize company towns, chosen to balance big metropolises and rural areas. Outside their states, the names of governors are usually trivia answers.</p><p>But this year, many governors are broadcasting daily briefings while Covid-19 case and death counts are tabulated by state as well as nationally. That's because states decide testing and quarantining protocols, and the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/09/canada-coronavirus-us-justin-trudeau-donald-trump\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</url> (CDC) must go through state, county and local governments to implement its directives. It's also because the current administration has essentially abdicated the role of the federal government in a pandemic, as set up by George W Bush and Barack Obama.</p><p>Absent a federal system to distribute medical supplies, governors compete to purchase them on the global market. They make life and death decisions about the reopening of schools, businesses and recreational areas. People protesting against Governor Gretchen Whitmer's stay-at-home order in Michigan<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/09/canada-coronavirus-us-justin-trudeau-donald-trump\">brought their guns</url> into the state senate gallery.</p><p>Looking beyond 30 June (and 3 November), more big decisions await. The fate of the Affordable Care Act lies with the supreme court through California v Texas, to be decided in 2021, pitting 21 state attorneys general against another 20. Reapportionment beckons too, with its implications for the balance of power and the shaping of policy agendas.</p><p>So it is a good moment to look at the powers of the states in the federal system, and how those powers have been wielded in a period of Republican dominance.</p><p>In the last decade, Republicans built on reapportionment and a backlash against Obama to take control of many state governments. In 2010 Democrats held the governor's mansion and legislative majorities in 27 states to 14, with eight split. By 2017, Democrats held 14 and Republicans 32, with only three states divided. Today, the count stands at Republicans 21, Democrats 15 and 13 divided. The totals come to 49 because Nebraska has a unicameral legislature, elected on a non-partisan basis.</p><p>To understand the reddening of the map, it pays to go back to 1973, when the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/09/canada-coronavirus-us-justin-trudeau-donald-trump\">American Legislative Executive Council (Alec)</url> began devoting attention to state politics. Alexander Hertel-Fernandez has published <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/09/canada-coronavirus-us-justin-trudeau-donald-trump\">State Capture: How Conservative Activists, Big Businesses and Wealthy Donors Reshaped the American States - and the Nation</url>, a detailed history of Alec; the State Policy Network, an association of more than 60 thinktanks founded in 1986; and Americans for Prosperity, the grassroots action network created by Charles Koch in 2004. Together this \"troika\" spends $240m a year lobbying and campaigning at state level.</p><p>Alec attests to the virtues of coordinated advocacy. Hertel-Fernandez characterizes it as an uneasy yet stable coalition of business representatives, conservative activists and wealthy donors. Alec writes model bills and brings them, sometimes at all-expenses paid retreats, to state legislators who lack the experience, staff and session time to generate such on their own. Where Republicans have controlled both chambers and governorships, the bills have moved forward.</p><p>Tort reform measures were an early success. Organizational effectiveness grew when Alec sorted itself into taskforces by industry sector. Big tech focused on climate change; big oil and gas dominated energy. Another source of power lay in Alec's low public profile, which persisted until the killing of Trayvon Martin in 2012 led progressives and journalists to Alec's door via its support for \"stand your ground\" laws, the Florida version of which was successfully used as a defense for Martin's assailant, George Zimmerman.</p><p>Hertel-Fernandez's database of model bills from 1995 to 2013 reveals that the most popular topic has been education (charter schools, vouchers, cutbacks of teacher union powers), followed by medical liability. Those are big state budget items.</p><p>Still, as Matt Grossman shows in his study, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/09/canada-coronavirus-us-justin-trudeau-donald-trump\">Red State Blues: How the Conservative Revolution Stalled in the States</url>, there have been limits to what Republicans have accomplished. He agrees with Hertel-Fernandez that in the 1990s the GOP became \"a full-throated national conservative party responsive to an activist base\", united in pursuing \"smaller government, unfettered capitalism, less redistribution, traditional values, social restoration, nationalism, and safety through security in every state\". Reviewing state governments' outputs and impacts, he finds that Republicans have enacted more abortion restrictions, loosened laws on gun use and ownership and blocked liberal initiatives. They have enlarged their political power by crushing unions and inhibiting voter registration and turnout.</p><p>These are no small things, but otherwise the GOP has not moved states right. Republicans have not gotten far on shrinking government programs and regulations. They have not overridden and reversed \"the build-up of decades of policy liberalism\". The minimum wage has risen. Only 6% of students are in charter schools and very few receive education vouchers. More states are taking Medicaid money.</p><p>Why? Grossman identifies a variety of factors, notably the inertia of the status quo, boosted by the constituencies for big programs they foster.</p><p>In <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/09/canada-coronavirus-us-justin-trudeau-donald-trump\">The Divided States of America: Why Federalism Doesn't Work</url>, Don Kettl puts these developments in historical perspective. He traces the dynamics of federalism from its inception. The current division of labor within the compound republic of James Madison's design has the federal government setting policy directions by issuing laws and regulations and dispensing money to the states, which administrate the programs with private contractors. It's a top-down but not top-heavy iteration. Since the late 1960s, the welfare state has been mediated and varied by state and local government actions.</p><p>For example, a federal agency, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, distributes one-quarter of all federal spending but has only 6,000 employees, half as many as Harvard Medical School and one-tenth that of the Mayo Clinic. The heavy lifting and often maddening complication of US healthcare results from the processing of CMS dollars. It's a similar deal with environmental policy, infrastructure, education and prisons.</p><p>Given their overstructured and underfunded condition, what can the states do to square their budgets and better address the pandemic's havoc?</p><p>First, a state's voters can switch party control. In Virginia, a Democratic majority elected in 2019 passed measures to protect LGBTQ residents, help undocumented migrants, improve the environment, fund roads and other transportation projects via a hike in the gas tax, and become the 38th state of ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, which will put it into the constitution if the courts agree.</p><p>Nevertheless, as Grossman would predict, Virginia Democrats fell short in their ambitions. A ban on assault weapons never got a vote in the senate and failed in a house committee. Neither chamber approved a repeal of the right-to-work law. Campaign finance reform has seen little action.</p><p>Second, citizens can vote with their feet. The pandemic has accelerated telework, consumption of streamed cultural products and reliance on shipped goods, making it more palatable for people to live where costs are lower. Taxing Amazon and Netflix at higher rates would be a timely option.</p><p>Third, and most important, Louis Brandeis's adage about the states being the \"laboratories of democracy\" still carries great potential. Kettl details the trailblazing record of California in enacting car emissions measures accepted by the automotive industry, which could not afford to forgo sales there. He also describes the success of Wisconsin Works, a welfare program initiated by the Republican governor, Tommy Thompson, and adopted throughout the country.</p><p>Thus, if and when a state comes up with a workable way to wriggle out of the Covid-19 squeeze, voters, residents, industries, other states and the federal government will take note. That's the American federalist approach. It's the best shot we have.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-64350453</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60B7-BF61-JCJY-G1F6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1610\"/><timeReceived>11:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

As president, she'd have an even tougher time convincing Congress \u2014 even if Democrats held both chambers.The big picture: A President Warren could immediately translate some of her progressive ideals into the policy of the land through executive order, but her best-known, most ambitious plans would have to go through Congress. And she's virtually assured to lack the kind of majorities she'd need to pass them, according to Democratic staffers and former White House officials from both parties. Details: Even under the most optimistic scenario for Democrats \u2014 keeping the House and narrowly winning back the Senate from the Republicans \u2014 Warren wouldn't have solid Democratic support for her biggest ideas, including the wealth tax, Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. </p><p>Her college debt plan would likely get a major rewrite from fellow Democrats, in a best case scenario. They're unlikely to go along with a full repeal of the GOP tax cut to set the stage for her corporate profits tax, according to Senate Democratic aides. And she'd have a solid wall of Republican opposition in the Senate, regardless of who wins the majority.Warren's answer to that problem is to eliminate the filibuster[1] so Democrats can pass legislation with a simple majority \u2014 but she'd have a hard time doing that since some Democrats, like Kyrsten Sinema[2], say they'd never support it. What they're saying: 'I don't think it's inappropriate for a candidate to campaign on her aspirations for the country, and to try to build support for a bigger vision than what is currently on offer,' said Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, who headed the White House Domestic Policy Council under Barack Obama and isn't working for any of the presidential campaigns. 'At the same time, I also think it's important to level with the country, because a big bold vision ultimately can take years to accomplish, and will require more than one election and much more than one leader.'Paul Winfree, who served as deputy director of the Domestic Policy Council under President Trump, said Warren would need Congress to pass 'virtually everything of significance' on health care, banking, taxes, student loans and other issues. The other side: If Warren wins the White House, she could do some significant things through executive action \u2014 including tougher antitrust enforcement to try to break up the Big Tech companies, as Axios' Margaret Harding McGill points out. Warren could appoint an aggressive Financial Stability Oversight Council to provide much tougher oversight of America's biggest banks, Axios' Felix Salmon notes, even if it couldn't go quite as far as separating commercial banks from investment banks entirely. (Her proposed 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act[3] would still require legislation.)On insulin, EpiPens, and the anti-inflammatory drug Humira, Warren says she'd be able to reduce the price of some costly drugs and delivery devices through executive actions[4]. That could mean using existing legal authority[5] to bypass or re-license their patents; and pursuing antitrust action against Humira manufacturer AbbVie.She couldn't ban all fracking without approval from Congress, but she could ban it on federal lands, per Axios' Amy Harder \u2014 and that could still have a significant impact, even though most oil and gas is produced on private and state lands. She could also reinstate environmental regulations Trump has repealed and make them even more aggressive. Warren could effectively decriminalize border crossings, not by changing the law but through instructions from the Justice Department telling federal prosecutors not to prosecute those crimes, Axios' Stef Kight reports. The Warren campaign insists she could pass one of her most popular ideas \u2014 the wealth tax \u2014 through a budget reconciliation process that requires a simple majority vote in the Senate, and that she could use executive action to implement significant changes on health care, gun control and the environment. \"Elizabeth has a proven record of making our governmentwork for every person, not just the wealthy and well-connected. She will use every tool available to do the same as president,\" said campaign spokesperson Saloni Sharma.Other variables may affect what Warren could or couldn't do if she wins \u2014 like the state of the economy by 2021, and any unforeseen crises. The bottom line: Warren has built a campaign on her ability to lead through bold ideas, so it's a good idea for supporters and critics alike to be clear-eyed about what she can actually get done.Go

So everybody keeps asking \u2014 what time is it? But none of the clocks have hands.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Every decade since, the global markets have relived this party. In the late 1960s the mania was for the \"nifty 50\" American companies like Disney and McDonald's, which had been the \"go-go\" stocks of that decade. In the late 1970s it was for natural resources, from gold to oil. In the late 1980s it was stocks in Japan, and in the late 1990s it was the dot-com boom.</p><p>Last decade, investors flocked to mortgage-backed securities and big emerging markets from Brazil to Russia. In every case, many partygoers were still in the market when the crash came.</p><p>Today, tech mania is resurgent. Investors are again glancing at a clock with no hands \u2014 and dismissing the risk. The profitless start-ups that were wiped out in the dot-com crash have consolidated into an oligopoly composed of leading survivors such as Google and Apple. These are giants with real earnings, yet signs of a irrational euphoria are growing.</p><p>One is pitchmen bundling investments with very different outlooks into a single package. Last decade they bundled Brazil, Russia, India and China to sell as the BRICs.</p><p>More recently they packaged Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google as FANG, then, as names and prospects shifted, subbed in Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft to make Faama. Others are hyping the hottest tech companies in China as BAT, for Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent.</p><p>Whatever the mix, acronym mania is usually a sign of bubbly thinking. Seven of the world's 10 most valuable companies are in the tech sector, matching the late 1999 peak. As the American stock market keeps marching to new highs \u2014 the Dow has hit 22,000 \u2014 the gains are increasingly concentrated in the big tech stocks.</p><p>The bulls say it is inevitable that Apple will become the first trillion-dollar company. No matter how surreal the endgame, booms tend to begin with real innovation. In the past, manias have been triggered by excitement about canals, the telegraph and the automobile.</p><p>But not since the advent of railroads incited market booms in the 1830s and 1840s has the world seen back-to-back booms like the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and the one we are in now. The dot-com era saw the rise of big companies that were building the nuts and bolts of the internet \u2014 including Dell, Microsoft, Cisco and Intel \u2014 and of start-ups that promised to tap its revolutionary potential.</p><p>The current boom lacks a popular name because the innovations \u2014 from the internet of things to artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 are sprawling and hard to label. If there is a single thread, it is the expanding capacity to harness data, which the Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, calls the \"electricity of the 21st century\".</p><p>Market excitement about authentic technology innovations enters the manic phase when stock prices rise faster than justified by underlying economic growth. Since the crisis of 2008, the US economy has been recovering at the rate of around 2 per cent, roughly half the rate seen for much of the past century.</p><p>The areas of growth are limited in this environment. Oil's not very euphoric, with prices depressed, while regulators are forcing banks to keep the music down. In the most direct echo of 1999, technology is once again seen as the best party in town.</p><p>It is true that prices today are not quite as widely overvalued as in 1999. Large technology stocks are up 350 per cent this decade, the low end of the range for the hot stocks from earlier booms, which saw gains of 300 to 1,900 per cent.</p><p>Only a few select technology companies \u2014 mainly the internet giants \u2014 are trading close to the valuations of the dot-com era, when the average price-to-earnings ratio for tech companies hit 50. The average ratio for that sector today is 18.</p><p>However, the scale of today's tech boom is not readily visible because much of the investment action has moved into the hands of big private players. In 1999, nearly 550 start-ups went public, and after many ended in disaster, the government tightened regulation of public companies.</p><p>In part to avoid that red tape, this year only 11 tech companies have gone public. Many are raising money instead from venture capitalists or private equity funds.</p><p>Venture capitalists have poured more than $60 billion into the technology sector every year for the past three years \u2014 the highest flows since the peak in 2000 \u2014 and private equity investors say there has never been a better time to raise money.</p><p>These new private funding channels are creating \"unicorns\", companies that haven't gone public but are valued at $1 billion or more. Unicorns barely existed in 1999.</p><p>Now there are more than 260 worldwide, with technology companies dominating the list. And if signs emerge that the privately owned unicorns are faltering, the value of publicly owned tech companies is not likely to hold up either.</p><p>We can never know when the end will come. Still, there are three critical signals to watch for. The first is regulation.</p><p>The tech giants are seen today as monopolising internet search and commerce, and they are angling to take over industries such as publishing and automobiles, raising alarms at antitrust agencies in Europe and the US. Fear that new internet technologies are doing more to waste time and brainpower than to increase productivity has already provoked a backlash in China, where officials recently criticised online gaming as \"electronic heroin\".</p><p>A regulatory crackdown on tech giants as either monopolies or productivity destroyers could pop the allure of tech stocks. The other signals are more familiar.</p><p>Going back to the \"nifty 50\" stocks of the 1960s, nearly every big market mania ended after central banks tightened monetary policy and many people who had borrowed to get in the game found themselves in trouble. The dot-com bubble peaked in 2000, after the Federal Reserve had increased interest rates multiple times.</p><p>The current boom will likewise be at risk if an increase in inflation compels the Fed to raise interest rates beyond the modest rise the market currently expects. Finally, watch for tech earnings to start falling short of analyst forecasts.</p><p>The dot-com boom was driven in part by increasingly optimistic predictions for technology company earnings, and it imploded when earnings started to miss badly. Investors realised then that their expectations about profits from the internet revolution had become unreal. Of course, no two booms will unfold exactly the same way.</p><p>We are now eight years into this bull market, making it the second longest in history, behind only the run-up of the late 1990s.

Everyone with an internet feed and access to a YouTube channel can be famous for a brief time, and this is a revolution that is constantly being televised. Though there is much to enjoy about the democratic potential of the internet, it is also home to some very dark chambers. People with malign motives and dreadful desires can lurk anonymously online and wait for their opportunity to strike. An investigation by The Times has uncovered more than 100 cases in which young people who have been streaming their lives on YouTube have been targeted by the unscrupulous and persuaded to undress or to take up sexualised poses. Children are promised payment in the valuable online currency of extra subscribers if they comply.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Clearly, the tendency of some young people to want to live out part of their life in public creates an opportunity for exploitation. It is very easy for paedophiles who visit YouTube, owned by Google, to find children online, merely by tapping in a few simple keywords. They can then communicate instantly and directly with the children who are posting there by using the comments section on the site. Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat also offer a live streaming service to children.</p><p>Experts in child safety warn regularly of the danger of parents using the internet as a form of babysitting. The more conscious young people are of the possible dangers the better. Still, it ought to be possible for young people to stream incidents from their lives and not be subject, as The Times has discovered they are, to gruesome requests to mimic sex acts or take their clothes off.</p><p>The principal responsibility in such instances always lies with the perpetrators. They need to be identified, tracked down and prosecuted. That process would be considerably easier, however, if YouTube, the channel on which a third of children between the ages of six and ten are now broadcasting at least some of their everyday actions, were to do more to intervene. In 2017 Google dropped the requirement for a user to have 10,000 subscribers or more before being permitted to live-stream from a smartphone. Now, almost anyone can do so, which has vastly expanded the range of children live-streaming.</p><p>The Home Office has accused the big tech companies of not doing enough to tackle abuse online and that accusation seems merited in this instance. YouTube failed to remove half the livestreamed videos even though it had been alerted anonymously, by our reporter, to their presence.</p><p>One commenter had been asking young girls to show their bodies in return for subscribers. That commenter had not been banned from the site. It is unfathomable why not when, according to Jonathan Krause, an expert in countering online crime, some of the comments made could constitute Category A violations, which are considered the most serious type in sentencing guidelines for child sexual abuse offences.</p><p>YouTube should have acted quicker to close channels down. Although YouTube has a minimum user age of 13 it needs to do more to verify the ages of those who are live-streaming and a lot more to regulate the freedom of anonymous people to comment. The very least we can expect is that the company should respond with greater severity when the issue is pointed out.</p><p>The internet is such a vast terrain that it is beyond the capacity of the state to take on the job of online invigilator and it would be inimical to the freedoms of the internet if it were to become too heavy handed in attempting to do so. Yet that requires greater responsibility from the providers than they are showing. The tech companies will leave governments with no other option, if they do not get serious, than to intervene. They will not be able to say they had not been warned.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-144442316</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TXR-BMC1-DYTY-C38N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"633\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 2, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 10, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Everyone with an internet feed and access to a YouTube channel can be famous for a brief time, and this is a revolution that is constantly being televised. Though there is much to enjoy about the democratic potential of the internet, it is also home to some very dark chambers. People with malign motives and dreadful desires can lurk anonymously online and wait for their opportunity to strike. An investigation by The Times has uncovered more than 100 cases in which young people who have been streaming their lives on YouTube have been targeted by the unscrupulous and persuaded to undress or to take up sexualised poses. Children are promised payment in the valuable online currency of extra subscribers if they comply.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Clearly, the tendency of some young people to want to live out part of their life in public creates an opportunity for exploitation. It is very easy for paedophiles who visit YouTube, owned by Google, to find children online, merely by tapping in a few simple keywords. They can then communicate instantly and directly with the children who are posting there by using the comments section on the site. Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat also offer a live streaming service to children.</p><p>Experts in child safety warn regularly of the danger of parents using the internet as a form of babysitting. The more conscious young people are of the possible dangers the better. Still, it ought to be possible for young people to stream incidents from their lives and not be subject, as The Times has discovered they are, to gruesome requests to mimic sex acts or take their clothes off.</p><p>The principal responsibility in such instances always lies with the perpetrators. They need to be identified, tracked down and prosecuted. That process would be considerably easier, however, if YouTube, the channel on which a third of children between the ages of six and ten are now broadcasting at least some of their everyday actions, were to do more to intervene. In 2017 Google dropped the requirement for a user to have 10,000 subscribers or more before being permitted to live stream from a smartphone. Now, almost anyone can do so, which has vastly expanded the range of children live streaming.</p><p>The Home Office has accused the big tech companies of not doing enough to tackle abuse online and that accusation seems merited in this instance. YouTube failed to remove half the livestreamed videos even though it had been alerted anonymously, by our reporter, to their presence.</p><p>One commenter had been asking young girls to show their bodies in return for subscribers. That commenter had not been banned from the site. It is unfathomable why not when, according to Jonathan Krause, an expert in countering online crime, some of the comments made could constitute Category A violations, which are considered the most serious type in sentencing guidelines for child sexual abuse offences.</p><p>YouTube should have acted quicker to close channels down. Although YouTube has a minimum user age of 13 it needs to do more to verify the ages of those who are live streaming and a lot more to regulate the freedom of anonymous people to comment. The very least we can expect is that the company should respond with greater severity when the issue is pointed out.</p><p>The internet is such a vast terrain that it is beyond the capacity of the state to take on the job of online invigilator and it would be inimical to the freedoms of the internet if it were to become too heavy handed in attempting to do so. Yet that requires greater responsibility from the providers than they are showing. The tech companies will leave governments with no other option, if they do not get serious, than to intervene. They will not be able to say they had not been warned.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-144433180</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TXR-BMC1-DYTY-C320-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"633\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 10, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I have been wondering for some time when the two giants of American social media would square up for what promises to be a comparably brutal battle. Finally, it began last month - and where else but on Twitter?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'Facebook was always anti-Trump,' tweeted the President of the United States on 27 September. Mark Zuckerberg shot back hours later (on Facebook, of course): 'Trump says Facebook is against him. Liberals say we helped Trump. Both sides are upset about ideas and content they don't like. That's what running a platform for all ideas looks like.'</p><p>A platform for all ideas? Well, maybe. Others see Facebook differently. As Zuckerberg's response to Trump acknowledged, the President is not alone in criticising him. The various inquiries into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election are turning up much that is awkward, notably that Russia bought around 3,000 Facebook ads designed to spread politically divisive posts to Americans before and after the election, as well as to promote inflammatory political protests on issues such as Muslim immigration.</p><p>It may be too big a stretch to claim that Russian Facebook ads swung the election in Trump's favour. But it seems plausible that his campaign's use of social media, particularly Facebook, gave it a vital edge that compensated for its financial disadvantage relative to Hillary Clinton's campaign. On that, if on nothing else, I suspect Steve Bannon and Clinton would agree. 'Facebook is now the largest news platform in the world,' Clinton writes in her election postmortem. 'With that awesome power comes great responsibility.'</p><p>Awesome power, yes. At the end of June, the number of active Facebook users (people who visit the site at least once a month) passed the two billion mark. WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram - all owned by Facebook - have three billion users altogether, though no doubt there is much overlap. Two- thirds of American adults are on Facebook and 45 per cent get their news from it. More than half the UK population access Facebook at least once a month. The average user is on the site for 1/16 of every day.</p><p>But great responsibility? In the wake of the Las Vegas massacre, Facebook briefly featured a bogus story that the shooter had 'Trump-hating' views. A fake page claimed responsibility for the attack on behalf of the far-left Antifa movement, saying the goal had been to kill 'Trump-supporting fascist dogs'.</p><p>Last month, the non-profit investigative news site ProPublica revealed that Facebook's online ad tools had helped advertisers to target self-described 'Jew haters' or people who had used phrases such as 'how to burn Jews'. In the words of Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg: 'The fact that hateful terms were even offered as options was totally inappropriate and a fail on our part.' Facebook 'never intended or anticipated this functionality being used this way'.</p><p>What Facebook intended and how Facebook is used turn out to be very different. The company's motto used to be: 'Make the world more open and connected.' It's no longer quite so simple. 'For most of the existence of the company, this idea of connecting the world has not been a controversial thing,' Zuckerberg recently said. 'Something changed.'</p><p>What has changed is that the world has belatedly woken up to realities about social networks that were already obvious to anyone familiar with history and network science. For most of history, it is true, hierarchies have tended to dominate distributed networks. However, there are historical precedents for technological change leading to enhanced connectedness that empowers social networks and weakens hierarchies.</p><p>The first began exactly 500 years ago, when Martin Luther launched his campaign for reform of the Roman Catholic church. Had it not been for the printing press, Luther would have been just another obscure heretic and might well have ended his life in the flames of the stake. But Gutenberg's innovation enabled Luther's message to 'go viral' - as we would now say - and it spread with remarkable speed throughout Germany and then across north-western Europe.</p><p>Luther was as much of a utopian as the pioneers of Silicon Valley in our own time. In his mind, the Reformation would create a powerful new network of pious Christians, all enabled to read the Bible in the vernacular and to establish more direct relationships with God than the indirect ones mediated by a corrupt ecclesiastical hierarchy. The vision of St Peter of a 'priesthood of all believers' would finally be realised.</p><p>But the true upshot of the Reformation was not harmony but polarisation and conflict. Not everyone was inspired by Luther's message. Some sought to go further than him. Others reacted violently against the proposed reforms. The Counter-Reformation adopted the Protestants' novel techniques of propagation and deployed them against the heretics.</p><p>Yet it proved impossible to destroy Protestant networks, even with mass executions and hideously cruel torture. If anything, persecution promoted radicalisation. Meanwhile, the constantly growing network of printed words proved itself as ready to spread madness as holiness. The witch craze of the 17th century was a classic example of a monster meme, claiming innocent lives from Scotland to Salem, Massachusetts.</p><p>There are three big differences between now and then. First, today's social networks are vastly bigger, faster and more widespread than those of the early modern era. Secondly, whereas the printing press was a truly decentralised technology - Johannes Gutenberg was no Bill Gates - the ownership of today's IT infrastructure is concentrated in remarkably few hands. Finally, our networked age began by disrupting markets and later politics; only one religion, Islam, has been significantly affected.</p><p>But the similarities are nevertheless striking. Now, as then, newly empowered networks have led to polarisation, not harmony. Now, as then, the networks have acted as a transmission mechanism for all kinds of manias and panics as well as truth and beauty. And now, as then, the networks have eroded territorial sovereignty, weakening the established structures of political authority.</p><p>The US government sought to harness the power of social networks when the National Security Agency co-opted the big technology companies into its PRISM programme of mass domestic and foreign surveillance. But the new networks did not easily integrate into old power structures. Globally disseminated leaks, courtesy of Edward Snowden and Julian Assange, exposed PRISM, while a new kind of populist politics flourished on social media.</p><p>A defining feature of social networks (as in the Reformation) is their tendency to divide rather than unite. Recent research on American blogs and Twitter reveals a similar pattern: the emergence of two self-segregated ideological communities, one liberal, the other conservative. Just as birds of a feather flock together (network geeks call it 'homophily') so Twitter users retweet within their political clusters. One study found that with tweets on hot-button political topics (such as gun control, same-sex marriage and climate change), the use of emotional words increases their diffusion by a factor of 20 per cent for each additional word. Ever wondered why tweets are full of expletives? Now you know.</p><p>The presidential election of 2016 was a tale of many networks. By going viral through a largely self-organised network, Trump beat Clinton's old-school, hierarchically structured campaign, which poured money into antiquated channels like local television. Isis contributed to the febrile atmosphere with its worst attack in North America (in Orlando in June last year), prompting Trump's populist (and popular) promise of a 'Muslim ban'. But the Trump network had itself been penetrated by the Russian intelligence network. Trump's campaign and, to a much smaller extent, the Russians both used Facebook and Twitter as tools to discredit his opponent and discourage potential Democratic voters.</p><p>Make no mistake: 2016 will never happen again. Silicon Valley hates Trump for too many reasons to count. The most important are his stance on immigration (on which the Valley depends for its supply of skilled software engineers) and Big Tech's need to 'virtue-signal' to its most valued user demographic: the young and affluent. They lean left. So does the otherwise capitalist Valley.</p><p>The political consequences were not immediately obvious, unless you were paying close attention, but after the Charlottesville clashes between white supremacists, neo-Nazis and their various left-wing opponents, they were there for all to see. Matthew Prince, CEO of the internet service provider Cloudflare, described what happened: 'Literally, I woke up in a bad mood and decided someone shouldn't be allowed on the internet.' On the basis that 'the people behind the Daily Stormer are assholes', he denied their fascistic website access to the worldwide web. As Prince himself rightly observed: 'No one should have that power. We need to have a discussion around this with clear rules and clear frameworks. My whims and those of Jeff [Bezos] and Larry [Page] and Satya [Nadella] and Mark [Zuckerberg] shouldn't be what determines what should be online.' Yet that discussion has barely begun. And until it happens, it will indeed be they who decide who is allowed on the internet.</p><p>This goes to the heart of the matter. According to Zuckerberg, Facebook is 'a tech company, not a media company... We build the tools; we do not produce any content'. Yet in practice, according to a recent Reuters investigation, 'an elite group of at least five senior executives regularly directs content policy and makes editorial judgment calls.' In the words of Espen Egil Hansen, the editor-in-chief of the Norwegian newspaper <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aftenposten</emphasis>, Zuckerberg is now 'the world's most powerful editor'.</p><p>It is not only neo-Nazi sites that find themselves on the online equivalent of the newsroom spike. Twitter has recently rejected paid-for tweets from the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) on the grounds of 'Hate'. These tweets were hardly excerpts from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mein Kampf</emphasis>: for example: 'The fiscal cost created by illegal immigrants of $746.3bn compares to a total cost of deportation of $124.1bn.' In the words of CIS director Mark Krikorian, 'The internet is now a utility more important than phones or cable TV. If people can be denied access to it based on the content of their ideas and speech (rather than specific illegal acts), why not make phone service contingent on your political views? Or mail delivery?'</p><p>Google recently revealed that it is using machine learning to document 'hate crimes and events' in America. Among their partners in this effort is the notorious Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which maintains a list of 'anti-Muslim extremists' - including my wife, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, and the British liberal Muslim Maajid Nawaz - but no list whatsoever of Muslim extremists.</p><p>'YouTube doesn't allow hate speech or content that promotes or incites violence,' declared a recent message to YouTube content creators. But who decides what is 'hate speech'? The phrase has become the 21st-century equivalent of 'heresy'. It's what you call something before you proscribe it.</p><p>Silicon Valley insists it is home to neutral network platforms. This is no longer credible. Facebook alone has, without quite meaning to, evolved into the most powerful publisher in the history of the world. Zuckerberg is William Randolph Hearst to the power of ten.</p><p>So what to do? Left-leaning Democrats have an answer: revive the progressive interpretation of anti-trust policy and break up the internet monopolies. Superficially, they have a case. Amazon controls 65 per cent of all online new book sales. Google's market share of online search is 87 per cent in the US. In mobile social networking, Facebook and its subsidiaries control 75 per cent of the American market.</p><p>Yet who seriously cares what the hipster anti-trust types say? Silicon Valley is a huge donor to the Democrats. Why would they make life difficult for Big Tech when it so openly leans left? The real question is when Republicans (and not just the President) are going to wake up to the threat they now face.</p><p>Two big battles are looming: one on the question of net neutrality (the principle that all bits of data should be treated alike, regardless of their content or value), the other on the 1996 Communications and Decency Act, which allows tech firms exemption from liability for content that appears on their platforms. A group of senators led by Rob Portman has started the ball rolling by seeking to impose liability on companies that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking on their platforms. The initial response of the Internet Association, a trade group that is essentially a mouthpiece for the Valley, was revealing: 'The entire internet industry wants to end human trafficking,' it said. 'But there are ways to do this without amending a law foundational to legitimate internet services.' Last month, however, the IA conceded the need for 'targeted amendments'.</p><p>This battle is only just beginning, but its outcome could be decisive in both the 2018 midterm elections to Congress and the 2020 presidential race. The regulatory status quo is not only highly favourable to Silicon Valley. It could also prove highly unfavourable to Republican candidates - though (so far as I could tell on a recent visit to Washington) the penny has not yet dropped with lawmakers who are accustomed to talking only about deregulation, not regulation.</p><p>In many ways, what we are about to witness will be a classic struggle between new networks and established hierarchies. Like King Kong's epic slugfest with Godzilla, however, it's far from easy to predict which side will prevail - or how much collateral damage they will both inflict on American democracy. In the old Godzilla movies, after all, the one predictable thing is that Tokyo always gets destroyed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPECTR-10301572</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPECTR2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PPT-8461-F0JS-N1WY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">245303</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-10-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2351\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Spectator Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Spectator</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"48251\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 14, 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

My hotel, on the top floor of a big building downtown, had a roof garden with a koi pond. One morning, as I had coffee and a bagel in this garden, I watched a pair of ducks feeding on a mound of pellets that someone had left for them at the pond's edge. Every few seconds, they dipped their beaks to drink, and, in the process, spilled undigested pellets into the water. A few koi idled there, poking at the surface for the scraps. The longer I watched, the more I wondered if the ducks were deliberately feeding the fish. Was such a thing possible? I asked the breakfast attendant, a ruddy Quebecer. He smiled and said, \"No, but it is what I tell the children.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My mind had been marinating overnight-and for more than a year, really-in the abstrusities of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology on which they are built. Bitcoin and, subsequently, a proliferation of other cryptocurrencies had become an object of global fascination, amid prophecies of societal upheaval and reform, but mainly on the promise of instant wealth. A peer-to-peer money system that cut out banks and governments had made it possible, and fashionable, to get rich by sticking it to the Man.</p><p>Some of this stuff I understood; much of it I still did not. If you're not, say, a computer scientist or a mathematician, the deeper you get into the esoterica of distributed ledgers, consensus algorithms, hash functions, zero-knowledge proofs, byzantine-fault-tolerance theory, and so on-the farther you travel from the familiar terrain of \"the legacy world,\" where, one blockchain futurist told me, pityingly, I live-the better the chance you have of bumping up against the limits of your intelligence. You grasp, instead, for metaphors.</p><p>Blockchain talk makes a whiteboard of the brain. You're always erasing, starting over, as analogies present themselves. So, Montreal bagel in hand, I considered the ducks and the carp. Let the pellets be a cryptocurrency-koicoin, say. Would the ducks then be currency miners? Every altcoin-the catchall for cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin, the majority of which are eventually classified as shitcoin-has its own community of enthusiasts and kvetchers, so perhaps the koi were this one's. The koicommunity. The breakfast attendant who had put out the pellets: he'd be our koicoin Satoshi-as in Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous and still unidentified creator of Bitcoin. Yes, the koicoin protocol was strong, and the incentives appeared to be well aligned, but the project didn't really pass muster in terms of immutability, decentralization, and privacy. Koicoin was shitcoin.</p><p>A few hours later, I was at lunch in a conference room in another hotel, with a table of crypto wizards, a few of them among the most respected devs in the space. (Devs are developers, and even legacy worlders must surrender after a while and ditch the scare quotes around \"the space,\" when referring to the cryptosphere.) Four of these devs were researchers associated with Ethereum, the open-source blockchain platform. Ethereum is not itself a cryptocurrency; to operate on Ethereum, you have to use the cryptocurrency ether, which, like bitcoin, you can buy or sell. (Among cryptocurrencies, ether's market capitalization is second only to bitcoin's.) The devs were specimens of an itinerant coder \u00e9lite, engaged, wherever they turn up and to the exclusion of pretty much everything else, in the ongoing construction of an alternate global financial and computational infrastructure: a new way of handling money or identity, a system they describe as a better, decentralized version of the World Wide Web-a Web 3.0-more in keeping with the Internet's early utopian promise than with the invidious, monopolistic hellscape it has become. They want to seize back the tubes, and the data-our lives-from Facebook, Google, and the new oligarchs of Silicon Valley.</p><p>One of them, Vlad Zamfir, a twenty-eight-year-old Romanian-born mathematician who grew up in Ottawa and dropped out of the University of Guelph, was scribbling equations on an electronic tablet called a reMarkable pad. He narrated as he scrawled. The others at the table leaned in toward him, in a way that recalled Rembrandt's \"The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp.\" To the two or three people at the table who were clearly incapable of following along, he said, earnestly, \"Sorry to alienate you with my math.\" Zamfir is the lead developer of one strand of Casper, an ongoing software upgrade designed to make Ethereum scale better and work more securely-an undertaking thought to be vital to its viability and survival. \"It's shitty technology,\" Zamfir, whose Twitter bio reads \"absurdist, troll,\" told a journalist two years ago.</p><p>Zamfir was showing the others some rough equations he'd worked out to address one of the thousands of riddles that need to be solved. This particular effort was an attempt (jargon alert) to optimize the incentive structure for proof-of-stake validation-that is, how best to get enough people and machines to participate in a computing operation essential to the functioning of the entire system. \"We're trying to do game theory here,\" Zamfir said. The others pointed out what they thought might be flaws. \"It doesn't seem reasonable,\" Zamfir said. \"But the math works out.\" This summarized much of what I'd encountered in crypto.</p><p>To his right sat Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum's founder and semi-reluctant philosopher king. Buterin, who is twenty-four, occasionally glanced at Zamfir's formulas but mostly looked into the middle distance with a melancholic empty stare, sometimes typing out messages and tweets on his phone with one finger. He was a quick study, and also he pretty much already knew what Zamfir had come up with, and to his thinking the work wasn't quite there. \"When the models are getting overcomplicated, it's probably good to have more time to try to simplify them,\" he told me later, with what I took to be generous understatement.</p><p>Buterin had been working, simultaneously, on another version of Casper. So he and Zamfir were both collaborating and competing with each other. There seemed to be no ego or bitterness-in their appraisal of each other's work, in person, or on social media, where so much of the conversation takes place, in full view. Their assessments were Spockian, and cutting only to the Kirks among us.</p><p>They had first met before a conference in Toronto in 2014. Zamfir was amazed by Buterin, whom he called a \"walking computer,\" and he joined Ethereum as a researcher soon after. Now good friends who meet up mostly at conferences and workshops, they had greeted each other the day before in the hotel lobby with a fervent embrace, like summer campers back for another year, before quick-walking to a quiet corner to start in on the incentive-structure-for-proof-of-stake-validation talk. Whenever and wherever Buterin and Zamfir convene, people gather around-eavesdropping, hoping for scraps of insight. The two are used to this and pay little heed. There were no secrets, only problems and solutions, and the satisfaction that comes from proceeding from one toward the other.</p><p>The first time I heard the word \"Ethereum\" was in April, 2017. A hedge-fund manager, at a benefit in Manhattan, was telling me that he'd made more money buying and selling ether and other cryptocurrencies in the past year than he'd ever made at his old hedge fund. This was a significant claim, since the fund had made him a billionaire. He was using words I'd never heard before. He mentioned bitcoin, too, which I'd certainly heard a lot about but, like most people my age, didn't really understand. I'd idly hoped I might be just old enough to make it to my deathbed without having to get up to speed.</p><p>As the year wore on, that dream faded. The surge in the price of bitcoin, and of other cryptocurrencies, which proliferated amid a craze for initial coin offerings (I.C.O.s), prompted a commensurate explosion in the number of stories and conversations about this new kind of money and, sometimes more to the point, about the blockchain technology behind it-this either revolutionary or needlessly laborious way of keeping track of transactions and data. It seemed as if language had been randomized. I started hearing those words-the ones I'd never heard before-an awful lot: \"trustless,\" \"sharding,\" \"flippening.\" Explaining blockchain became a genre unto itself.</p><p>The dizzying run-up in crypto prices in 2017 was followed, this year, by a long, lurching retreat that, as the summer gave way to fall, began to seem perilous. As with notorious stock-market and real-estate bubbles, innocents had been taken in and cleaned out. But both boom and bust reflected an ongoing argument over what cryptocurrencies and their technological underpinnings might be worth-which is to say, whether they are, as some like to ask, real. Is crypto the future or a fad? Golden ticket or Ponzi scheme? Amazon 2.0 or tulip mania? And what is it good for, anyway? It sure is neat, but for now it lacks its killer app, a use that might lead to mass adoption, as e-mail did for the Internet. \"We need the hundred-dollar laptop, the iPod,\" a blockchain apostle told me.</p><p>Now and then, legacy titans voiced their scorn. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of J.\u00a0P. Morgan, labelled crypto \"a fraud\"; Warren Buffett used the phrase \"rat poison squared.\" Legions of skeptics and technophobes, out of envy, ignorance, or wisdom, savored such pronouncements, while the true believers and the vertiginously invested mostly brushed it aside. They had faith that a new order was nigh. They pumped but did not dump.</p><p>Among a certain subset, it was both fashionable and integral to ignore the fluctuations in price. The idea was to build and shore up a new system-for everything from payments and banking to health care and identity-that was either a replacement for the old one, or at least an alternative to it, one that was borderless, independent of state control and of exploitation by Big Tech. \"It's definitely nice to try to eke out some completely parallel kind of world that's totally separate from the existing one,\" Buterin said. \"It does interact with the rest of society, and the goal is definitely to help improve the mainstream world, but we're on a different track.\" Such an undertaking would, at best, take many years and likely span several economic and investment cycles. While the old armature rots, a new one rises alongside it, much as the new Tappan Zee Bridge, over the Hudson, gradually took shape next to the rusty old one it would one day replace. To Buterin, however, the benefits were already clear. \"The cryptocurrency space has succeeded at making certain aspects of the international economy more open, when politics is moving in the exact opposite direction,\" he said. \"I do think that's a meaningful contribution to the world.\"</p><p>Buterin is a striking figure, tall and very lean, with long, fidgety fingers, sharp elfin features, and vivid blue eyes, which, on the rare occasions when he allows them to meet yours, convey a depth and warmth that you don't expect, in light of the flat, robotic cadence and tone of his speech. People often joke about him being an alien, but they usually apologize for doing so, because there's a gentleness about him, an air of tolerance and moderation, that works as a built-in rebuke to such unkind remarks. As we spoke, on the first afternoon of the Montreal conference (the crypto life is a never-ending enchainment of conferences, and is pretty much wall-to-wall dudes), he aligned some items in front of him: pens, Post-its, phone. He forgoes most social niceties and overt expressions of emotion but, when he finds questions or assertions agreeable, is generous with notes of encouragement: \"Yep, yep, yep\"; \"Right, totally\"; \"Yes, yes, exactly.\" Arguable remarks elicit a mechanical \"Hmm.\" He seems to anticipate your question before you even know quite what it is, but he forces himself to allow you to finish. He has a dry sense of humor.</p><p>He said, \"I definitely don't have the kind of single-minded C.E.O. personality that a lot of Silicon Valley V.C.s lionize-that thing of being ambitious and wanting to win at all costs, like, basically, Mark Zuckerberg.\" He was dressed that day, as on the day before and the day after, in a gray turtleneck, black track pants, and laceless Adidas sneakers over turquoise socks. He often wears T-shirts with unicorns and rainbows. He likes to cite Lambos-as in Lamborghini, the cryptobro trophy ride of choice-as shorthand for the excessive trappings of wealth, which do not interest him. He's about as indifferently rich as a man can be. Although he sold a quarter of his bitcoin and ether well before the prices began to soar last year, he is said to be worth somewhere in the vicinity of a hundred million dollars. (He recently gave away a couple of million dollars to a life-extension research project.) He has no assistants or entourage. He owns little and travels light. \"Recently, I reduced my bag size from sixty litres to forty,\" he said. \"Forty is very tolerable. You can go on fifteen-kilometre walks with it.\" The Adidas, he said, were his only pair of shoes. \"Actually, I have another pair that's in one of the many places I call home.\" These are friends' apartments, where he sometimes sleeps for a few nights at a stretch-in Toronto, San Francisco, Singapore, Shanghai, Taipei. He especially likes East Asia. He speaks fluent Mandarin.</p><p>After Montreal, he was headed to Berlin and then Switzerland. His home, really, is the Internet. At one point, I referred to an Ethereum outpost in San Francisco, which I'd read about, as a \"base of operations,\" and he rejected the term: \"Home. Base of operations. The more you invent your own life style, the more you realize that the categories that have been invented are ultimately, at best, imperfect devices for understanding the world, and, at worst, fake.\"</p><p>I'd been trying for months to talk to Buterin. In January, I reached out to his father, Dmitry, who reported back that Vitalik was not interested in an interview. \"He is trying to focus his time on research,\" Dmitry said. \"He's not too excited that the community assigns so much importance to him. He wants the community to be more resilient.\" Dmitry Buterin, forty-six, is from Grozny, in Chechnya. He studied computer science in Moscow and then started a financial-software business, before emigrating to Canada, when Vitalik was six. Dmitry settled in Toronto, with Vitalik; Vitalik's mother, a financial analyst, chose Edmonton. Vitalik, when he was three, got an old PC and began fiddling around with Excel. By ten or eleven, he was developing video games. \"Vitalik was a very smart boy,\" his father said. \"It was not easy. His mind was always racing. It was hard for him to communicate. He hardly spoke until he was nine or ten. I was concerned, but at some point I realized it is what it is. I just gave him my love.\"</p><p>He also gave Vitalik his first glimpse of Bitcoin. It was 2011, somewhat early, but Dmitry was an avowed anarcho-capitalist, a cynical child of Soviet and post-Soviet Russia. For many others like him, especially in those early days, the first encounter with Bitcoin was like a religious epiphany-powerful, life-altering, a glimpse of an entirely different and perhaps more agreeable way of ordering human affairs. \"Bitcoin looks like money's dream of itself,\" the technology journalist Brian Patrick Eha wrote, in \"How Money Got Free.\"</p><p>\"Before Bitcoin came along, I was happily playing World of Warcraft,\" Vitalik told me. He had already been nursing some inchoate ideas about the risks and intrinsic unfairness of centralized systems and authority. He once told a journalist, \"I saw everything to do with either government regulation or corporate control as just being plain evil. And I assumed that people in those institutions were kind of like Mr. Burns, sitting behind their desks saying, 'Excellent. How can I screw a thousand people over this time?'\u00a0\" Bitcoin scratched this itch. But in many ways what drew him in was the elegance of the system, invented, it seemed, by a rogue outsider out of thin air. It suited a world view, a dream of a fluid, borderless, decentralized financial system beyond the reach of governments and banks, inclined as they inevitably are toward corruption and self-dealing, or at least toward distortions of incentive. Buterin said, \"If you look at the people that were involved in the early stages of the Bitcoin space, their earlier pedigrees, if they had any pedigrees at all, were in open source-Linux, Mozilla, and cypherpunk mailing lists.\" These were subversives and libertarians, ranging in political affinity from far left to weird right, as often as not without institutional or academic stature or access. \"I found it immensely empowering that just a few thousand people like myself could re-create this fundamental social institution from nothing.\"</p><p>In the eighties, cryptographers and computer scientists began trying to devise a foolproof form of digital money, and a way to execute transactions and contracts without the involvement (or rent-seeking) of third parties. It was the man, woman, or group of humans known as Satoshi Nakamoto who, with Bitcoin in 2008, solved the crux-the so-called double-spend problem. If you have ten dollars, you shouldn't be able to pay ten dollars for one thing, then spend the same ten for another. This requires some mechanism for keeping track of what you have, whom you gave it to, and how much they now have. And that was the blockchain.</p><p>Definitions of blockchain are as various as the metaphors-bingo, Google Docs, a giant room of transparent safes-that people use to try to illustrate them. Broadly speaking, a blockchain is an evolving record of all transactions that is maintained, simultaneously and in common, by every computer in the network of that blockchain, be it Ethereum, Bitcoin, or Monero. Think, as some have suggested, of a dusty leather-bound ledger in a Dickensian counting house, a record of every transaction relevant to that practice. Except that every accountant in London, and in Calcutta, has the same ledger, and when one adds a line to his own the addition appears in all of them. Once a transaction is affirmed, it will-theoretically, anyway-be in the ledger forever, unalterable and unerasable.</p><p>Historically, records have been stored in one place-a temple, a courthouse, a server-and kept by whoever presided. If you distrust central authority, or are queasy about Google, this won't do at all. With blockchains, the records, under a kind of cryptographic seal, are distributed to all and belong to no one. You can't revise them, because everyone is watching, and because the software will reject it if you try. There is no Undo button. Each block is essentially a bundle of transactions, with a tracking notation, represented in a bit of cryptographic code known as a \"hash,\" of all the transactions in the past. Each new block in the chain contains all the information (or, really, via the hash, a secure reference to all the information) contained in the previous one, all the way back to the first one, the so-called genesis block.</p><p>There are other words that are sometimes included in the definition of blockchain, but they are slippery, and grounds for endless parsing, asterisking, and debate. One is \"decentralized.\" (Some blockchains are more decentralized than others.) Another is \"immutable\"-the idea that, in theory, the past record can't be altered. (This is different from having your crypto stolen or hacked, when it's stored in an online \"wallet.\" That happens all the time!) Then there's \"privacy.\" The aspiration is for a digital coin to have the untraceability of cash. Because bitcoin was, at the outset, the dark Web's go-to tender for the purchase of drugs, sex, weaponry, and such, many assumed that it was private. But it isn't. Every transaction is there in the ledger for all to see. It is, fundamentally, anonymous (or pseudonymous, anyway), but there are many ways for that anonymity to be compromised.</p><p>The odds are high that someone, somewhere, has attempted to make an explanation like this one to you. The chain-splainer is a notorious date spoiler and cocktail-party pariah. Here he comes-you're trapped. You should have known better than to ask about mining.</p><p>Mining is a reward system-compensation for helping to maintain and build a blockchain. The work of establishing and recording what's legit takes machinery, memory, power, and time. Cryptocurrency blockchains require that a bunch of computers run software to affirm (or reject) transactions-it's a kind of automated convocation. During this ritual, the computers in the network are competing, via brute guesswork, to be the first to get the answer to a really difficult math problem. The more computational power you have, the more guesses you can make, and the more likely you are to get the answer. The winner creates a new block and gets a reward, in, say, bitcoin-new bitcoin, which has not previously been in circulation. (Satoshi ordained that there be a finite number of bitcoin ever created-twenty-one million-so that no one could inflate away the value of existing bitcoin, as, say, the Federal Reserve does with dollars. Other cryptocurrencies, including ether, don't necessarily have finite supplies.)</p><p>This system is known as Proof of Work. The problem-solving exercise is proof that the computers are doing the work. This approach has serious and, some would say, fatal, flaws. First, it requires a tremendous amount of electricity. This year, it is said, the Bitcoin network will use as much energy as the nation of Austria, and produce as much carbon dioxide as a million transatlantic flights. Mining rigs-computers designed specifically to do this work-are thirsty machines. Mining farms tend to sprout up where juice is cheap (typically, in proximity to hydropower projects with excess capacity to unload) and where temperatures are low (so you don't have to burn even more electricity to keep the rigs cool). There are open-air warehouses in remote corners of sub-Arctic Canada, Russia, and China, with machines whirring away on the tundra, creating magic money, while the permafrost melts. Second, a small number of mining conglomerates, or pools-many of them Chinese-have wielded outsized influence over the network and the decisions that get made. Last month, one of the biggest of these, Bitmain, confirmed plans to go public.</p><p>The alternative, which Zamfir and Buterin were working on in Montreal, is called Proof of Stake. In this scenario, the holders of the currency in question become the validators, who typically take a small cut of every approved transaction. Theoretically, the more crypto you have, the more influence you have, so PoW partisans consider PoS to be plutocratic as well-a new gloss on the old problem of too much in the hands of too few.</p><p>In 2013, Buterin travelled to San Jose for a Bitcoin meet-up, and felt that he'd encountered like-minded people for the first time in his life-a movement worth devoting himself to. \"The people that I had been searching for the whole time were actually all there,\" Buterin told me. Zooko Wilcox, a cryptographer, recalled Buterin telling him, \"This is the first technology I've ever loved that loves me back.\" Buterin had been writing blog posts about it for five bitcoins per post. Together, he and Mihai Alisie, a Romanian blockchain entrepreneur who'd read his posts, founded Bitcoin Magazine. Buterin had a knack for explaining things-at least to an audience already primed to understand. But, as he travelled around the world to Bitcoin meet-ups, he began to think that the technology was limited, that attempts to jury-rig non-money uses for this digital-money platform was the computational equivalent of a Swiss Army knife. You basically had to devise hacks. He envisaged a one-blade-fits-all version, a blockchain platform that was broader and more adaptable to a wider array of uses and applications. The concept behind Bitcoin-a network of machines all over the world-seemed to be a building block upon which to construct a global computer capable of all kinds of activities.</p><p>In the mid-nineties, Nick Szabo, a cryptographer and early cypherpunk, coined the term \"smart contract,\" which two decades later became the basis of Ethereum. This is a means of setting and enforcing the terms of an agreement without a middleman-no lawyer, notary, bookie, or referee. The terms are enshrined in and triggered by code, rather than by someone's interpretation of legal language or fit of pique. The proposition is that computer code, unlike, say, Hammurabi's or the Federal Reserve's, is impartial-that it can eliminate, or at least greatly reduce, the role of toxic subjectivity. This could cover a simple exchange of digital money, or the sale of a house, or an insurance payout, or a bet. Szabo's preferred metaphor was the vending machine. You don't generally require someone to vouch for the machine. In a smart-contract world, as he described it, if a borrower hasn't paid off his car loans in time his car just stops working, as per the terms of the loan, which are embedded in the code and integrated into the mechanism of the car.</p><p>The reliability of the code, and of the system for checking it, would discharge humans from having to read minds and look into hearts, or from having to pay someone else to make up for the fact that they cannot. As it stands, here in the dusty old legacy economy, we have to pay other people, and squander time and resources, to establish a modicum of trust. It's a legalized kind of protection racket. A favorite example is title insurance; an entire industry exists to prove that the person selling you a house is the owner in good standing. Provenance-of property, both real and intellectual-is big business, but, to the blockchain believers, it need not be. Code shall banish the odious frictions and costs. \"Blockchains are more fundamentally about increasing our ability to collaborate across these large social distances,\" Buterin said. \"It's the trust machine bringing more trust where there was less trust before.\"</p><p>Another thing we presently outsource, perhaps to our peril, is our identity: the affirmation of who we are, along with whatever data sticks to that. Identity as we know it now is typically maintained by a centralized state-by the taxman, the department of motor vehicles, the police. Then it spills out into the world, often without our knowledge or consent, through our transaction histories, browsing habits, and unencrypted communications. In the Google era, we spray aspects of ourselves all over the Internet. The blockchain innovation is what's often called \"self-sovereign identity,\" the idea that you'll control and parcel out information about yourself, as you wish. The Ethereum network maintains the attestation.</p><p>Then there are those vast realms where the old intermediaries hardly exist at all. The trust machine's most obvious beneficiaries are said to be the disenfranchised and the so-called unbanked-the billions of humans around the world with no passports or access to any reliable kind of financial system. We may find it harder to see the utility here in our daily lives, where we can rely on Citibank, Visa, Venmo, and Western Union to handle our transactions and keep track of all the money flying around. Amid such a sturdy (if extractive) system, the blockchain can seem like a back-office fix, a change in the accounting scheme, of interest to the systems geeks and bean counters but not to oblivious customers. But if you are, say, a Venezuelan citizen or a Turkish journalist, or a refugee from Syria or Myanmar, the prospect of being able to maintain and render portable both money and identity could be hugely liberating, perhaps even life-saving. Unless you forget your private key.</p><p>In November, 2013, Buterin wrote up a white paper-cryptoland is a blizzard of white papers-proposing a new open-source, distributed computing platform upon which you could build all kinds of smart-contract applications and uses, as well as other coins. He called it Ethereum. \"I was browsing a list of elements from science fiction on Wikipedia when I came across the name,\" he said then. \"I suppose it was the fact that [it] sounded nice and it had the word 'ether,' referring to the hypothetical invisible medium that permeates the universe and allows light to travel.\" He expected that experienced cryptographers would pick his proposal to pieces. Instead, everyone who read it seemed to be impressed by its elegance and ambition. Among the early enthusiasts were a handful of Toronto Bitcoiners who'd got to know one another at informal meet-ups and in a Skype group chat-\"a regular call with serious people,\" as one of them recalled.</p><p>The foundational gathering, in the Ethereum creation story, occurred at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, in January, 2014. These serious people decided to rent a beach house, and there, in a week or so, banged out a fuller sense of what Ethereum, Buterin's \"computer in the sky,\" as he described it to me, might become. They defined themselves as founders. Among them were Gavin Wood (a British programmer who later took on the role of Ethereum's chief technology officer), Charles Hoskinson (a Colorado programmer who was briefly the C.E.O.), and Anthony Di Iorio, a Torontonian who was underwriting the project. Di Iorio had invited a fellow Toronto Bitcoiner named Joseph Lubin, then forty-nine, who, with a sense of the import of the occasion, brought along the reporter Morgen Peck, to bear witness. She later described it as \"an after-hours grease trap\" for dozens of additional participants in the conference. (The online publication Backchannel published her story, as well as a photograph she'd snapped of Buterin working at his laptop one morning while the rest of the house slept. Peck says that the pot pipe on the table next to him wasn't his.)</p><p>Buterin's Miami d\u00e9but of Ethereum was a hit. Nineteen at the time, he dropped out of the University of Waterloo, where he'd been studying computer science, and devoted himself full time to the Ethereum project. \"We realized this was going to be big,\" Hoskinson recalled.</p><p>The founders assumed different roles. Lubin, who had Wall Street experience, was the chief operating officer. \"That's one of the silly titles we chose to give ourselves,\" Lubin told me. \"It didn't really mean anything in that weird open-source project.\" (Buterin dubbed himself the C-3PO.) Lubin positioned himself as the grownup in the room, the worldly chaperon. Wood, with whom he eventually clashed, said, \"He wanted to be the mentor, the Obi-Wan Kenobi, but unfortunately he became the Darth Vader.\"</p><p>Months of work ensued, in which the founders came up with a lexicon and a conceptual framework both to define Ethereum in lay(ish) terms and to inoculate it against possible legal consequences. When the idea arose to sell new cryptocoins to the public, to raise money for the project, Lubin, along with Hoskinson, recognized that this might be a fraught enterprise. \"Some people, including me, pointed out that it looks like we were going to raise tens of millions of dollars from bitcoin nouveau riche and that we might want to talk to some lawyers-that we should be concerned that we might be selling an unregistered security to Americans,\" Lubin said. It was an exercise in semiotics with vital legal implications.</p><p>\"In that process, we pretty much defined what Ethereum is and what ether is,\" Lubin said. \"We realized-I realized-that we had an opportunity to tell people what this is, and there was a good chance that they were just going to accept our understanding and that we could create reality that way. And it seems to have worked. We seem to have created a reality.\" Language is consciousness: they defined ether as a \"crypto-fuel,\" which one needs to run programs and store data on the Ethereum system. Wood, at a meet-up in New York, called it \"a computer at the center of the world,\" like a sixties-era mainframe that everyone everywhere can use.</p><p>The founders took to calling it \"the world computer,\" and debated the best corporate conveyance. Should it be a for-profit entity funded by an I.C.O. or by venture capital-like Ripple, an earlier cryptocurrency protocol launch-or a not-for-profit foundation, with independent oversight? Different groups among the eight founders staked out different positions, with some favoring for-profit, others not-for-profit. \"Things started souring pretty quickly,\" Hoskinson recalls. Wood told me, \"There was this sense, which I found distasteful, that Vitalik was the goose that laid the golden egg, and he was treated in that objectivizing form by everyone else, like he was some alien from Mars sent to help us all.\"</p><p>\"There was a lot of drama,\" Lubin said. \"It got really complicated.\" Broadly speaking, the developers, among them Wood, were wary of the motives and methods of the business guys, who in turn felt that the developers lacked practical sense and an appreciation for the allure of a big payday.</p><p>Eventually, the founders agreed to let Buterin decide. \"I was definitely the person that people had respected and trusted more than they trusted each other, which was unfortunate and sad,\" Buterin said. He was also, he said, \"seemingly the most harmless of the group.\"</p><p>\"Vitalik was innocent and unprepared,\" Dmitry Buterin told me. \"He had to learn a lot of tough lessons about people.\"</p><p>Six months after Miami, the whole team holed up in a house in Switzerland, in the canton of Zug, an old commodities-hedge-fund tax haven now known as Crypto Valley. This was the first time all of the founders were in one room together. Buterin, after some time alone on the patio, told Hoskinson and another founder that they were out. Later, he made clear that Ethereum would proceed as a nonprofit. \"It was a shitty time, and it was a shitty thing for Vitalik to have to do,\" Wood said.</p><p>\"That was one of those few nuclear bombs that I threw into the Ethereum governance process,\" Buterin told me. \"I felt very strongly that Ethereum is meant to be this open-source project for the world,\" he continued. \"Having a for-profit entity be at the center of it felt like going way too far in this centralized direction.\" The remaining founders established the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation, with headquarters in Zug, to help fund development. (Ethereum itself is based nowhere, and in traditional corporate terms is as substantial as the ether.)</p><p>And so the founders, driven by discord and the appeal of more lucrative endeavors, decentralized themselves. \"We all scattered to the winds,\" Hoskinson told me. He eventually started a crypto company called IOHK, and a blockchain project called Cardano. \"Now I run my own company, with a hundred and sixty people,\" he told me. \"I'm basically a billionaire. At this point, I couldn't care less about those six months of my life with Ethereum.\"</p><p>What would a world reconstituted by smart contracts look like? One grasps at legacy tableaux: office towers emptied of bankers, lawyers, and accountants; crypto-utopian settlements on hurricane-ravaged Caribbean islands; open-air barns out on the steppes, stacked with bitcoin-mining computers. In May, I attended the Ethereal Summit, a conference held in a former industrial glassworks in Maspeth, Queens. The symbolism-new order sprouting up in the derelict precincts of the old-was on the nose, as was the vibe: food trucks, local craft beers, a \"Zen Zone\" meditation tent. Here was blockchain as life style. Two big bathrooms, side by side, started out unisex, but by the afternoon of the first day the conference attendees, at the urging of no centralized authority, were self-sorting: men to the one on the right, women the one on the left.</p><p>On the main stage, a roster of luminaries and evangelists served up a steady diet of jargon stew, but elsewhere in the old factory you could find spoonfuls of sugar-use cases for English majors. One was a presentation of a supply-chain startup called Viant, which had deployed the blockchain to track fish from \"bait to plate.\" A video depicted a yellowfin tuna caught off Fiji on April 10th. And here it was, a month later, as sashimi, its provenance indisputable, trusted, immutable, thanks to the blockchain. Everyone surged forward for a free taste-plate-to-mouth still requiring humans to jostle and reach. There was a panel discussion with the founders of Civil, an attempt to use the blockchain to remake the journalism business, amid the wreckage wrought by the Internet and the demise of the advertising model. And, in a small brick outbuilding, there was a demonstration of something called Cellarius, which was, according to its founder, Igor Lilic, (1) a crowdsourced sci-fi story, set in the year 2084, after the activation of an artificial super-intelligence; (2) a community of artists and collaborators; and (3) a technological platform that its developers were gradually building out. \"It's a hypothesis,\" Lilic said. \"The long-term goal is to figure out some new economics of intellectual property.\" A worthy goal, Lord knows, and yet I failed to understand what it had to do with distributed ledgers or consensus algorithms.</p><p>The host of the conference was ConsenSys, a company that Lubin started, in Brooklyn, in 2014, after he left Ethereum. ConsenSys is an incubator of new businesses and projects that operate-or will, or would-on the Ethereum blockchain. It is the Ethereum community's most prominent and ubiquitous developer and promoter of what are called DApps, for decentralized applications, less for stuff like tuna fish or sci-fi than for such fundamentals of commerce as property ownership, identity management, document verification, commodities trading, and legal agreements-the rudiments of what Lubin calls the infrastructure of a new decentralized economy.</p><p>ConsenSys's home base, in a graffittied industrial space in Bushwick, is a defiant, almost ostentatious expression of an anti-corporate ethos-a nod to crypto's anarchic underpinnings, but with a bit of pretense, since ConsenSys consults with businesses and governments seeking help in building private blockchains. A friend who has done some work with them said, \"They have billions of dollars to spend. Why is it like this? Why don't they have an office on Twenty-eighth Street in Manhattan, like everyone else?\" The firm now has more than a thousand employees, in offices around the world. (Lubin says that they've hired a lot of people from I.B.M.) \"They have so much money,\" another member of the community said. \"The approach is, throw it all at the wall and see what sticks.\" So far, not much has. They can cite dozens of projects in various stages of emergence; none has morphed into a killer DApp.</p><p>Lubin is said to be the largest holder of ether and is estimated to be worth more than a billion dollars. A few people told me that he had started ConsenSys to enhance the value of his ether. When I asked him about this, he scoffed. \"What a poor strategy that would be for making money,\" he said. \"Like, yeah, I'm going to build a company on an ecosystem that doesn't exist, so I can increase the value of my Internet magic-money holdings.\" He went on, \"The people who were in the space early were there for philosophical reasons, for political or economic reasons not tied to their personal wealth.\" ConsenSys has instituted a policy that forbids employees from talking about price. I went to see Lubin in Bushwick one day, after ether, and other currencies, had suffered a huge drop in value overnight. When I asked him about the plunge, he said, \"Who gives a fuck?\" Not a cryptobillionaire, apparently.</p><p>For a great number of people at Ethereal, there was an evangelical fervor-techno-utopianism in a new guise, unaffiliated, for the most part, with Silicon Valley and the cults of Elon and @Jack. The director of the Ethereum Foundation, Aya Miyaguchi, told me, \"We want to change the world. We actually believe in it.\"</p><p>The first time I met Lubin, who was with his chief marketing officer, Amanda Gutterman-over tacos in Williamsburg, in the summer of 2017-Gutterman said, \"We call him white Morpheus,\" in reference to the Laurence Fishburne character in \"The Matrix.\" (It started as a meme on Reddit.) Lubin summoned a parallel reality, where heretofore unempowered citizens would be able to perform amazing feats. Like Buterin, he rejects the primacy, in business, of the charismatic founder, and yet the world can seem to insist on it. If Buterin, who is often depicted in fan art as Jesus with a Lambo, is a kind of blockchain messiah, Lubin is its Paul, both in his tireless evangelism and in his attention to practical, worldly matters. He is an Ethereum true believer, but he is also a proponent of so-called enterprise applications-actual business uses, often on private blockchains-which could get the legacy world interested in hastening its own obsolescence.</p><p>\"Joe gets criticized for trying to push Ethereum into enterprise,\" Emin G\u00fcn Sirer, a professor of computer science at Cornell who has worked with Ethereum, says. \"You have two sides to it all. The one that appeals to the fringe counterculture versus the one where someone has to pay all these developers' bills. One to appeal to the cypherpunk kids, another to appeal to the adults in the room.\"</p><p>Lubin has a shaved head and the flat accent of a native Torontonian. In a roast-tinged panel discussion at Ethereal, the comedian Ronny Chieng, from \"The Daily Show,\" worked Lubin over for his fashion sense (stone-washed jeans and big swag-bag T-shirts), for the fact that his features don't seem to move when he talks (\"You'd get more investors if you moved your face\"), and for his apparent inability to explain anything without using words that were invented less than two years ago.</p><p>Reared in Toronto (his father is a dentist, his mother a retired real-estate broker), Lubin played squash and studied electrical engineering and computer science at Princeton. Among his roommates were Mike Novogratz, now a hedge-fund investor, who in 2017 became the Wall Street face of the crypto boom, and a wrestler named Richard Tavoso, known as Fudge, who kept a record of who owed what to whom in their regular poker games. Fudge's ledger became a handy analogy for other roommates and friends, thirty years later, when they followed Lubin and Novogratz into the blockchain boom.</p><p>After graduating, Lubin tried to make a go of it as a pro squash player while working as a researcher on artificial-intelligence experiments, helping to build nervous systems and visual systems for robots. He married young, had a son, got divorced. There followed some years of programming and Wall Street work, including at Goldman Sachs and then at a banking consortium called Identrus. \"That's where I learned about cryptography, and how to write software with cryptographic systems,\" he said. He later developed a program for trading currencies and securities, started a fund, and did very well. Nonetheless, his encounters with the global financial markets, before and after the 2008 collapse, and his earlier immersion in science fiction and cyberpunk culture, put him in a quasi-apocalyptic frame of mind. (He has entertained the theory that 9/11 was an inside job.) He looked into buying land in Peru or Ecuador-\"This was out of fear, a scarcity mind-set, the expectation of a cascading collapse of financial systems,\" he said-but instead began planning a vertical farm in Brooklyn. Before he could see that idea through, he became friends with a Jamaican model and actress and moved to Kingston to help her launch a musical career. They got a house, built a recording studio, recorded some songs, and made some videos. \"Then things kind of fell apart,\" he said. \"It just got very complicated. And then Ethereum happened.\"</p><p>He'd got into Bitcoin in 2011, when he came across the Satoshi Nakamoto white paper on Slashdot and began studying Bitcoin and new protocols in the works. But it was Buterin's white paper that changed his life. \"Vitalik's paper was the best that I had read,\" Lubin said. He met Buterin at a meet-up in Toronto on New Year's Day, 2014. (I asked Lubin what that was like. \"We talked about blockchain,\" he said.)</p><p>Lubin gets a twinkle in his eye when he talks about what he sees as the first opportunity in human history to create systems without the traditional clerical class, the old priesthood of the record keepers, rune readers, and bean counters. Still, he acknowledges, \"You'll certainly need priests to build these systems.\" These would be the top-end coders, the devs. William Shatner has called crypto \"cyber-snob currency.\" In some respects, we'd be replacing one priesthood with another.</p><p>\"Governance\" is a dismal word, but in the crypto realm it has profound implications. It concerns how decisions are made, and who gets to make them. Each blockchain-as a technology, a community, and a social experiment-is an exercise in achieving consensus. The quest is a human one, so the mechanisms that rule it reflect the priorities of the mechanics. Technology, as we learn time and again, is no cure for human nature. Power accrues, even when the goal is to eliminate it. Szabo, the father of smart contracts and a staunch libertarian, tweeted recently, \"Blockchain governance generally comes in only three varieties: (1) Lord of the Flies, (2) lawyers, or (3) ruthlessly minimized.\" Someone asked, \"Why ruthless?\" and Szabo wrote, \"Otherwise the children or the lawyers will win.\"</p><p>Sometimes it can seem less \"Lord of the Flies\" than \"Life of Brian\"-a comical exercise in the narcissism of small differences. The Judean People's Front versus the People's Front of Judea. Last year, when bitcoin miners and developers clashed over how to increase the efficiency of the network, a faction split off-a maneuver called a hard fork-and created a new version of bitcoin, called Bitcoin Cash, whose most visible cheerleader is Roger Ver, a libertarian sometimes called Bitcoin Jesus. (He likes to say that digital money is as important an invention as the wheel, electricity, and the transistor.) Ver, who lives in Japan, was sentenced to ten months in prison for selling explosives online; this seems to have both inflamed his mistrust of institutional authority and enhanced his credibility as an anarcho-capitalist. Ver regularly declares that Bitcoin Cash is the true bitcoin, in keeping with the ideas set forth by Satoshi (as opposed to those espoused by all the \"Faketoshis\").</p><p>The guiding principle in cryptoworld's regular schisms is a version of \"Love it or leave it.\" The viability of any particular upgrade or project is measured by the extent to which people decide to adopt or participate in it. They do so either on the merits-a common invocation is D.Y.O.W. (do your own work)-or on the basis of the reputations of those proposing, endorsing, or criticizing any particular idea.</p><p>In the absence of formal hierarchy, reputational capital is paramount. The campaign to acquire it is waged largely on social media and on conference-panel stages. As the crypto stars strut their stuff, declare their allegiances, and taunt their rivals, you wind up with shifting, indistinct pecking orders. \"Our governance is inherently social,\" Vlad Zamfir said, on one such stage. \"People who are more connected in the community have more power, a kind of soft power.\"</p><p>\"There's definitely, in all blockchains and cryptocurrencies, some notion of what I call the high priest,\" Buterin told me. \"A high priest is basically someone who has high status inside a cryptocurrency community for whatever reason, and sometimes high priests say things. I don't know if you want to mix religious metaphors, but they can issue fatwas.\" Buterin wasn't excluding himself. He has no real institutional writ or hierarchal role and yet is, by default and by consensus, Ethereum's face and figurehead, as much the arbiter as on the day he paced the patio in Zug. It's a position that he's not entirely eager to maintain. \"The Ethereum community can't survive in the long term if it's completely dependent on me,\" he said. \"I think the right way to do that isn't to subtract myself. It's to add other people that can complement and potentially replace myself. There have been more and more outspoken core developers. I've acted in deliberate ways, for example, to encourage more high priests in the Ethereum community to show up. One of the things you can do is tolerate them.\"</p><p>\"Perceived authority and real authority blur,\" Hoskinson told me. \"Vitalik hasn't been elected to anything or endowed with any actual power. But when he speaks millions of people around the world listen.\"</p><p>Or they attack him. \"Vitalik has shouldered the weight of the world-of the unbelievable number of total assholes picking at him from a distance on the Internet, and he's done it at the age of nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, with a lot of grace,\" Lubin said. Last year, someone posted on a chat forum that Buterin had died in a car crash. The price of ether plummeted. To counter the report, Buterin posted a photo of himself, with a blockchain-appropriate time stamp-an Ethereum block number and its corresponding hash, written on a piece of paper. The price stabilized.</p><p>The most infamous crisis in the governance of Ethereum was the demise of the DAO-short for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. The DAO was a crowdsourced venture fund, a way of using smart contracts to cut out traditional venture capitalists, reduce fees, and give access to regular civilians, who contributed ether and voted on which projects to invest in. Two early aspirants were a German smart-locks startup (for rental properties and bicycles) and a French autonomous-electric-minicar ride-sharing venture. At the time, it was the biggest crowdfunding ever-the equivalent, then, of about a quarter-billion dollars, and, now, of about two billion. Within weeks, it was hacked. There was a loophole in the code; the hacker, who could repeatedly take money out of the DAO before the transfers were recorded, drained more than a quarter of the funds.</p><p>\"Vitalik was powerless,\" Emin G\u00fcn Sirer, the Cornell professor, who, with Zamfir, had been involved in critiquing the DAO, told me. Along with others, Sirer said, Buterin \"had to spam Ethereum with other transactions to slow down the hacker.\"</p><p>Some in the Ethereum community, including Buterin, Sirer, and Zamfir, argued for what was, effectively, the reversing of the transactions-altering what was supposed to have been unalterable-in order to restore the funds to the people who'd invested in the DAO. Others insisted that doing so would be a violation of the principle that blocks must remain immutable. \"We were all wondering, Is code law?\" Sirer recalled. \"What is code? What is law? What is the covenant? It was almost epistemological. We were a bunch of computer geeks way out of our depth.\" A schism ensued-a hard fork. The majority of Ethereum users followed Buterin and other prominent figures onto a new blockchain, while the fundamentalists stayed on the old chain, according to which the ether had been lost. The latter became known as Ethereum Classic, where, theoretically, the hacker, whoever it is, still holds stolen ether.</p><p>\"A lot of people who objected to the hard fork were not of the Ethereum community,\" Zamfir has said. \"It was more generally blockchain people concerned about the precedent.\"</p><p>Sirer said, \"If you are courting illegal money from, you know, cartels and drug dealers, you have to maintain immutability. That's the Bitcoin mentality.\"</p><p>To make a perilous generalization, the Bitcoin community seems to be more contentious and confrontational than Ethereum's, especially when it comes to internecine battles. The bitcoin-or-bust crowd, including the so-called HODLers, play a bruising game on Reddit and Twitter. (HODL, derived from a drunken typo of \"hold\" five years ago on a Bitcoin message board, is shorthand for holding onto one's bitcoin, come hell or high water, and is a Bitcoin maximalist battle cry.) In some respects, Bitcoin is as much a critique of the fiat money system as it is an alternative to it. As such, there's a side to it that seems always to be scrapping for a fight. It wants you to hold its beer. Ethereum retains some of Bitcoin's scrappy, libertarian characteristics, but, as a foundation for many other uses, it is by nature more fungible. The Ethereum network is a platform for other currencies and tokens. It's a bigger tent.</p><p>\"Ethereum folks are nice,\" Sirer said. \"Many are latecomers to the Bitcoin clique. They're Obamaesque. They like to ponder and think.\"</p><p>At any rate, Sirer said, \"the hard fork was the best thing that happened to Ethereum. It showed that Ethereum took errors seriously. And that it was practical and not dogmatic. It chose the right thing over the letter of the law-or, really, the letter of the code.\"</p><p>A small sliver of the population understands blockchain technology well enough to engage in fierce, esoteric debate over the meaning and relative importance of various ideas and terms. At the highest levels, everyone practices a kind of obscurantism, unwitting or otherwise. Elsewhere, people fake it. An investor who has met with Joe Lubin and Mike Novogratz, and who is getting up to speed for the purpose of a token sale for a publicly traded company, told me one day, with regard to levels of understanding, \"Joe, I'm guessing, is an 8.5 or maybe even a 9, out of 10. Vitalik, whom I've never met, I'm guessing is a 9.2. I'm probably a 2.5, maybe a 3. My tech guy is probably a 7, and I've met a few 4s and 5s who work in the space. But most every trader coming in from other fields that I've met is 2.5 or lower.\"</p><p>Peter Smith, the C.E.O. and co-founder of a cryptocurrency platform called Blockchain, told me one afternoon, \"This is my life's work, inventing a category, and I give myself a 4 out of 5. I don't know anyone who's a 5.\"</p><p>A ConsenSys engineer said, \"At a certain point, you break through it, you come to understand it all, and then the door closes behind you, and then you just get it but can't explain it. All the words you use to explain it are words people on the other side of the door don't understand.\"</p><p>A friend of mine who is involved in a blockchain startup remarked that people keep trying to explain the underlying technology-the engine under the hood rather than the car on the road. \"It's like they're trying to describe e-mail to people, and instead of saying, 'You can send messages to people over the Internet,' they're saying, 'There's a protocol called S.M.T.P., which locates a set of rules for the movement of files from one to another.'\u00a0\" And yet he also complained about what he calls the incorrigibles, the Luddites who refuse even to try, whom he likened to the people in an office who profess not to know how to work the copy machine.</p><p>Public understanding of the space has also been hindered by an abundance of silliness. The more frivolous uses and manifestations are the jazz hands of crypto, distracting from subtler virtues or cynical schemes. It was somehow unsurprising when the founders of a crypto debit card called Centra, which had been endorsed, to widespread sniggering, by the boxer Floyd Mayweather, Jr., and the producer DJ Khaled, were arrested for securities and wire fraud. (They pleaded not guilty.) The gold rush attracts a cartoonish array: Ashton Kutcher, 50 Cent, Jamie Foxx, Paris Hilton, Brock Pierce (former child star of \"The Mighty Ducks\"), and, of course, the Winklevoss twins, who plowed their Facebook settlement money into bitcoin and were later widely cited as crypto's first billionaires.</p><p>It is now a well-worn joke that one need only throw the word \"blockchain\" around to raise money or to seem smart. When the Long Island Iced Tea Corp. changed its name to Long Blockchain Corp., its share price nearly tripled, even though it hadn't really attempted to articulate any case for how a distributed ledger might be a panacea for the hawking of sugary drinks. Every few weeks, it seems, there's a new entry in the did-you-hear category of goofy alt-I.C.O.s. One day it's Bananacoin, offered by banana plantations in Laos and pegged to the price of a kilo of Lady Fingers, and another it's Dentacoin, a dentistry token, which-but, seriously-at one point had a market cap of more than two billion dollars. Coinye (the Shitcoin Formerly Known as Coinye West) might have had a shot, too, had its developers not been sued by Kanye for trademark infringement. Jesus Coin (a parody coin that has nonetheless been traded like a real one) and Christ Coin (a non-parody coin that has been shunned as though it were a spoof) have encountered no namesake legal issues. Nor has Mike Tyson Bitcoin, a digital-wallet app, about which Tyson said, \"In no way do I profess to be any kind of bitcoin currency guru. It just seems very interesting, and I'm intrigued with the possibilities.\" Turns out there is even a Koi Coin, worth a fraction of a penny.</p><p>Last December, as the price of ether was shooting up, the most popular DApp on Ethereum was CryptoKitties, a virtual-pet-collection racket-you adopt as a pet (or pets) unique bits of code that are stored on the network. Founder Cat #18-whose bio reads, in part, \"When no one's home, I invite my pals over and we listen to Rihanna. I look forward to riding unicorns with you\"-changed hands last year for the ether equivalent of a hundred and ten thousand dollars. The popularity of CryptoKitties clogged the network and exposed how ill-equipped Ethereum, as currently configured, is to handle the kind of volume it would have to in order to be anything close to as transformational as its adherents claim it will be.</p><p>Over the course of a few days-Blockchain Week in New York, in May-I saw Lubin onstage at three conferences taking on doubters of different kinds. The first was Nouriel Roubini, a.k.a. Dr. Doom, the economist best known for calling the 2008 financial meltdown. The organizers of the conference, called Fluidity, had promoted this debate as a kind of prizefight. A standing-room-only crowd of true believers and opportunists crammed into the vast domed hall of a former Gilded Age savings bank in Williamsburg. Roubini quickly warmed to the role of skeptical grouch. \"Ninety-nine per cent of all crypto transactions are occurring in centralized exchanges,\" he said. \"Vitalik Buterin is called, what, a benevolent dictator for life.\" He went on, \"Talking about decentralization is just nonsense.\" There was some laughter, and some booing. Lubin maintained a forbearing, almost mischievous smile, and in his customary flat tone disputed the assertions one at a time. \"Vitalik doesn't really write the code,\" he said. There are ten different teams that all \"fight with one another.\"</p><p>Lubin began conjuring the decentralized future again-state channels, sidechains, plasma, sharding-and Roubini said, \"You've been saying these things for five years. I mean, come on.\"</p><p>\"I can show you the code,\" Lubin said. \"We'll go back to the office after.\"</p><p>A man sitting next to me mumbled, referring to Roubini, \"He wouldn't even know what code looks like.\"</p><p>Roubini kept going: \"Of all the recent I.C.O.s, eighty-one per cent of them are scams.\" He summarized the usual blockchain pitch as being a variation on the old solution-in-search-of-a-problem spiel, and said, \"It's totally lunatic!\"</p><p>The audience began to jeer. \"Shut him up!\" someone shouted.</p><p>Lubin seemed to be enjoying himself. His remarks, and his posture, indicated confidence that history would prove Roubini woefully incorrect. (Gavin Wood told me that, whatever his differences with Lubin, he has no doubt that he is a true believer: \"It's like Joe took some acid or some DMT and saw the light.\")</p><p>There was a moderator, and she asked them both, \"Where do you think you could be wrong?\"</p><p>Lubin maintained the sly smile and said, \"I think I may be wrong when I anticipate that it will all take more time.\" Then he added, \"It's difficult being a human being living in exponential times.\"</p><p>It was difficult, certainly, being a non-exponential human being during Blockchain Week. There were the conferences themselves, each a welter of feverish networking and buoyant gobbledygook, and then all the side action-a party on a boat on the East River, another above a furniture store in Bushwick. Consensus 2018, the main event, staged by the news site CoinDesk, was at the Hilton, in midtown. No Zen Zone here. The organizers had apparently sold their media list. P.R. inquiries poured into my in-box, a deluge of cryptobabble.</p><p>In a vast ballroom at the Hilton, I saw Lubin bear up under another skeptical barrage. He shared the stage with Amber Baldet, who had recently left J.\u00a0P. Morgan, where she led blockchain initiatives, to launch a decentralized-application startup called Clovyr, which, with her business partner, Patrick Nielsen, she'd just announced. Like Lubin, Baldet is a proponent of finding ways to apply blockchain technology to existing businesses and corporations. They were joined by Jimmy Song, a Bitcoin developer and true believer, who was wearing a pink shirt and a cowboy hat and leaning back in his chair with performative insouciance. Song was asked what he thought of Baldet's Clovyr presentation.</p><p>\"I didn't see anything other than buzzwords. It's, like, let's play buzzword bingo!\" he said. \"I feel like I'm at a time-share presentation.\"</p><p>Baldet smiled and let him continue.</p><p>He went on, \"How can you decentralize, when you're a corporation, which is centralizing?\" He kept hammering away. \"Blockchains are expensive and slow\"; \"You're utilizing tools that don't fit the problem. You end up with crap\"; \"You're a hammer-thrower looking for nails\"; \"Blockchain is not a panacea. It's not this magical thing that you sprinkle blockchain dust over it and it's O.K.\"</p><p>Baldet, who has tattoos and lavender hair, has become adept at finessing the cognitive dissonance between crypto-anarchism and global banking, as well as that of being a woman in a mostly male line of work. She chalked up Song's aggressive stance to the ongoing game of reputation enhancement. You make a name in the space by staking out turf and fighting for it, onstage and online. She was also accustomed to men, especially on social media, dismissing her work out of hand.</p><p>Lubin said, \"So, five years from now we're going to see nothing but Bitcoin 1.0?\"</p><p>\"Five years from now, most of the projects in this space will be nothing,\" Song said.</p><p>\"If we can come up with some crisp criteria, I will bet you any amount of bitcoin that you're wrong,\" Lubin said.</p><p>The room buzzed. They agreed to set the terms on Twitter.</p><p>The larger world has tended to see crypto as an asset class and, therefore, in terms defined by arrows pointing up or down, as numbers displayed either in red or in green. The fact that prices have sunk so far, from the great hype cycle of 2017, leads some to conclude that its relevance is past, its demise nigh. As a method of payment, it remains flawed, owing to sparse adoption and price volatility-it's hard to open your crypto wallet when what you spend today on a six-pack might be enough next year to buy the brewery. Conversely, as a store of value, it has proved more fickle than the price of gold or real estate in Peru. As for its utility as a vehicle for systemic and societal renewal, it depends on whether society takes it up.</p><p>\"It took crypto seven years to get to one per cent of the global financial-services market,\" Peter Smith, the Blockchain C.E.O., said. \"Maybe at the end of my career we'll be at six per cent.\"</p><p>David Chaum, a computer scientist in California who decades ago laid a lot of the groundwork for cryptocurrency but then failed to participate in (or capitalize on) its recent rise, told me, \"There's never been, in the history of civilization, this much money aggregated as a result of doing nothing.\"</p><p>One night this month, Lubin, just back from travels to Paris, Hamburg, Singapore, Dublin, and Bermuda, was sitting up in bed in his Williamsburg apartment. \"There have been and will be booms and corrections,\" he said. \"I've seen five or six already. Our ecosystem is fifty times larger than it was a year ago. The price surge attracted attention, investment, and talent. The people who signed on, they're hooked: they can't unsee what they've seen.\"</p><p>At one point, at the Ethereal conference, I wandered away from a panel and made my way through the derelict factory complex, past promotional booths and Davos-calibre networking, to an airy brick hall, where Deepak Chopra was addressing a standing-room-only (and sitting-with-proper-posture-on-the-floor) audience. \"We are all conditioned by the mind, by culture, by religion, by history, by economics,\" he was saying. \"This shoe is a human construct, this hand is a human construct, meaning is a human construct. We created money. We created blockchain. These are human constructs.\"</p><p>This seemed inarguable, but perhaps beyond the purview of a crypto conference. Word around the site was that Buterin had boycotted Ethereal because of Chopra-that this was one cultic indulgence too many for the community's mathematicians and computer scientists. (\"It wasn't a kind of decision to deliberately boycott it,\" Buterin said later. \"I already had plans to be in San Francisco for one quiet week, and sometimes I have to reject stuff. Obviously, I think Deepak Chopra's crazy.\")</p><p>At a picnic table by a taco truck, I met a couple of crypto traders from Singapore. They weren't much interested in changing the world-or in trackable tuna or in an audience with Deepak Chopra. They were in the game to make money. They told wallet-scam tales and talked about Ethereum purely in currency-trading terms. \"Conferences are different here,\" one said. \"In Asia, they're for business. Here they're for marketing.\"</p><p>As of last week, Lubin and Song hadn't set the terms of their bet. For the most part, the big talk was the point. Whoever won, a few years hence, would receive the additional prize of the other being soon forgotten.\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWYRK-0028792X_1018_26</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWYRK2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TJJ-2971-DYWH-9185-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">237442</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"11024\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Conde Nast Publications, Inc.

And what is it good for?</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Not long ago, I was in Montreal for a cryptocurrency conference. My hotel, on the top floor of a big building downtown, had a roof garden with a koi pond. One morning, as I had coffee and a bagel in this garden, I watched a pair of ducks feeding on a mound of pellets that someone had left for them at the pond's edge. Every few seconds, they dipped their beaks to drink, and, in the process, spilled undigested pellets into the water. A few koi idled there, poking at the surface for the scraps. The longer I watched, the more I wondered if the ducks were deliberately feeding the fish. Was such a thing possible? I asked the breakfast attendant, a ruddy Quebecer. He smiled and said, \"No, but it is what I tell the children.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My mind had been marinating overnight-and for more than a year, really-in the abstrusities of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology on which they are built. Bitcoin and, subsequently, a proliferation of other cryptocurrencies had become an object of global fascination, amid prophecies of societal upheaval and reform, but mainly on the promise of instant wealth. A peer-to-peer money system that cut out banks and governments had made it possible, and fashionable, to get rich by sticking it to the Man.</p><p>Some of this stuff I understood; much of it I still did not. If you're not, say, a computer scientist or a mathematician, the deeper you get into the esoterica of distributed ledgers, consensus algorithms, hash functions, zero-knowledge proofs, byzantine-fault-tolerance theory, and so on-the farther you travel from the familiar terrain of \"the legacy world,\" where, one blockchain futurist told me, pityingly, I live-the better the chance you have of bumping up against the limits of your intelligence. You grasp, instead, for metaphors.</p><p>Blockchain talk makes a whiteboard of the brain. You're always erasing, starting over, as analogies present themselves. So, Montreal bagel in hand, I considered the ducks and the carp. Let the pellets be a cryptocurrency-koicoin, say. Would the ducks then be currency miners? Every altcoin-the catchall for cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin, the majority of which are eventually classified as shitcoin-has its own community of enthusiasts and kvetchers, so perhaps the koi were this one's. The koicommunity. The breakfast attendant who had put out the pellets: he'd be our koicoin Satoshi-as in Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous and still unidentified creator of Bitcoin. Yes, the koicoin protocol was strong, and the incentives appeared to be well aligned, but the project didn't really pass muster in terms of immutability, decentralization, and privacy. Koicoin was shitcoin.</p><p>A few hours later, I was at lunch in a conference room in another hotel, with a table of crypto wizards, a few of them among the most respected devs in the space. (Devs are developers, and even legacy worlders must surrender after a while and ditch the scare quotes around \"the space,\" when referring to the cryptosphere.) Four of these devs were researchers associated with Ethereum, the open-source blockchain platform. Ethereum is not itself a cryptocurrency; to operate on Ethereum, you have to use the cryptocurrency ether, which, like bitcoin, you can buy or sell. (Among cryptocurrencies, ether's market capitalization is second only to bitcoin's.) The devs were specimens of an itinerant coder \u00e9lite, engaged, wherever they turn up and to the exclusion of pretty much everything else, in the ongoing construction of an alternate global financial and computational infrastructure: a new way of handling money or identity, a system they describe as a better, decentralized version of the World Wide Web-a Web 3.0-more in keeping with the Internet's early utopian promise than with the invidious, monopolistic hellscape it has become. They want to seize back the tubes, and the data-our lives-from Facebook, Google, and the new oligarchs of Silicon Valley.</p><p>One of them, Vlad Zamfir, a twenty-eight-year-old Romanian-born mathematician who grew up in Ottawa and dropped out of the University of Guelph, was scribbling equations on an electronic tablet called a reMarkable pad. He narrated as he scrawled. The others at the table leaned in toward him, in a way that recalled Rembrandt's \"The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp.\" To the two or three people at the table who were clearly incapable of following along, he said, earnestly, \"Sorry to alienate you with my math.\" Zamfir is the lead developer of one strand of Casper, an ongoing software upgrade designed to make Ethereum scale better and work more securely-an undertaking thought to be vital to its viability and survival. \"It's shitty technology,\" Zamfir, whose Twitter bio reads \"absurdist, troll,\" told a journalist two years ago.</p><p>Zamfir was showing the others some rough equations he'd worked out to address one of the thousands of riddles that need to be solved. This particular effort was an attempt (jargon alert) to optimize the incentive structure for proof-of-stake validation-that is, how best to get enough people and machines to participate in a computing operation essential to the functioning of the entire system. \"We're trying to do game theory here,\" Zamfir said. The others pointed out what they thought might be flaws. \"It doesn't seem reasonable,\" Zamfir said. \"But the math works out.\" This summarized much of what I'd encountered in crypto.</p><p>To his right sat Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum's founder and semi-reluctant philosopher king. Buterin, who is twenty-four, occasionally glanced at Zamfir's formulas but mostly looked into the middle distance with a melancholic empty stare, sometimes typing out messages and tweets on his phone with one finger. He was a quick study, and also he pretty much already knew what Zamfir had come up with, and to his thinking the work wasn't quite there. \"When the models are getting overcomplicated, it's probably good to have more time to try to simplify them,\" he told me later, with what I took to be generous understatement.</p><p>Buterin had been working, simultaneously, on another version of Casper. So he and Zamfir were both collaborating and competing with each other. There seemed to be no ego or bitterness-in their appraisal of each other's work, in person, or on social media, where so much of the conversation takes place, in full view. Their assessments were Spockian, and cutting only to the Kirks among us.</p><p>They had first met before a conference in Toronto in 2014. Zamfir was amazed by Buterin, whom he called a \"walking computer,\" and he joined Ethereum as a researcher soon after. Now good friends who meet up mostly at conferences and workshops, they had greeted each other the day before in the hotel lobby with a fervent embrace, like summer campers back for another year, before quick-walking to a quiet corner to start in on the incentive-structure-for-proof-of-stake-validation talk. Whenever and wherever Buterin and Zamfir convene, people gather around-eavesdropping, hoping for scraps of insight. The two are used to this and pay little heed. There were no secrets, only problems and solutions, and the satisfaction that comes from proceeding from one toward the other.</p><p>The first time I heard the word \"Ethereum\" was in April, 2017. A hedge-fund manager, at a benefit in Manhattan, was telling me that he'd made more money buying and selling ether and other cryptocurrencies in the past year than he'd ever made at his old hedge fund. This was a significant claim, since the fund had made him a billionaire. He was using words I'd never heard before. He mentioned bitcoin, too, which I'd certainly heard a lot about but, like most people my age, didn't really understand. I'd idly hoped I might be just old enough to make it to my deathbed without having to get up to speed.</p><p>As the year wore on, that dream faded. The surge in the price of bitcoin, and of other cryptocurrencies, which proliferated amid a craze for initial coin offerings (I.C.O.s), prompted a commensurate explosion in the number of stories and conversations about this new kind of money and, sometimes more to the point, about the blockchain technology behind it-this either revolutionary or needlessly laborious way of keeping track of transactions and data. It seemed as if language had been randomized. I started hearing those words-the ones I'd never heard before-an awful lot: \"trustless,\" \"sharding,\" \"flippening.\" Explaining blockchain became a genre unto itself.</p><p>The dizzying run-up in crypto prices in 2017 was followed, this year, by a long, lurching retreat that, as the summer gave way to fall, began to seem perilous. As with notorious stock-market and real-estate bubbles, innocents had been taken in and cleaned out. But both boom and bust reflected an ongoing argument over what cryptocurrencies and their technological underpinnings might be worth-which is to say, whether they are, as some like to ask, real. Is crypto the future or a fad? Golden ticket or Ponzi scheme? Amazon 2.0 or tulip mania? And what is it good for, anyway? It sure is neat, but for now it lacks its killer app, a use that might lead to mass adoption, as e-mail did for the Internet. \"We need the hundred-dollar laptop, the iPod,\" a blockchain apostle told me.</p><p>Now and then, legacy titans voiced their scorn. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of J.\u00a0P. Morgan, labelled crypto \"a fraud\"; Warren Buffett used the phrase \"rat poison squared.\" Legions of skeptics and technophobes, out of envy, ignorance, or wisdom, savored such pronouncements, while the true believers and the vertiginously invested mostly brushed it aside. They had faith that a new order was nigh. They pumped but did not dump.</p><p>Among a certain subset, it was both fashionable and integral to ignore the fluctuations in price. The idea was to build and shore up a new system-for everything from payments and banking to health care and identity-that was either a replacement for the old one, or at least an alternative to it, one that was borderless, independent of state control and of exploitation by Big Tech. \"It's definitely nice to try to eke out some completely parallel kind of world that's totally separate from the existing one,\" Buterin said. \"It does interact with the rest of society, and the goal is definitely to help improve the mainstream world, but we're on a different track.\" Such an undertaking would, at best, take many years and likely span several economic and investment cycles. While the old armature rots, a new one rises alongside it, much as the new Tappan Zee Bridge, over the Hudson, gradually took shape next to the rusty old one it would one day replace. To Buterin, however, the benefits were already clear. \"The cryptocurrency space has succeeded at making certain aspects of the international economy more open, when politics is moving in the exact opposite direction,\" he said. \"I do think that's a meaningful contribution to the world.\"</p><p>Buterin is a striking figure, tall and very lean, with long, fidgety fingers, sharp elfin features, and vivid blue eyes, which, on the rare occasions when he allows them to meet yours, convey a depth and warmth that you don't expect, in light of the flat, robotic cadence and tone of his speech. People often joke about him being an alien, but they usually apologize for doing so, because there's a gentleness about him, an air of tolerance and moderation, that works as a built-in rebuke to such unkind remarks. As we spoke, on the first afternoon of the Montreal conference (the crypto life is a never-ending enchainment of conferences, and is pretty much wall-to-wall dudes), he aligned some items in front of him: pens, Post-its, phone. He forgoes most social niceties and overt expressions of emotion but, when he finds questions or assertions agreeable, is generous with notes of encouragement: \"Yep, yep, yep\"; \"Right, totally\"; \"Yes, yes, exactly.\" Arguable remarks elicit a mechanical \"Hmm.\" He seems to anticipate your question before you even know quite what it is, but he forces himself to allow you to finish. He has a dry sense of humor.</p><p>He said, \"I definitely don't have the kind of single-minded C.E.O. personality that a lot of Silicon Valley V.C.s lionize-that thing of being ambitious and wanting to win at all costs, like, basically, Mark Zuckerberg.\" He was dressed that day, as on the day before and the day after, in a gray turtleneck, black track pants, and laceless Adidas sneakers over turquoise socks. He often wears T-shirts with unicorns and rainbows. He likes to cite Lambos-as in Lamborghini, the cryptobro trophy ride of choice-as shorthand for the excessive trappings of wealth, which do not interest him. He's about as indifferently rich as a man can be. Although he sold a quarter of his bitcoin and ether well before the prices began to soar last year, he is said to be worth somewhere in the vicinity of a hundred million dollars. (He recently gave away a couple of million dollars to a life-extension research project.) He has no assistants or entourage. He owns little and travels light. \"Recently, I reduced my bag size from sixty litres to forty,\" he said. \"Forty is very tolerable. You can go on fifteen-kilometre walks with it.\" The Adidas, he said, were his only pair of shoes. \"Actually, I have another pair that's in one of the many places I call home.\" These are friends' apartments, where he sometimes sleeps for a few nights at a stretch-in Toronto, San Francisco, Singapore, Shanghai, Taipei. He especially likes East Asia. He speaks fluent Mandarin.</p><p>After Montreal, he was headed to Berlin and then Switzerland. His home, really, is the Internet. At one point, I referred to an Ethereum outpost in San Francisco, which I'd read about, as a \"base of operations,\" and he rejected the term: \"Home. Base of operations. The more you invent your own life style, the more you realize that the categories that have been invented are ultimately, at best, imperfect devices for understanding the world, and, at worst, fake.\"</p><p>I'd been trying for months to talk to Buterin. In January, I reached out to his father, Dmitry, who reported back that Vitalik was not interested in an interview. \"He is trying to focus his time on research,\" Dmitry said. \"He's not too excited that the community assigns so much importance to him. He wants the community to be more resilient.\" Dmitry Buterin, forty-six, is from Grozny, in Chechnya. He studied computer science in Moscow and then started a financial-software business, before emigrating to Canada, when Vitalik was six. Dmitry settled in Toronto, with Vitalik; Vitalik's mother, a financial analyst, chose Edmonton. Vitalik, when he was three, got an old PC and began fiddling around with Excel. By ten or eleven, he was developing video games. \"Vitalik was a very smart boy,\" his father said. \"It was not easy. His mind was always racing. It was hard for him to communicate. He hardly spoke until he was nine or ten. I was concerned, but at some point I realized it is what it is. I just gave him my love.\"</p><p>He also gave Vitalik his first glimpse of Bitcoin. It was 2011, somewhat early, but Dmitry was an avowed anarcho-capitalist, a cynical child of Soviet and post-Soviet Russia. For many others like him, especially in those early days, the first encounter with Bitcoin was like a religious epiphany-powerful, life-altering, a glimpse of an entirely different and perhaps more agreeable way of ordering human affairs. \"Bitcoin looks like money's dream of itself,\" the technology journalist Brian Patrick Eha wrote, in \"How Money Got Free.\"</p><p>\"Before Bitcoin came along, I was happily playing World of Warcraft,\" Vitalik told me. He had already been nursing some inchoate ideas about the risks and intrinsic unfairness of centralized systems and authority. He once told a journalist, \"I saw everything to do with either government regulation or corporate control as just being plain evil. And I assumed that people in those institutions were kind of like Mr. Burns, sitting behind their desks saying, 'Excellent. How can I screw a thousand people over this time?'\u00a0\" Bitcoin scratched this itch. But in many ways what drew him in was the elegance of the system, invented, it seemed, by a rogue outsider out of thin air. It suited a world view, a dream of a fluid, borderless, decentralized financial system beyond the reach of governments and banks, inclined as they inevitably are toward corruption and self-dealing, or at least toward distortions of incentive. Buterin said, \"If you look at the people that were involved in the early stages of the Bitcoin space, their earlier pedigrees, if they had any pedigrees at all, were in open source-Linux, Mozilla, and cypherpunk mailing lists.\" These were subversives and libertarians, ranging in political affinity from far left to weird right, as often as not without institutional or academic stature or access. \"I found it immensely empowering that just a few thousand people like myself could re-create this fundamental social institution from nothing.\"</p><p>In the eighties, cryptographers and computer scientists began trying to devise a foolproof form of digital money, and a way to execute transactions and contracts without the involvement (or rent-seeking) of third parties. It was the man, woman, or group of humans known as Satoshi Nakamoto who, with Bitcoin in 2008, solved the crux-the so-called double-spend problem. If you have ten dollars, you shouldn't be able to pay ten dollars for one thing, then spend the same ten for another. This requires some mechanism for keeping track of what you have, whom you gave it to, and how much they now have. And that was the blockchain.</p><p>Definitions of blockchain are as various as the metaphors-bingo, Google Docs, a giant room of transparent safes-that people use to try to illustrate them. Broadly speaking, a blockchain is an evolving record of all transactions that is maintained, simultaneously and in common, by every computer in the network of that blockchain, be it Ethereum, Bitcoin, or Monero. Think, as some have suggested, of a dusty leather-bound ledger in a Dickensian counting house, a record of every transaction relevant to that practice. Except that every accountant in London, and in Calcutta, has the same ledger, and when one adds a line to his own the addition appears in all of them. Once a transaction is affirmed, it will-theoretically, anyway-be in the ledger forever, unalterable and unerasable.</p><p>Historically, records have been stored in one place-a temple, a courthouse, a server-and kept by whoever presided. If you distrust central authority, or are queasy about Google, this won't do at all. With blockchains, the records, under a kind of cryptographic seal, are distributed to all and belong to no one. You can't revise them, because everyone is watching, and because the software will reject it if you try. There is no Undo button. Each block is essentially a bundle of transactions, with a tracking notation, represented in a bit of cryptographic code known as a \"hash,\" of all the transactions in the past. Each new block in the chain contains all the information (or, really, via the hash, a secure reference to all the information) contained in the previous one, all the way back to the first one, the so-called genesis block.</p><p>There are other words that are sometimes included in the definition of blockchain, but they are slippery, and grounds for endless parsing, asterisking, and debate. One is \"decentralized.\" (Some blockchains are more decentralized than others.) Another is \"immutable\"-the idea that, in theory, the past record can't be altered. (This is different from having your crypto stolen or hacked, when it's stored in an online \"wallet.\" That happens all the time!) Then there's \"privacy.\" The aspiration is for a digital coin to have the untraceability of cash. Because bitcoin was, at the outset, the dark Web's go-to tender for the purchase of drugs, sex, weaponry, and such, many assumed that it was private. But it isn't. Every transaction is there in the ledger for all to see. It is, fundamentally, anonymous (or pseudonymous, anyway), but there are many ways for that anonymity to be compromised.</p><p>The odds are high that someone, somewhere, has attempted to make an explanation like this one to you. The chain-splainer is a notorious date spoiler and cocktail-party pariah. Here he comes-you're trapped. You should have known better than to ask about mining.</p><p>Mining is a reward system-compensation for helping to maintain and build a blockchain. The work of establishing and recording what's legit takes machinery, memory, power, and time. Cryptocurrency blockchains require that a bunch of computers run software to affirm (or reject) transactions-it's a kind of automated convocation. During this ritual, the computers in the network are competing, via brute guesswork, to be the first to get the answer to a really difficult math problem. The more computational power you have, the more guesses you can make, and the more likely you are to get the answer. The winner creates a new block and gets a reward, in, say, bitcoin-new bitcoin, which has not previously been in circulation. (Satoshi ordained that there be a finite number of bitcoin ever created-twenty-one million-so that no one could inflate away the value of existing bitcoin, as, say, the Federal Reserve does with dollars. Other cryptocurrencies, including ether, don't necessarily have finite supplies.)</p><p>This system is known as Proof of Work. The problem-solving exercise is proof that the computers are doing the work. This approach has serious and, some would say, fatal, flaws. First, it requires a tremendous amount of electricity. This year, it is said, the Bitcoin network will use as much energy as the nation of Austria, and produce as much carbon dioxide as a million transatlantic flights. Mining rigs-computers designed specifically to do this work-are thirsty machines. Mining farms tend to sprout up where juice is cheap (typically, in proximity to hydropower projects with excess capacity to unload) and where temperatures are low (so you don't have to burn even more electricity to keep the rigs cool). There are open-air warehouses in remote corners of sub-Arctic Canada, Russia, and China, with machines whirring away on the tundra, creating magic money, while the permafrost melts. Second, a small number of mining conglomerates, or pools-many of them Chinese-have wielded outsized influence over the network and the decisions that get made. Last month, one of the biggest of these, Bitmain, confirmed plans to go public.</p><p>The alternative, which Zamfir and Buterin were working on in Montreal, is called Proof of Stake. In this scenario, the holders of the currency in question become the validators, who typically take a small cut of every approved transaction. Theoretically, the more crypto you have, the more influence you have, so PoW partisans consider PoS to be plutocratic as well-a new gloss on the old problem of too much in the hands of too few.</p><p>In 2013, Buterin travelled to San Jose for a Bitcoin meet-up, and felt that he'd encountered like-minded people for the first time in his life-a movement worth devoting himself to. \"The people that I had been searching for the whole time were actually all there,\" Buterin told me. Zooko Wilcox, a cryptographer, recalled Buterin telling him, \"This is the first technology I've ever loved that loves me back.\" Buterin had been writing blog posts about it for five bitcoins per post. Together, he and Mihai Alisie, a Romanian blockchain entrepreneur who'd read his posts, founded Bitcoin Magazine. Buterin had a knack for explaining things-at least to an audience already primed to understand. But, as he travelled around the world to Bitcoin meet-ups, he began to think that the technology was limited, that attempts to jury-rig non-money uses for this digital-money platform was the computational equivalent of a Swiss Army knife. You basically had to devise hacks. He envisaged a one-blade-fits-all version, a blockchain platform that was broader and more adaptable to a wider array of uses and applications. The concept behind Bitcoin-a network of machines all over the world-seemed to be a building block upon which to construct a global computer capable of all kinds of activities.</p><p>In the mid-nineties, Nick Szabo, a cryptographer and early cypherpunk, coined the term \"smart contract,\" which two decades later became the basis of Ethereum. This is a means of setting and enforcing the terms of an agreement without a middleman-no lawyer, notary, bookie, or referee. The terms are enshrined in and triggered by code, rather than by someone's interpretation of legal language or fit of pique. The proposition is that computer code, unlike, say, Hammurabi's or the Federal Reserve's, is impartial-that it can eliminate, or at least greatly reduce, the role of toxic subjectivity. This could cover a simple exchange of digital money, or the sale of a house, or an insurance payout, or a bet. Szabo's preferred metaphor was the vending machine. You don't generally require someone to vouch for the machine. In a smart-contract world, as he described it, if a borrower hasn't paid off his car loans in time his car just stops working, as per the terms of the loan, which are embedded in the code and integrated into the mechanism of the car.</p><p>The reliability of the code, and of the system for checking it, would discharge humans from having to read minds and look into hearts, or from having to pay someone else to make up for the fact that they cannot. As it stands, here in the dusty old legacy economy, we have to pay other people, and squander time and resources, to establish a modicum of trust. It's a legalized kind of protection racket. A favorite example is title insurance; an entire industry exists to prove that the person selling you a house is the owner in good standing. Provenance-of property, both real and intellectual-is big business, but, to the blockchain believers, it need not be. Code shall banish the odious frictions and costs. \"Blockchains are more fundamentally about increasing our ability to collaborate across these large social distances,\" Buterin said. \"It's the trust machine bringing more trust where there was less trust before.\"</p><p>Another thing we presently outsource, perhaps to our peril, is our identity: the affirmation of who we are, along with whatever data sticks to that. Identity as we know it now is typically maintained by a centralized state-by the taxman, the department of motor vehicles, the police. Then it spills out into the world, often without our knowledge or consent, through our transaction histories, browsing habits, and unencrypted communications. In the Google era, we spray aspects of ourselves all over the Internet. The blockchain innovation is what's often called \"self-sovereign identity,\" the idea that you'll control and parcel out information about yourself, as you wish. The Ethereum network maintains the attestation.</p><p>Then there are those vast realms where the old intermediaries hardly exist at all. The trust machine's most obvious beneficiaries are said to be the disenfranchised and the so-called unbanked-the billions of humans around the world with no passports or access to any reliable kind of financial system. We may find it harder to see the utility here in our daily lives, where we can rely on Citibank, Visa, Venmo, and Western Union to handle our transactions and keep track of all the money flying around. Amid such a sturdy (if extractive) system, the blockchain can seem like a back-office fix, a change in the accounting scheme, of interest to the systems geeks and bean counters but not to oblivious customers. But if you are, say, a Venezuelan citizen or a Turkish journalist, or a refugee from Syria or Myanmar, the prospect of being able to maintain and render portable both money and identity could be hugely liberating, perhaps even life-saving. Unless you forget your private key.</p><p>In November, 2013, Buterin wrote up a white paper-cryptoland is a blizzard of white papers-proposing a new open-source, distributed computing platform upon which you could build all kinds of smart-contract applications and uses, as well as other coins. He called it Ethereum. \"I was browsing a list of elements from science fiction on Wikipedia when I came across the name,\" he said then. \"I suppose it was the fact that [it] sounded nice and it had the word 'ether,' referring to the hypothetical invisible medium that permeates the universe and allows light to travel.\" He expected that experienced cryptographers would pick his proposal to pieces. Instead, everyone who read it seemed to be impressed by its elegance and ambition. Among the early enthusiasts were a handful of Toronto Bitcoiners who'd got to know one another at informal meet-ups and in a Skype group chat-\"a regular call with serious people,\" as one of them recalled.</p><p>The foundational gathering, in the Ethereum creation story, occurred at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, in January, 2014. These serious people decided to rent a beach house, and there, in a week or so, banged out a fuller sense of what Ethereum, Buterin's \"computer in the sky,\" as he described it to me, might become. They defined themselves as founders. Among them were Gavin Wood (a British programmer who later took on the role of Ethereum's chief technology officer), Charles Hoskinson (a Colorado programmer who was briefly the C.E.O.), and Anthony Di Iorio, a Torontonian who was underwriting the project. Di Iorio had invited a fellow Toronto Bitcoiner named Joseph Lubin, then forty-nine, who, with a sense of the import of the occasion, brought along the reporter Morgen Peck, to bear witness. She later described it as \"an after-hours grease trap\" for dozens of additional participants in the conference. (The online publication Backchannel published her story, as well as a photograph she'd snapped of Buterin working at his laptop one morning while the rest of the house slept. Peck says that the pot pipe on the table next to him wasn't his.)</p><p>Buterin's Miami d\u00e9but of Ethereum was a hit. Nineteen at the time, he dropped out of the University of Waterloo, where he'd been studying computer science, and devoted himself full time to the Ethereum project. \"We realized this was going to be big,\" Hoskinson recalled.</p><p>The founders assumed different roles. Lubin, who had Wall Street experience, was the chief operating officer. \"That's one of the silly titles we chose to give ourselves,\" Lubin told me. \"It didn't really mean anything in that weird open-source project.\" (Buterin dubbed himself the C-3PO.) Lubin positioned himself as the grownup in the room, the worldly chaperon. Wood, with whom he eventually clashed, said, \"He wanted to be the mentor, the Obi-Wan Kenobi, but unfortunately he became the Darth Vader.\"</p><p>Months of work ensued, in which the founders came up with a lexicon and a conceptual framework both to define Ethereum in lay(ish) terms and to inoculate it against possible legal consequences. When the idea arose to sell new cryptocoins to the public, to raise money for the project, Lubin, along with Hoskinson, recognized that this might be a fraught enterprise. \"Some people, including me, pointed out that it looks like we were going to raise tens of millions of dollars from bitcoin nouveau riche and that we might want to talk to some lawyers-that we should be concerned that we might be selling an unregistered security to Americans,\" Lubin said. It was an exercise in semiotics with vital legal implications.</p><p>\"In that process, we pretty much defined what Ethereum is and what ether is,\" Lubin said. \"We realized-I realized-that we had an opportunity to tell people what this is, and there was a good chance that they were just going to accept our understanding and that we could create reality that way. And it seems to have worked. We seem to have created a reality.\" Language is consciousness: they defined ether as a \"crypto-fuel,\" which one needs to run programs and store data on the Ethereum system. Wood, at a meet-up in New York, called it \"a computer at the center of the world,\" like a sixties-era mainframe that everyone everywhere can use.</p><p>The founders took to calling it \"the world computer,\" and debated the best corporate conveyance. Should it be a for-profit entity funded by an I.C.O. or by venture capital-like Ripple, an earlier cryptocurrency protocol launch-or a not-for-profit foundation, with independent oversight? Different groups among the eight founders staked out different positions, with some favoring for-profit, others not-for-profit. \"Things started souring pretty quickly,\" Hoskinson recalls. Wood told me, \"There was this sense, which I found distasteful, that Vitalik was the goose that laid the golden egg, and he was treated in that objectivizing form by everyone else, like he was some alien from Mars sent to help us all.\"</p><p>\"There was a lot of drama,\" Lubin said. \"It got really complicated.\" Broadly speaking, the developers, among them Wood, were wary of the motives and methods of the business guys, who in turn felt that the developers lacked practical sense and an appreciation for the allure of a big payday.</p><p>Eventually, the founders agreed to let Buterin decide. \"I was definitely the person that people had respected and trusted more than they trusted each other, which was unfortunate and sad,\" Buterin said. He was also, he said, \"seemingly the most harmless of the group.\"</p><p>\"Vitalik was innocent and unprepared,\" Dmitry Buterin told me. \"He had to learn a lot of tough lessons about people.\"</p><p>Six months after Miami, the whole team holed up in a house in Switzerland, in the canton of Zug, an old commodities-hedge-fund tax haven now known as Crypto Valley. This was the first time all of the founders were in one room together. Buterin, after some time alone on the patio, told Hoskinson and another founder that they were out. Later, he made clear that Ethereum would proceed as a nonprofit. \"It was a shitty time, and it was a shitty thing for Vitalik to have to do,\" Wood said.</p><p>\"That was one of those few nuclear bombs that I threw into the Ethereum governance process,\" Buterin told me. \"I felt very strongly that Ethereum is meant to be this open-source project for the world,\" he continued. \"Having a for-profit entity be at the center of it felt like going way too far in this centralized direction.\" The remaining founders established the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation, with headquarters in Zug, to help fund development. (Ethereum itself is based nowhere, and in traditional corporate terms is as substantial as the ether.)</p><p>And so the founders, driven by discord and the appeal of more lucrative endeavors, decentralized themselves. \"We all scattered to the winds,\" Hoskinson told me. He eventually started a crypto company called IOHK, and a blockchain project called Cardano. \"Now I run my own company, with a hundred and sixty people,\" he told me. \"I'm basically a billionaire. At this point, I couldn't care less about those six months of my life with Ethereum.\"</p><p>What would a world reconstituted by smart contracts look like? One grasps at legacy tableaux: office towers emptied of bankers, lawyers, and accountants; crypto-utopian settlements on hurricane-ravaged Caribbean islands; open-air barns out on the steppes, stacked with bitcoin-mining computers. In May, I attended the Ethereal Summit, a conference held in a former industrial glassworks in Maspeth, Queens. The symbolism-new order sprouting up in the derelict precincts of the old-was on the nose, as was the vibe: food trucks, local craft beers, a \"Zen Zone\" meditation tent. Here was blockchain as life style. Two big bathrooms, side by side, started out unisex, but by the afternoon of the first day the conference attendees, at the urging of no centralized authority, were self-sorting: men to the one on the right, women the one on the left.</p><p>On the main stage, a roster of luminaries and evangelists served up a steady diet of jargon stew, but elsewhere in the old factory you could find spoonfuls of sugar-use cases for English majors. One was a presentation of a supply-chain startup called Viant, which had deployed the blockchain to track fish from \"bait to plate.\" A video depicted a yellowfin tuna caught off Fiji on April 10th. And here it was, a month later, as sashimi, its provenance indisputable, trusted, immutable, thanks to the blockchain. Everyone surged forward for a free taste-plate-to-mouth still requiring humans to jostle and reach. There was a panel discussion with the founders of Civil, an attempt to use the blockchain to remake the journalism business, amid the wreckage wrought by the Internet and the demise of the advertising model. And, in a small brick outbuilding, there was a demonstration of something called Cellarius, which was, according to its founder, Igor Lilic, (1) a crowdsourced sci-fi story, set in the year 2084, after the activation of an artificial super-intelligence; (2) a community of artists and collaborators; and (3) a technological platform that its developers were gradually building out. \"It's a hypothesis,\" Lilic said. \"The long-term goal is to figure out some new economics of intellectual property.\" A worthy goal, Lord knows, and yet I failed to understand what it had to do with distributed ledgers or consensus algorithms.</p><p>The host of the conference was ConSensys, a company that Lubin started, in Brooklyn, in 2014, after he left Ethereum. ConSensys is an incubator of new businesses and projects that operate-or will, or would-on the Ethereum blockchain. It is the Ethereum community's most prominent and ubiquitous developer and promoter of what are called DApps, for decentralized applications, less for stuff like tuna fish or sci-fi than for such fundamentals of commerce as property ownership, identity management, document verification, commodities trading, and legal agreements-the rudiments of what Lubin calls the infrastructure of a new decentralized economy.</p><p>ConSensys's home base, in a graffittied industrial space in Bushwick, is a defiant, almost ostentatious expression of an anti-corporate ethos-a nod to crypto's anarchic underpinnings, but with a bit of pretense, since ConSensys consults with businesses and governments seeking help in building private blockchains. A friend who has done some work with them said, \"They have billions of dollars to spend. Why is it like this? Why don't they have an office on Twenty-eighth Street in Manhattan, like everyone else?\" The firm now has more than a thousand employees, in offices around the world. (Lubin says that they've hired a lot of people from I.B.M.) \"They have so much money,\" another member of the community said. \"The approach is, throw it all at the wall and see what sticks.\" So far, not much has. They can cite dozens of projects in various stages of emergence; none has morphed into a killer DApp.</p><p>Lubin is said to be the largest holder of ether and is estimated to be worth more than a billion dollars. A few people told me that he had started ConSensys to enhance the value of his ether. When I asked him about this, he scoffed. \"What a poor strategy that would be for making money,\" he said. \"Like, yeah, I'm going to build a company on an ecosystem that doesn't exist, so I can increase the value of my Internet magic-money holdings.\" He went on, \"The people who were in the space early were there for philosophical reasons, for political or economic reasons not tied to their personal wealth.\" ConSensys has instituted a policy that forbids employees from talking about price. I went to see Lubin in Bushwick one day, after ether, and other currencies, had suffered a huge drop in value overnight. When I asked him about the plunge, he said, \"Who gives a fuck?\" Not a cryptobillionaire, apparently.</p><p>For a great number of people at Ethereal, there was an evangelical fervor-techno-utopianism in a new guise, unaffiliated, for the most part, with Silicon Valley and the cults of Elon and @Jack. The director of the Ethereum Foundation, Aya Miyaguchi, told me, \"We want to change the world. We actually believe in it.\"</p><p>The first time I met Lubin, who was with his chief marketing officer, Amanda Gutterman-over tacos in Williamsburg, in the summer of 2017-Gutterman said, \"We call him white Morpheus,\" in reference to the Laurence Fishburne character in \"The Matrix.\" (It started as a meme on Reddit.) Lubin summoned a parallel reality, where heretofore unempowered citizens would be able to perform amazing feats. Like Buterin, he rejects the primacy, in business, of the charismatic founder, and yet the world can seem to insist on it. If Buterin, who is often depicted in fan art as Jesus with a Lambo, is a kind of blockchain messiah, Lubin is its Paul, both in his tireless evangelism and in his attention to practical, worldly matters. He is an Ethereum true believer, but he is also a proponent of so-called enterprise applications-actual business uses, often on private blockchains-which could get the legacy world interested in hastening its own obsolescence.</p><p>\"Joe gets criticized for trying to push Ethereum into enterprise,\" Emin G\u00fcn Sirer, a professor of computer science at Cornell who has worked with Ethereum, says. \"You have two sides to it all. The one that appeals to the fringe counterculture versus the one where someone has to pay all these developers' bills. One to appeal to the cypherpunk kids, another to appeal to the adults in the room.\"</p><p>Lubin has a shaved head and the flat accent of a native Torontonian. In a roast-tinged panel discussion at Ethereal, the comedian Ronny Chieng, from \"The Daily Show,\" worked Lubin over for his fashion sense (stone-washed jeans and big swag-bag T-shirts), for the fact that his features don't seem to move when he talks (\"You'd get more investors if you moved your face\"), and for his apparent inability to explain anything without using words that were invented less than two years ago.</p><p>Reared in Toronto (his father is a dentist, his mother a retired real-estate broker), Lubin played squash and studied electrical engineering and computer science at Princeton. Among his roommates were Mike Novogratz, now a hedge-fund investor, who in 2017 became the Wall Street face of the crypto boom, and a wrestler named Richard Tavoso, known as Fudge, who kept a record of who owed what to whom in their regular poker games. Fudge's ledger became a handy analogy for other roommates and friends, thirty years later, when they followed Lubin and Novogratz into the blockchain boom.</p><p>After graduating, Lubin tried to make a go of it as a pro squash player while working as a researcher on artificial-intelligence experiments, helping to build nervous systems and visual systems for robots. He married young, had a son, got divorced. There followed some years of programming and Wall Street work, including at Goldman Sachs and then at a banking consortium called Identrus. \"That's where I learned about cryptography, and how to write software with cryptographic systems,\" he said. He later developed a program for trading currencies and securities, started a fund, and did very well. Nonetheless, his encounters with the global financial markets, before and after the 2008 collapse, and his earlier immersion in science fiction and cyberpunk culture, put him in a quasi-apocalyptic frame of mind. (He has entertained the theory that 9/11 was an inside job.) He looked into buying land in Peru or Ecuador-\"This was out of fear, a scarcity mind-set, the expectation of a cascading collapse of financial systems,\" he said-but instead began planning a vertical farm in Brooklyn. Before he could see that idea through, he became friends with a Jamaican model and actress and moved to Kingston to help her launch a musical career. They got a house, built a recording studio, recorded some songs, and made some videos. \"Then things kind of fell apart,\" he said. \"It just got very complicated. And then Ethereum happened.\"</p><p>He'd got into Bitcoin in 2011, when he came across the Satoshi Nakamoto white paper on Slashdot and began studying Bitcoin and new protocols in the works. But it was Buterin's white paper that changed his life. \"Vitalik's paper was the best that I had read,\" Lubin said. He met Buterin at a meet-up in Toronto on New Year's Day, 2014. (I asked Lubin what that was like. \"We talked about blockchain,\" he said.)</p><p>Lubin gets a twinkle in his eye when he talks about what he sees as the first opportunity in human history to create systems without the traditional clerical class, the old priesthood of the record keepers, rune readers, and bean counters. Still, he acknowledges, \"You'll certainly need priests to build these systems.\" These would be the top-end coders, the devs. William Shatner has called crypto \"cyber-snob currency.\" In some respects, we'd be replacing one priesthood with another.</p><p>\"Governance\" is a dismal word, but in the crypto realm it has profound implications. It concerns how decisions are made, and who gets to make them. Each blockchain-as a technology, a community, and a social experiment-is an exercise in achieving consensus. The quest is a human one, so the mechanisms that rule it reflect the priorities of the mechanics. Technology, as we learn time and again, is no cure for human nature. Power accrues, even when the goal is to eliminate it. Szabo, the father of smart contracts and a staunch libertarian, tweeted recently, \"Blockchain governance generally comes in only three varieties: (1) Lord of the Flies, (2) lawyers, or (3) ruthlessly minimized.\" Someone asked, \"Why ruthless?\" and Szabo wrote, \"Otherwise the children or the lawyers will win.\"</p><p>Sometimes it can seem less \"Lord of the Flies\" than \"Life of Brian\"-a comical exercise in the narcissism of small differences. The Judean People's Front versus the People's Front of Judea. Last year, when bitcoin miners and developers clashed over how to increase the efficiency of the network, a faction split off-a maneuver called a hard fork-and created a new version of bitcoin, called Bitcoin Cash, whose most visible cheerleader is Roger Ver, a libertarian sometimes called Bitcoin Jesus. (He likes to say that digital money is as important an invention as the wheel, electricity, and the transistor.) Ver, who lives in Japan, was sentenced to ten months in prison for selling explosives online; this seems to have both inflamed his mistrust of institutional authority and enhanced his credibility as an anarcho-capitalist. Ver regularly declares that Bitcoin Cash is the true bitcoin, in keeping with the ideas set forth by Satoshi (as opposed to those espoused by all the \"Faketoshis\").</p><p>The guiding principle in cryptoworld's regular schisms is a version of \"Love it or leave it.\" The viability of any particular upgrade or project is measured by the extent to which people decide to adopt or participate in it. They do so either on the merits-a common invocation is D.Y.O.W. (do your own work)-or on the basis of the reputations of those proposing, endorsing, or criticizing any particular idea.</p><p>In the absence of formal hierarchy, reputational capital is paramount. The campaign to acquire it is waged largely on social media and on conference-panel stages. As the crypto stars strut their stuff, declare their allegiances, and taunt their rivals, you wind up with shifting, indistinct pecking orders. \"Our governance is inherently social,\" Vlad Zamfir said, on one such stage. \"People who are more connected in the community have more power, a kind of soft power.\"</p><p>\"There's definitely, in all blockchains and cryptocurrencies, some notion of what I call the high priest,\" Buterin told me. \"A high priest is basically someone who has high status inside a cryptocurrency community for whatever reason, and sometimes high priests say things. I don't know if you want to mix religious metaphors, but they can issue fatwas.\" Buterin wasn't excluding himself. He has no real institutional writ or hierarchal role and yet is, by default and by consensus, Ethereum's face and figurehead, as much the arbiter as on the day he paced the patio in Zug. It's a position that he's not entirely eager to maintain. \"The Ethereum community can't survive in the long term if it's completely dependent on me,\" he said. \"I think the right way to do that isn't to subtract myself. It's to add other people that can complement and potentially replace myself. There have been more and more outspoken core developers. I've acted in deliberate ways, for example, to encourage more high priests in the Ethereum community to show up. One of the things you can do is tolerate them.\"</p><p>\"Perceived authority and real authority blur,\" Hoskinson told me. \"Vitalik hasn't been elected to anything or endowed with any actual power. But when he speaks millions of people around the world listen.\"</p><p>Or they attack him. \"Vitalik has shouldered the weight of the world-of the unbelievable number of total assholes picking at him from a distance on the Internet, and he's done it at the age of nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, with a lot of grace,\" Lubin said. Last year, someone posted on a chat forum that Buterin had died in a car crash. The price of ether plummeted. To counter the report, Buterin posted a photo of himself, with a blockchain-appropriate time stamp-an Ethereum block number and its corresponding hash, written on a piece of paper. The price stabilized.</p><p>The most infamous crisis in the governance of Ethereum was the demise of the DAO-short for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. The DAO was a crowdsourced venture fund, a way of using smart contracts to cut out traditional venture capitalists, reduce fees, and give access to regular civilians, who contributed ether and voted on which projects to invest in. Two early aspirants were a German smart-locks startup (for rental properties and bicycles) and a French autonomous-electric-minicar ride-sharing venture. At the time, it was the biggest crowdfunding ever-the equivalent, then, of about a quarter-billion dollars, and, now, of about two billion. Within weeks, it was hacked. There was a loophole in the code; the hacker, who could repeatedly take money out of the DAO before the transfers were recorded, drained more than a quarter of the funds.</p><p>\"Vitalik was powerless,\" Emin G\u00fcn Sirer, the Cornell professor, who, with Zamfir, had been involved in critiquing the DAO, told me. Along with others, Sirer said, Buterin \"had to spam Ethereum with other transactions to slow down the hacker.\"</p><p>Some in the Ethereum community, including Buterin, Sirer, and Zamfir, argued for what was, effectively, the reversing of the transactions-altering what was supposed to have been unalterable-in order to restore the funds to the people who'd invested in the DAO. Others insisted that doing so would be a violation of the principle that blocks must remain immutable. \"We were all wondering, Is code law?\" Sirer recalled. \"What is code? What is law? What is the covenant? It was almost epistemological. We were a bunch of computer geeks way out of our depth.\" A schism ensued-a hard fork. The majority of Ethereum users followed Buterin and other prominent figures onto a new blockchain, while the fundamentalists stayed on the old chain, according to which the ether had been lost. The latter became known as Ethereum Classic, where, theoretically, the hacker, whoever it is, still holds stolen ether.</p><p>\"A lot of people who objected to the hard fork were not of the Ethereum community,\" Zamfir has said. \"It was more generally blockchain people concerned about the precedent.\"</p><p>Sirer said, \"If you are courting illegal money from, you know, cartels and drug dealers, you have to maintain immutability. That's the Bitcoin mentality.\"</p><p>To make a perilous generalization, the Bitcoin community seems to be more contentious and confrontational than Ethereum's, especially when it comes to internecine battles. The bitcoin-or-bust crowd, including the so-called HODLers, play a bruising game on Reddit and Twitter. (HODL, derived from a drunken typo of \"hold\" five years ago on a Bitcoin message board, is shorthand for holding onto one's bitcoin, come hell or high water, and is a Bitcoin maximalist battle cry.) In some respects, Bitcoin is as much a critique of the fiat money system as it is an alternative to it. As such, there's a side to it that seems always to be scrapping for a fight. It wants you to hold its beer. Ethereum retains some of Bitcoin's scrappy, libertarian characteristics, but, as a foundation for many other uses, it is by nature more fungible. The Ethereum network is a platform for other currencies and tokens. It's a bigger tent.</p><p>\"Ethereum folks are nice,\" Sirer said. \"Many are latecomers to the Bitcoin clique. They're Obamaesque. They like to ponder and think.\"</p><p>At any rate, Sirer said, \"the hard fork was the best thing that happened to Ethereum. It showed that Ethereum took errors seriously. And that it was practical and not dogmatic. It chose the right thing over the letter of the law-or, really, the letter of the code.\"</p><p>A small sliver of the population understands blockchain technology well enough to engage in fierce, esoteric debate over the meaning and relative importance of various ideas and terms. At the highest levels, everyone practices a kind of obscurantism, unwitting or otherwise. Elsewhere, people fake it. An investor who has met with Joe Lubin and Mike Novogratz, and who is getting up to speed for the purpose of a token sale for a publicly traded company, told me one day, with regard to levels of understanding, \"Joe, I'm guessing, is an 8.5 or maybe even a 9, out of 10. Vitalik, whom I've never met, I'm guessing is a 9.2. I'm probably a 2.5, maybe a 3. My tech guy is probably a 7, and I've met a few 4s and 5s who work in the space. But most every trader coming in from other fields that I've met is 2.5 or lower.\"</p><p>Peter Smith, the C.E.O. and co-founder of a cryptocurrency platform called Blockchain, told me one afternoon, \"This is my life's work, inventing a category, and I give myself a 4 out of 5. I don't know anyone who's a 5.\"</p><p>A ConSensys engineer said, \"At a certain point, you break through it, you come to understand it all, and then the door closes behind you, and then you just get it but can't explain it. All the words you use to explain it are words people on the other side of the door don't understand.\"</p><p>A friend of mine who is involved in a blockchain startup remarked that people keep trying to explain the underlying technology-the engine under the hood rather than the car on the road. \"It's like they're trying to describe e-mail to people, and instead of saying, 'You can send messages to people over the Internet,' they're saying, 'There's a protocol called S.M.T.P., which locates a set of rules for the movement of files from one to another.'\u00a0\" And yet he also complained about what he calls the incorrigibles, the Luddites who refuse even to try, whom he likened to the people in an office who profess not to know how to work the copy machine.</p><p>Public understanding of the space has also been hindered by an abundance of silliness. The more frivolous uses and manifestations are the jazz hands of crypto, distracting from subtler virtues or cynical schemes. It was somehow unsurprising when the founders of a crypto debit card called Centra, which had been endorsed, to widespread sniggering, by the boxer Floyd Mayweather, Jr., and the producer DJ Khaled, were arrested for securities and wire fraud. (They pleaded not guilty.) The gold rush attracts a cartoonish array: Ashton Kutcher, 50 Cent, Jamie Foxx, Paris Hilton, Brock Pierce (former child star of \"The Mighty Ducks\"), and, of course, the Winklevoss twins, who plowed their Facebook settlement money into bitcoin and were later widely cited as crypto's first billionaires.</p><p>It is now a well-worn joke that one need only throw the word \"blockchain\" around to raise money or to seem smart. When the Long Island Iced Tea Corp. changed its name to Long Blockchain Corp., its share price nearly tripled, even though it hadn't really attempted to articulate any case for how a distributed ledger might be a panacea for the hawking of sugary drinks. Every few weeks, it seems, there's a new entry in the did-you-hear category of goofy alt-I.C.O.s. One day it's Bananacoin, offered by banana plantations in Laos and pegged to the price of a kilo of Lady Fingers, and another it's Dentacoin, a dentistry token, which-but, seriously-at one point had a market cap of more than two billion dollars. Coinye (the Shitcoin Formerly Known as Coinye West) might have had a shot, too, had its developers not been sued by Kanye for trademark infringement. Jesus Coin (a parody coin that has nonetheless been traded like a real one) and Christ Coin (a non-parody coin that has been shunned as though it were a spoof) have encountered no namesake legal issues. Nor has Mike Tyson Bitcoin, a digital-wallet app, about which Tyson said, \"In no way do I profess to be any kind of bitcoin currency guru. It just seems very interesting, and I'm intrigued with the possibilities.\" Turns out there is even a Koi Coin, worth a fraction of a penny.</p><p>Last December, as the price of ether was shooting up, the most popular DApp on Ethereum was CryptoKitties, a virtual-pet-collection racket-you adopt as a pet (or pets) unique bits of code that are stored on the network. Founder Cat #18-whose bio reads, in part, \"When no one's home, I invite my pals over and we listen to Rihanna. I look forward to riding unicorns with you\"-changed hands last year for the ether equivalent of a hundred and ten thousand dollars. The popularity of CryptoKitties clogged the network and exposed how ill-equipped Ethereum, as currently configured, is to handle the kind of volume it would have to in order to be anything close to as transformational as its adherents claim it will be.</p><p>Over the course of a few days-Blockchain Week in New York, in May-I saw Lubin onstage at three conferences taking on doubters of different kinds. The first was Nouriel Roubini, a.k.a. Dr. Doom, the economist best known for calling the 2008 financial meltdown. The organizers of the conference, called Fluidity, had promoted this debate as a kind of prizefight. A standing-room-only crowd of true believers and opportunists crammed into the vast domed hall of a former Gilded Age savings bank in Williamsburg. Roubini quickly warmed to the role of skeptical grouch. \"Ninety-nine per cent of all crypto transactions are occurring in centralized exchanges,\" he said. \"Vitalik Buterin is called, what, a benevolent dictator for life.\" He went on, \"Talking about decentralization is just nonsense.\" There was some laughter, and some booing. Lubin maintained a forbearing, almost mischievous smile, and in his customary flat tone disputed the assertions one at a time. \"Vitalik doesn't really write the code,\" he said. There are ten different teams that all \"fight with one another.\"</p><p>Lubin began conjuring the decentralized future again-state channels, sidechains, plasma, sharding-and Roubini said, \"You've been saying these things for five years. I mean, come on.\"</p><p>\"I can show you the code,\" Lubin said. \"We'll go back to the office after.\"</p><p>A man sitting next to me mumbled, referring to Roubini, \"He wouldn't even know what code looks like.\"</p><p>Roubini kept going: \"Of all the recent I.C.O.s, eighty-one per cent of them are scams.\" He summarized the usual blockchain pitch as being a variation on the old solution-in-search-of-a-problem spiel, and said, \"It's totally lunatic!\"</p><p>The audience began to jeer. \"Shut him up!\" someone shouted.</p><p>Lubin seemed to be enjoying himself. His remarks, and his posture, indicated confidence that history would prove Roubini woefully incorrect. (Gavin Wood told me that, whatever his differences with Lubin, he has no doubt that he is a true believer: \"It's like Joe took some acid or some DMT and saw the light.\")</p><p>There was a moderator, and she asked them both, \"Where do you think you could be wrong?\"</p><p>Lubin maintained the sly smile and said, \"I think I may be wrong when I anticipate that it will all take more time.\" Then he added, \"It's difficult being a human being living in exponential times.\"</p><p>It was difficult, certainly, being a non-exponential human being during Blockchain Week. There were the conferences themselves, each a welter of feverish networking and buoyant gobbledygook, and then all the side action-a party on a boat on the East River, another above a furniture store in Bushwick. Consensus 2018, the main event, staged by the news site CoinDesk, was at the Hilton, in midtown. No Zen Zone here. The organizers had apparently sold their media list. P.R. inquiries poured into my in-box, a deluge of cryptobabble.</p><p>In a vast ballroom at the Hilton, I saw Lubin bear up under another skeptical barrage. He shared the stage with Amber Baldet, who had recently left J.\u00a0P. Morgan, where she led blockchain initiatives, to launch a decentralized-application startup called Clovyr, which, with her business partner, Patrick Nielsen, she'd just announced. Like Lubin, Baldet is a proponent of finding ways to apply blockchain technology to existing businesses and corporations. They were joined by Jimmy Song, a Bitcoin developer and true believer, who was wearing a pink shirt and a cowboy hat and leaning back in his chair with performative insouciance. Song was asked what he thought of Baldet's Clovyr presentation.</p><p>\"I didn't see anything other than buzzwords. It's, like, let's play buzzword bingo!\" he said. \"I feel like I'm at a time-share presentation.\"</p><p>Baldet smiled and let him continue.</p><p>He went on, \"How can you decentralize, when you're a corporation, which is centralizing?\" He kept hammering away. \"Blockchains are expensive and slow\"; \"You're utilizing tools that don't fit the problem. You end up with crap\"; \"You're a hammer-thrower looking for nails\"; \"Blockchain is not a panacea. It's not this magical thing that you sprinkle blockchain dust over it and it's O.K.\"</p><p>Baldet, who has tattoos and lavender hair, has become adept at finessing the cognitive dissonance between crypto-anarchism and global banking, as well as that of being a woman in a mostly male line of work. She chalked up Song's aggressive stance to the ongoing game of reputation enhancement. You make a name in the space by staking out turf and fighting for it, onstage and online. She was also accustomed to men, especially on social media, dismissing her work out of hand.</p><p>Lubin said, \"So, five years from now we're going to see nothing but Bitcoin 1.0?\"</p><p>\"Five years from now, most of the projects in this space will be nothing,\" Song said.</p><p>\"If we can come up with some crisp criteria, I will bet you any amount of bitcoin that you're wrong,\" Lubin said.</p><p>The room buzzed. They agreed to set the terms on Twitter.</p><p>The larger world has tended to see crypto as an asset class and, therefore, in terms defined by arrows pointing up or down, as numbers displayed either in red or in green. The fact that prices have sunk so far, from the great hype cycle of 2017, leads some to conclude that its relevance is past, its demise nigh. As a method of payment, it remains flawed, owing to sparse adoption and price volatility-it's hard to open your crypto wallet when what you spend today on a six-pack might be enough next year to buy the brewery. Conversely, as a store of value, it has proved more fickle than the price of gold or real estate in Peru. As for its utility as a vehicle for systemic and societal renewal, it depends on whether society takes it up.</p><p>\"It took crypto seven years to get to one per cent of the global financial-services market,\" Peter Smith, the Blockchain C.E.O., said. \"Maybe at the end of my career we'll be at six per cent.\"</p><p>David Chaum, a computer scientist in California who decades ago laid a lot of the groundwork for cryptocurrency but then failed to participate in (or capitalize on) its recent rise, told me, \"There's never been, in the history of civilization, this much money aggregated as a result of doing nothing.\"</p><p>One night this month, Lubin, just back from travels to Paris, Hamburg, Singapore, Dublin, and Bermuda, was sitting up in bed in his Williamsburg apartment. \"There have been and will be booms and corrections,\" he said. \"I've seen five or six already. Our ecosystem is fifty times larger than it was a year ago. The price surge attracted attention, investment, and talent. The people who signed on, they're hooked: they can't unsee what they've seen.\"</p><p>At one point, at the Ethereal conference, I wandered away from a panel and made my way through the derelict factory complex, past promotional booths and Davos-calibre networking, to an airy brick hall, where Deepak Chopra was addressing a standing-room-only (and sitting-with-proper-posture-on-the-floor) audience. \"We are all conditioned by the mind, by culture, by religion, by history, by economics,\" he was saying. \"This shoe is a human construct, this hand is a human construct, meaning is a human construct. We created money. We created blockchain. These are human constructs.\"</p><p>This seemed inarguable, but perhaps beyond the purview of a crypto conference. Word around the site was that Buterin had boycotted Ethereal because of Chopra-that this was one cultic indulgence too many for the community's mathematicians and computer scientists. (\"It wasn't a kind of decision to deliberately boycott it,\" Buterin said later. \"I already had plans to be in San Francisco for one quiet week, and sometimes I have to reject stuff. Obviously, I think Deepak Chopra's crazy.\")</p><p>At a picnic table by a taco truck, I met a couple of crypto traders from Singapore. They weren't much interested in changing the world-or in trackable tuna or in an audience with Deepak Chopra. They were in the game to make money. They told wallet-scam tales and talked about Ethereum purely in currency-trading terms. \"Conferences are different here,\" one said. \"In Asia, they're for business. Here they're for marketing.\"</p><p>As of last week, Lubin and Song hadn't set the terms of their bet. For the most part, the big talk was the point. Whoever won, a few years hence, would receive the additional prize of the other being soon forgotten.\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWYRK-0028792X_1018_26</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWYRK2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TJ9-WGT1-JCDF-K008-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">237442</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"11024\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Conde Nast Publications, Inc.

In this entertaining and well-researched book, Isaac maps out Uber's story, from the highs (rapid growth; Beyonc\u00e9 performing at a staff party) to the lowest lows: allegations of sexual harassment at the company, Kalanick's power tussle with investors, dodgy dealings. This is above all a corporate warning: how a company worth billions can nearly implode due to poor decisions, bad behaviour and greed.</p><p>                   More of the best business books                   </p><p>It has been a year of polemics against big tech, beginning with Shoshana Zuboff's </p><p>                   The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power                   </p><p> (Profile \u00a310.99). Although heavy-going, it provides a vital analysis of the digital economy and our place in it. Zuboff, a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, rejects that overused maxim about internet companies - \"If you're not paying for it, you're the product\"- in favour of a more stinging verdict: the behavioural data we unthinkingly hand over is the raw material these firms package up and sell. So what does that make us? We are like elephants killed for their tusks, Zuboff argues: \"You are not the product. You are the abandoned carcass.\"</p><p>An easier read in a similar vein is </p><p>                   Don't Be Evil: The Case Against Big Tech                   </p><p> (Allen Lane \u00a320) by Rana Foroohar, a Financial Times journalist.

Perhaps most interesting are Simons's political links: he was the largest donor to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, while his former co-CEO at Renaissance Technologies, Robert Mercer, was the biggest contributor to Donald Trump's.</p><p>Too many business autobiographies are vanity projects for the inflated egos of chief executives who pay ghostwriters handsomely to translate their corporate spiel into \"man of destiny\" tales. </p><p>                   The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons in Creative Leadership                   </p><p> (Bantam Press \u00a320) by Robert Iger, CEO of the Walt Disney Company, is rather better.

Although this fervent anti-business rhetoric sounds similar to the 2020 Democratic primary, but it was actually Franklin Roosevelt in 1936 accepting the party's presidential nomination.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[2]. A Democratic presidential candidate pledged to seize power[3] back from the \"economic royalists,\" arguing that financial and business interests had amassed too much influence within the government to the clear detriment of the middle class. \"What they really complain of is that we seek to take away their power,\" the candidate said. \"Our allegiance to American institutions requires the overthrow of this kind of power.\" This fervent anti-business rhetoric echoes what's been heard in the 2020 Democratic primary. But the comments were actually made by President Franklin Roosevelt in July 1936, when he accepted the Democratic presidential nomination. Still, the language wouldn't be out of place in today's heated political environment. The super-rich and Wall Street have become useful fodder for Democratic candidates seeking to establish their progressive credentials and contrast themselves with rivals in a large primary field. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are driving the shift, harnessing lingering anger among the public towards financial institutions and the wealthy a decade after the 2008 financial crisis. \"It's not that surprising that billionaires have become a target in 2020,\" Rebecca Katz, a progressive political strategist, told Business Insider. \"If anything, it's surprising they've escaped scrutiny for this long \u2014 with income going to the top one percent and wages stagnating[4] for working people.\" The animosity on the campaign trail is reaching levels not seen since the aftermath of the Great Depression.A poll released earlier this month from the nonpartisan group Americans for Financial Reform found[5] that there was overwhelming support among Democrats, Republicans and independents \u2014 80%, 65%, and 72%, respectively \u2014 for more muscular government regulation of Wall Street. Both Warren and Sanders have spurned attending lavish fundraisers in favor of generating excitement and drawing individual contributions to cement their candidacy's image as a movement energized by the middle and working class. Warren has also rolled out a plan to impose a 2% tax on households with a net worth above $50 million and three percent on net worth above $1 billion. And Sanders put forward an even more aggressive plan[6] that would cut some billionaires' wealth in half over 15 years. The mounting willingness to tackle inequality comes after several decades of wealth becoming increasingly concentrated near the top of American society. Research from economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman found that the richest 400 families controlled more wealth than the bottom 60% of wealth distribution \u2014 or 150 million adults in the US. They've also recently said those same households are paying a lower tax rate[7] than the working class. \"The time is ripe for a Democratic candidate to take on corporate America, Wall Street and Big Tech,\" former Labor Secretary Robert Reich told Business Insider. \"It's not just Democrats who are suspicious and distrustful, its also working class Republicans and many independents.\"\"No one is supporting billionaires\"In the last Democratic primary debate, even moderates declined to defend the wealthy \u2014 and former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar took turns whacking the super-rich. \"No one on this stage wants to protect billionaires,\" Klobuchar said. \"Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires,\" she said, referring to Tom Steyer, a wealthy candidate who hasn't shied away from tearing into the rich either. Biden echoed that. \"No one is supporting billionaires,\" he said. Sanders and Warren, though, have emerged as the progressive favorites and both are competing for the same ideological lane of voters eager to drastically remake American capitalism.\"Warren and Sanders are very well positioned to take that animosity toward Wall Street and Big Tech and use it against them the same way Roosevelt used the animosity towards CEOs in the '30s against them.\" Sanders in particular has invoked Roosevelt to defend his vision of democratic socialism and the \"economic rights\" he believes it is capable of delivering for the American public. Back in June, Sanders said in a speech[8] that \"we must take up the unfinished business of the New Deal and carry it to completion.\"Lessons from 1936Roosevelt campaigned in 1936 on protecting the New Deal, a sweeping set of reforms that stabilized the nation's banking system, put stricter regulations on Wall Street, launched colossal infrastructure projects and raised wages after the 1929 financial crash. That invited the fury from Republicans who charged him of gross overreach and subverting the Constitution. Though Republican candidate Alfred Landon agreed with elements of the New Deal, he criticized it[9] as being overly hostile to business. But Roosevelt was unswayed and reveled in the barrage of attacks. \"FDR loved a good fight,\" Reich said. Instead, he argued that \"his New Deal protected the average American against the predations of the rich and powerful,\" wrote[10] University of North Carolina history professor emeritus William Leuchtenberg for the Miller Center, a nonpartisan affiliate for presidential scholarship at the University of Virginia. The American Liberty League \u2014 a political organization mostly funded by wealthy business elites \u2014 marshaled the opposition against the 32nd president. Roosevelt famously said of his well-funded political rivals at the time: \"They are unanimous in their hate for me \u2014 and I welcome their hatred.\"Reich characterized Roosevelt's approach as \"jiu-jitsu.\" \"Where FDR was particularly smart was to take advantage of the business opposition to him,\" Reich said. \"He used it to make the point they were united against him because he was trying to effectively regulate capitalism.\" Roosevelt won the 1936 election by huge majorities in both the popular vote and the electoral college, powered by a new coalition of voters made up of small farmers, labor union members, Catholics, as well as urban black voters. Still, the corporate opposition Roosevelt confronted is reminiscent of the attacks both Sanders and Warren have drawn from some in corporate America \u2014 and how they've similarly tried using it to cement their image as fighters for middle and working class Americans. Sanders has repeatedly pointed to remarks from former Golden Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein saying his candidacy \"has the potential to be a dangerous moment.\" And the Sanders campaign website features a list[11] of \"anti-endorsements\" from \"the modern oligarchs who oppose our movement.\" Warren has also drawn significant fire from corporate leaders. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, said in leaked audio earlier this month[12] the company would \"go to the mat\" to prevent the social media giant from being broken up \u2014 which Warren proposed to better regulate[13] technology companies. Her campaign put the audio in an ad[14] highlighting attacks from the business community. Reich said both Sanders and Warren have an opportunity to run similar campaigns in mold of Roosevelt over eight decades ago. \"When CEO's on Wall Street today say they're afraid of either Warren or Sanders.. all of this is potential fodder for a presidential campaign like FDR's in 1936,\" Reich said. Whether that strategy would pay off against a volatile opponent like President Donald Trump and the Republican campaign apparatus remains to be seen.Read more:Billionaires from George Soros to Abigail Disney are begging to be taxed more[15] 2020 Democratic candidates keep promising to help American workers.

But the comments were actually made by President Franklin Roosevelt in July 1936, when he accepted the Democratic presidential nomination.</p><p>Still, the language wouldn't be out of place in today's heated political environment.</p><p>The super-rich and Wall Street have become useful fodder for Democratic candidates seeking to establish their progressive credentials and contrast themselves with rivals in a large primary field. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are driving the shift, harnessing lingering anger among the public towards financial institutions and the wealthy a decade after the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p>\"It's not that surprising that billionaires have become a target in 2020,\" Rebecca Katz, a progressive political strategist, told Business Insider. \"If anything, it's surprising they've escaped scrutiny for this long - with income going to the top one percent and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-wage-growth-is-slow-2018-9?utm_source=digitalarchivedistribution&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">wages stagnating</url> for working people.\"</p><p>The animosity on the campaign trail is reaching levels not seen since the aftermath of the Great Depression.</p><p>Chirag Wakaskar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images</p><p>A poll released earlier this month from the nonpartisan group Americans for Financial Reform <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/7/20898512/poll-democratic-republican-wall-street-regulation\">found</url> that there was overwhelming support among Democrats, Republicans and independents - 80%, 65%, and 72%, respectively - for more muscular government regulation of Wall Street.</p><p>Both Warren and Sanders have spurned attending lavish fundraisers in favor of generating excitement and drawing individual contributions to cement their candidacy's image as a movement energized by the middle and working class.</p><p>Warren has also rolled out a plan to impose a 2% tax on households with a net worth above $50 million and three percent on net worth above $1 billion. And Sanders <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-wealth-tax-plan-ultra-rich-2019-9?utm_source=digitalarchivedistribution&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">put forward an even more aggressive plan</url> that would cut some billionaires' wealth in half over 15 years.</p><p>The mounting willingness to tackle inequality comes after several decades of wealth becoming increasingly concentrated near the top of American society. Research from economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman found that the richest 400 families controlled more wealth than the bottom 60% of wealth distribution - or 150 million adults in the US. They've also recently said those same households <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/american-billionaires-paid-less-taxes-than-working-class-wealth-gap-2019-10?utm_source=digitalarchivedistribution&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">are paying a lower tax rate</url> than the working class.</p><p>\"The time is ripe for a Democratic candidate to take on corporate America, Wall Street and Big Tech,\" former Labor Secretary Robert Reich told Business Insider. \"It's not just Democrats who are suspicious and distrustful, its also working class Republicans and many independents.\"</p><h>\"No one is supporting billionaires\"</h><p>In the last Democratic primary debate, even moderates declined to defend the wealthy - and former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar took turns whacking the super-rich.</p><p>\"No one on this stage wants to protect billionaires,\" Klobuchar said. \"Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires,\" she said, referring to Tom Steyer, a wealthy candidate who hasn't shied away from tearing into the rich either.</p><p>Biden echoed that. \"No one is supporting billionaires,\" he said.</p><p>Sanders and Warren, though, have emerged as the progressive favorites and both are competing for the same ideological lane of voters eager to drastically remake American capitalism and curb the political power of corporate America.</p><p>REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton</p><p>\"Warren and Sanders are very well positioned to take that animosity toward Wall Street and Big Tech and use it against them the same way Roosevelt used the animosity towards CEOs in the '30s against them,\" Reich said.</p><p>Sanders in particular has invoked Roosevelt to defend his vision of democratic socialism and the \"economic rights\" he believes it is capable of delivering for the American public. Back in June, Sanders <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/us/politics/bernie-sanders-socialism.html\">said in a speech</url> that \"we must take up the unfinished business of the New Deal and carry it to completion.\"</p><h>Lessons from 1936</h><p>Roosevelt campaigned in 1936 on protecting the New Deal, a sweeping set of reforms that stabilized the nation's banking system, put stricter regulations on Wall Street, launched colossal infrastructure projects and raised wages after the 1929 financial crash.</p><p>That invited the fury from Republicans who charged him of gross overreach and subverting the Constitution. Though Republican candidate Alfred Landon agreed with elements of the New Deal, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www2.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/landon-alfred.cfm\">he criticized it</url> as being overly hostile to business.</p><p>But Roosevelt was unswayed and reveled in the barrage of attacks. \"FDR loved a good fight,\" Reich said.</p><p>Instead, he defended his New Deal as a barrier guarding \"the average American against the predations of the rich and powerful,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://millercenter.org/president/fdroosevelt/campaigns-and-elections\">wrote</url>University of North Carolina history professor emeritus William Leuchtenberg for the Miller Center, a nonpartisan affiliate for presidential scholarship at the University of Virginia.</p><p>The American Liberty League - a political organization mostly funded by wealthy business elites - marshaled the opposition against the 32nd president. Roosevelt famously said of his well-funded political rivals at the time: \"They are unanimous in their hate for me - and I welcome their hatred.\"</p><p>PhotoQuest/GettyImages</p><p>Reich characterized Roosevelt's approach as \"jiu-jitsu.\"</p><p>\"Where FDR was particularly smart was to take advantage of the business opposition to him,\" Reich said. \"He used it to make the point they were united against him because he was trying to effectively regulate capitalism.\"</p><p>Roosevelt won the 1936 election by huge majorities in both the popular vote and the electoral college, powered by a new coalition of voters made up of small farmers, labor union members, Catholics, as well as urban black voters.</p><p>Still, the corporate opposition Roosevelt confronted is reminiscent of the attacks both Sanders and Warren have drawn from some in corporate America - and how they've similarly tried using it to cement their image as fighters for middle and working class Americans.</p><p>Sanders has repeatedly pointed to remarks from former Golden Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein saying his candidacy \"has the potential to be a dangerous moment.\" And the Sanders campaign website <url normalizedValue=\"https://berniesanders.com/anti-endorsements/\">features a list</url> of \"anti-endorsements\" from \"the modern oligarchs who oppose our movement.\"</p><p>Warren has also drawn significant fire from corporate leaders. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, said in leaked audio <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-warren-mark-zuckerberg-breaking-up-facebook-2019-10?utm_source=digitalarchivedistribution&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">earlier this month</url> the company would \"go to the mat\" to prevent the social media giant from being broken up - which Warren       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-warren-tech-regulation-roll-back-facebook-whatsapp-instagram-2019-3?utm_source=digitalarchivedistribution&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">proposed to better regulate</url> technology companies.

A bipartisan consensus has formed around this idea. Senator Elizabeth Warren has charged tech giants with using their heft to \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/files/documents/2016-6-29_Warren_Antitrust_Speech.pdf\">snuff out competition</url>,\u201d and even Senator Ted Cruz \u2014 usually a foe of government regulation \u2014 recently warned of their \u201c      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/files/documents/2016-6-29_Warren_Antitrust_Speech.pdf\">unprecedented</url>\u201d size and power. While the potential tools for redressing the harms vary, a growing chorus is calling for the use of antitrust law.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the decision in a case currently before the Supreme Court could block off that path, by effectively shielding big tech platforms from serious antitrust scrutiny. On Monday the Court heard Ohio v. American Express, a case centering on a technical but critical question about how to analyze harmful conduct by firms that serve multiple groups of users. Though the case concerns the credit card industry, it could have sweeping ramifications for the way in which antitrust law gets applied generally, especially with regards to the tech giants.</p><p>The case was first brought by the Justice Department against American Express, Visa, and Mastercard for imposing anticompetitive restrictions on merchants. The credit card industry is a classic case of oligopoly. Despite involving millions of merchants and hundreds of millions of cardholders, the credit card business is controlled by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/files/documents/2016-6-29_Warren_Antitrust_Speech.pdf\">four firms.</url> Merchants who need payment networks lack any real bargaining power and have been stuck paying high rates to the oligopoly \u2014 steeper costs that ultimately get passed on to consumers.</p><p>As one might expect, the credit card companies use their power to block competition. American Express did this by imposing conditions on retailers that accept Amex cards. Retailers were told they could not ask their own customers to use, say, a Discover card, over an American Express card, even if Discover would be a cheaper option. Discover could provide a merchant like The Home Depot better terms than American Express \u2014 but, because of American Express\u2019s restrictions, The Home Depot had no way of reflecting Discover\u2019s lower rates to cardholders, thereby keeping Discover\u2019s competitive advantage from translating into greater market share. This meant card networks had no reason to compete when serving merchants, keeping prices high.</p><p>The district court ruled that American Express\u2019s \u201canti-steering\u201d provisions stifled price competition and violated the antitrust laws (Mastercard and Visa settled with the government before trial). But when American Express appealed, the Second Circuit reversed, relying on a new concept to create a special set of rules. The concept is that players in \u201ctwo-sided\u201d markets are unique because they serve different sets of customers in distinct but related markets, effectively facilitating transactions. American Express, for example, charges both merchants who accept its cards and consumers who use them. Using this concept, the Second Circuit held that the government would have to show that any price increases for merchants also harmed cardholders, or at least didn\u2019t benefit them. In effect, the court introduced a dramatically new rule, making it much more difficult to win important antitrust cases and to stop anticompetitive behavior.</p><p>The case is now at the Supreme Court. If affirmed, the Second Circuit decision would create de facto antitrust immunity for the most powerful companies in the economy. Since internet technologies have enabled the growth of platform companies that serve multiple groups of users, firms like Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Uber are set to be prime beneficiaries of the Second Circuit\u2019s warped analysis. Amazon, for example, could claim status as a two-sided platform because it connects buyers and sellers of goods; Google because it facilitates a market between advertisers and search users. (An industry trade group representing the tech platforms filed an amicus brief in support of American Express.) Indeed, the reason that the tech giants are lining up behind the Second Circuit\u2019s approach is that \u2014 if ratified \u2014 it would make it vastly more difficult to use antitrust laws against them.</p><p>The fact that the tech platforms could effectively be shielded from antitrust is troubling because, in several respects, these firms enjoy dominant market positions that makes antitrust scrutiny of their conduct especially important. By virtue of providing increasingly critical services, tech giants wield immense leverage over the sellers and buyers that rely on their platforms. This power is ripe for abuse. If the Supreme Court ratifies the Second Circuit\u2019s approach, platforms will be able to engage in anticompetitive activity with one set of users, so long as they can plausibly claim that harmful conduct enabled them to benefit another group. Say, for example, that Uber prohibited its drivers from also serving rivals like Lyft, suppressing driver income. Under the current approach, these exclusive agreements would likely violate antitrust law. But under the Second Circuit\u2019s analysis, the case would go nowhere unless plaintiffs could show that this practice also harmed riders.</p><p>This danger is compounded by the slipperiness of the concept underlying this analysis: the idea of a \u201ctwo-sided\u201d market. While reports paid for by the credit card industry introduce \u201ctwo-sided\u201d markets as a novel concept that requires special analysis, markets serving different groups of users have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/files/documents/2016-6-29_Warren_Antitrust_Speech.pdf\">been around for centuries</url>. They include, for example, grain futures exchanges (connecting farmers and buyers of farm products), banking (linking depositors and borrowers) and newspapers (serving advertisers and readers). For decades, courts have recognized that anticompetitive conduct imposed by a newspaper on readers, for example, is no less illegal if it can be shown to benefit advertisers.</p><p>Indeed, almost all markets can be understood as having two sides. Firms ranging from airlines to meatpackers could reasonably argue that they meet the definition of \u201ctwo-sided,\u201d thereby securing less stringent review.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/files/documents/2016-6-29_Warren_Antitrust_Speech.pdf\">Oral argument</url> on Monday gave little new insight into how the vote breakdown might fall. Justice Neil Gorsuch pushed an aggressively pro-monopoly line of questions, while Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan were       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/files/documents/2016-6-29_Warren_Antitrust_Speech.pdf\">skeptical</url> of arguments offered by American Express. While Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. spoke little, his views may prove decisive. He has criticized unwieldy antitrust standards in the past \u2014 a problem that would get much worse if the court rules for American Express.</p><p>Unless the Supreme Court rejects the Second Circuit\u2019s approach, it will risk immunizing dominant platforms from effective antitrust review, at the very moment when they most need it.</p><p>Lina M.

They see us as profitable, captive data generators while their PR departments act like they did something virtuous for the greater good. Like Zoom.</p><p>For reasons us privacy nerds can t comprehend, many people rushed to adopt and use Zoom for in-home teleconferencing once all the sheltering-in-place started. Zoom happens to be a privacy nightmare with a terrible security track record   so bad that in late 2019, EPIC (Electronic Privacy Information Center) made an official complaint to the FTC alleging  unfair and deceptive practices.  According to EPIC,  Zoom intentionally designed its web conferencing service to bypass browser security settings and remotely enable a user s web camera without the knowledge or consent of the user. </p><p>That s not all: Zoom collects  your physical address, phone number, your job title, credit and debit card information, your Facebook account, your IP address, your OS and device details, and more    and traffics that data with whomever it s doing business with (it s unclear where or how Zoom sntaches that info, except to say it s  when you use or otherwise interact with our Products ).</p><p>If only sleazy data dealers used their talents for good, right?</p><p>Look: former privacy pitchers, I get why you re now catching for Big Brother. This is an emergency. But looking at what s working (or not) in other countries, we will fail at containment unless we make sure pandemic response tracing tools don t blur into the fulfillment of ICE and police wishlists.</p><p>There are serious epidemiologists talking about actual efforts to leverage tech for contact tracing but techbros solutionizing about location tracking need to stop. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/QuDZyz8FNs\">https://t.co/QuDZyz8FNs</url></p><p>  Blake You re on Mute (@blakereid) March 24, 2020</p><p>If you re sitting at home (you better be) arguing this is a matter of privacy versus safety, you ve just shown us that privacy and surveillance abuses are merely abstract concepts for you.

We have failed to contain coronavirus, to stop its spread, and to prepare for the worst. Those failures have nothing to do with a lack of invasive surveillance, and cannot be cured by finally closing the information-sharing loop between Big Tech and Stephen Miller.</p><p>Elizabeth M. Renieris, a Fellow at Harvard s Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society explained in When privacy meets pandemic how it s critical that core international human rights principles on privacy are baked into coronavirus-related tech.</p><p> What happens if we trace people with no ability to help them,  Renieris wrote.  What if it just doesn t work in some contexts? We especially have to ask these questions where some experimental methods of contact tracing are being entrusted to large for-profit tech companies.  Ms. Renieris adds:</p><p>While no one seriously questions the need for interventions that can protect public health and safety, the framing of many privacy-related concerns skips a fundamental step in the analysis   namely, asking when an interference with fundamental rights is justified.</p><p>This analysis is grounded in core principles of international human rights law   not something particularly within Facebook or Google s expertise.

These normally privacy-forward sources are saying this in response to the pandemic, obviously. But it's also because companies that track, target, identify and surveil individuals are pitching[3] their technologies to ID and trace the infected \u2014 in shady backroom discussions[4] with the White House.The pandemic has us all in vulnerable positions, and some tech companies are just ethics-free enough to step in and take advantage of entire populations being held hostage by COVID-19. They see us as profitable, captive data generators while their PR departments act like they did something virtuous for the greater good. Like Zoom.For reasons us privacy nerds can't comprehend, many people rushed to adopt and use Zoom for in-home teleconferencing once all the sheltering-in-place started. Zoom happens to be a privacy nightmare with a terrible security track record \u2014 so bad that in late 2019, EPIC (Electronic Privacy Information Center) made an official complaint to the FTC[5] alleging \"unfair and deceptive practices.\" </p><p>According to EPIC, \"Zoom intentionally designed its web conferencing service to bypass browser security settings and remotely enable a user's web camera without the knowledge or consent of the user.\"That's not all: Zoom collects[6] \"your physical address, phone number, your job title, credit and debit card information, your Facebook account, your IP address, your OS and device details, and more\" ... and traffics that data with whomever it's doing business with[7] (it's unclear where or how Zoom sntaches that info, except to say[8] it's \"when you use or otherwise interact with our Products\").If only sleazy data dealers used their talents for good, right?Look: former privacy pitchers, I get why you're now catching for Big Brother. This is an emergency. But looking at what's working (or not) in other countries, we will fail at containment unless we make sure pandemic response tracing tools don't blur into the fulfillment of ICE and police wishlists.There are serious epidemiologists talking about actual efforts to leverage tech for contact tracing but techbros solutionizing about location tracking need to stop. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/QuDZyz8FNs\">https://t.co/QuDZyz8FNs</url>[9] \u2014 Blake You're on Mute (@blakereid) March 24, 2020[10] If you're sitting at home (you better be) arguing this is a matter of privacy versus safety, you've just shown us that privacy and surveillance abuses are merely abstract concepts for you. This is not a black or white issue; staying at home is, washing your hands is, and behaving like you're infected for the safety of others is. We have failed to contain coronavirus[11], to stop its spread, and to prepare for the worst. Those failures have nothing to do with a lack of invasive surveillance, and cannot be cured by finally closing the information-sharing loop between Big Tech and Stephen Miller.Elizabeth M. Renieris, a Fellow at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society explained in When privacy meets pandemic[12] how it's critical that core international human rights principles on privacy are baked into coronavirus-related tech.\"What happens if we trace people with no ability to help them,\" Renieris wrote[13]. \"What if it just doesn't work in some contexts? We especially have to ask these questions where some experimental methods of contact tracing are being entrusted to large for-profit tech companies.\" Ms. Renieris adds:While no one seriously questions the need for interventions that can protect public health and safety, the framing of many privacy-related concerns skips a fundamental step in the analysis \u2014 namely, asking when an interference with fundamental rights is justified.This analysis is grounded in core principles of international human rights law \u2014 not something particularly within Facebook or Google's expertise. If the privacy community skips this critical step, we have already lost the battle to protect our fundamental rights.Do it wrong and people avoid getting tested, you wind up with unknown infected populations, and you create a marriage of surveillance and policing that cannot be walked back \u2014 you fail to contain the virus and democracy is DOA. Do it right and you have an informed and voluntary population, policing is separate from public health and medicine, there are safeguards in place to prevent inevitable abuses, and you stem the tide of infections. Pandemic surveillance: Privacy's tipping point Yes, other governments around the world are using surveillance tools[14] to stem COVID-19's spread. The main countries using technology to track and throttle the spread of the virus are China, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan.As you may know, China and Israel have gone full draconian. Israel has decided to leverage novel coronavirus in order to \"lean in\" on that whole police state thing. \"Last week the Israeli government issued emergency orders granting the Shin Bet security service the authority to track its citizens,\" reported[15] Haaertz, \"allowing digital monitoring of coronavirus patients' cellphones, using means that were not disclosed.\"The country's security service is[16] \"using the technology at its disposal to track the routes that patients have taken outside their homes and to determine whom they have gotten close to ... [and] tracking details of all calls made by coronavirus patients.\" But at least Israel is supposed to have an expiration date on keeping citizen data[17]. Unlike China.After unsuccessfully concealing the severity of its COVID-19 outbreak for two months, China rolled out the advanced tracking tech it used to round up more than a million Uyghur Muslims[18] (now in concentration camps[19]) and uses that tech to enforce an isolation policy. It includes phone tracking, facial recognition, and requiring hundreds of millions of citizens in lockdown to download an app[20]. The app places people into three stoplight categories (green is free to move about; red is 14-day quarantine).China, of course, said this was successful in stopping the pandemic, which has since resurfaced in the country[21], challenging that claim.This shows the location data of phones that were on a Florida beach during Spring Break. It then shows where those phones traveled.First thing you should note is the importance of social distancing. The second is how much data your phone gives off. pic.twitter.com/iokUX3qjeB[22] \u2014 Mikael Thalen (@MikaelThalen) March 26, 2020[23] The countries with the best balance of privacy and virus tracing are containing it, namely South Korea and Taiwan.

But it's also because companies that track, target, identify and surveil individuals are pitching their technologies to ID and trace the infected - in shady backroom discussions with the White House.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The pandemic has us all in vulnerable positions, and some tech companies are just ethics-free enough to step in and take advantage of entire populations being held hostage by COVID-19. They see us as profitable, captive data generators while their PR departments act like they did something virtuous for the greater good. Like Zoom.</p><p>For reasons us privacy nerds can't comprehend, many people rushed to adopt and use Zoom for in-home teleconferencing once all the sheltering-in-place started. Zoom happens to be a privacy nightmare with a terrible security track record - so bad that in late 2019, EPIC (Electronic Privacy Information Center) made an official complaint to the FTC alleging \"unfair and deceptive practices.\" According to EPIC, \"Zoom intentionally designed its web conferencing service to bypass browser security settings and remotely enable a user's web camera without the knowledge or consent of the user.\"</p><p>That's not all: Zoom collects \"your physical address, phone number, your job title, credit and debit card information, your Facebook account, your IP address, your OS and device details, and more\" ... and traffics that data with whomever it's doing business with (it's unclear where or how Zoom sntaches that info, except to say it's \"when you use or otherwise interact with our Products\").</p><p>If only sleazy data dealers used their talents for good, right?</p><p>Look: former privacy pitchers, I get why you're now catching for Big Brother. This is an emergency. But looking at what's working (or not) in other countries, we will fail at containment unless we make sure pandemic response tracing tools don't blur into the fulfillment of ICE and police wishlists.</p><p>If you're sitting at home (you better be) arguing this is a matter of privacy versus safety, you've just shown us that privacy and surveillance abuses are merely abstract concepts for you. This is not a black or white issue; staying at home is, washing your hands is, and behaving like you're infected for the safety of others is. We have failed to contain coronavirus, to stop its spread, and to prepare for the worst. Those failures have nothing to do with a lack of invasive surveillance, and cannot be cured by finally closing the information-sharing loop between Big Tech and Stephen Miller.</p><p>Elizabeth M. Renieris, a Fellow at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society explained in When privacy meets pandemic how it's critical that core international human rights principles on privacy are baked into coronavirus-related tech.</p><p>\"What happens if we trace people with no ability to help them,\" Renieris wrote. \"What if it just doesn't work in some contexts? We especially have to ask these questions where some experimental methods of contact tracing are being entrusted to large for-profit tech companies.\" Ms. Renieris adds:</p><p>While no one seriously questions the need for interventions that can protect public health and safety, the framing of many privacy-related concerns skips a fundamental step in the analysis - namely, asking when an interference with fundamental rights is justified.</p><p>This analysis is grounded in core principles of international human rights law - not something particularly within Facebook or Google's expertise. If the privacy community skips this critical step, we have already lost the battle to protect our fundamental rights.</p><p>Do it wrong and people avoid getting tested, you wind up with unknown infected populations, and you create a marriage of surveillance and policing that cannot be walked back - you fail to contain the virus and democracy is DOA. Do it right and you have an informed and voluntary population, policing is separate from public health and medicine, there are safeguards in place to prevent inevitable abuses, and you stem the tide of infections.</p><p>Pandemic surveillance: Privacy's tipping point</p><p>Yes, other governments around the world are using surveillance tools to stem COVID-19's spread. The main countries using technology to track and throttle the spread of the virus are China, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan.</p><p>As you may know, China and Israel have gone full draconian. Israel has decided to leverage novel coronavirus in order to \"lean in\" on that whole police state thing. \"Last week the Israeli government issued emergency orders granting the Shin Bet security service the authority to track its citizens,\" reported Haaertz, \"allowing digital monitoring of coronavirus patients' cellphones, using means that were not disclosed.\"</p><p>The country's security service is \"using the technology at its disposal to track the routes that patients have taken outside their homes and to determine whom they have gotten close to ... [and] tracking details of all calls made by coronavirus patients.\" But at least Israel is supposed to have an expiration date on keeping citizen data. Unlike China.</p><p>After unsuccessfully concealing the severity of its COVID-19 outbreak for two months, China rolled out the advanced tracking tech it used to round up more than a million Uyghur Muslims (now in concentration camps) and uses that tech to enforce an isolation policy. It includes phone tracking, facial recognition, and requiring hundreds of millions of citizens in lockdown to download an app. The app places people into three stoplight categories (green is free to move about; red is 14-day quarantine).</p><p>China, of course, said this was successful in stopping the pandemic, which has since resurfaced in the country, challenging that claim.</p><p>The countries with the best balance of privacy and virus tracing are containing it, namely South Korea and Taiwan. In fact, most of the countries showing success with coronavirus tracing have unique, current legislation specific to pandemics with provisions on data collection. The laws in Germany, Italy, South Korea, and Taiwan meet the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) standards. These countries are thinking about what will happen in the days after we all survive the novel coronavirus, and acknowledge that it's a terrible idea to unbraid privacy from healthcare.</p><p>In South Korea and Taiwan, two countries who've done well to push back against the virus without the draconian tech-surveillance measures of China and Israel, legislation around data collection includes oversight and transparency for its citizens. \"For example,\" Haaretz wrote regarding South Korea's approach, \"citizens were provided with an explanation of what information was collected, for what purpose and when it would be erased.\"</p><p>That's how South Korea's officials addressed the problem of people avoiding tests over privacy concerns. Jung Eun-kyeong, the director of South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told press, \"We will balance the value of protecting individual human rights and privacy and the value of upholding public interest in preventing mass infections.\"</p><p>Singapore's COVID-19 mortality rate is arguably the lowest - and though the country isn't high in the freedom and democracy index, its success in using tech to fight the virus may be linked to its conditions around data privacy. \"Privacy legislation in Singapore was most recently revised in 2014 and entails that the processing of data about individuals requires their consent,\" press reported. \"Downloading the application was voluntary, it did not monitor people's whereabouts, and the information collected was not provided to the government.\"</p><p>In a way, it's no surprise that entrepreneurs, greedy corporations, and dark-intentioned authorities are seeing COVID-19 as an opportunistic land grab for money, control, and power. It's sickening.</p><p>What is surprising, however, is how some seem to have learned from the mistakes of the greedy. Singapore -- again, no steward of democractic freedoms -- clearly gets that if you treat your people's privacy and data the same way Facebook does (or China, or Zoom for that matter), your problems are going to breed problems like tribbles.</p><p>The notion of repurposing tools that data harvesting companies use to track, snatch, and profit from our personal data without our explicit consent is some pretty ballsy -- or naive, or grossly privileged -- wishful thinking. These data collection tools were not built to save lives in emergencies: they were purpose-built for exploitation and abuse.</p><p>The only way to repurpose them safely and effectively is to treat them like they're radioactive: we must proceed with the certainty that all virus tracking and tracing tech will be abused. To not do so will be catastrophic.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRUDCT-BRUDIR2803202000004</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRUDCT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YHW-7D01-F00C-6470-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">423883</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1518\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 BruDirect All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>BruDirect</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 28, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Keep magnifying and you enter the unimaginably messy realm of the subatomic, a weird place of eldritch geometries and smeared-out, probabilistic motion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The world is smooth and rough, orderly and messy, all at once, depending on how closely you look. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The System</emphasis>, the journalist James Ball - a veteran of both WikiLeaks and the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Guardian</emphasis>'s original Snowden team - peers at the internet at a variety of magnifications, starting with the physical wires and data centres, moving up the stack through the protocols and the governance mechanisms; the businesses and the businesses that enable the businesses; the surveillance operators and the regulators; and, finally, the loyal opposition - the civil society groups that dream about how wonderful it might be even as they live with the daily nightmare of how terrible it's all becoming.</p><p>Ball's storytelling mode is familiar to anyone who enjoys 'narrative non-fiction' - leavening the necessarily technical exposition about how all this stuff works with personal profiles of the people <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">doing</emphasis> the work. He is a sprightly writer and a master explainer who does very well on the technical side, and he's also a canny enough observer of the world that he steers clear of the pitfall of lionising his subjects, making heroic titans of them. Instead, he holds them up as examples, just one out of an army of similarly situated people who could be swapped in. He doesn't want us to think of this as a clash of personal wills and personalities but, rather, as a system (hence the title), where, yes, named human beings take decisions of enormous import to billions, but whose overall freedom of motion is constrained by vast and impersonal forces.</p><p>The internet touches every facet of our lives and every one of the chapters in this book covers an entire specialist degree's worth of ground, so the detail we get is more representative than comprehensive. But Ball has a gift for choosing which details to bring forth - for example, his chapter on advertising technology ('ad-tech') dispenses quickly with the easy arguments about whether or how behavioural advertising is 'killing the news' and moves onto real, meaty, thorny questions that are rarely asked in these discussions. </p><p>If you pay attention to this stuff you probably know about the 'real-time auctions' that take place when you visit a web-page, as the page's publisher sends your personal information to dozens or hundreds of ad-brokers to see who'll pay the most to place an ad on that page. But few people appreciate the fact that when this happens, all the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">losers</emphasis> in that action still come away with new information about you: 'This person reads the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Guardian</emphasis>' (or the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Times</emphasis> or <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Der Spiegel</emphasis>). Thereafter, these ad-brokers can go to their advertisers and say: 'I have a comprehensive list of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Guardian</emphasis>readers and can advertise to them on places that are cheaper to place ads on than the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Guardian</emphasis> itself.' Is it any surprise that ad rates at the major publications are falling?</p><p>As if that wasn't enough of a mind-blower, Ball follows it up with the compelling evidence that this 'behaviour advertising' system is, at best, only slightly better at figuring out how to show you a relevant advert than 'contextual ads' - those based on your IP address, the time of day or the content of the article you're reading. In other words, news sites could stem the tide of falling ad rates by switching from creepy, surveillant behavioural ads to relatively innocuous context ads, arresting their slide into financial oblivion, with only a minor fall in their advertisers' ability to sell their wares.</p><p>This kind of exposition made me like this book, but the broader context it serves made me like it even more. Here I must declare an interest. I know these people. I've picketed some of them at their places of work. I've helped to sue others. I eulogised one of them at his memorial service and have known another since I was a small child. At one point in his journey, Ball visits my workplace. </p><p>Based on that intimate knowledge, I think he does an excellent job here of showing how the system works, where its levers of power are, and how they can be moved. Which is important.</p><p>It's important because <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">you</emphasis> have an interest too. The Covid pandemic has settled forever the argument about whether and when technology is a human right. When everything we do - romance, familial relations, employment, education, politics, civil engagement, medical care and commerce - takes place on the internet, the system matters to you as well.</p><p>In his concluding chapter, Ball draws an apt comparison between the system of technology and the system of finance. Both are cloaked in complex obscurity, some of it deliberately, performatively dull, the kind of technical bafflegab one deploys if one hopes to commit great crimes and make them seem respectable by dismissing one's critics as unqualified to venture an opinion. What's more, finance and tech are largely inseparable, with the same shot-callers running both industries, and responding to the same imperatives.</p><p>Today, we are faced with a crisis of both finance and tech, thanks to the crisis in public health. Every chapter in this book - from the material on surveillance to that on global, networked soft power - has real bearing on the pandemic world. As economies implode, taking down those few remaining smaller firms with ties to places and people, we are experiencing a quiet wave of consolidations, in which the free-floating Big Tech firms (flush with tax-free, offshore cash) 'rescue' these smaller companies and absorb them, barrelling towards a future in which the world can be divided among them like the Great Powers whose peaceful status quo shattered with the Great War.</p><p>As we lurch towards that oligarchic stitch-up and its inevitable conflagration, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The System</emphasis>could not be more timely. Ball clearly loves this technology he writes about, has empathy for its self-styled guardians and would-be revolutionaries, and fears it too. He knows, as well as any of us, how rotten it's become and how much worse it could become. </p><p>Ball's message boils down to this: you can't change technology until you understand it, and you can't understand it merely by knowing what it does. You have to know who it does it <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">for</emphasis>... and who it does it <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">to</emphasis>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPECTR-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPECTR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MP-TBM1-JD3P-Y00P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">245303</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1090\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Spectator Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Spectator</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"48251\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 15, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000454</classCode><className>DEATH NOTICES &amp; OBITUARIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST00097CN</classCode><className>ARMIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001905</classCode><className>JOURNALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000954</classCode><className>INTERNET &amp; WWW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST00097CN</classCode><className>ARMIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>PE000DNAW</classCode><className>ABBY FINKENAUER</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

It's 1:00 p.m. here in Washington. Wherever you're watching from around the world, thanks very much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We start with Republicans hitting the home stretch on their $1.5 trillion tax plan. The deal is mostly set putting the House and Senate bills together.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They've reached agreement on several key points, including lowering the top individual rate to 37 percent from 39.6 percent. Setting the corporate rate now at 21 percent down from 35 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They've also agreed on state and local tax deductions, lowering the estate tax threshold and eliminating the health care individual mandate.</p><p>But one big hurdle still needs to be cleared, the final votes which includes questions about the health of the Arizona senator, John McCain.</p><p>Let's go to our Congressional Correspondent Phil Mattingly. He's closely watching this up on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Phil, we get to the -- we'll get to the votes in a moment. But first, what response are you hearing there today to the deal? What's the reaction?</p><p>PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, mostly, Republicans are still trying to digest things, Wolf. This has been moving at a very, very quick clip.</p><p>And the reality is the full proposal has still not been unveiled. That's not expected until tomorrow.</p><p>Republican leaders, though, feel very good about they -- where they will end up. You mentioned, the state and local tax deduction. They expanded the eligibility for that.</p><p>That should hit a lot of the concerns from Republicans in the House, from states like New Jersey, New York and, most importantly, perhaps, California. So, they feel good about where that is.</p><p>But there's no question about it. The details here matter a tremendous amount. Not just for members of Congress, but for pretty much everybody in the country.</p><p>And until all of the details are out, it's very likely you aren't going to know where things are going to end up.</p><p>I will say though, Wolf, the expectation is, has been and will continue to be, in the days ahead I'm told, that they will move on this.</p><p>On Monday, they expect to have this to the president's desk, as soon as Wednesday.</p><p>The big question now is, what's actually going to be in the 500-plus pages beyond the topline deal points that already you noted -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: All right. I want you to stand by, Phil, because I want to get some more specifics on the proposed deal. We'll get back to you in just a moment.</p><p>Jim Tankersley is with us right now. He's the tax and economics reporter for \"The New York Times.\" Lots of questions, you know, Jim, about where this goes. They've now set it at 21 percent, the corporate tax rate.</p><p>The president originally wanted it at 15. He agreed to 20. Then, there was talk of 22. Now, it's down to 21.</p><p>JIM TANKERSLEY, TAX AND ECONOMICS REPORTER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": Yes, 21 has emerged as an important place here for the Republicans, because they needed money.</p><p>They've had to give revenues from other parts of the bill away to assuage concerns from wavering senators, wavering members in the House.</p><p>And so, 21 just seemed to be that resting point that they came to and the president said he was OK with it.</p><p>BLITZER: What about the individual -- the highest individual rate now -- which is currently 39.6 percent, going down, what, to 37 percent?</p><p>TANKERSLEY: So, this was a little bit of a surprise because neither the Senate nor the House bill came down this far.</p><p>But there were complaints, especially from higher-income people in New York, people the president runs with in his circles, who thought that they weren't getting enough out of this bill. And so, this appears, possibly, to be a response to that.</p><p>Now, it's a 37 percent top rate which would be a tax cut, again, for the highest earners.</p><p>BLITZER: And what's the final decision on very sensitive issues, including education-related deductions, graduate school, tuition waivers, student loan deductions, teacher spending deductions? A lot of folks are really concerned.</p><p>TANKERSLEY: So, we don't know all of those provisions yet, but we know some of them.</p><p>For example, on graduate student tuition waivers, we know that they will not be taxed. That's the Senate version. The House had made that taxable. That was something people were -- graduate students were, in fact, very worried about.</p><p>In most cases so far, what we've seen is, from the details we've learned, the tie goes to the Senate bill. And so, the Senate tends to preserve more of those deductions, for example, medical expense deductions, whereas the House eliminated more of them.</p><p>BLITZER: All right, stand by for a moment.</p><p>I want to go back to Capitol Hill. Phil is up there.</p><p>The Senate vote is really the focus right now. Two senators, they have been missing some votes due to health-related issues. Others are still considered to be on the fence, even though they voted yes the last time.</p><p>Then, there's the vice president Mike Pence, he's now postponing a trip to Israel and Egypt. Where does all this stand?</p><p>MATTINGLY: Yes, Wolf, you have to look at it through the context of the razor-thin majority, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, is actually working with here. Only 52 votes. They're going to need 50, with the vice president being able to cast the tie-breaking vote here.</p><p>So, you look at, kind of, four key senators right now who are still outstanding, Susan Collins, who made very clear that she had some specific ask in the Senate bill, and also has some specific ask related to health care legislation outside the tax bill.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see whether she gets that.</p><p>Senator Jeff Flake, he had some issues on the gradual phase-out of the expensing provision, where that ends up standing.</p><p>Senator Marco Rubio, he's long been considered a solid yes vote on this but he has concerns about the refundability of the child tax credit.</p><p>And then, you have Senator Bob Corker. Wolf, you know well he voted against the initial plan on deficit reasons. Those haven't changed.</p><p>[13:05:05] Those reasons, those deficits that the bill would create haven't changed at any point during these negotiations. He's expected to be a no but still saying he's looking at the proposal.</p><p>I think the key issue right now is the health of the two senators, Thad Cochran and Senator John McCain. Senator Cochran's spokesman, earlier today, told our colleague, Ted Barrett, he fully planned on being back to vote on the tax bill next week.</p><p>He is in Washington right now. So, that's the expectation. The big question, Senator John McCain. He's still at Walter Reed Hospital, recovering from the treatment that he continues to get for his cancer diagnosis.</p><p>There is no ETA, in terms of when he would actually return to the Senate. His office says he's trying to get back as soon as possible.</p><p>But because of that, the idea has always been the Senate would go first. They have tougher rules to deal with. They have more restrictive rules to deal.</p><p>The best, kind of, case scenario would be they push it through the chamber first. That is now an open question, according to Speaker Paul Ryan. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN (R), WISCONSIN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: It's all about timing and managing absences in the Senate. So, we're basically being flexible for the majority leader. I've talked to Mitch a couple times about this. We're simply being flexible to honor their concerns about managing their schedule and some possible absences.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTINGLY: Now, Wolf, I think it's important to note the very tight timeline the Republicans are working on here. Now, this is an artificial one. One they set themselves.</p><p>But given the, kind of, large magnitude of the other year-end items they have to deal with, they expect to deal with by the end of next week. They still plan to move this early next week, when it comes to the tax proposal. That's where those absences or potential absences are coming into play right now.</p><p>We will still have to see how all that shakes out. I will say that, according to both the House and Senate leadership officials and negotiators that I've been talking to, they are confident the votes will be here.</p><p>But as we've seen, as of now, they aren't. There is still work to do -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: And you think the votes will go next, what, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday of next week? First, what, in the House and then in the Senate? Is that what they're planning?</p><p>MATTINGLY: Look, the plan, at least over the course of the last six or seven days, has been for the Senate to go first, starting on Monday. The House to follow, likely on Tuesday. A bill signing at the White House by Wednesday.</p><p>I think the big question that the speaker is referring to and that we're hearing right now is if other senators are absent, if the votes aren't necessarily there, perhaps the House goes first. But that raises some serious issues, based on whether or not the bill actually, kind of, falls into place, related to Senate rules. That's why they always wanted the Senate to go first. I think the preference in both chambers is for the Senate to go first.</p><p>Right now, that's an open question. We'll have to see over the course of the next 24, 48 hours, whether that issue is resolved or solved all together, before we really know, kind of, the exact step-by-step process.</p><p>But I will say, there's no question right now, the White House and leaders on Capitol Hill expect the bill to be at the White House for a signing ceremony likely on Wednesday -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: All right, we'll see if it is.</p><p>Phil Mattingly, thanks very much. And Jim Tankersley, thanks to you as well.</p><p>President Trump may be on the verge of his first legislative win. But he also faces major challenges. First of all, polls show most Americans don't like the tax bill. In our Quinnipiac University poll, just 26 percent approve the plan.</p><p>The president's own approval rating is at historic lows right now. The latest Monmouth University poll is at 32 percent, his job approval numbers.</p><p>So, what does all this mean heading into 2018? Let's talk about that and more with Susan Page, the Washington Bureau Chief for \"USA Today\" and our CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger.</p><p>It's not very popular, if you believe the polls right now, this tax bill, even though the president, the Republicans keep saying to the American people, especially the middle class, you're going to be paying a lot less tax.</p><p>GLORIA BORGER, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST: And if you look deeper into these numbers, the people who have problems with it are Democrats and independent voters.</p><p>And so, what you see from this White House is, really, a base strategy which is appeal to the base. These vote -- our voters want this tax cut. They believe it's going to help them and that's what they're doing.</p><p>But going into 2018, and I harken back to 2010 and Barack Obama, Obamacare, they had the same kind of strategy with their base. Their base wanted the Affordable Care Act. They gave them the Affordable Care Act. And Barack Obama lost 63 seats in the House.</p><p>BLITZER: We all remember that.</p><p>You know, the reason it's not that popular is because a lot of Americans have accepted this notion, this is a tax plan, tax cuts that will benefit the wealthy, benefit the corporations, not necessarily them.</p><p>SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"USA TODAY\": So, here's the gamble the Republicans are making. The tax cut will do what they predict it will do which is improve the economy.</p><p>And the fact is, if you see a surging, a great economy going into the mid-terms, that does a lot to help Republicans even in a tough year.</p><p>But if it doesn't, that's a problem. You know, this is not just an unpopular bill. This is the least popular bill that has been passed by Congress, in terms of a major bill, in the past 30 years.</p><p>You know, it makes Obamacare look popular when it was passed. Obamacare was in -- it was about 10 points higher --</p><p>BORGER: Higher.</p><p>PAGE: -- than the tax cut bill is now.</p><p>[13:10:00] So, this is an enormous risk, on the part of the Republicans.</p><p>BLITZER: Where does the stunning Alabama Senate race loss for Roy Moore, the Republican candidate, where does that fit into all of this?</p><p>BORGERF: Well, I think you can argue it puts the Senate more in play here.</p><p>I mean, look, you know, the Democrats have a -- have an uphill struggle to win control of the Senate. Because they have 10 Democrats who are running for reelection in states that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>won. So, that's a -- so, that's a problem for them.</p><p>But you do see a motivated Democratic base. You do see a 40 percent turnout in the state of Alabama in this election on a random Tuesday. And so, you do see that the Democratic base is much more motivated right now than the Republicans. And you do see this slippage among independent voters.</p><p>So, I think it's all part and parcel of the kind of environment that we are seeing going into 2018.</p><p>BLITZER: Is it likely to have any impact in the short term right now, the loss for the Republicans in Alabama, on what's going to happen with the tax cuts?</p><p>PAGE: I think it makes it more likely it goes through. Because Republicans are looking at the possibility of going into the mid-terms having achieved no major legislative victory. Even though they control the House, the Senate and the White House.</p><p>And that is why, I think, there is no momentum behind passing a bill that has many details we don't even know about. We don't know how the Senate hits the $1.5 trillion deficit number that they have to meet in this bill. There's a -- there are a lot of important details about this bill that have not been explored and analyzed. But it looks like it's going to pass anyway.</p><p>BORGER: And also, don't forget, it's going to take effect very quickly. There are going to be lots of unintended consequences that people are going to suddenly see. And it's -- and that can play out in a way that isn't -- that isn't particularly helpful.</p><p>But I also think that there may be some members who are less afraid of taking on <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>I mean, I know they all think that they got to get to the big goal because they have to get something done.</p><p>But there may be members, like a Flake, or a Corker who's leaving anyway, or a Collins, although she seems to be predisposed to vote for this, who may be saying, you know what? He might not hurt me as much anymore.</p><p>PAGE: But with this divided Republican Party, I think it makes the calculation so complicated --</p><p>BORGER: Yes, it is.</p><p>PAGE: -- for Republicans. Because you've got Steve Bannon out there who's still talking about challenging Republicans in primaries next year. You've got the McConnell faction that is under fire by some and yet has succeeded in a way.</p><p>I mean, it's a sign that the -- that Republicans count it as a victory. That they -- that the Republican candidate was defeated for the Senate.</p><p>BLITZER: Susan, where are all the Congressional Republican deficit hawks on this? Because this tax bill --</p><p>BORGER: Under this paper here.</p><p>BLITZER: -- supposedly is going to increase the national debt by at least $1 trillion, maybe $1.5 trillion, that according to the Congressional Budget Office, the Joint Committee on taxation. These, you know, nonpartisan independent auditors.</p><p>Yet, they're willing to go along with it. It's not paid for, as they say.</p><p>PAGE: You know, it's a sign of how <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has redefined what the Republican Party stands for. This is not the party of fiscal discipline. It's not the party of free trade. It is the party of Trump. And that has meant some fundamental differences on issues like that one.</p><p>BLITZER: Are you surprised by that? That a lot of these deficit hawks, all of a sudden, well, we can go along.</p><p>BORGER: But first of all -- BLITZER: And they come up with these -- this notion that there will be dynamic scoring. The economy will be great. A lot more money will be coming in.</p><p>BORGER: Well, first of all, you see Bob Corker. That's the issue that he's, kind of -- that's he's, kind of, hanging back on.</p><p>By the way, you're cutting taxes in the middle of a booming economy. That is also something Republicans would say, wait a minute. We normally would do this to juice the economy. That's what you normally do.</p><p>And so, it has turned the party on its head. And I think <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has said, you know, I promised to move the embassy in Israel. I promised to cut taxes. I haven't been able to deliver on health care. I want to do what I promised I would do. And they're, kind of -- they promised it, too.</p><p>BLITZER: He's delivering a lot of those promises, deregulation and other related issues. But this is, clearly, going to be a huge vote next week. Let's see if it happens and what happens as a result.</p><p>Gloria, Susan, guys, thanks very, very much.</p><p>We expect, by the way, to hear from the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, later this hour. You're looking at live pictures from the briefing room. Reporters still haven't really started coming in. We'll have live coverage of that briefing. That's coming up later this hour. Stand by for that.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Russian president, <person><nameText>Vladimir Putin, </nameText></person>derives what he calls, quote, \"espionage mania\" when it comes to claims that Moscow tried to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. We'll get a live report from Moscow when we come back.</p><p>[13:14:50]</p><p>[13:19:07] BLITZER: There is breaking news we're following right now.</p><p>We've been watching the Republican-led Federal Communications Commission where the commissioners just voted on the future of how the Internet is going to be regulated. A panel voted along party lines to repeal what's called Net Neutrality. The Obama-era regulations were designed to keep the Internet open and fair. Republicans, though, argue the rules stifle innovation.</p><p>Once again, the FCC voting along party lines, 3-2, to repeal Net Neutrality. A very significant development.</p><p>Our senior tech correspondent Laurie Segall explains how all of this will affect you.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LAURIE SEGALL, CNN SENIOR TECH CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): What is Net Neutrality? It has nothing to do with a volleyball or a tennis court. The \"net\" refers to the Internet, something that's become as necessary as water and power for most of us. The \"neutrality\" part is about keeping the net the way it is today. It's a set of rules that went into effect in 2015 to prevent speed traps on the information superhighway. In other words, speeding up access to some sites and slowing down access to others, or blocking certain cites entirely.</p><p>[13:20:15] So, are these rules a bad thing? It depends on who you ask. The companies that deliver your Internet, like Comcast, Verizon and AT&amp;T have spent millions in lobbying money to get rid of Net Neutrality, arguing that having the government micromanage their business is not good for them or their consumers.</p><p>On the other side are Internet giants like FaceBook and Google, streaming services like Netflix and former President Obama. They all argue the Internet is a public good and should be regulated like one. They also say that companies that own the pipelines could play favorites.</p><p>For example, a content provider like Netflix is in direct competition with Comcast, which owns NBC Universal and controls access to the Internet for over 20 million customers. You can imagine a scenario where NBC would want to speed up streams of its shows and slow down streams of its rival, Netflix.</p><p>Now, Netflix can afford to pay for the fast line. It's worth more than $70 billion. But the next Netflix, some awesome startup, can't.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BLITZER: All right, Laurie's joining us right now.</p><p>Laurie, a very significant development now.</p><p>First of all, will this vote be challenged?</p><p>SEGALL: I can say, I am almost positive that it will. The could definitely be legal fallout here because the stakes are simply so high and you've had so many folks speaking out against this. You know, I've covered technology. You look at the tech company who have been very outspoken about the stakes here. You had the telecom industry in favor of this for a long time. They said that the current regulations, you know, get in the way of daily business. That they're stifling innovation, which you heard a little bit about.</p><p>But you have the tech companies on the other end who say that, you know, this gives Internet providers too much power, too much control over the way online content is delivered. It creates a tiered Internet. So I think you're definitely going to see that challenge.</p><p>And we already heard a lot of controversy, Wolf, ahead of this vote. The FCC actually went out on their website and asked for public opinion. They wanted the public to weigh in. And an investigation showed that you had 20 million comments and millions of those comments were bots and they were fake. So you had Democratic lawmaker calling for them to delay the vote. they didn't delay that vote.</p><p>So I think this is the beginning of, you know, a longer process. But, you know, the stakes are very high. These regulations were put into place in 2015 under the Obama administration to ensure a fair and open Internet. So it depends on whose side you're on and who you're asking. But you can certainly bet that this will just be -- kind of the beginning of what we're hearing about this because today's a big day for all of us as Internet consumers.</p><p>BLITZER: Well, assuming their -- forget about whether or not it's going to be challenged, when will this decision, this vote, this 3-2 vote by the FCC, when does it go into effect, eliminating what's called the Net Neutrality?</p><p>SEGALL: You know, I think we'll have to see to see about the legal challenges, to see, you know, what happens. So I don't think we're going to see anything immediate right now.</p><p>But, you know, Net Neutrality has always been something that has been tough for some folks to understand and people don't know too much about it. But why it's important to talk about it is because it really does impact all of us and how we browse the Internet. You think about right now, under the current rules, or under -- as they were, you know, the way you watch Amazon, Hulu, all of these streaming services, that could change. You know, you could be charged for one. It would allow companies to essentially charge us more money to make our streaming videos faster. And it could, in a sense, as many of the tech companies, create a tiered Internet.</p><p>So I do think, you know, this is a big moment today but we're going to hear a lot more in the coming weeks. Probably, you know, we've already seen protests. I can imagine we'll hear more protests. That it won't be long until we start beginning to hear again from the big tech companies, FaceBook, Google, I'm sure they'll all be weighing in very shortly after today's vote, Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes, we'll be getting a lot of reaction and we'll, of course, have all of that. And we'll see how this impacts the average person out there.</p><p>Laurie, thank you so much.</p><p>Laurie Segall reporting for us on a significant development.</p><p>We may be hearing about this at the White House briefing that's coming up. Sarah Sanders, the press secretary, getting ready to answer reporters' questions. We'll have live coverage of the daily briefing right here on CNN. That starts later this hour.</p><p>Also, the Russian president, <person><nameText>Vladimir Putin, </nameText></person>derives what he calls espionage mania when it comes to claims that Moscow tried to influence the U.S. presidential election. We'll get a live report from Moscow when we come back.</p><p>[13:28:56] BLITZER: The Russian president, <person><nameText>Vladimir Putin, </nameText></person>offering some kind words for his American counterpart, President <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>President Putin spoke about what he calls serious achievements by President Trump. He made the comments during his annual end of the year news conference. Putin also took a shot at the investigation over possible collusion between the Trump team and Russia.

Thanks so much we'll  see you in a little while.  Good morning everybody, thanks for joining us,  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Happy Wednesday, it is Wednesday March 28th.  Your  top stories right now, 6 A.M. on the East Coast.  Technology taking it's  toll, stocks stumble yesterday, weighed down by major technology names.   Facing concerns over new regulatory scrutiny.  The Dow Jones industrial  average was down 344 points, down one and a half percent.  Along the top  loser's yesterday, Facebook, Alphabet and Apple which all turned negative  for the year. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The news coming as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly agrees to  testify before lawmakers on Capital Hill.  Facebook down another 5 percent.   Future this morning, looking like this, we're looking at weakness at the  trading this morning.  Dow industrial set to open down about 50 points.   NASDAQ also down 45 points right now.  Investors are watching for the final  reading of the fourth quarter GDP that is due out at 8:30 A.M. eastern.  We  are expecting growth of two point seven percent.  That is the economist  estimate.   </p><p>For Europe this morning right across the board, take a look at the European  embassy's(ph) FT 100 down two thirds of one percent and the CAC cost(ph)  and the DAX index both down better than 1 percent right now.  In Asia over  night, similar stories, steep declines across the board.  Worse performers  is Hong Kong, HANG SENG index down two and a half percent.  The global sell  off coming amid a possible crack down.  Speculation is mounting that the  White House is considering regulating Chinese investments in technology  companies.  Senator Lindsey Graham waiting on taking that action against  China. </p><p>LINDSEY GRAHAM:  They steal everything you bring to China, they manipulate  the currency, they dump steal in a below value into the world economy and  Trump said during the campaign he was going to push back.  He has.  And if  the French and the Germans were smart, they would join President Trump to  change Chinese business practices.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Then major implications for the sector and the markets coming  up this morning.  The trade deal secured, President Trump making moves,  reaching an agreement with South Korea, his first deal since taking office.   We are breaking down the deal as the commander in chief makes good on yet  another campaign promise.  And new problems to report for Tesla.  The  details as the National Transportation Safety Board investigates another  fatal crash.  The stock down (ph) another two percent this morning.  </p><p>Too slow.  FBI Directory Christopher Wray says he will double the number of  personnel assigned to reviewing the GOP demanding documents in the  investigation of the Clinton e-mail investigation, FBI abuse and the firing  of Andrew McCabe.  We'll tell you what's next after that subpoena got  things moving.  And then talk about a d'oh-nut.  Springfield coming to  Krispy Kreme with Simpsons themed pastries.  </p><p>All that coming up this morning.  And joining me to talk all about it this  (ph) Fox Business hour is Dagen McDowell, Benchmark managing partner Kevin  Kelly and the Wall Street Journal's editorial board member, Fox News  contributor Mary Kissel.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, JOURNALIST, FOX BUSINESS NEWS:  D'oh.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I knew she was going to do that.  That's good.  Thank you.   Thank you so much.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  You didn't do too bad a job  yourself.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  Hey, welcome back from -- from the wedding.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Thank you very much.  I missed you guys, but -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We missed you.  Yes.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, but it worked out.  I got to tear up the dance floor, you  know.  It was -- it was perfect.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How's the missus?  </p><p>KELLY:  She's doing exceptionally well.  She's -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congratulations.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Yes.  It's -- this is -- it's called perseverance, 12 years a  love story in the making.  I mean, it -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  12 years.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  Wow (ph).  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Wow.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Yes, so -- so -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He's really in love.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's patient.  She's a keeper.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Yes, she's great.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot on the table this morning to discuss, you guys.  We got  trade, we got the market sell-off.  Lot of uncertainty over there.  </p><p>MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Yes, lot of  uncertainty and a lot of fake news about this trade deal, too, Maria.  I  hope we're going to get into that.  It's not exactly I think what the White  House is selling.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that right?  </p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll talk about that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then also questions about Facebook going forward, it's  profitability, how much is it worth.  It's really hard to put a number on  it.  If you have users leaving or spending less time on the service and  advertisers turning their back on Facebook, potentially.  Again, that's a  big question mark and it's certainly weighing on the broad market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is -- this is the real first test that we've seen for this  company in terms -- you're right, valuation, but also the sustainability,  if people are worried about user data.  </p><p>KELLY:  They -- they really -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mark -- Mark -- Mark Zuckerberg didn't invent anything.  We kept  playing that sound bite from Steve Jobs.  He didn't invent anything, just  preyed on our desire to be liked.  It's a -- it's an advertising vehicle.   He just did a better job than Classmates and Tripod and Geocities.  I date  myself, but thank god I am close to 50, because I actually remember a lot  of these companies that tried to do what Facebook did.  </p><p>It's at 2 billion users.  How much bigger can it get?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If (ph) those people spend less time on that service, those --  those earnings are going to be a lot lower than people think.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And boy, did investors react yesterday.  That is our top story  right now, the technology sector taking a beating.  A steep sell-off in  tech stocks yesterday pulled U.S. markets sharply lower with the DOW  closing down nearly 400-points.  One day after the indices posted their  best day in more than two years.  Technology stock has come under pressure  amid concerns over increased government scrutiny in the wake of privacy  questions surrounding Facebook.  </p><p>All this coming amid speculation that the Trump administration is  considering a crackdown on Chinese investments in U.S. technologies by  using a law reserved for national emergencies.  Joining us now to weigh in  is director of defense studies at the Center for National Interest and the  executive editor of National Interest Magazine, Harry Kazianis.  Good to  see you, Harry.  Thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p>HARRY KAZIANIS, DIRECTOR OF DEFENSE STUDIES, CENTER FOR NATIONAL INTEREST:   Good morning, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So let's start first with the crackdown on Chinese investments  in technology.  We know that China has participated in 10 percent off  venture deals in the U.S. in the last five years.  Your take on what could  happen in terms of China investing in U.S. companies.  </p><p>KAZIANIS:  Maria, I think there being some sort of restrictions is a very  practical and an important step.  I think if we look at the history of  Chinese actions, really over the last 10 years and things they've done to  the United States, not just economic but geopolitical, there had to be some  restrictions.  You know, being in the defense sector, looking at this from  that perspective, we look at some of the things the Chinese done in terms  of stealing a lot of our defense intellectual property.  </p><p>They've hacked in and stolen our aircraft carrier designs, the V-22 Osprey,  the F-35, which is a trillion dollar defense program.  So when you look at  it from that perspective, there has to be some restrictions.  And then we  talk about the technology of the future, things like 5G, A.I.  If Chinese  companies were to come in and essentially, you know, buy parts of U.S.  companies or get into joint ventures and then take that technology, we're  essentially giving away our economic future to China.  And I think that  would be a big mistake.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, I know that we have CFIUS, Mary, and that really  does regulate the -- whether or not we should see ownership of American  companies.  But at the same time, China has such strict situations with  regard to American investing there.  And we don't have anything like that.  </p><p>KISSEL:  No, I mean look, our tariff barriers are very low compared to  China.  And China also has a lot of barriers that are not set in stone or  formalized, right?  They -- they say well, you know, if you come here and  you really want to get in, you have to give us 51 percent control and we to  have a communist party member on your board in China, things like that.  </p><p>So Harry's absolutely right.  There are a lot of problems here.  Harry, my  question to you is what is strategic?  You know, I understand that we don't  want investment in dual use technologies, defense, certain  telecommunication industries, but where else does this go?  Does it go to  energy companies?  I mean, what's the limit here?  </p><p>KAZIANIS:  I think the thing that I worry about most, Mary, is technologies  of the future.  Like I was saying, 5G could be a revolutionary technology.   I mean, most of us at home are getting -- you know, on our internet speeds,  about 100, 150 megs per second.  That is the speeds of -- of 5G over  cellular networks.  That could be revolutionary in terms of self driving  cars, medical devices.  </p><p>And in terms of, you know, strategy and -- and overall geopolitics and  intelligence, if the Chinese were to gain footholds in those arenas, the  amount of intelligence they could gather would be astronomical.  Now, I  don't want to sound like I'm panicking over, you know, what the Chinese can  do in terms of intelligence capabilities, but I think we have some very  real concerns when you combine that, in terms of all of the geopolitical  things the Chinese have done over 10 years.  </p><p>So I think it's good to be cautious, I think it's something that we have to  do.  But we have to remember, the U.S. China relationship is changing,  really since the fall of the Soviet Union in1991.  This relationship was  begging to be changed.  I mean, one of the reasons why America and China  actually came together in the first place is because of the Soviet Union.  </p><p>When the Soviet Union collapsed, there was always going to be some sort of  inevitable change, but it was always economics that brought us together.   Now it's actually -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just want to (ph) point out, Kevin, one -- one thing that Devin  Nunes told me on Sunday is not only are we dealing with these economic  issues with China, but right now, they're buying up a lot of infrastructure  across the world.  They're investing in these countries and then getting a  sealine position and setting up military bases right there.  This is  another thing that this administration is watching over (ph).  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, especially in Africa, right?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  </p><p>KELLY:  In -- in -- in Djibouti.  And I think one of the -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>KELLY:  -- important things to note is that China is going to get this 5G  technology whether we like it or not, right?  And one of the -- the things  this administration has done is block the Broadcom deal with Qualcomm.  The  issue actually has to do with will we have that infrastructure, that  technology?  Are we going to have access to it in times of national  defense?  And I think that's the biggest -- biggest question.  </p><p>If -- if we don't have access to it and only the Chinese do, if they're  scooping up U.S. companies, that's the biggest issue.  But I think the -- I  think one of the things we're tiptoeing around is North Korea.  I mean,  China is completely enabling North Korea and a lot of their weaponized  attacks across the world, whether it's in South Korea, here.  </p><p>So the only way North Korea survives and thrives is through China.  Now, do  you think that's one of the biggest conflicts of interest that we're having  right now with China and their technology?  Harry?  </p><p>KAZIANI:  I do.  I do.  And I -- and I think the -- the point on North  Korea is so key here.  I mean, no wonder the -- you know -- Kim Jung-un is  going to, you know, meet with Xi Jinping so early, in terms of having  multiple different summits and whatnot.  And I think when we talk about  issues on the Korean Peninsula and how this all comes to play, I think it's  extremely important for the United States to continue making sure that we  apply maximum pressure on both of those countries.  </p><p>Because there's a relationship where essentially North Korea feeds off  China, but China also feeds off North Korea.  And I think as long as we're  ensuring that pressure on both sides is being maintained, I think that's  the smartest way to go.  So I -- I think all of these situations we're  talking about, the recalibrating of the U.S. China relationship, North  Korea, it's all one big pot that we have to worry about.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We always talk about the big picture in terms of the U.S. and  China and China's investment in technologies.  There's a story in the Wall  Street Journal that pinpoints how it does effect mama and daddy, if you  will, in -- in rural parts of America.  </p><p>And a lot of smaller telecomm companies have relied on gear made by Huawei,  the bigger company since 2012 because there was a fear -- there was a  congressional report done -- there was a fear that China would exploit that  technology being in the United States in order to spy or even hack into our  data networks.  </p><p>But smaller telecomm companies have relied on that very gear because it's  cheaper.  And there was an -- the FCC put out a proposal on Monday that  might -- that will likely restrict these smaller companies drawing on this  $8.5 billion government-run fund to build out these rural networks.  So  again, there are broad implications for these rules that are sent out of  Washington.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And -- and the administration is watching each of these  nuances.  Meanwhile, we've got to talk about this. The state media has  reported -- the Chinese state new media reporting that North Korean leader  Kim Jong-un did in fact make a surprise visit to Beijing to meet with  President Xi Jinping. </p><p>The North Korean leader reportedly told his Chinese counterpart that  Pyongyang is committed to denuclearization, and is willing to talk to U.S.  officials.  President Trump just tweeted about this moments ago, want to  get this tweet out right away. </p><p>Here's what the president just said, for years and through many  administrations, everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the  Korean Peninsula was not even a small possibility. </p><p>Now there is a good chance that Kim Jong-un will do what is right for his  people and for humanity.  Look forward to our meeting.  And of course, we  know that the president is planning on meeting the head of the North Korea  in may, Harry, do you -- do we know what Kim Jong-un would want in exchange  for potentially giving up his nuclear weapons?</p><p>Do we believe that he even would consider such a thing?</p><p>KAZIANIS:  Well Maria, that's the golden question in this whole situation.   What does Kim Jong-un want?  I think at a bare minimum, he's going to want  some sort of peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, some sort of  diplomatic recognition by the United States, potentially as much as  hundreds of billions of dollars in economic assistance. </p><p>That might be one of the reasons he actually went to China.  He -- he is  going to demand a lot, but we're also going to demand a lot.  We're going  to need to have really tough inspections to go in and make sure the North  Koreans are actually living up to the deal. </p><p>But (ph) even gets worse, I mean do they give up their chemical weapons or  missiles?  We have a lot of questions this morning and not a lot of  answers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mary Kissel, you're not buying it, and you're -- and you're  also not buying this first major trade deal with South Korea.  We spoke -- </p><p>KISSEL:  No, but just first -- first on this North Korea meeting, Kim Jong- un's goal here, Maria, is to combine the two Koreas and to have North Korea  run South Korea, that's the goal.</p><p>He wants to eject U.S. troops from the Korean Peninsula, he is never going  to voluntarily give up his nuclear program.  The only way that North Korea  talking to China is a good thing is if China is brokering a deal to take  Kim Jong-un and put him into exile in Monaco or some prison somewhere in  the world. </p><p>That's the only way that that's going to be a good -- a good meeting. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I just think that China reinserted itself real quick on this  deal, why aren't you buying this up (ph) (inaudible).</p><p>KISSEL:  So Trump administration says that this is great for free trade,  this is not market opening, this is called manage trade.  This is called  managed trade, this is where we're going back to the 1980's where we're  trying to set quotas and limits on how certain goods move between  countries.</p><p>It's not market opening, it -- it's not good for trade, it rewards certain  industries, in fact, I'd say it's a little bit of a swamp coming back to  Washington. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, all right, we'll keep watching that.  Harry, great to have  you this morning, thanks so much for your insights. </p><p>KAZIANIA:  Thanks for having me, guys. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Harry Kazianis there, coming up the NTSB launching a probe into  a fatal Tesla crash, whether the automated driving system is to blame.  The  impact on the brand, the company, the stock, which had another tough day  yesterday, this morning it is down again.  </p><p>The FBI and the GOP leaders need to agree on one thing, the response to  demands to turn over documents on alleged abuses at the agency has gone way  too slow.  Find out how the director is picking up the pace after that  subpoena from Bob Goodlatte, back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERICAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump is tweeting this morning.  Guess  (ph) what he just sent out, the second amendment will never be repealed, as  much as democrats would like to see this happen and despite the words  yesterday of former Supreme Court Justice Stevens, no way. </p><p>We need more republicans in 2018 and must always hold the Supreme Court.   Meanwhile there's this, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg decides to testify  before Congress.  </p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now, finally he says he's going to do it. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, ANCHOR:  Yes, I mean we were kind of wondering what he was  going to do.  Zuckerberg is now expected to face pretty tough questions  about the companies handling of user data.</p><p>This entire controversy started after British political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica -- excuse me -- allegedly misused the personal data of  50 million Facebook users.  So Facebook stock actually dropped nearly five  percent yesterday over worries about more regulation, stocks down 15  percent for the month of March. </p><p>This makes it the worst month for this stock since July of 2012.  This  morning, again, stock to watch is down on the pre-market, it's come back a  little bit, but is down more than half a percent. </p><p>We should say that it -- he is still declining to talk to British  lawmakers.  Maria, so he'll talk to those here in the United States.   (Inaudible) investigators are looking into another fatal crash involving  the Tesla that happened last Friday in California. </p><p>National Transportations Safety Board says it not clear if the car's  autopilot was on at the time.  The Model X caught fire after it hit a  highway barrier and was struck by two other vehicles, one man died as a  result of this crash.</p><p>Tesla stocks plunged eight percent yesterday, we should say, and shares are  lower in the pre-market, nearly two percent to the downside right now.   Well let's stay in the car theme, because Uber is putting the breaks on its  driverless car testing in California.  </p><p>They are temporarily suspending all testing after a woman was killed by one  of its cars while crossing the street in Tempe, Arizona.  Cameras show the  safety driver, who we later found out was a convicted felon, looking down,  away from the road at the time of the crash. </p><p>This is the video, Uber says it will not renew its permit in California to  test the vehicles for the foreseeable future.  Also in California, Uber  reaching a $10 million settlement in a discrimination lawsuit. </p><p>Two women engineers accused Uber of gender and racial discrimination, they  claimed that Uber's employee ranking system favors men and white or Asian  employees.  According to filing, the settlement compensates for financial  and emotional harm, to about 285 women and 135 men of color. </p><p>And I'm going to leave you with this, something a little brighter, in an  ode to Homer Simpson, we love him, Krispy Kreme is releasing a real life  version of Homer's favorite donut. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So you like donuts?  Well have all of the (ph) donuts  in the world.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>That's a lot of donuts.  The Simpson's donut is a glazed donut then they  dip it in strawberry flavored white chocolate truffle, that's how it's  iced, and then there's rainbow sprinkles on top. </p><p>You can't get them in the U.S., this is very frustrating, they're only  available in Australia.  Thanks a lot Krispy Kreme. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I guess that means you didn't bring any?</p><p>CASONE:  Well you know I would have (inaudible) get my hands on them. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.  The president just tweeted this, we want to  get this out here, he says this, received message last night from Xi  Jingping of China that his meeting with Kim Jong-un went very well and that  Kim looks forward to his meeting with me. </p><p>In the mean time, and unfortunately, maximum sanctions and pressure must be  maintained at all costs.  The president just -- it's important to not that  John Bolton, now the -- his national security advisor, was behind the --  the Bush administration effort to basically intervene and prevent the  transfer of weapons material, the anti-proliferation measures that were put  in place during the Bush administration, so (inaudible) ...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes, proliferation security initiative very good, and he also saw  appeasement up close, spoke out very strongly against it during the Bush  years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very important.</p><p>McDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right (ph), we'll keep following that.

He's doubling up.  </p><p>FBI Director Christopher Wray is doubling the number of personnel assigned  to responding to the House subpoena for documents relating to the ongoing  Hilary Clinton investigation, the FBI abuse controversy and the FBI's  internal recommendation to fire former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.</p><p>This comes after House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte issued a  subpoena for those documents.  He told me he would on Sunday Morning  Futures - about the slow response, and he asked about the next move, as I  asked him about the subpoena.</p><p>He issued the judicial proceeding days later.  </p><p>(VIDEO BEGINS)</p><p>BOB GOODLATTE, REPRESENTATIVE, REPUBLICAN:  The department and the Bureau  have been slow - I would say, now, very slow - in getting them to us. </p><p>The last time I was on your program, I expressed confidence that we would  have those documents forthcoming, and here we are several weeks later,  still don't have them, so this is coming to a head.</p><p>(VIDEO ENDS)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is former Special Assistant to President  Trump, former Press Secretary to Vice President Pence, and today (ph) RNC  consultant Mark Lauder (ph).  Mark, good to see you.  Thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p>MARC LOTTER, RNC CONSULTANT:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think they're going to get these documents?  I mean it's  absolutely extraordinary to me that they requested 1.2 million documents,  and they've only been given 3,000.</p><p>LOTTER:  I do think they'll get the documents.  It's an enormous request,  and having worked for many different government agencies, these take a lot  of time and a lot of manpower to get through.</p><p>But I think it's also very good that the - that the FBI recognizes the  problem, and they're dealing with it by doubling the staff.</p><p>I mean this is a public relations nightmare for the FBI.  Not only are they  being questioned in terms of how they've handled the investigations, how  they've handled the various activities, now they're being questioned about  the process.  So eliminate the process questions, and let's get to the  bottom of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well is it just a P.R. nightmare, or is it something more?  I  mean the fact is, is there's been stonewalling for almost a year.  </p><p>And not only that, but we now know because of these text message, of the  bias at the top of the FBI, and how they used kid gloves with the Hillary  Clinton investigation, but we're very happy to investigate Donald Trump.</p><p>So I mean, I think it might be more than just P.R.</p><p>LOTTER:  Well, it is more than that, in terms of the actual underlying  issues, and it's something that Director Wray has talked about getting to  the bottom of, and it's something that Congress definitely wants to.</p><p>But having to fight a battle over process is not good for the FBI, so  that's - it's a (ph) good sign that Director Wray has moved in this  direction, to double the amount of people that are dealing with these  requests.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's move on to the speculation around the Speaker of the  House, Paul Ryan.  A (ph) Nevada Republican Congressman told a local  journalist this week he heard through the grapevine that House Speaker Paul  Ryan is on his way out.</p><p>Reports say majority whip (ph) Steve Scalise or House Majority Leader Kevin  McCarthy could replace him.  </p><p>Here's what Speaker Ryan told me when I asked him about his future plans  just last month.</p><p>(VIDEO BEGINS)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to stick around in order to see the fruits of  your labor ...</p><p>PAUL RYAN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  I can't really answer that question (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  ... because the rumblings are you're going to hopefully keep  the House, as you just said, but then ...</p><p>RYAN:  Yes, no, I feel good about - I really think we're going to keep the  House.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  ... resign and step down after November?</p><p>RYAN:  Look, my wife and I have that conversation in the spring of every  election year.  We haven't had that yet.  We'll figure it out then.</p><p>(VIDEO ENDS)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Paul Ryan has dismissed any plans to step down.  Do you think  we see somebody else holding the gavel soon?</p><p>LOTTER:  No, I don't.  I think the Speaker does - he - we just passed  historic tax cuts with the President, they've got a big agenda, and I know  that the Speaker has a number of items on his plate that he still wants to  get to.</p><p>He's raising money left and right for republicans running for congress and  to keep the majority.  I think you'll see him be a Speaker again next year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I wonder what happens.  I mean, I - what I've heard was the  inside is that eventually he will step down, but not before the mid-terms.   What do you think, Mary?</p><p>KISSEL:  Well, I don't know.  I'm curious to see if they're going to try  for another tax bill, try to make the personal income tax cuts permanent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY:  ... thing was health care, though, and that - and that's what he  took issue on and said here, is he was so furious that the senate wouldn't  back their plans for health care.</p><p>So he's like, hey, we've done our job on the house side, and he repeatedly  said that, and he took - he took offense to John McCain coming in and  actually destroying it in the 12th hour.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>McDOWELL:  And passing that stupid spending bill.  That basically took  making the individual tax cuts permanent - took that off the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think so?</p><p>McDOWELL:  In my opion.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KISSEL:  He cares about the party, though.  I'm not sure he'd want to make  it look like chaos right before the mid-terms.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Marc, we going to see phase two of the tax plan (ph), you  think?</p><p>LOTTER:  I think they're working on it.  I'm not sure if they'll get it  done this year.  I think there's a hope for that, but I think right now  we've got to make sure that we keep what we've got going, the momentum, and  if we can make it permanent, it's probably something that's better for  republicans to be able to campaign on for 2018 than (ph) to actually get it  done right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  Marc, great to see you.   Thanks so much.</p><p>LOTTER:  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Marc Lotter, joining us there.  Coming up, nervous investors  sent the market (ph) sliding on fears of a (ph) technology regulation  crackdown.  </p><p>Is it time to get out of tech?  And what about the rest of the market?   Take a look at the damage, yesterday.  Netflix down better than 6 percent.</p><p>Then there's this.  Megamillions climbs to a half a billion dollars, the  biggest jackpot in nearly two year.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Wednesday morning, welcome back everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, March 28, your  top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the east coast.  A wild day on Wall  Street yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial average swinging better than 700  points from the high to the low.  The selling accelerated in the final hour  of trading and the declines driven by a tech wreck, the largest names in  the sector, all sharply lowering yesterday's trade.</p><p>Take a look, Amazon down 4 percent, Facebook down 5 percent, Netflix down  more than 6 percent.  The Nasdaq, the worst performer on the day, down  nearly 3 percent on the session.  Yesterday, the Dow was down one and a  half percent and the S&amp;P were down were down - was down one and three  quarters percent.</p><p>Take a look at the future because the selling is continuing this morning.   We are expecting the markets to open lower, although, well off of the low  as I should point out.  Dow Industrials now down just about 10 points.   We're waiting on the final read of the fourth quarter GDP.  The expectation  calls for growth of 2.7 percent for the fourth quarter and that would be  final.  So, we'll get that to you in about two hour's time. </p><p>Global markets, following the U.S. lower this morning, the (FT 100) down a  third of a percent, the CAC (INAUDIBLE) and the DAX INDEX down one percent  a piece.  In Asia, over night, steep declines there as well.  It's taking a  cue from Wall Street.  Worst performer was Hong Kong, Hang Seng down two  and a half percent. </p><p>Farewell to a hero, thousands attend the funeral for the New York City  firefighter who died fighting a blaze on a movie set.  And now, a lawsuit  has been filed against Ed Norton's production company over that fire.   Another ball headed to the NBA, Lonzo Ball's younger brother declares for  the NBA draft.</p><p>Plus, the numbers are in for Mega Millions, but nobody won the $485 million  jackpot, and so, we're going to preview that and then there's Roseanne  returning to the small screen, this time, as a Trump supporter.  All that  coming up this morning, but first, there's this, technology taking a  tumble.</p><p>(Stocks) tumble, those big tech names weighed on the major averages  yesterday with the Nasdaq down nearly 3 percent on the session.  The so- called fang stocks, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google have lost  more than $250 billion in market value just in the past week, alone.   Joining me, right now, is the Yardeni Research President and the author of  Predicting the Markets, Ed Yardeni, who has done so well for so many years  and Ed, it is great to see you again. </p><p>ED YARDENI, YARDENI RESEARCH PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us, congratulations on the book. </p><p>YARDENI:  My pleasure. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about that in a minute, but first...</p><p>YARDENI:  Sure. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  ...get your take on what we saw this week, concerns over the  regulatory headwinds coming for the tech sector.  What would you do with  tech right now? </p><p>YARDENI:  The market has had a great run since March 2009 and it was really  melting up in January.  And now it feels a little bit like a mini meltdown.   It's really just been a correction and I think we're just, kind of, coming  back to the planet Earth, recognizing that it's not straight up with  technology.  There are going to be issues, regulatory issues and issues of  whether some of these technologies can actually be achieved. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So - so, look at the backdrop, then, for us, for investing.  I  mean, what would you do, right now, and how do you see the backdrop? </p><p>YARDENI:  Well, for anybody who's been in this market for a while, I'd stay  with it.  I don't see any particular reason to bail out of here.  I don't  see a bare market because I don't see a recession coming anytime soon.  </p><p>For anybody who's thinking about getting in, you're a little late, stocks  are not exactly cheap. So, you may just want to take opportunities like  this to get into some stocks that are showing selling earnings growths.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is that really what you want to drive your decisions - the  earnings growth because here...</p><p>YARDENI:  Yes. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  ...we are, what, two weeks away from starting to get the first  quarter numbers...</p><p>YARDENI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  ...right? The - the first quarter ends this week and we're  expecting the S&amp;P 500 earnings to be up 16 percent...</p><p>YARDENI:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  ...in the first quarter, that's a good number. </p><p>YARDENI:  Well, you know, we had the tax cut at the end of last year and,  as a result of that, analysts actually raised their numbers for earnings  for this year, substantially, by $12 a share, basically.  That's a - it's a  really big - big gain, but it may actually be more than that because they  didn't really have a complete read on how the tax cut would, in fact, hit  earnings positively and I think that's going to be reflected in the  upcoming earning season. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think the tax plan has a long runway in terms of an impact  on earnings and the broad economy? </p><p>YARDENI:  Well, look, the - the immediate impact is dramatic.  We're  looking at an earnings growth number of 16 to 17 percent, this year.  So,  it's great that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, 18 percent higher year over year?</p><p>YARDENI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>YARDENI:  Well, that's what the analysts are thinking, but they were a  little - a little bit optimistic.  But I think then we settled down to the  norm which is about 7 percent growth, but that's good.  That's what -  that's what the market typically does, it goes up with earnings.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell - tell me about investing in this market, today.  You  wrote a book about you, you are legendary in terms of looking at the  backdrop and - and allocating money. </p><p>YARDENI:  Right. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How would you do that today? </p><p>YARDENI:  Well, I think, the - the key issue for investors always has been,  at least in the 40 years that I've been in the business, has been  inflation.  And so, you really want to have a pretty strong feel of where  inflation is going.  And there is a widespread concern that it's going to  come back, but it hasn't.  And I think that's very powerful for us is  keeping inflation down. </p><p>In that case, I don't see a big increase in bond yield.  So, if you've had  some dividend yielding stocks and then they'll continue to do well,  although, they're not cheap, obviously.  And I would focus - continue to  focus on growth.  I think we are looking at a technology driven world where  the innovations are just extraordinary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your book is called Predicting the Markets, based on your 40  years in the financial sector.  So, you're - you're talking about the lack  of inflation even though we are seeing some moves in wage growth.  You  would imagine...</p><p>YARDENI:  Yes. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  ...wage growth happens when you have a better economic story...</p><p>YARDENI:  Right. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  ...and we're talking about 2.7 percent growth. </p><p>YARDENI:  Right.  Well, there is a Phillips curve theory that says when the  unemployment rates are very low, the way the inflation should go up.  And  this kind of makes sense.  However, that's not the whole story.  The other  story is the price of inflation, itself, can feed back into keeping a lid  on wage inflation if you have tremendous global competition, which we do. </p><p>If we have tremendous technological innovation, which we do, Amazon being  one example of how technology is impacting lower inflation.  And then,  aging and demographics around the world, I think, is another force keeping  inflation down.  So, I know there's a lot of concern about inflation coming  back, but I don't think it is. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So - so, you've got a lot of big ideas in this book.  You - you  also take into account that this is an Amazon economy, which is keeping  inflation in check. </p><p>YARDENI:  Yes, absolutely. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>YARDENI:  And, you know, I keep following what the Fed and other central  banks are doing and they - they're still, kind of, stuck on this idea that  they should be able to get inflation higher, but at what point are they  going to put up a flag and say, maybe inflation isn't just a monetary  phenomenon, maybe there are other forces keeping it down? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So, tell us, right now, how you want to recommend  investing, today, because you're looking, not just at the growth story...</p><p>YARDENI:  Right. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  ...you're also looking at where evaluations are best. </p><p>YARDENI:  Right - right.  Well, everything is expensive. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. </p><p>YARDENI:  And so, I think you really do want to be where the earnings  growth is, but I think you want to diversify and still have stocks that  have been growing dividends.  I mean, that, historically, that's really  been the best way to make money over the long term in the market, is invest  in good companies that are raising their dividends and there's plenty of  them. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you worry about the current upset around trade and tariffs? </p><p>YARDENI:  Well, I worry about it.  I think, to the extent, that the market  worries about it.  I have to worry about it.  I think globalization is here  to stay.  I think they're just too much interdependence to settle a shut  off world trade.  And I don't really think this administration wants to  move away from free trade.  I really don't have a problem with fair trade  as long as it is free trade.  And I think this administration is using a  lot of threats to make trade fair for the United States...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. </p><p>YARDENI:  ...and it's working.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's face it, we have deficits - trade deficits...</p><p>YARDENI:  Yes we do. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  ...across the world. </p><p>YARDENI:  Yes. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pretty significant actually.  $800 billion...</p><p>YARDENI:  Yes. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  ...when you look at...</p><p>YARDENI:  Right. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  ...collectively speaking.  So, in terms of their policies, then  you think the markets are getting it wrong? </p><p>YARDENI:  Well, I think the markets are - have, sort of, a life of their  own.  It's not just about the fundamentals.  It's also, sometimes, about  the internal working as a market.  And I think we're just seeing a  consolidation and some of the profit taking and, sort of, the high flyers  coming back to reality about what can and can't be achieved. </p><p>So, I think once if we can solve it for a few more months, it is a good  thing because then the market will mosey along with earnings.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you expecting 3 present economic growth this year? </p><p>YARDENI: I am. I think the frustrating thing for our economy is that all  this stimulus the Administration is throwing at it, some of it does get  leaked through the trade deficit and that's why there is this pressure to  do something about that. But I think we could grow 3%; I don't see 4%. I  don't think that demographics and productivity numbers are going to make  that number work. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Not even a couple years out? </p><p>YARDENI:  Not even a couple of years out.  The demography is such the labor  force growth is extremely slow. I mean back in the 60s, 70s and 80s, a good  part of what I wrote about in my book is the baby boomers flooded in, women  flooded in and we had tremendous participation rate increases. But now the  baby boomers are getting older and millennials are not providing the labor  force growth. </p><p>BARTIROMO: And that is why the participation rate is where it is?</p><p>YARDENI: That's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Ed, it's great to see you. Thanks so much. Congrats on the  book. Check it out. Ed Yardeni. </p><p>Coming up, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu under orders to rest  after going to the hospital with flu-like symptoms. We're told he is okay  and resting right now. Then find out the gross reason for delay of game at  Dodger Stadium last night. Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)   </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back. A tough day yesterday.  Thousands mourn in honor,  a New York City firefighter killed on a movie set. Cheryl Casone with the  details.  Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Good morning Maria.  It was really was an  inspiring and emotional show of from the New York Fire Department along  with friends, family, and firefighters from around the country that  attended the funeral service for Lieutenant Michael Davison at St.  Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue. The 37 year old father of four young  children died after fighting flames in a building in Harlem that was being  used as a movie set for a film called \"Motherless Brooklyn.\"  Meanwhile a  tenant in the building is now suing after Edward Norton's production  company for $7 million.  The tenant claiming she suffered severe permanent  personal injuries because of the film company's negligence. </p><p>Another headline we're following for you this morning, Israeli Prime  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly feeling better after he was  hospitalized.  Netanyahu had a high fever and cough after not taking enough  time to recover from a prior throat infection. He tweeted out yesterday  that he was on his way home from the hospital to get some rest.</p><p>Well the Mega Millions Jackpot grew into a whopping $502 million, after no  one won last night.  This is the fourth largest jackpot in Mega Millions  history.  The next drawing is going to be Friday night and your chances of  winning, just you know 258.9 million in 1.  Yes, so good luck with that.  </p><p>All right, the classic sitcom \"Rosanne\" is back on TV after 21 years and  this time the title character played by Roseanne Barr supports President  Trump. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>JACKIE HARRIS, SISTER OF ROSEANNE BARR:  How could you have voted for him  Roseanne? </p><p>ROSEANNE BARR:  He talked about jobs, Jackie.  He said he'd shake things  up. I mean this might come as a complete shock to you, but we almost lost  our house the way things are going. </p><p>HARRIS:  Have you looked at the news because now things are worse. </p><p>BARR:  Not on the real news. </p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>CASONE:  Roseanne Barr herself is a Trump supporter. The nine-episode  season started last night. John Goodman has returned as Dan, Roseanne  Conner's husband and along with daughter Darlene, played by Sara Gilbert,  who is now an executive producer on the show. They explained Dan's death by  saying oh, it was all a dream. By the way, Dan is alive, never mind. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes and of course she has been trashed on twitter as a result of  her support for Donald Trump. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:   Wait.  You got into a twitter fight with Roseanne,  didn't you? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, no, I am a fan. It is great the show is back. I  think that, you know look, a lot of mainstream America is not represented  on television. And you know what?  All sorts of people voted for Donald  Trump and I think it's very savvy of Roseanne to bring this character back  right now. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it's both sides that are portrayed, it's the right and the  left.  It's the conversations that people actually have in their homes. And  she was -- Roseanne was a trailblazer when she started in terms of her  stand up and doing the show.  So I've got to sit down and watch it. </p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right.  It's a conversation happening across...</p><p>MCDOWELL:   Whitney Cummings, who is a female comedian also is working on  it as one of the writers, and I know that was like - because I follow her  on Instagram.   I know that that's an important addition to the cast or the  writing staff.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE :  I was just going to say that Tim Allen had a great  show that represented the right and got canceled and it was on ABC.  It had  great ratings. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right.  Why did it get canceled? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: \"Home Improvement?\"</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, no, no.  It was called \"Last Man Standing.\"  It got  canceled - it got cancelled for nebulous reasons, no one really knows but  it had great ratings.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll take a break.  When we come back, the biggest winner in  this year's March Madness, Sister Jean, the 98-year-old spiritual leader of  Loyola Chicago men's basketball team just made Bobblehead history. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  YouTube TV will be the first ever presenting  sponsor for the NBA finals.  This as (ph) Nike extends its contract with  the NFL.  Lauren Simonetti was (ph) told the details in sports this  morning, Laura. </p><p>LAURA SIMONETTI, SPORTS:  (SPORTS)</p><p>BARITROMO:  Laura thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Sure. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  (Inaudible) we'll see you a little Lauren Simonetti.  Still  ahead, we are live from the New York auto show.  Wait until you see what's  there.  We talk about what's driving Ford Motor Company in the future. </p><p>I'm going to check in on those autonomous cars post that accident.

Good Wednesday morning,  everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is  Wednesday, March 28th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Technology taking a toll, stocks tumbled yesterday, weighed down by major  tech names facing concerns over new regulatory scrutiny.  Among the leaders  Facebook, Alphabet and Apple which turned negative for the year.  This  comes as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly agrees to testify before  lawmakers on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Futures this morning show that the selling is continuing -- take a look.   We are off of the lows.  Look at this, the Dow Industrials just moved into  positive territory just a few minutes ago.  We're now looking at a gain on  the Dow of 36 points.  The S&amp;P is also higher.  The Nasdaq still in the red  down 12.75 points right now.</p><p>Investors are waiting for the final reading for the fourth quarter GDP.   It's due out in 90 minutes from economists are expecting growth of 2.7  percent for the final reading.</p><p>In Europe, red across the board although here too, you're looking at the  markets, off of the lows.  FT100 down just 6 points right now; and the CAC  40 and DAX index down three-quarters of 1 percent.  They had been down  better than 1 percent earlier.  So a bit of a rally under way this morning.</p><p>In Asia overnight, steep declines.  The Hang Seng index was the worst  performer in Hong Kong, down 2.5 percent.  The Nikkei in Japan down more  than 1 percent.</p><p>Microsoft bans offensive language.  The big change to the company's service  agreement that allows it to monitor your private account.</p><p>Fighting sanctuary cities -- Orange County, California's board of  supervisors, voting to go against California and fight legislation which  protects illegal immigrants.  The country's sheriff -- the county sheriff  rather, is taking action against sanctuary laws by making inmate release  dates public.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's a public safety issue to me.  It's not about  immigration at all.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's about individuals who have committed violent  crimes.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  More on the battle over illegal immigration coming up this  morning.</p><p>And shocking moments on a Utah highway -- look at this.  Look at this.  A  driver slams into a police officer, launching him into the air.  This video  is incredible.  Can you believe?  He's ok this morning.  </p><p>MARY KISSEL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  That's a miracle.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was a miracle.  We have that story coming up.  The video is  just incredible.  We wanted you to see it there.  So we'll play it here  once more.</p><p>And coming up, beefing up the box office, Carl's Jr. debuts a new Spiel- burger to celebrate the legendary Director Steven Spielberg.  The director  says cut -- why he is passing on this honor.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to break it all  down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; Benchmark managing partner  now, Mr. Kevin Kelly; and the \"Wall Street Journal's\" editorial board  member, Fox News contributor Mary Kissel.  Great to see you.</p><p>KISSEL:   Good morning -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning, everybody.  Congrats on your marriage.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you very much.  And the biggest  question now is what do I do to my settings?  Do I update my relationship  status on Facebook?  Do I not?  There's a lot of security issues.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you see the banner though?  Facebook is introducing new  privacy controls.  This is just crossing Reuters right now.  Announcing a  series of privacy changes that it's making to give users more control over  their data.</p><p>I'll dig into this.  It's going to add a new privacy short cuts menu which  is going to let users review what they're sharing, what they've and deleted  as well as features enabling them to download their data and move it to  another service.</p><p>But again this is one of the knocks on this app data, the information that  you were essentially handing over to apps.  Even that your friends were  using.</p><p>It wasn't under the privacy controls.  It was under your setting in the  apps area and people didn't know that this was going on, even though  Facebook really tried to pull away from this back in 2014, 2015.</p><p>We can get into it.  Anyway, I wanted to just get into that real quick.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, one of the issues is that when you have a Facebook  account, you actually have to take it upon yourself to opt out of these  things.  Otherwise, you're completely, you know -- you're completely there  for companies to take your data, right and access your information.  You  have to opt out.  It's not like an opt-in.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, also taking other meta data, so they have cookies that are  tracking your search habits on the Internet.  They're also getting metadata  from financial institutions, repairing that together.  And then they're  selling that data.  That's the whole point.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And nobody knew that.  It makes you completely vulnerable.  </p><p>KELLY:  Right.  And this, this doesn't necessarily have to do with the  weaponization of foreign countries.  It has to do with the affiliate  marketing where people are sold diet pills and there's, you know, all these  crazy different things where data is being exploited for nefarious purposes  especially on the advertising side.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Facebook is an advertising company -- </p><p>KISSEL:  And a media company -- Dagen, and a media company -- </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure.</p><p>KISSEL:   that doesn't want to be held liable for the contents that it puts  up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, everybody should just share their information.  </p><p>Let's bring in Hotspot Shield cyber security analyst Robert Siciliano, get  you to weigh in here.  Robert -- it's good to see you, sir.  Thanks so much  for joining us.</p><p>ROBERT SICILIANO, CYBER SECURITY ANALYST, HOTSPOT SHIELD:  Good morning --  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take on this?  This is breaking right now.   Facebook is introducing new features for users to download and delete data.  </p><p>SICILIANO:  Yes.  This is, you know, reminiscent of anyone who's committed  a crime and they apologize after, wishing that, you know, it didn't happen  that way and, you know, it's a little late for that.  The cat's out of the  bag.  The horse is out of the barn.</p><p>And, you know, while these new privacy controls may tamper things down a  little bit, I think it's a little too late.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I think one of the biggest questions we're having, Robert, is  you talk about it's a little too late.  I mean we saw that after the  election in 2016, they still -- they kind of doubled down saying hey, this  isn't our fault.  They weren't the ones to blame.  They weren't the ones  doing anything wrong.  They were victims themselves.</p><p>Now, how do you reconcile what's going on with Facebook, with Google -- I  think Google is another canary in the coal mine -- we're talking about all  these things being batted down and I think Google is actually the next  pillar to fall because I feel they have more sensitive information from  business to personal to maps to everything -- you name it.  </p><p>So where do we go from here?  And do you think Google is the next pillar to  fall?  </p><p>SICILIANO:  Well, there's no question about it -- Google, Facebook,  Snapchat, Instagram -- all of these sites are gathering a tremendous amount  of information about us.  And when you think about it phone companies,  right, they've had a lot of information on us for years.</p><p>I mean they have access to our phone calls, access to our devices, right.   You think credit card companies; I mean they know everything that you're  purchasing every single day.  And think about the amount of data they have  on you. </p><p>And right now companies like Google and Facebook and others aren't nearly  regulated the way credit card companies are, financial institutions are,  the way phone companies are.  And I think that regulation is what's on the  horizon for all these companies.</p><p>I think that they have lacked self regulation for all these years.  They've  gotten away with so much and this right here, this is effectively the wake- up call and you're going to see politicians worldwide tampering down.  </p><p>KISSEL:   Well, you've got to thank President (AUDIO GAP) -- Facebook was  doing whoops, somebody used it to actually help the Trump campaign.  Now  all of a sudden Democrats who protected Facebook for years are up in arms.</p><p>Robert -- was this the biggest open secret in Silicon Valley that this was  what -- how Facebook ran its business?  </p><p>SICILIANO:  You know, I think that this hasn't really been a secret at all.   I think that the public has known about it -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If they watch MORNINGS WITH MARIA they would know it wasn't a  secret because we've been sitting on this very program talking about it for  years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He have.</p><p>KISSEL:   Years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have.  We have.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We knew that a regulatory fight was coming, by the way.  We all  said this.  Dagen and I have been talking about this for a long time.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They had Facebook live allowing people to commit suicide and  kill themselves on TV and their reaction was, well, we rolled it out too  quickly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And more than that, they're more powerful than they ever  have been.  They have -- I mean Google says it anonymizes (ph) our search  items after two years.  Why?  Why not anonymize it immediately?  Why must  you sit on our -- what we are searching for, for two years?  It's  incredible.  </p><p>SICILIANO:  Yes.  They -- Google at this point, you know, they know that  the end is near.  Facebook knows they can't continue this behavior.   They're rolling out all these features right now just to kind of calm  everybody down.  But I don't think that's going to matter.  I think the  regulation is going to come hard, it's going to come fast and it's going to  cost them and their investors a lot of money.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that there's still a lot to be discovered about what  Facebook was doing and the core of their business to me is so insidious  because, again, they were constantly asking you for more and more  information, more and more information, because they wanted to improve the  social experience on Facebook -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But your friends know what you like.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We need to know exactly where you went to elementary school so  your life can be better by us improving our features.  And it's just a big  lie.</p><p>They were trying to collect more and more data on you so then they could  essentially -- they could slice and dice it and sell it and make their  advertising that much more attractive to advertisers.</p><p>But another -- there are a couple of other things.  How much information is  out there from app developers that was gathered between 2007 and 2015 when  they said they put an end to the practice of basically collecting vast  amounts of data from anybody and everybody?</p><p>It's sitting out there on servers, number one.  And I think that we're just  beginning to scratch the surface on how Facebook really drives news.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are no independent news organizations except for like \"The  Wall Street Journal\" -- </p><p>KISSEL:   Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and very few newspapers, because what happens is these news  organizations, these magazines, they essentially write articles based on  what Google and Facebook tell them will get the most eye balls.  </p><p>KISSEL:   Yes.  And can we get some numbers in here?  About 140 million  Americans get news from Facebook.  I'm quoting from an editorial, Robert -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>KISSEL:  -- while Fox News -- well, let's not talk about Fox News  viewership but it's much lower than 140 million people.  And they're not  showing every part of the political spectrum.  They're skewed to the left.   My hope is that now maybe some of these readers will start to question, you  know, what Facebook is feeding them.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wait, here's what -- and Robert, you can respond to this -- but  here's what always got me so upset.  When people would find out that  basically our intelligence agencies were trying to use metadata -- </p><p>KISSEL:   Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- to track terrorists and prevent terror attacks, you would get  -- </p><p>KISSEL:   Up in arms.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- asymmetric rage, or outrage from people in this country.  But  yet, they were never upset about Facebook, them handing over the most  sensitive personal information to Facebook for a private company to make  money off of it.  </p><p>SICILIANO:  Yes.  The general public are somewhat naive to this.  And I  think it's only because they don't recognize that while social is free,  that they in fact, the consumer, the user, they are the product of what's  being sold.  And I don't think that they're thinking that through.  And as  a result -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can you regulate?  Can you regulate these companies?</p><p>SICILIANO:  -- they're all shocked by this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Or is this information coming in and out so quickly?  Can you  regulate Facebook?  </p><p>SICILIANO:  I'm sure at some level they can be.  They have to be.  </p><p>KELLY:  The best thing Facebook can do along with these other social media  giants is do a self-regulatory agency where they hold themselves  accountable if they don't want the government to get involved.</p><p>But one of the things is they had discriminatory advertising going on  relentlessly where people could go on and just say we don't want to  advertise to people of color.  It's ridiculous.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's just remember what happens when the pendulum swung  so far on the banks.  When, you know, they over-regulated the banks they  became bigger.  So I would just throw that out there to say can, you know - - has the horse left the station at this point, right?</p><p>Robert -- thank you very much.  Robert Siciliano -- </p><p>SICILIANO:  Thank you -- Maria.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- thank you, sir.</p><p>Coming up, sanctuary state backlash -- officials in Orange County joining  federal lawsuit that battles California's laws protecting illegal  immigrants.  That's going to be some conversation.  Join us for that.</p><p>And then a police officer in Utah survives after an unbelievable roadside  car accident.  You have to see this. It's incredible.  We will have the  details on his condition this morning.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>The final read on fourth quarter GDP could be a market mover.  The number  is out in about an hour.  And we are expecting growth of 2.7 percent.   Futures right now are higher going into that number, up almost 50 points on  the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- complete reversal as we've been on the  air this morning.</p><p>The Nasdaq is also well off of the lows.  It's still negative, down 2  points.  But again, well off of the lows.  And the S&amp;P is higher as well,  up 4 points.</p><p>Meanwhile there's this dozens of iPhone owners filing a lawsuit against  Apple.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  That's right -- Maria.  Some five dozen  iPhone customers have filed about 60 lawsuits since December are accusing  Apple of slowing older iPhones to force people to buy new iPhones.  This  comes after Apple said its software updates reduced the performance of  older phone models to preserve battery life.  Shares of the company though,  we should say in the premarket, are little changed this morning.</p><p>Well, Oracle has won the latest round in an eight year legal fight against  Google over copyrights.  A federal appeals court ruled that Google's use of  Oracle's java programming language for its Android operating system was,  quote, \"not fair\".  The court has sent the case back for trial to determine  how much money Google should pay in damages.  The tab could run into the  billions.</p><p>Well, one day your doctor's prescription could require you to be selfie- medicated.  Smartphone apps that monitor pill taking are now available.   Researchers are currently looking at how well the video monitoring works in  ensuring that patients do take their pills.  Using an app on someone's  phone a patient can film themselves taking the medication, upload the video  to their doctor's office as proof they're actually taking their pills.  Ok.</p><p>And then finally there is this.  Red Bull is going organic.  They're  launching a new line of sodas.  But unlike good old regular Red Bull which  Dagen knows I love, it may not give you the jolt that you actually want.   Three of the four new beverages do not have caffeine.  The organic line is  made up of Red Bull Simply Cola, Bitter Lemon, Ginger Ale and Tonic Water.</p><p>They're going to be on store shelves next week, first in San Diego, then to  North Carolina.  For the rest of us for now it's going to will be available  on Amazon.  So Red Bull without the oomph, Maria -- I don't know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know other.  All right.  Cheryl -- thank you.</p><p>We'll take a break.</p><p>When we come back we're live from the New York Auto Show.  It is an  exciting time for automakers like Ford Motor, but also a challenging one.   We talk to the Ford executive vice president next.</p><p>And then thanks, but no thanks -- why legendary director Steven Spielberg  is turning down an offer by Carl's Jr. to make a burger named after him. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Combating California's sanctuary laws -- yesterday Orange County and the  board of supervisors there voted unanimously to buck the state's political  leaders and join instead a federal lawsuit that fights legislation  protecting illegal immigrants.</p><p>The move comes as the county sheriff's department is working to improve  communication with federal immigration agents by publishing when inmates  will be released.  They published that online.</p><p>Joining us right now is the vice chairman for the Orange County board of  supervisor, Shawn Nelson.  Shawn -- thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p>SHAWN NELSON, VICE CHAIRMAN, ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS:  Hi --  good morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So tell us about yesterday's vote.  </p><p>NELSON:  Yesterday's vote, the board took action basically to stand up for  the people of Orange County, stand up for the sheriff, and let California  know that despite their desires to release criminals into our  neighborhoods, under the guise of being kind, that we weren't going to  tolerate that.  It's not constitutional.  And we decided to join the  federal lawsuit.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean what is the motive of the state?  I mean the attorney  general in California weighed in on the steps that Orange County is taking  and obviously they're pushing back on you.  So what do you think the motive  is?  </p><p>NELSON:  Maria, in fairness, I don't even think that he understood the  steps that we took.  I think their motive is, and if it goes back to the  original legislation, the original desire was to not allow the sheriff to  stop any criminal from being released.  They backed off and there are now  some exceptions but the state of California and the tone is they don't want  anyone that is here illegally to even have to comply with any rules and  they exempt criminals as well and it's sad.  But anyone that disagrees with  them, they call names -- racist, etcetera.  And it's sort of degenerated to  the least common denominator.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, here's the attorney general yesterday.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>XAVIER BECERRA, CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL:  The state law is state law  and it's my job to enforce state law.  I will do so.  And we want to make  sure that every jurisdiction including Orange County understands what state  law requires of the people and the subdivisions of the state of California.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Does that mean a lawsuit against the sheriff's  department or an arrest of the sheriff? </p><p>BECERRA:  I think I just answered that.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Shawn -- is this just a pushback against President Trump or --  I mean -- what would be the motive of alerting criminals, those who have  broken the law, that ICE is coming for you?  </p><p>NELSON:  The motive is they don't want the federal government to have any  authority to enforce immigration laws here and the idea that any local  would cooperate to them is, you know, basically you're speaking like an  apostate.</p><p>It's crazy.  It's illegal.  And we're not going to put up with it.  And the  attorney general doesn't understand his own law.  The sheriff has said  clearly she's going to follow the law which is why we engaged in an  intervention attempt to get in the federal lawsuit so we could set the law  straight and let them know we're acting within the rules.  They violated  them.  Not our local sheriff.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So where does this go?  I mean the AG is fighting back saying  look, Becerra -- he's not ruling out taking action of his own, he said.</p><p>NELSON:  He's just speaking out of school.  The sheriff is not violating  the current California law.  That's the problem.  The current California  laws required our sheriff to release 172 criminals into the street that  should have been detained by federal authorities.</p><p>So she's continuing to follow the law.  She's found a work-around for now.   He may be frustrated but that's just because he probably hasn't read his  own law and doesn't understand, you know, she got him on this one.  I'm  sure the fix is coming from Sacramento to close that loophole any time.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what about the move to put the release dates online?  Why  is that important?  </p><p>NELSON:  Well, because what the current California law says is that they  cannot release information on inmates that's not otherwise available to the  public.  The sheriff, to her credit, just realized, fine, then we will  release all inmates' data and for right now at least the federal  authorities can at least access that database.</p><p>There's no communication which there should be, but at least they can see  who's there and when they're getting out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So that's the point of that then, just make sure the federal  regulators, the lawmakers understand what the release dates are, they know  who will be let out and when?  </p><p>NELSON:  Right.  The sheriff outsmarted the law for right now.  California  has proven that their desire in Sacramento is not to help the citizens and  protect them, but to somehow come up with schemes to allow illegal  immigrants to basically get out without any rule-following at all.  And  this is the next step, will probably be Sacramento trying to change the law  yet again.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean did you think the people feel differently than the  leadership in Sacramento?  </p><p>NELSON:  Maria -- I know they do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NELSON:  And that's the big difference.  California -- the public employee  unions kind of dominate politics so you get a lot of interesting results at  the state level.  But I can tell you overwhelmingly, the citizens of Orange  County across the board have thanked us.  We've gotten calls, letters, e- mails.</p><p>People appreciate this and it's common sense.  And people are just sort of  breathing a sigh of relief that elected officials are standing up for the  average citizen finally.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  we'll be watching this.  This is an  incredible case.</p><p>Shawn -- thanks very much for weighing in this morning.  </p><p>NELSON:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Shawn Nelson there.</p><p>Coming up, we are live from the New York Auto Show this morning.

A wild day for stocks yesterday.  The Dow swung more than 700 points from the high to the low. The selling  accelerated in the final hour of trading and the damage was steep. The Dow  Jones Industrial Average down 1.5%, 345 points lower at the close. The  declines were driven by a tech wreck; the largest names in technology all  sharply lower in yesterday's trade. Take a look at Facebook, down almost  5%. Amazon down almost 4%. Apple and Netflix also sharply lower, Alphabet  down almost 5%. The Nasdaq was the worst performer, down nearly 3% when all  was said and done. The Dow Industrials down 345 points yesterday, 1.5%, and  the S&amp;P down 1  3/4%. </p><p>We're looking at a bit of a rebound this morning though, take a look at  futures, completely reversing course in the last hour. We started off the  show, the market was down about 60 points, now we're up 77 points on the  Dow, up 7.5 on the S&amp;P and up 15.5 points on the Nasdaq, a quarter of a  percent higher there. </p><p>Next hour we get the final reading on the fourth quarter GDP. The  expectations call for growth in the fourth quarter, up 2.7%. Global markets  following the U.S. lower this morning, in Europe we're well off the lows  here, should point out but still in the red. FQ100 down 3 points,  (inaudible) is down 36, and the DAX Index in Germany is down 71, 2/3 of a  percent lower there. </p><p>In Asia overnight, steep declines, Asian markets taking a cue from Wall  Street with the Hang Seng in Hong Kong down 2.5% and the Nikkei in Japan  down 1 1/3%.  </p><p>An unbelievably scary moment on a Utah highway. Take a look at this. A  highway patrol officer thrown into the air after being hit by a car. The  incredible story and his recovery this morning. We'll give you an update on  how he is doing after this incredible move on the highway. </p><p>Meanwhile, Spielberg sending back his order to Carl's Junior. Why he  rejected the fast food company's idea to create a Spiel-Burger and then so  much for a Tiffany setting. The new trend in engagement rings, taking out  the ring and raising the eyebrows.</p><p>And now you can really run on Dunkin'.  The coffee giant unveiling its own  shoe; all that coming up this morning, but first this.  It is a big week  for the auto sector with the New York international auto show this week.  Lincoln is unveiling a high-tech, eco-friendly mid-sized SUV. Joining me  right now from the New York Auto Show is Ford Executive Vice President,  Global Markets President, Jim Farley. Jim good to see you, thanks so much  for joining us. </p><p>JIM FARLEY, FORD MOTOR COMPANY EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND GLOBAL  MARKETS  PRESIDENT:  My pleasure. Good to be here this morning. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know the auto sector has become all about technology. Tell  us what strikes you about the new models, in particular that new SUV from  Lincoln and in particular the technology inside the car. </p><p>FARLEY:  So for Lincoln, SUVS are really important for us. We just launched  Navigator. We're going to launch Aviator. The tech in the car is pretty  amazing.  A phone in the key so you don't need a key fob anymore; you can  just operate the vehicle with your phone in your pocket. We have new  technology in the vehicle. It's a beautiful interior and it fits in with  the quiet flight vision. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jim, I got to ask you, is there any security concern with that  key? I mean we're talking all morning about Facebook and how our data is  being used by third parties unbeknown to us. What are you doing with all  the data that you get from us in the cars? </p><p>FARLEY:   Well, nothing's more important than our brand and the safety and  privacy of our customers.  We have a very specific electric architecture  that is really secure. So we have no qualms about any of the customer  privacy information but used in anything other than starting and operating  the car. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you saying you're not selling the data to third party  companies? Are you selling this data to anybody else? </p><p>FARLEY:  No, no. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen? </p><p>MCDOWELL:   In terms of protecting individuals' data, you're going to have  to really convince, I think that given the blow-up with Facebook, you're  going to have to convince those customers whether they are a die-hard Ford  family like mine that you are protecting their data and that other parties,  third parties won't have access to it. Regardless of whether you're selling  it or not, it's about protecting it from anybody but Ford Motor. </p><p>FARLEY:  Yeah, again, nothing's more important than people's relationship  with the brand. Ford's been in business for 116 years. That is -- we're a  very special brand. We understand the responsibility we hold, and the  bottom line is we have an opt-in policy. So all customers would be  completely transparent about their data with the company with the company,  but no, we don't sell the data. We don't use it. We don't share it with  other companies. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have to check.  Now we have to check on everybody because  the world is just new now and people don't understand, there's a lot of  stuff that you're getting when you're sitting there in the car. You're  hearing our conversations and there's all this technology that has led to  trouble. So we have to check there. Let me ask you about the Aviator being  available in a plug-in hybrid form with a classic gasoline engine. Tell us  about bringing that iconic luxury brand electric. </p><p>FARLEY:   It's a big deal for us. Lincoln has always been known for a  really comfortable ride and that electric power train, it really fits into  that grace and the quiet flight. This is going to be a plug-in electric but  it's the first vehicle we have a turbo-charged engine too. You don't have  to worry about the range, you can go all electric but on a longer trip you  don't have to worry about plugging in because we have a a twin turbo engine  at the same time. It's kind of the best of both worlds. We think that will  work for Americans. </p><p>KELLY: Hey Jim, this is Kevin Kelly and I think you're hitting on one of  the more salient points and that goes back to sort of fuel efficiency and  there's a lot of uncertainty right now against the rules or about the rules  right now, the fuel efficiency rules in this Administration. Is one of the  reasons why you came up with this hybrid SUV in a sense to accommodate  previous Administrations' policies about fuel efficiency? The state of  California is focusing on it. How does that impact your decision making  when you design trucks as well as SUVS? </p><p>FARLEY:   It's a great question. At Ford we're doubling down on our truck  and SUV line-up as well as Lincoln. We think that hybrid technology as well  as full electrification are really going to work for customers but our take  is a little bit different than you would hear from other companies. I'll  give you a couple examples. Our hybrid technology, we don't want hybrid  just to mean fuel efficiency only. For example, we're going to put hybrid  in the F-150 or the Mustang. For Mustang it will be for performance. For  the F-150, the hybrid is going to allow you to not have to have a generator  on the job site. We're looking to use electrification a little differently  than just fuel efficiency. We are investing $11 billion in a whole range of  fully electric vehicles; our first one comes out in 2020. And the plug-in  system in Lincoln is a big part of our strategy. It's not just compliance.  We're not looking at that electrification for compliance. We're looking at  it because we think we can give customers better capability, even in a  Mustang. </p><p>MCDOWELL: Jim, the Navigator, award-winning new SUV, tell us how sales are  going and can you keep up with that demand, because I know that was a  problem for Ford. </p><p>FARLEY: Oh, holy cow.  We have such incredible demand on the Navigator.  We're down to like I think it's 15 days on the lot, minimum. We're getting  most of the customers are new to Lincoln. The vehicle's very well-accepted.  All of our dealers are pushing us to build more and more. The whole team at  Ford is maximizing our production. Frankly, the reaction of the product has  been overwhelming. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.  I tried it. I absolutely love it, Jim.  Congratulations on the Navigator. I have to tell you the G.M. Escalade has  not lived up to expectations at all but this Navigator is a beautiful car  and great quality. I mean it. It's unfortunate. I have an Escalade, big  problems. Let me ask you about this, Jim -- go ahead. </p><p>FARLEY:  Sure. One of the things that makes Navigator really different is  the third row. We don't talk a lot about it and the new Aviator's a three  row vehicle. People want room in the third row and that's one of the  difference makers for Navigator.   It's not only great looking, has a great  interior, but the third row is useful. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you know how much the price of a car will go up if we see  increased tariffs? We're talking about the trade policy coming out of the  White House. Are you expecting the price of a car to go up with the tariffs  on aluminum and steel? </p><p>FARLEY:  Generally speaking, prices for vehicles have been going up the  last couple of years.  Yes.  Most -- almost all of our steel and aluminum  we buy at Ford of motor company for the U.S. is here in the U.S.   But the  tariffs that we're seeing will absolutely be a head wind for our costs.  Some of that will have to be passed on to customers. Yes, we see this as a  new cost to our company, our customers, even though we buy most of our  steel and aluminum almost all of it in the U.S. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So why, if you buy the aluminum and steel in the U.S., how come  there's a head wind? </p><p>FARLEY:   Because some of the steel and aluminum we buy is specific kinds,  high tensile where those plants are overseas, other places where frankly  there's no other place in the world to buy them. They're very specific  types of materials and that's going to drive costs. But frankly, commodity  costs as you know are going up anyways. Steel and aluminum have gone up in  general anyway.  It was a headwind for us last year for the business, it is  this year.  But the tariffs are going to add to that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has -- has the sort of shine on -- on autonomous been taken  off, given the recent events?  I mean, Jim, Waymo is unveiling a new  autonomous Jaguar at the auto show.  Ford is taking steps toward building  its own autonomous fleet.  What's your take on the self driving car today  in the wake of that Uber accident? </p><p>FARLEY:  It's really a good question.  You know, nothing is more important  for us than the safety of our customers.  We don't know all the data, what  happened with the accident.  When we get that, we'll evaluate it, what it  means.  </p><p>In our case for example, we have two safety drivers in all of our go  vehicles.  So different than other companies.  I can't really speak about  that, but as you said, Avi (ph) is a new technology.  It's a very important  technology for our industry.  </p><p>Ford is really leaning into this space.  But we're cautious.  You know,  we're 116 year old company.  We understand the responsibility the brand has  for safety.  And we're going to make sure that our technology is the right  technology from a safety standpoint.  The customers -- all of us have to  get used to you know, this new technology and it's a transition.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Jim, great stuff.   Congrats.  We'll be watching the auto show.  Thanks very much for the  preview. </p><p>FARLEY:  All the best.  Have a great morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jim Farley from Ford.  Great conversation there.  Really broad  base guys, thank you so much.  Coming up, a Utah trooper miraculously  survives after this.  Look at this.  A car crash sends him flying into the  air.  More of the shocking dash cam video coming up right after this.  </p><p>And yes, he did survive.  We will give you his condition coming up.  Then,  could less screen time make your kids happier?  The surprising study  linking teenagers moods to their digital devices, next. </p><p>(COMMERICAL BREAK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Terrifying moments caught on an officers dash  cam when he's hit by a car and sent flying in the air.  Cheryl Casone with  the details right now.  She's on headline.  Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  It's -- Maria, incredible.  That highway patrolman, Kade (ph)  Brenchly (ph) was slammed from behind by a car that was sliding on this  icing road.  As you can see here, it launched him several feet into the air  as he was walking towards another car that had been stuck on the side of  the road.  He suffered a few injuries, but by some miracle, he's actually  OK.  </p><p>He really just hopes the video serves as a reminder for drivers to slow  down and move over and be careful on icy roads.  Brenchly's (ph) a 13 year  veteran of the Utah Highway Patrol.  He's a father of four, he's a soccer  coach.  He suffered four broken ribs, a broken shoulder blade and had some  road rash as well, but he's OK.  </p><p>Well another headline we're following for you this morning.  Takeda kicking  the tires of rival drug maker Shire.  The Japanese company says it may make  an offer for the other company which has market value of about 40 billion.  </p><p>Takeda says acquiring Shire would help it expand its work in rare diseases  and drugs for attention deficit disorder.  The deal would also boost its  presence in the United States, Shire's stock is souring in the pre-market  on news of this deal, up more than 17 percent right now.  </p><p>Take a look at Takeda, the stock is down 7 percent so far this year.  Well  the Burger King, Carl's Jr. trying on publicity for Steven Spielberg's next  movie Ready Player One.  They wanted to change the name of their sliders to  Spielburgers, but.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP BEGINS) </p><p>(VIDEO CLIP ENDS)</p><p>CASONE:  OK.  So that was their plan, but there's a problem.  The director  went onto Twitter to politely ask them to stop.  </p><p>(VIDEO CLIP BEGINS)</p><p>STEVEN SPIELBERG, AMERICAN FILMMAKER:  Hey, there.  It's recently come to  my attention that Carl's Jr. wants to rename their charbroiled sliders  Spielburgers.  And they're pretty good, but I'm passing.  Cease and desist,  can't do it, sorry guys.  </p><p>(VIDEO CLIP ENDS)</p><p>CASONE:  OK.  Well Carl's Jr. says the Spielburgers are not on the menu, it  was just a social media stunt with a really great commercial.  OK.  Well  America may actually be able to run on Dunkin.  Dunkin Donuts teaming up  with Saucony, the shoemaker to create donut inspired running shoes.  </p><p>They're decorated with images sprinkles, coffee, and of course the Dunkin  Donuts logo.  They're $110 per share -- per pair, excuse me.  Share of the  Dunkin brands are down about 8 percent.  The Share, Maria.  But they're  only -- it's a limited edition shoe.  So they might be kind of tough to  get.  I'm going to try and actually get a pair.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They look good. </p><p>CASONE:  I'm a runner.  I'll run in some -- some donut sneakers.  I love  donuts. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Degans (ph) a runner, you in the market for new sneaks? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I used to wear Saucony for years, and they changed  design of them and I had leg injury.  So no on the Saucony. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, you don't like Saucony? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  But number two, how -- how ridiculous is it that it  essentially reminds people, you eat a donut, you need to go out and run 100  miles to work off that donut. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's true.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  There you go.  Be an ultra runner, an ultra  marathoner if you're going to eat dodos all day long. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Or just don't get the ones that are stuffed full of  cream and all that stuff. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  No.  Just dodos are generally.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Really, even the coolers (ph)? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  High in fat and calories pretty much.  Yes.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  But you don't like the sprinkles on the sneakers. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think that they're delicious to look at, but maybe  does the body good.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, not so much.  All right.  Thank you.  Cheryl, coming up,  Diamonds are forever, right?  What about a more permanent option when it  comes to an engagement ring?  Details on the new trend and the danger.   Back in a minute. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  OK how about this, instead of an engagement  ring, what about an engagement piercing?  Some people are saying I do to  diamond dermal piercings.  Diamonds are pierced into the finger where a  normal engagement ring would usually go.  Joining us now is Doctor Mikhail  Varshavski better known as Doctor Mike.  I imagine you have something to  say about this.  Putting foreign objects in your finger.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well look, I understand people want to get piercings, but I  just feel like putting a piercing on your hand is not a smart place to put  a piercing.  Number one your hands are so dirty.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's gross.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Second of all you're interacting with the world with your  hands, you're bumping into doorways, you're hitting the steering wheel with  your hand.  Imagine loosing a diamond just because you walk through a  doorway and hit your hand on it.  So I don't think this is smart.  Honestly  I don't know where this came from because I'm on social media and I haven't  seen this craze kick in.  So I hope this is one of those unique small  populations that are trying to do this.</p><p>KELLY:  I've got a better idea, why don't you just give someone your heart  for her(ph).  It's very romantic.  Yes, that's all you actually need to do.   Do something completely vain like this, I mean that just makes no sense.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes but what happens when you get divorced and you want the  stone back?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  I mean they can take it out, it's a small surgical procedure.   But again I don't know who's doing this because the hand is a dangerous  place.  You get a skin infection, it can easily travel to the bone and you  get an osteomyelitis, which is a bone infection.  That's IV antibiotics for  a long period of time.  Who needs this problem?  </p><p>KELLY:  There's going to be a bunch of millennia's running around with no  ring finger.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is worse then the millennial's eating the pods, the Tide  Pods.  I don't know what's worse.  They both .</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  I would just like to say there's millennial's with a Z and a  millennial's with an S.  We're talking about younger millennial's because I  represent the older millennial's and we would never do anything like this  or eat Tide Pods.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way you just got married.  Kevin Kelly you didn't  consider - putting a ring in as apposed to .</p><p>KELLY:  No. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  . putting a bag(ph) Kevin.  There's your beautiful bride.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Congratulations.</p><p>KELLY:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way - just by the way, buying an engagement ring is the  biggest waist of money and the dumbest investment that you will ever make  in your life because if you get divorced, you know what, the ring is maybe  worth 10 cents on the dollar.</p><p>KELLY:  But don't worry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the dude doesn't get it back.  The woman get's to keep it.</p><p>KELLY:  Well Mrs. Kelly doesn't need to worry about any of that, OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kevin that was not . way to be Debbie Downer David .</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I had to sell my first engagement ring on eBay OK. </p><p>KELLY:  Wow.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  10 cent's on the dollar for it.  Yes not a good thing.  OK good  point.  All right we've got this, a new study claims that teens who only  use smart phone and other digital media for less then an hour a day, are  happier then those who use it for longer.  Doctor Mike your take on that.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Social media isn't good when you over use it.  There is a  happy median and this study form the University of San Diego found that.   However this study found a correlation, meaning it found a relationship  that those who spend a lot of time on there phones are generally unhappier.  There's no cause and effect established here and we don't know that if  you're unhappy therefore you use your cell phone more or does using your  cell phone cause you to be unhappy.  Those are two very different things.   Now talking about social media, talking about alcohol, talking about even  sex.  Addictions cause on happiness.  So if you're going to be spending a  lot of time doing any of these task and it's causing dysfunction in your  life, you're going to be unhappy.  So this is not surprising to us in the  medical community.</p><p>KELLY:  Well of course not because these apps and the way they're designed  are forcing people - is a gamification(ph) right.  To get validation as  well as to - it has to do with chemical - I mean Face Book getting back to  it, ran studies to see how people would react to certain things.  I mean -  physiological studies to see how it impacts people.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Every time one of those heart emoji's pops up notifying you  that you have a like.  It lights up the reward center of your brain,  similar to that of cocaine.  It's the same reaction that occurs and that's  why people love seeing notifications, they love seeing those likes.  But  now for parents I think what the smart piece of advice is, is not  necessarily saying you only have two hours to use your cell phone in a day.   It's to create new activities that will force them to not use their cell  phones.

Good Wednesday morning,  everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is  Wednesday, March 28th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East  Coast.  Technology tanks stocks, the major indices tumbled yesterday,  weighed down by major tech names facing concerns over new regulatory  scrutiny.  The Dow Industrial down 345 points, 1-1/2 percent, the NASDAQ  211 points yesterday, that was almost three percent yesterday.  Among the  big losers, Facebook, Alphabet, Apple, which all turned negative for the  year.  The news comes as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly agrees now  to testify before lawmakers on Capitol Hill.  Markets this morning are  bouncing on the heels of that loss yesterday.  Dow Industrials now at the  high of the morning, up almost 70 points, up a quarter of a percent higher.   The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ also in positive territory.  We are waiting on the  final reading of the fourth quarter GDP.  It is due out in 30 minutes time.   Economists are expecting growth of 2.7 percent for the fourth quarter.  In  Europe this morning, right across the board although here too off of the  lows.  FT-100 just slipped into positive territory.  It's up two points  right now and the CAC quarante is down 32, two-thirds of a percent, the DAX  index is down 61, that's one-half of one percent, off of the lows.  In Asia  overnight, steep declines across the board.  Worst performers were Hong  Kong and Japan and Korea, down 2-1/2 percent on the Hang Seng.  The global  selloff comes amid a possible crackdown, speculation is mounting that the  White House is considering regulating Chinese investments in technology  companies.  Senator Lindsey Graham weighed in on taking action against  China.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  There's still everything you  bring to China, they manipulate the currency, they dump steel below market  value into the world economy and Trump said during the campaign, he was  going to push back.  He has.  And if the French and the Germans were smart,  they would join President Trump to change Chinese business practices.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The major implications for technology and the markets coming up  this morning.  New problems for Tesla.  The details as the National  Transportation Safety Board investigates yet another fatal crash.  And too  slow, the FBI Director Christopher Wray finally responds.  He says he will  double the number of personnel assigned to reviewing the GOP's request for  documents in the investigation of the Clinton e-mail investigation as well  as the FBI abuse and the firing of Andrew McCabe.  What you need to know  coming up this morning.  Saudi Arabia bets on solar.  The major investment  the country is making with SoftBank on a solar park in the kingdom.  Plus,  too sexy for the aisle?  Why Wal-Mart is removing cosmopolitan magazine  from the checkout lanes.  All those stories are coming up this Wednesday  morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen  McDowell, Benchmark Managing Partner Kevin Kelly, and the Wall Street  Journal Editorial Board Member, Fox News Contributor, Mary Kissel.  Great  show so far, you guys.  </p><p>MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Great to be  here, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you.  Good morning.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, KELLY AND COMPANY:  And we haven't covered  the Kim Jong-un meeting as much I would figured because I figure this is a  really big turning point in the relations between China and the United  States, given the fact that, you know, the South China Sea is a big  contentious issue, what's going on with Japan.  I mean, I think this is a  bigger deal than it's actually being played out.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  I don't know about  that, Kevin.  Maybe I'm just cynical because I've been covering this story  for so long both in Asia and here in the United States.  And I am telling  you, I am really glad that President Trump is keeping the pressure up on  North Korea.  That's exactly the right thing to do.  It's the only reason  that they're coming to the table.  But the idea that they're somehow going  to voluntarily give up nuclear weapons, that is a fantasy, an absolute  fantasy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think so.  Good op-ed in the Journal today by Robert  Zoellick.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Top 10 Tips for Negotiating With Kim Jongu Un.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you for saying that because I was just accused by one of  the viewers of being grouchy and grumpy this morning.</p><p>KISSEL:  No.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, pragmatic.  That's what I call it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KISSEL:  Well, let's learn some history here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Believe nothing that Kim Jong-un says.</p><p>KISSEL:  Republicans, Democrats, both sides of the aisle, they have  appeased this country for decades.  Look at where it's gotten us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're going to talk more about this this morning and we kick it  off this hour right now with this top story.  Investors are watching a  possible crackdown by the Trump administration on Chinese investments in  U.S. technology companies.  This coming as President Trump seals his first  trade deal with South Korea.  Adam Shapiro covering the story at the White  House right now with the very latest.  Adam, good morning to you.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  And a good morning to you,  Maria.  When President Trump last week signed the memorandum authorizing  the United States trade representative to come up with a list of potential  items for tariffs in regards to China, the administration also talked about  enhancing the ability of the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United  States, CFIUS over the Treasury Department to also crackdown on what the  administration calls the theft of intellectual property and the forced  transfer of technology to Chinese corporations.  Well, yesterday it was  apparent that one of the negotiating areas that's going on between Treasury  and China could possibly limit or end investment from China into technology  companies in the United States on technology which is still emerging, and  that was something that upset investors.  Wilbur Ross from the Commerce  Department actually talked about what is on the table and here's what he  said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF COMMERCE:  There will be  limitations on foreign investment.  As you know, the entity that regulates  foreign investment.  As you know, CFIUS which is the entity that regulates  foreign investment has new legislation pending both in the House and in the  Senate.  So that will be part of it.  And then some other action by the  President will be the other part of it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SHAPIRO:  And Maria, of course, the administration is touting the success  of its negotiations with South Korea.  We will limit imports of South  Korean steel.  It will be 70 percent of an average of their production over  the last three years as well as increasing the number of U.S. cars that can  be exported to South Korea.  Right now, every manufacture can export up to  25,000 cars.  It will go to 50,000 cars.  Critics point out that no  manufacturer in the United States has exported more than 11,000 cars in any  given year to Korea -- to South Korea at least but the administration is  calling this a victory.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Adam.  Thanks.  We will watch that.  Adam Shapiro at  the White House.  I want to turn now over the uproar over the census.  At  least 12 states now say they will sue the Trump administration to block the  administration from adding a question about citizenship to the 2020 census.   The Commerce Department says the question will help determine possible  violations of the Voting Rights Act and protect minority voting rights.   But Democrats say it amounts to a \"craven attack on our democracy.  Joining  me right now is the host of \"MICHELLE MALKIN INVESTIGATES\", CRTV.com,  Michelle Malkin.  Michelle, good to see you.</p><p>MICHELLE MALKIN, POLITICAL COMMENTATR:  You too, Maria.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are Democrats so up in arms about this?  It seems logical  to have that question in there.  </p><p>MALKIN:  It does.  And I think to most people in fly-over countries, the  idea of a country asking who is in it is something that should be basic.   But only in America will a Federal government get sued by states for asking  that basic question.  It is bizarre.  What it really is about is a power  grab.  It's about control over the electoral landscape because the census  is used to divvy up seats in the House based on a proportion of the head  count.  And then of course, it doesn't just affect those Congressional  districts because the Electoral College uses the size of Congressional  districts as well as a gauge.  And the thing that I think people are  missing in terms of context here is that dating back to the Carter  administration, the open borders lobby has used the annual census as an  argument to freeze immigration rates and ICE actions at worksites.  That  was the policy officially under Clinton.  It was the unspoken policy  through the Obama administration as well.  And what's happened is that you  have a Trump administration now that has showed at every level that it is  serious about immigration enforcement and finally for the first time when  the next census is taken, they are not going to be in charge and in  control.  They do not have the reins.  It's a $3 billion industry, if you  think about it.  That's what the census budget is.  I think people's minds  would be blown if they've know that.  And it's been a slush fund for a  number of left wing groups that are used as the census workers to go out  there and pound the pavement and do these questionnaires.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Michelle, I mean, you also have to be just, you know,  shocked at what's going on in California.  I don't know -- I don't know  about shocked but I mean, it's just a stunner.  Officials in Orange County,  California voting to join a lawsuit fighting the state's sanctuary city  laws hours after the county sheriff's department announced it will publicly  list release dates of inmate including those in the country illegally.   Here's what vice chairman of the county's board of supervisors told me  about the moves earlier on the program.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SHAWN NELSON, ORANGE COUNTY SUPERVISOR:  The board took action basically to  stand up for the people of Orange County, stand up for the sheriff and let  California know that despite their desires to release criminals into our  neighborhoods under the guise of being kind, that we weren't going to  tolerate that.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction, Michelle?  </p><p>MALKIN:  Well, there is somewhat of a new opt-out movement in California.   I don't know if it's too little too late.  But there are still pockets of  sanity.  Orange County is one of them, certain regions in San Diego County  as well.  We've already heard from a couple of localities including Los  Alamitos that are moving to pass ordinances to defy the sanctuary status.   Remember, there were three bills that were passed and signed by Jerry  Brown.  One of them dealt with worksite enforcement.  And the state  basically ordering private employers not to allow ICE onto their premises  which is just astounding that this is even legal.  And then the other two  dealing with detention and as the law enforcement officer just mentioned  about being able to notify the public when criminal illegal aliens are  about to be released, if they're not going to be picked up by ICE.  So you  have an anti-sanctuary sanctuary movement.  Again, I wonder if it's too  little too late and really the bottom line is, if these outlaw counties and  cities in places like San Francisco are not prosecuted for breaking our  immigration laws, for aiding and abetting illegal aliens, how does it stop.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  No.  I think this is -- this is really a stunning  story and we will of course be watching it.  Let me ask you about the FBI  news because finally the director of the FBI, Christopher Wray responds to  the subpoena which we told you about a week ago.  Now Wray says he will  double the number of staff members combing through documents to comply with  the request from Republicans for records on the investigation into the  Hillary Clinton e-mail server.  This move comes just days after House  Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte subpoenaed the Justice  Department to get those documents.  Here's what Goodlatte first told me  about obtaining the records right before he issued that subpoena.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY: We  need to have those documents.  The Department and the Bureau have been  slow, I would say now very slow in getting them to us.  The last time I was  on your program I expressed confidence that we would have those documents  forthcoming.  Here we are several weeks later, still don't have them.  So  this is coming to a head.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it is coming to a head.  And Christopher Wray now has  responded and he agrees, it's been slow.  </p><p>MALKIN:  Yes.  Thanks a lot.  You know, the F in the FBI has always stood  for foot-dragging when it comes to document production in FOIA request,  public records request.  This is something that the I.G. of the DOJ  currently, Michael Horowitz pointed out under the Obama administration.   They did it with fast and furious, they did it with the IRS investigation  and hide -- the hide and seek and run out the clock have been their M.O.   So finally you actually have somebody in FBI brass who is acknowledging  that.  But it took a long time, didn't it?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we don't have the documents yet.  So, let's not, you  know, jump the gun here.  </p><p>MALKIN:  True.  Yes, that's right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it is pretty extraordinary that they would just blow-off  the committee that has jurisdiction over them for so long and not produce  these documents, especially since the documents that we've had already  have, you know, shown all of these text messages that explain to us and  shown us the bias at the top of the FBI.  So, without the 3,000 pages we  would not have known that.  And without the I.G. report, Michael Horowitz.  </p><p>MALKIN:  Yes.  That's right.  Which I think it points to the fact that  there's so much more here and, you know, we've heard the cliche tip of --  tip of the iceberg.  And -- but that is, you know, anybody who is a  journalist who had to file public records requests know even at the local  level that public records acts are really seen as subvert the public and so  obviously, you know, you multiply that by thousands for the FBI.  I mean,  there are ongoing public records requests that have -- you know, date back  to 20, 25 years.  And thank god we have good watchdog groups like Judicial  Watch out there fighting these battles for us, you know, outside of the  Congressional Committees as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Michelle, thanks for weighing in on all that.  Great to see  you.</p><p>MALKIN:  You too.  Take care.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Michelle Malkin joining us there.  Coming up, SoftBank and  Saudi Arabia teaming up again, now to build the world's largest solar park.   We break down the $200-billion deal, they signed a memorandum of  understanding last night.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Futures erasing early losses.  A complete  turnaround here, Dow Industrials now expected to be up about 90 points on  the session when the market opens in about an hour and 15 minutes.  So  we're looking at money moving into stocks after that tough selloff  yesterday.  Meanwhile, a fatal crash of a Tesla Model X in California  prompting a Federal investigation.  Cheryl Casone with the story now.   Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  The National  Transportation Safety Board says it's conducting a field investigation to  determine whether the vehicle's semi-automated driving system was actually  engaged.  The driver died when the Model X SUV struck a barrier and caught  fire on a highway last week.  Shares of Tesla plunged more than eight  percent yesterday as you can see on your screen, 279.18.  This morning the  company's stock is lower in the premarket by more than two percent.  Well,  Saudi Arabia turning to solar power in a big way.  They've teamed up with  SoftBank to build the biggest solar park in the world.  SoftBank's founder  Masayoshi Son and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman sitting there with  you, Maria, has signed a preliminary agreement for the $200-billion  project.  They did this yesterday here in New York.  The venture is going  to create as many as 100,000 jobs and generate enough electricity to power  150 million homes.  It's part of the Prince's plan to reduce Saudi Arabia's  dependence on oil.  Shares of SoftBank have lost four percent so far this  year.  </p><p>Well, actor Corey Feldman says that he was stabbed last night.  Feldman  post a picture to Twitter about an hour or so ago saying that three men  pulled up and one attack him while he was sitting in his car.  Here's what  he tweeted.  I'm in the hospital.  I was attacked tonight.  A man opened my  car door and stabbed me with something.  Please say prayers for us.  Well,  security was distracted a guy in a car pulled up and attacked.  I'm OK.   According to Feldman, the LAPD is investigation the alleged as an attempted  homicide.  He believes the attack could be connected to a number of threats  made to him on social media.  Feldman has been outspoken for years actually  against alleged sexual predators in Hollywood.  Predators that go after  young actors like himself at one point in his life.</p><p>Well, Wal-Mart has decided to ban cosmopolitan from the checkout line at  its stores.  The National Center on Sexual Exploitation is actually  claiming credit for this, saying Wal-Mart made the decision following  conversations that they had with the organization.  The magazine is famous  for its sexy covers and giving out love and sex advice to women but the  NCSC calls it pornography and has been lobbying Wal-Mart to remove it from  the sight of children.  Cosmo has logged in the most profitable title for  publisher Hearse, maybe there's a reason for that.  Shares of Wal-Mart  slightly higher in the premarket, Maria.  Pornography.  Come on. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is crazy.</p><p>CASONE:  Really.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Removing Cosmopolitan from the aisles, what do you think?  </p><p>KISSEL:  I don't know.  They do run some kind of racy topics, don't they?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KISSEL:  Because I'm a regular reader of Cosmo --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- for the 70s.</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then there's this.  Mark Zuckerberg, guys, he will  reportedly testify before Congress on the Facebook data scandal.  How the  social media company responds to the scrutiny from Washington, next.  And  then the iPad gets a reboot.  The high-tech features from the new Apple  device that's under $300 for students.  Wait until you see it, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are watching Facebook this morning.  The  company announced this morning new privacy features allowing users to  download and delete data, should they want to.  This comes after CEO Mark  Zuckerberg reportedly agreed yesterday to testify before Congress over the  company's data practices.  The Senate Judiciary Committee wants him  questioned.  The stock is now in bare market territory of notice, trading  higher right now, it is down 20 percent from the most recent high which was  on February 1st.  The stock yesterday was down five percent.  This morning  it's bouncing about one percent.  Joining us right now GBH Insights Chief  Strategy Officer and head of technology research Daniel Ives.  Dan, good to  see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DANIEL IVES, CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER, GBH INSIGHTS:  Great to be here.</p><p>IVES:  You still like Facebook stock.  You're bullish on the stock despite?  </p><p>IVES:  Yes.  I mean, look, this has been the darkest chapter for Zuckerberg  in Facebook's 14-year history.  But we view it -- as what's really baked  into the stock is a draconian type of regulatory environment.  If you think  it's anything less caught slight to modest in our opinion, this is a  significant buying opportunity.  If you can navigate through these dark  clouds that are going to become over the coming weeks and months for  Facebook and Zuckerberg.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY:  I have a hard time with that given the fact that there's so much  uncertainty.  And one of the things that we don't know, what's going to  happen to management?  Will they separate the chairman and CEO role?   That's a real possibility.  Because Mark Zuckerberg can't even apologize or  be held accountable.  He was a v victim.  They were victims of this,  considering the fact that consistently cozied up to advertisers that have  done nefarious things on their platform post election.  Then all of a  sudden you're seeing the multiple compression, right?  Right now they're  still trading at 25 times earnings.  I'm having a hard time buying into  your thesis if they go from 25 to 20.  </p><p>IVES:  Look, I mean, there's no doubt.  Right now the bear's going to come  out of hibernation.  I mean -- and you're seeing it.  Ultimately we  factored if they lose 10 percent advertising revenue up five billion a  year. You fact that in, reduce the multiple, ultimately with $10.00  earnings power, 30 percent grower, I view it as a $180 to $190 stock.  To  your point has the upside been capped as you start to pick up from multiple  expansion?  No doubt.  And this has definitely been -- for Zuckerberg, it's  going to be a defining period.  When he goes on his sort of (INAUDIBLE)  sorry tour in front of Congress and others, that's going to be defining not  just for Facebook but for Alphabet, for Twitter.  You saw Twitter yesterday  for social media peers.  So this is really a game-changing fork in the road  situation.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We should just point out.  Twitter's stock fell 12 percent  yesterday.  </p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  They're getting slammed.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's a huge haircut for one day.  </p><p>KISSEL:  But there's longer term problems here for Facebook.  I mean,  Facebook's user growth has been slowing now for a while.  </p><p>IVES:  No doubt.  I mean, if you look at user growth, engagement, you get  to two billion users, 50 billion in advertising revenue, you're going to  hit a point right now where it starts to slow.  And that's also why Twitter  was starting to get sea legs, Snap continues sort of the up-and-down story.   But when you look at Facebook from a fundamental valuation, this is really  one way of using heavy-handed regulation, this is a game-changing move and  ultimately to -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're talking about 30 to 40 percent upside potential for this  stock?  Is that what you see? </p><p>IVES:  Oh, yes.  I mean, in our --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In what time frame?  </p><p>IVES:  In our opinion, over the next year we view this as a 30 percent  upside stock.  I'm not saying you're not going to (INAUDIBLE) roller  coaster over the coming weeks and months.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the charges?  I mean, how much -- how much money is  this going to cost Facebook?  Doesn't that cut into earnings?  </p><p>IVES:  Yes.  And look, when we factored in like in terms of FTC and some of  these other fines, if you factor in it's going to be in the hundreds of  millions of dollars, that's probably where we see FTC funds some of the  class action lawsuits.  But there's no doubt, if you look at Facebook right  now, this is one of those -- it's a fork in the road.  If you think this is  the start of just a game-changer to the model and fundamentals, to your  point, you don't own the stock.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick.  Instagram is owned by Facebook, so if Facebook, the  social media platform gets hurt, where does the traffic go?  Its goes to  Instagram and they also on WhatsApp, so that gives them balance.</p><p>IVES:  And that's -- and that's why even though from advertisers, it sounds  great when you say, I'm going to come off Facebook for a week?  You put the  P.R. out, you feel good.  Realistically, where are you going when it comes  down online, if it's Faceboook.  And ultimately, Amazon is probably a  beneficiary on the advertising model.  Because remember on FANG stock,  Netflix, Amazon are really insulated from regulatory headwinds.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  you're All right.  We will leave it there.  Well, you're  sticking your neck out, Dan.  Thanks.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Daniel Ives there.  Coming up, we've got the final reading of  the fourth quarter GDP due out in a few minutes.  Economists are expecting  growth of 2.7 percent.  Markets are up going into the numbers.  Dow  Industrials are expected to be up 90 points.  We're watching for any change  of that, ahead of the number. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday, March 28.   Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Stocks looking to  rebound.  We are waiting on the GDP number out momentarily.  The  expectations call for growth of 2.7 percent.  The number -- 2.9 percent is  the number that is better than expected, just hitting the tape.  This comes  after yesterday's route on Wall Street.  Right now, we're looking at  Futures up 100 points as the number hits the tape of 2.9 percent growth  better than expected.  Yesterday, the market was down nearly 400 points.   Take a look at the Dow Industrials down 344 points yesterday.  1.5 percent  lower, the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ also lower.  The NASDAQ hit hard yesterday.   Three percent lower.  But this morning, we're looking at money moving into  stocks and this fourth quarter GDP number right now is actually boosting  markets as it is up 2.9 percent.  Versus an estimate of 2.7 percent.  This  market is up fractionally from where we we're going in to the numbers.  Dow  Industrials expected to be up 114 points at the opening of trading this  morning.  The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ are mixed right now.  NASDAQ is slipping  back into negative territory by two points.  Joining us right now, is the  dean of the Columbia Business School and former chairman of the Council of  Economic Advisers, Glenn Hubbard.  Glenn, good to see you.  Thanks so much  for joining us.</p><p>GLENN HUBBARD, DEAN, COLUMBIA BUSINESS SCHOOL:  My pleasure, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just getting this final report on fourth quarter GDP on 2.9  percent growth.  Your thoughts in where we are in the economy right now.</p><p>HUBBARD:  Well, it's a number I expected.  I was looking for somewhere  between 2.9 and three percent.  I think the economy was going into this  year very strong.  Maintaining it will depend on the effects of the tax  bill, of a continued reset about expectations for growth.  But I think it's  a very good news number.</p><p>KELLY:  Glenn, you know, one of the interesting things I look at is the  durable goods report and it actually beat my expectations not only for  nondefense spending.  So, what are the reports you're looking at and where  are they showing growth for this year?  Because, you know, the durable  goods they came out on Friday were gangbusters.  That's leading me to  believe we're going to get above the three percent, maybe 3.5 percent  quarter this year alone.  What are you seeing for the first quarter this  year?</p><p>HUBBARD: Well, I think we've got a good news going in, as you say capital  spending is up.  And that's very promising.  That have been a weakness in  the recovery going in.  So, I think, that's all good news.  I think it  would be hard to imagine the economy growing three percent plus  consistently.  But being in that range doesn't strike me as odd at all. </p><p>MARY KISSELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Glenn, Mary Kissel here,  \"Wall Street Journal\", this Trump administration came into office just as  the business cycle was nearing its end.  Tax cuts really seem to give the  economy a boost but now there's a lot of concern on the trade front.  How  do you see that impacting growth going forward?</p><p>HUBBARD:  Well, I think a big impact right now, Mary, is uncertainty.  The  actual measures taken thus far like the steel or aluminum tariffs while  they're not good public policy have been fairly modest.  The China action  as well.  So, I think what business people are waiting for is, is this a  game changer or is this more rhetoric?  On the other side, their  renegotiation of the U.S.-Korea agreement, that looks pretty positive.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Glenn, it's Dagen McDowell, what about the rise and borrowing  cost, although we saw the yield on the ten-year treasury yesterday close  below 2.8 percent had been below that level.  I don't think since early  February.  Got a frontpage story in the \"Wall Street Journal\" today, that  the rate that banks pay to lend to one another.  LIBOR or the London  Interbank Offered Rate.  It's at its highest level in a decade.  And,  again, this rate is used to determine what -- the rate paid on about $200  trillion in loans globally.  How much of a headwind is that for economic  growth, particularly here in the United States?</p><p>HUBBARD:  Well, it's definitely a headwind.  But I think we have to step  back and ask, you know, why aren't rates rising?  They're rising because  it's a better growth environment.  We're rising because inflation is  getting back closer to where the Fed wants it to be.  So, I don't feel it  as a bad story as long as all of this is gradual.  As long as growth is  there, I think we're fine.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where is the growth?  Would you say, I mean, we're just two  weeks away from the first quarter earnings season and we're expecting  earnings for the first quarter to be up 16 percent.  Where specifically do  you see the most growth right now in this economy?</p><p>HUBBARD:  Well, I think we are seeing a rebounding capital spending  sectors.  Obviously, some weakness right now in the technology sector.  But  strong still in financial services, in health care, generally throughout  the economy with consumer spending.  So, I'm pretty optimistic.  Again,  what would worry me would be policy uncertainty or geopolitical events.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Don't we have that?  Don't we have policy uncertainty and GOP - - and also upset and uncertainty about the foreign story in terms of  national security?</p><p>HUBBARD:  What we do, and I think what we have to do is focus on what we  can control, which would be the policy uncertainty.  So, it'd be great to  see the administration focus more on its low frequency successes and less  on high frequency noise.</p><p>KISSEL:  But how are consumers spending all this money Glenn?  Mary again  from the \"Wall Street Journal\".  Aren't they taking out debt or they've  putting on credit cards, or is this coming out of savings?</p><p>HUBBARD:  It's out of savings, and that of course will require some  adjustment going forward.  Right now, consumers are more optimistic about  growth and wages.  If that optimism proves premature, obviously consumer  spending would take a hit.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, I think one of the things that we're kind of tiptoeing around  too is the strength the dollar last year.  The market was up 20 percent and  one of the reasons why is the dollar was down 10 percent, you're starting  to see that the dollar actually selloff here.  Is that good for the economy  going forward in the regards to, hey, what's going to -- for the stock  market right now.  It's not good necessarily for our trade deficits in our  exports.  But what is your take on the dollar and how it's going to weigh  on this market?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, by the way, you would have expected the complete opposite,  right?  If the economy is growing the way we think it is, you would think  that we would have a stronger dollar.</p><p>KISSEL:  And you think we'd want a stronger dollar.  They're talking down  the dollar, just remarkable.  Terrible idea.</p><p>HUBBARD: Yes, I agree with everything that's just been said.  I mean, first  of all, the dollar should be determined by market forces.  Those market  forces in my expectation should be pointing toward a higher dollar over the  short to medium term.  Obviously, a lower dollar does revise earnings and  help stocks.  But for the country as a whole, we should want the dollar in  market forces, and we should want a strong dollar, not a weak one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You would think.  Let me ask you about the Federal Reserve.   Growing speculation that rising inflation could force the Fed to increase  rates four or five times now?  Is this -- I mean, five times is pretty  aggressive out there.  What's your expectation?</p><p>HUBBARD:  I think five times sounds unlikely.  Three is clear --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think, I agree with you.</p><p>HUBBARD: -- four, perhaps, but I think the Fed is watching inflation rise,  but I don't think anybody expects inflation to suddenly snap out way beyond  two percent.  So, I think Chairman Powell and his colleagues are in a  gradual adjustment mode, and that seems like a good place to be.</p><p>KELLY:  Is there inflation, though?  I mean, that's one of the biggest  questions we're having on the street is that, you know, the PCE has  consistently come around 1.5, you know, we'll get an outlier here and  there.  Otherwise, CPI is not really trudging above two.  And so, I don't  know where there is inflation.  I haven't seen it come anywhere.  </p><p>HUBBARD:  Well, I think we will cross two percent in quarter PCE later this  year.  But I agree with you, I don't see inflation breaking out.  So, I'm  not one of these people worried about a sudden snap in Fed policy or indeed  in a long-term rates, which would be the sum of inflation on the real rate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Glenn, your thoughts on this deal with South Korea.  It eases  the steel tariffs and exchange for quotas on steel exports from South  Korea.  There's a provision as well to make sure not a country  intentionally devalues the currency for a trade advantage.  What do you  make of this new deal with South Korea this morning?</p><p>HUBBARD:  I don't think it's a bad deal.  I think that there was a lot of  uncertainty going into it because people didn't know what the  administration was trying to accomplish.  But I think it did make some  marginal improvements for the United States.  I Don't think we were even  selling cars at quite our quota before, so I'm not sure what the expected  gain will be.  But I think it's not a bad thing.  What I would urge the  administration to do is be clear about what the goals are when you go in  for trades, so that you don't create so much uncertainty.</p><p>KISSEL:  I don't agree with that at all.  I mean, we're again, we're moving  back towards managed trade.  We did this with Japan in the 1980s.  I mean,  what we did was extend protections for U.S. truck makers instead of forcing  South Korea to lower their tariffs.  There's no help here for our  agricultural market.  I mean, Glenn, this isn't expending market  opportunities.  This is managed trade.  How is this a good deal?</p><p>HUBBARD:  Well, I think it is a good deal for the sectors involved.  I  don't think it's the best deal that could be done.  I share your views that  we should move toward more openness.  But given where this administration  started, I'm actually pleasantly surprised.</p><p>KISSEL: Oh, so this is good from a low bar.  That's what you're really  saying?</p><p>HUBBARD:  Well, I didn't quite say it that way.</p><p>KISSEL:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If you're worried about protection policies from this White  House, like, a little bit of give is a lot (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>HUBBARD: Exactly.</p><p>KISSEL:  You know what?  Glenn, I'm wondering if this has anything to do  with South Korea and everything to do with the NAFTA negotiations that are  going on that we basically strong armed South Korea into protection for  certain industries so that they could pronounce a win and then go to the  NAFTA partners and say, hey, look, if you don't do what we want, we're  going to do what we did to South Korea.  We're going to do it to you.</p><p>HUBBARD:  That's possible.  The Korea issue of course is complicated  because it's not just the trade negotiation.  It's the obvious elephant in  the room of North Korea and those upcoming negotiations.  So, it's really  hard to see how they're connected.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well you know, I mean, at some point and it's like, any day  now.  NAFTA's off the table.  I mean, let's face it.  They have elections  in Mexico, and then we had the midterm elections here.  So, by the time  you're actually going to get back to the negotiating table on NAFTA is well  after November.  So, I don't know that we'll hear any headlines in terms of  NAFTA.  There's that uncertainty out there.  Let me ask you about the  Atlanta Fed, Glenn.  Because the president of the Fed in Atlanta told the  journal the tax cut and increased government spending.  Like, the recently  passed $1.3 trillion spending bill could put pressure on monetary policy.   What's your take on that $1.3 trillion spending bill and its impact? </p><p>HUBBARD:  Well, I think the spending bill was unwise.  It really is a  continuation of Congress's unwillingness to grasp the fiscal situation  we're in.  Whether it radically changes monitory policy, though, I would be  a little bit more questioning.  I think, the Fed will continue to gradually  increase rates.  The only reason it would change monetary policy is if  suddenly inflation snapped, or growth snapped out of a range.  I don't  really see that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll leave it there.  Glenn, great to have you on the program.</p><p>HUBBARD: My pleasure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Glenn Hubbard joining us there from Columbia.  Coming up, the  final meet on the fourth quarter GDP, shows growth of 2.9 percent.  Stuart  Varney has a thing or two to say about that, he's going to weigh in. </p><p>Then Apple takes a bite of the education market.  Where the company is  cutting prices on its new iPad for students.  Next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(AUDIO GAP) </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning,  Maria.  Well, right now we're watching two names.  And the first is  Walgreens.  Walgreens this morning right now we can see how it's trading.   But they came out profit beat, sales beat, and raising the forecast.  The  stock is up 2.3 percent and the forecast is what's good news here for  earnings.  They raised this guidance for 2018 and say they continue to see  growth.  That's what they expect for 2018.  And at least in part because of  the recent acquisition of Rite Aid.  Walgreens boots alliance up 2.3  percent, but it's been a real loser, and that is down 20 percent over the  last 52 weeks.  </p><p>Let's take a look at Apple this morning.  So, Apple this morning looking  down just slightly.  They did have a Goldman Sachs down cutting their price  target, which I'll explain in a moment.  The big news is the new iPads for  schools.  What's happened over the last five years is that Apple has  basically lost ground on the education market.  Google Chrome books are  huge, are up 60 percent right market share.  Microsoft has in the 20  percent range and Apple has slipped.  So now they're putting out this new  iPad.  It's going to be cheaper for the schools.  Instead of 329, to be  299.  It will have a stylus pen, which is only available on the highest  Apple iPads.  So that will be instead of 89 -- $99, it will be $89.  By the  way, Goldman Sachs lowered their iPhone sales forecast for the March of  June quarters.  Putting a new price target of 159.  Much more.  MORNINGS  WITH MARIA coming up after the break. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we got the number as we're reporting the U.S.  economy grew by 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter.  That is the final  reading out this morning.  Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"   Stuart Varney with some thoughts there.  Stuart, good morning to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Am I as surprised as you, or  are you as surprised as I am?  Because I wasn't expecting 2.9.  That's  pretty close to three percent growth, originally reported I think, back in  2.5, something like that.  That's a very solid rate of growth.  Now, here's  my surprise not just at that solid rate of growth but at the market  reaction.  I see interest rates as in the ten-year treasury down at 2.76  percent.  Why so low?  Having recently touched 2.9, why are we at 2.76 when  we've just got a nice, strong report on the economy?  Why did Futures go  from a gain of 90 to a gain of 48?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>VARNEY:  How come that happened?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm wondering if it's this idea that rates are going to go up  five times do I.  I find that extraordinary, five interest rates hike this  year.  What do you think?</p><p>VARNEY:  I suppose that's what's in the cards given the strength in the  fourth quarter last year.  But I'm just no good at predicting what the  Fed's going to do.  You know me, Maria.  I don't do much on the Fed.  I  have a buzzer if I start running on about the Fed.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right, you're right.</p><p>VARNEY:  If you're -- if you're really talking about five rate increases  this year.  If that's what they're talking about, no wonder Futures are not  performing really well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well that, I'm just trying to come up with an explanation of  why the market went from up 100 to up to 50.  Because, I think you're  right.  This is a solid growth story.  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Some of this is going to be end of quarter putting some lipstick  on that portfolio and pulling back on these tech stocks --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and reallocating to a safer asset, particularly going into a  long weekend where the bond market closes midday on Thursday, I think it's  closed on Friday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, stock markets are close on Friday as well.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, the market's closed Friday.  It's supposed to be three-day  weekend.  But you know, Dagen's right there.  The focus of the market this  morning is not economic growth.  It's not the Fed.  It's not interest  rates.  It's technology stocks.  They're still under pressure.  They are  under attack starting with Facebook.  And I, think that's what's doing it  to the overall market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  End of quarter positioning. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Technology 25 percent of the S&amp;P at early February that was the  highest percentage it's been since the dot-com bubble blew up back in 18  years ago this month.</p><p>KELLY:  Just to get to GDP, I just want to point out the fact that this is  a great number before tax cuts started to take effect.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>KELLY:  I mean, you had people spending money.  (CROSSTALK) It was the  household spending number is what led this to 2.9 percent.  So, if you  think about that, that's before people even got those $1,000 bonuses from  the corporations.  So, this is leaning toward an even better number for the  Q1 here.  So, I think, the market is actually trying to digest this.  If  we're getting these great numbers before the policies took effect, what  kind of numbers are we going to get for Q1 and the rest of this year.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p>VARNEY:  The Trump growth agenda rolls on, does it not.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly, and we got the jobs number out a week from Friday.   So, let's see what that number is.  And of course, first quarter earnings  are going to start, Stuart, and they should be good. </p><p>VARNEY:  They better be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you in about eight minutes, Stuart.  </p><p>VARNEY:  You will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins half of the hour,  right after mornings with Maria.  But first, will President Trump's tariffs  on steel and aluminum impact the oil industry?  Jeff Flock is live at the  New York International Auto Show with some answers.  Jeff.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  And we have news on that  this morning, Maria in an interview with Scott Keogh of Audi here  exclusively on the FOX Business Network this morning.  I'll get to that in  the moment, but first, I want to show you the most important unveil.  No,  it's not the Camaro Hot Wheels 50th version, I just showed you that because  it's kind of fun to look at.  But take a look at the what I think it's the  most important unveil of the show, that is the Toyota RAV4.  Why is that  the most important unveil of this show?  Because other than the pick-up  trucks, the F150 and the Chevy's and the rest, that is the best-selling  vehicle in America.  They sold 400,000 of those last year.  And despite the  fact that it was an old version, this new version is out now.  So, people  love the SUVs, and I think SUVs are the star of the show this year.  If you  take a look at the numbers, SUV sales in the U.S. this last year up six  percent.  Cars down almost two percent.  There you go.  </p><p>Now onto the news.  That is on tariffs.  We talked to Scott Keogh of Audi.   You know, automakers are unsettled about this.  Not only the steel tariffs  and the aluminum tariffs but the potential of trade war.  Here is what  Scott Keogh told us on FOX Business this morning about his fears about  trade war.  Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCOTT KEOGH, PRESIDENT, AUDI:  And I think a lot of this back and forth  starts to put doubt into the system.  You've seen the doubt a little bit  with how the stock market responded and doubt is not a good thing for the  business.  We believe in free trade.  We believe America competitiveness  because when you're competitive, you have the best workers, you make the  best products, and you win the day.  So, that's what we believe in and, of  course, the details, event flows, let's see where it goes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FLOCK:  I leave you, Maria, this is the VW Atlas.  They have a concept.   They're about to unveil, and the rumor has it, and we are going to only say  that much, they will unveil a pickup truck.  A VW pickup truck concept.  I  talked to VW earlier.  They said that's a very patriotic space, but they  think maybe they can play in it.  Interesting.  See if they can get one  that would sell, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jeff, do you think one of the reasons for the pickup and SUV  sales is the price of oil?  Maybe when gasoline comes down, people feel,  well, then I will go big again instead of going for the smaller, electric  cars.</p><p>FLOCK:  I talked to Scott Keogh, and I said what do you think?  And he said  you know, with fracking and everything else going on around the world, I  think I'll be retired before we have $4 gas again.  He doesn't plan to  retire any time soon, by the way.  So, FYI.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well look, the fact (INAUDIBLE) are in New York this week, and  I can tell you for sure, that they're saying $100 oil is going to look  cheap in the coming years.  I don't know.  It feels like $100 oil is off  the table with the supply coming out of the U.S. but --</p><p>KELLY:  Well yes, the Saudi's are also -</p><p>FLOCK:  There's going to be a lot of SUVs and trucks sitting around.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>FLOCK:  If that's the case.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, the Saudis are capitulating doing a deal with the Russians on  a 10 to 20 year cooperation.  But, Jeff, I'm more interested in this Toyota  RAV4 situation that you would brought up.  The best-selling sort of mini- crossover, is there any indication why?  </p><p>FLOCK:  Isn't that amazing.</p><p>KELLY: Yes, is there any indication why that is?  Have you gotten any color  on that?</p><p>FLOCK:  Well, people -- especially with the gas prices as they are and, of  course, RAV4 gets pretty good mileage anyway.  You know, people have just  gone away from cars.  There's plenty more room in these vehicles, if you've  got kids, whatever you're doing, the SUVs work, you know?  It's the station  wagon of the new age.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mama McDowell -- Mama McDowell, can sum up in one sentence why  people buy SUVs and pickup trucks.  I can see out of it that's why people  buy them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They don't like little cars.</p><p>FLOCK:  Thinking high, they like to be high.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I'm flying high and I can see -(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rather than sitting deep into a Sevan.  That's absolutely  right.  Jeff, thank you.</p><p>FLOCK:  Like always great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jeff Flock at the International Auto Show in New York.</p><p>Coming up final thoughts from the officer panel.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, final thoughts of officer panel.  Kevin Kelly.</p><p>KELLY:  Earning season is going to be -- do very well.  It's coming up in  the next couple of weeks.  We'll hear from bank first.  That's going to  lead the rally higher.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  60 percent earnings good, (INAUDIBLE) Mary.</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes that's true.  And I just want to make a quick note about  trade, Maria.  The White House is going to come out and really try to sell  this deal with South Korea.  Don't buy it, they're going to talk about the  trade deficit.  As if it's a problem.  It's not, this is not a market  opening.  This is managed trade, it's the wrong way to go.  Sorry  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, you are not liking that deal.</p><p>KISSEL:  I don't.</p><p>KELLY:  Kissel the missile.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And this real quickly, thank you to John Paul Stevens, former  Supreme Court Justice.  For actually proving to people who believe in the  second amendment.  That the left does want to take it away.  Give me a  pickup truck with a Gun Rock.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, Dagen McDowell, whacking it up.  All right, Dagen, Mary,  great to see everybody.  Thank you so much.  Kevin, (INAUDIBLE) take it  away.</p><p>KELLY:  I will.  Thanks, Maria.  Crunch time the big tech.  They led the  market rally.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Thanks so much we'll  see you in a little while.  Good morning everybody, thanks for joining us,  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Happy Wednesday, it is Wednesday March 28th.  Your  top stories right now, 6 A.M. on the East Coast.  Technology taking it's  toll, stocks stumble yesterday, weighed down by major technology names.   Facing concerns over new regulatory scrutiny.  The Dow Jones industrial  average was down 344 points, down one and a half percent.  Along the top  loser's yesterday, Facebook, Alphabet and Apple which all turned negative  for the year. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The news coming as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly agrees to  testify before lawmakers on Capital Hill.  Facebook down another 5 percent.   Future this morning, looking like this, we're looking at weakness at the  trading this morning.  Dow industrial set to open down about 50 points.   NASDAQ also down 45 points right now.  Investors are watching for the final  reading of the fourth quarter GDP that is due out at 8:30 A.M. eastern.  We  are expecting growth of two point seven percent.  That is the economist  estimate.   </p><p>For Europe this morning right across the board, take a look at the European  embassy's(ph) FT 100 down two thirds of one percent and the CAC cost(ph)  and the DAX index both down better than 1 percent right now.  In Asia over  night, similar stories, steep declines across the board.  Worse performers  is Hong Kong, HANG SENG index down two and a half percent.  The global sell  off coming amid a possible crack down.  Speculation is mounting that the  White House is considering regulating Chinese investments in technology  companies.  Senator Lindsey Graham waiting on taking that action against  China. </p><p>LINDSEY GRAHAM:  They steal everything you bring to China, they manipulate  the currency, they dump steal in a below value into the world economy and  Trump said during the campaign he was going to push back.  He has.  And if  the French and the Germans were smart, they would join President Trump to  change Chinese business practices.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Then major implications for the sector and the markets coming  up this morning.  The trade deal secured, President Trump making moves,  reaching an agreement with South Korea, his first deal since taking office.   We are breaking down the deal as the commander in chief makes good on yet  another campaign promise.  And new problems to report for Tesla.  The  details as the National Transportation Safety Board investigates another  fatal crash.  The stock down (ph) another two percent this morning.  </p><p>Too slow.  FBI Directory Christopher Wray says he will double the number of  personnel assigned to reviewing the GOP demanding documents in the  investigation of the Clinton e-mail investigation, FBI abuse and the firing  of Andrew McCabe.  We'll tell you what's next after that subpoena got  things moving.  And then talk about a d'oh-nut.  Springfield coming to  Krispy Kreme with Simpsons themed pastries.  </p><p>All that coming up this morning.  And joining me to talk all about it this  (ph) Fox Business hour is Dagen McDowell, Benchmark managing partner Kevin  Kelly and the Wall Street Journal's editorial board member, Fox News  contributor Mary Kissel.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, JOURNALIST, FOX BUSINESS NEWS:  D'oh.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I knew she was going to do that.  That's good.  Thank you.   Thank you so much.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  You didn't do too bad a job  yourself.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  Hey, welcome back from -- from the wedding.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Thank you very much.  I missed you guys, but -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We missed you.  Yes.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, but it worked out.  I got to tear up the dance floor, you  know.  It was -- it was perfect.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How's the missus?  </p><p>KELLY:  She's doing exceptionally well.  She's -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congratulations.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Yes.  It's -- this is -- it's called perseverance, 12 years a  love story in the making.  I mean, it -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  12 years.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  Wow (ph).  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Wow.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Yes, so -- so -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He's really in love.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's patient.  She's a keeper.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Yes, she's great.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot on the table this morning to discuss, you guys.  We got  trade, we got the market sell-off.  Lot of uncertainty over there.  </p><p>MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Yes, lot of  uncertainty and a lot of fake news about this trade deal, too, Maria.  I  hope we're going to get into that.  It's not exactly I think what the White  House is selling.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that right?  </p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll talk about that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then also questions about Facebook going forward, it's  profitability, how much is it worth.  It's really hard to put a number on  it.  If you have users leaving or spending less time on the service and  advertisers turning their back on Facebook, potentially.  Again, that's a  big question mark and it's certainly weighing on the broad market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is -- this is the real first test that we've seen for this  company in terms -- you're right, valuation, but also the sustainability,  if people are worried about user data.  </p><p>KELLY:  They -- they really -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mark -- Mark -- Mark Zuckerberg didn't invent anything.  We kept  playing that sound bite from Steve Jobs.  He didn't invent anything, just  preyed on our desire to be liked.  It's a -- it's an advertising vehicle.   He just did a better job than Classmates and Tripod and Geocities.  I date  myself, but thank god I am close to 50, because I actually remember a lot  of these companies that tried to do what Facebook did.  </p><p>It's at 2 billion users.  How much bigger can it get?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If (ph) those people spend less time on that service, those --  those earnings are going to be a lot lower than people think.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And boy, did investors react yesterday.  That is our top story  right now, the technology sector taking a beating.  A steep sell-off in  tech stocks yesterday pulled U.S. markets sharply lower with the DOW  closing down nearly 400-points.  One day after the indices posted their  best day in more than two years.  Technology stock has come under pressure  amid concerns over increased government scrutiny in the wake of privacy  questions surrounding Facebook.  </p><p>All this coming amid speculation that the Trump administration is  considering a crackdown on Chinese investments in U.S. technologies by  using a law reserved for national emergencies.  Joining us now to weigh in  is director of defense studies at the Center for National Interest and the  executive editor of National Interest Magazine, Harry Kazianis.  Good to  see you, Harry.  Thanks very much for joining us.  </p><p>HARRY KAZIANIS, DIRECTOR OF DEFENSE STUDIES, CENTER FOR NATIONAL INTEREST:   Good morning, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So let's start first with the crackdown on Chinese investments  in technology.  We know that China has participated in 10 percent off  venture deals in the U.S. in the last five years.  Your take on what could  happen in terms of China investing in U.S. companies.  </p><p>KAZIANIS:  Maria, I think there being some sort of restrictions is a very  practical and an important step.  I think if we look at the history of  Chinese actions, really over the last 10 years and things they've done to  the United States, not just economic but geopolitical, there had to be some  restrictions.  You know, being in the defense sector, looking at this from  that perspective, we look at some of the things the Chinese done in terms  of stealing a lot of our defense intellectual property.  </p><p>They've hacked in and stolen our aircraft carrier designs, the V-22 Osprey,  the F-35, which is a trillion dollar defense program.  So when you look at  it from that perspective, there has to be some restrictions.  And then we  talk about the technology of the future, things like 5G, A.I.  If Chinese  companies were to come in and essentially, you know, buy parts of U.S.  companies or get into joint ventures and then take that technology, we're  essentially giving away our economic future to China.  And I think that  would be a big mistake.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, I know that we have CFIUS, Mary, and that really  does regulate the -- whether or not we should see ownership of American  companies.  But at the same time, China has such strict situations with  regard to American investing there.  And we don't have anything like that.  </p><p>KISSEL:  No, I mean look, our tariff barriers are very low compared to  China.  And China also has a lot of barriers that are not set in stone or  formalized, right?  They -- they say well, you know, if you come here and  you really want to get in, you have to give us 51 percent control and we to  have a communist party member on your board in China, things like that.  </p><p>So Harry's absolutely right.  There are a lot of problems here.  Harry, my  question to you is what is strategic?  You know, I understand that we don't  want investment in dual use technologies, defense, certain  telecommunication industries, but where else does this go?  Does it go to  energy companies?  I mean, what's the limit here?  </p><p>KAZIANIS:  I think the thing that I worry about most, Mary, is technologies  of the future.  Like I was saying, 5G could be a revolutionary technology.   I mean, most of us at home are getting -- you know, on our internet speeds,  about 100, 150 megs per second.  That is the speeds of -- of 5G over  cellular networks.  That could be revolutionary in terms of self driving  cars, medical devices.  </p><p>And in terms of, you know, strategy and -- and overall geopolitics and  intelligence, if the Chinese were to gain footholds in those arenas, the  amount of intelligence they could gather would be astronomical.  Now, I  don't want to sound like I'm panicking over, you know, what the Chinese can  do in terms of intelligence capabilities, but I think we have some very  real concerns when you combine that, in terms of all of the geopolitical  things the Chinese have done over 10 years.  </p><p>So I think it's good to be cautious, I think it's something that we have to  do.  But we have to remember, the U.S. China relationship is changing,  really since the fall of the Soviet Union in1991.  This relationship was  begging to be changed.  I mean, one of the reasons why America and China  actually came together in the first place is because of the Soviet Union.  </p><p>When the Soviet Union collapsed, there was always going to be some sort of  inevitable change, but it was always economics that brought us together.   Now it's actually -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just want to (ph) point out, Kevin, one -- one thing that Devin  Nunes told me on Sunday is not only are we dealing with these economic  issues with China, but right now, they're buying up a lot of infrastructure  across the world.  They're investing in these countries and then getting a  sealine position and setting up military bases right there.  This is  another thing that this administration is watching over (ph).  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, especially in Africa, right?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  </p><p>KELLY:  In -- in -- in Djibouti.  And I think one of the -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>KELLY:  -- important things to note is that China is going to get this 5G  technology whether we like it or not, right?  And one of the -- the things  this administration has done is block the Broadcom deal with Qualcomm.  The  issue actually has to do with will we have that infrastructure, that  technology?  Are we going to have access to it in times of national  defense?  And I think that's the biggest -- biggest question.  </p><p>If -- if we don't have access to it and only the Chinese do, if they're  scooping up U.S. companies, that's the biggest issue.  But I think the -- I  think one of the things we're tiptoeing around is North Korea.  I mean,  China is completely enabling North Korea and a lot of their weaponized  attacks across the world, whether it's in South Korea, here.  </p><p>So the only way North Korea survives and thrives is through China.  Now, do  you think that's one of the biggest conflicts of interest that we're having  right now with China and their technology?  Harry?  </p><p>KAZIANI:  I do.  I do.  And I -- and I think the -- the point on North  Korea is so key here.  I mean, no wonder the -- you know -- Kim Jung-un is  going to, you know, meet with Xi Jinping so early, in terms of having  multiple different summits and whatnot.  And I think when we talk about  issues on the Korean Peninsula and how this all comes to play, I think it's  extremely important for the United States to continue making sure that we  apply maximum pressure on both of those countries.  </p><p>Because there's a relationship where essentially North Korea feeds off  China, but China also feeds off North Korea.  And I think as long as we're  ensuring that pressure on both sides is being maintained, I think that's  the smartest way to go.  So I -- I think all of these situations we're  talking about, the recalibrating of the U.S. China relationship, North  Korea, it's all one big pot that we have to worry about.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We always talk about the big picture in terms of the U.S. and  China and China's investment in technologies.  There's a story in the Wall  Street Journal that pinpoints how it does effect mama and daddy, if you  will, in -- in rural parts of America.  </p><p>And a lot of smaller telecomm companies have relied on gear made by Huawei,  the bigger company since 2012 because there was a fear -- there was a  congressional report done -- there was a fear that China would exploit that  technology being in the United States in order to spy or even hack into our  data networks.  </p><p>But smaller telecomm companies have relied on that very gear because it's  cheaper.  And there was an -- the FCC put out a proposal on Monday that  might -- that will likely restrict these smaller companies drawing on this  $8.5 billion government-run fund to build out these rural networks.  So  again, there are broad implications for these rules that are sent out of  Washington.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And -- and the administration is watching each of these  nuances.  Meanwhile, we've got to talk about this. The state media has  reported -- the Chinese state new media reporting that North Korean leader  Kim Jong-un did in fact make a surprise visit to Beijing to meet with  President Xi Jinping. </p><p>The North Korean leader reportedly told his Chinese counterpart that  Pyongyang is committed to denuclearization, and is willing to talk to U.S.  officials.  President Trump just tweeted about this moments ago, want to  get this tweet out right away. </p><p>Here's what the president just said, for years and through many  administrations, everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the  Korean Peninsula was not even a small possibility. </p><p>Now there is a good chance that Kim Jong-un will do what is right for his  people and for humanity.  Look forward to our meeting.  And of course, we  know that the president is planning on meeting the head of the North Korea  in may, Harry, do you -- do we know what Kim Jong-un would want in exchange  for potentially giving up his nuclear weapons?</p><p>Do we believe that he even would consider such a thing?</p><p>KAZIANIS:  Well Maria, that's the golden question in this whole situation.   What does Kim Jong-un want?  I think at a bare minimum, he's going to want  some sort of peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, some sort of  diplomatic recognition by the United States, potentially as much as  hundreds of billions of dollars in economic assistance. </p><p>That might be one of the reasons he actually went to China.  He -- he is  going to demand a lot, but we're also going to demand a lot.  We're going  to need to have really tough inspections to go in and make sure the North  Koreans are actually living up to the deal. </p><p>But (ph) even gets worse, I mean do they give up their chemical weapons or  missiles?  We have a lot of questions this morning and not a lot of  answers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mary Kissel, you're not buying it, and you're -- and you're  also not buying this first major trade deal with South Korea.  We spoke -- </p><p>KISSEL:  No, but just first -- first on this North Korea meeting, Kim Jong- un's goal here, Maria, is to combine the two Koreas and to have North Korea  run South Korea, that's the goal.</p><p>He wants to eject U.S. troops from the Korean Peninsula, he is never going  to voluntarily give up his nuclear program.  The only way that North Korea  talking to China is a good thing is if China is brokering a deal to take  Kim Jong-un and put him into exile in Monaco or some prison somewhere in  the world. </p><p>That's the only way that that's going to be a good -- a good meeting. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I just think that China reinserted itself real quick on this  deal, why aren't you buying this up (ph) (inaudible).</p><p>KISSEL:  So Trump administration says that this is great for free trade,  this is not market opening, this is called manage trade.  This is called  managed trade, this is where we're going back to the 1980's where we're  trying to set quotas and limits on how certain goods move between  countries.</p><p>It's not market opening, it -- it's not good for trade, it rewards certain  industries, in fact, I'd say it's a little bit of a swamp coming back to  Washington. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, all right, we'll keep watching that.  Harry, great to have  you this morning, thanks so much for your insights. </p><p>KAZIANIA:  Thanks for having me, guys. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Harry Kazianis there, coming up the NTSB launching a probe into  a fatal Tesla crash, whether the automated driving system is to blame.  The  impact on the brand, the company, the stock, which had another tough day  yesterday, this morning it is down again.  </p><p>The FBI and the GOP leaders need to agree on one thing, the response to  demands to turn over documents on alleged abuses at the agency has gone way  too slow.  Find out how the director is picking up the pace after that  subpoena from Bob Goodlatte, back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERICAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump is tweeting this morning.  Guess  (ph) what he just sent out, the second amendment will never be repealed, as  much as democrats would like to see this happen and despite the words  yesterday of former Supreme Court Justice Stevens, no way. </p><p>We need more republicans in 2018 and must always hold the Supreme Court.   Meanwhile there's this, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg decides to testify  before Congress.  </p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now, finally he says he's going to do it. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, ANCHOR:  Yes, I mean we were kind of wondering what he was  going to do.  Zuckerberg is now expected to face pretty tough questions  about the companies handling of user data.</p><p>This entire controversy started after British political consulting firm  Cambridge Analytica -- excuse me -- allegedly misused the personal data of  50 million Facebook users.  So Facebook stock actually dropped nearly five  percent yesterday over worries about more regulation, stocks down 15  percent for the month of March. </p><p>This makes it the worst month for this stock since July of 2012.  This  morning, again, stock to watch is down on the pre-market, it's come back a  little bit, but is down more than half a percent. </p><p>We should say that it -- he is still declining to talk to British  lawmakers.  Maria, so he'll talk to those here in the United States.   (Inaudible) investigators are looking into another fatal crash involving  the Tesla that happened last Friday in California. </p><p>National Transportations Safety Board says it not clear if the car's  autopilot was on at the time.  The Model X caught fire after it hit a  highway barrier and was struck by two other vehicles, one man died as a  result of this crash.</p><p>Tesla stocks plunged eight percent yesterday, we should say, and shares are  lower in the pre-market, nearly two percent to the downside right now.   Well let's stay in the car theme, because Uber is putting the breaks on its  driverless car testing in California.  </p><p>They are temporarily suspending all testing after a woman was killed by one  of its cars while crossing the street in Tempe, Arizona.  Cameras show the  safety driver, who we later found out was a convicted felon, looking down,  away from the road at the time of the crash. </p><p>This is the video, Uber says it will not renew its permit in California to  test the vehicles for the foreseeable future.  Also in California, Uber  reaching a $10 million settlement in a discrimination lawsuit. </p><p>Two women engineers accused Uber of gender and racial discrimination, they  claimed that Uber's employee ranking system favors men and white or Asian  employees.  According to filing, the settlement compensates for financial  and emotional harm, to about 285 women and 135 men of color. </p><p>And I'm going to leave you with this, something a little brighter, in an  ode to Homer Simpson, we love him, Krispy Kreme is releasing a real life  version of Homer's favorite donut. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  So you like donuts?  Well have all of the (ph) donuts  in the world.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>That's a lot of donuts.  The Simpson's donut is a glazed donut then they  dip it in strawberry flavored white chocolate truffle, that's how it's  iced, and then there's rainbow sprinkles on top. </p><p>You can't get them in the U.S., this is very frustrating, they're only  available in Australia.  Thanks a lot Krispy Kreme. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I guess that means you didn't bring any?</p><p>CASONE:  Well you know I would have (inaudible) get my hands on them. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.  The president just tweeted this, we want to  get this out here, he says this, received message last night from Xi  Jingping of China that his meeting with Kim Jong-un went very well and that  Kim looks forward to his meeting with me. </p><p>In the mean time, and unfortunately, maximum sanctions and pressure must be  maintained at all costs.  The president just -- it's important to not that  John Bolton, now the -- his national security advisor, was behind the --  the Bush administration effort to basically intervene and prevent the  transfer of weapons material, the anti-proliferation measures that were put  in place during the Bush administration, so (inaudible) ...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes, proliferation security initiative very good, and he also saw  appeasement up close, spoke out very strongly against it during the Bush  years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very important.</p><p>McDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right (ph), we'll keep following that.  We'll take a break.</p><p>When we come back, a New York City Firefighter is laid to rest yesterday  after being killed on a movie set.</p><p>Meanwhile, actor Edward Norton's production company is facing a multi- million dollar suit because of that blaze.</p><p>Plus, Rosanne reboot getting political.  The NBC show taking a page from  real life with major support for the president.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, the FBI is finally responding to Bob Goodlatte's  subpoena.  He's doubling up.  </p><p>FBI Director Christopher Wray is doubling the number of personnel assigned  to responding to the House subpoena for documents relating to the ongoing  Hilary Clinton investigation, the FBI abuse controversy and the FBI's  internal recommendation to fire former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.</p><p>This comes after House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte issued a  subpoena for those documents.  He told me he would on Sunday Morning  Futures - about the slow response, and he asked about the next move, as I  asked him about the subpoena.</p><p>He issued the judicial proceeding days later.  </p><p>(VIDEO BEGINS)</p><p>BOB GOODLATTE, REPRESENTATIVE, REPUBLICAN:  The department and the Bureau  have been slow - I would say, now, very slow - in getting them to us. </p><p>The last time I was on your program, I expressed confidence that we would  have those documents forthcoming, and here we are several weeks later,  still don't have them, so this is coming to a head.</p><p>(VIDEO ENDS)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is former Special Assistant to President  Trump, former Press Secretary to Vice President Pence, and today (ph) RNC  consultant Mark Lauder (ph).  Mark, good to see you.  Thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p>MARC LOTTER, RNC CONSULTANT:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think they're going to get these documents?  I mean it's  absolutely extraordinary to me that they requested 1.2 million documents,  and they've only been given 3,000.</p><p>LOTTER:  I do think they'll get the documents.  It's an enormous request,  and having worked for many different government agencies, these take a lot  of time and a lot of manpower to get through.</p><p>But I think it's also very good that the - that the FBI recognizes the  problem, and they're dealing with it by doubling the staff.</p><p>I mean this is a public relations nightmare for the FBI.  Not only are they  being questioned in terms of how they've handled the investigations, how  they've handled the various activities, now they're being questioned about  the process.  So eliminate the process questions, and let's get to the  bottom of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well is it just a P.R. nightmare, or is it something more?  I  mean the fact is, is there's been stonewalling for almost a year.  </p><p>And not only that, but we now know because of these text message, of the  bias at the top of the FBI, and how they used kid gloves with the Hillary  Clinton investigation, but we're very happy to investigate Donald Trump.</p><p>So I mean, I think it might be more than just P.R.</p><p>LOTTER:  Well, it is more than that, in terms of the actual underlying  issues, and it's something that Director Wray has talked about getting to  the bottom of, and it's something that Congress definitely wants to.</p><p>But having to fight a battle over process is not good for the FBI, so  that's - it's a (ph) good sign that Director Wray has moved in this  direction, to double the amount of people that are dealing with these  requests.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's move on to the speculation around the Speaker of the  House, Paul Ryan.  A (ph) Nevada Republican Congressman told a local  journalist this week he heard through the grapevine that House Speaker Paul  Ryan is on his way out.</p><p>Reports say majority whip (ph) Steve Scalise or House Majority Leader Kevin  McCarthy could replace him.  </p><p>Here's what Speaker Ryan told me when I asked him about his future plans  just last month.</p><p>(VIDEO BEGINS)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to stick around in order to see the fruits of  your labor ...</p><p>PAUL RYAN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  I can't really answer that question (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  ... because the rumblings are you're going to hopefully keep  the House, as you just said, but then ...</p><p>RYAN:  Yes, no, I feel good about - I really think we're going to keep the  House.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  ... resign and step down after November?</p><p>RYAN:  Look, my wife and I have that conversation in the spring of every  election year.  We haven't had that yet.  We'll figure it out then.</p><p>(VIDEO ENDS)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Paul Ryan has dismissed any plans to step down.  Do you think  we see somebody else holding the gavel soon?</p><p>LOTTER:  No, I don't.  I think the Speaker does - he - we just passed  historic tax cuts with the President, they've got a big agenda, and I know  that the Speaker has a number of items on his plate that he still wants to  get to.</p><p>He's raising money left and right for republicans running for congress and  to keep the majority.  I think you'll see him be a Speaker again next year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I wonder what happens.  I mean, I - what I've heard was the  inside is that eventually he will step down, but not before the mid-terms.   What do you think, Mary?</p><p>KISSEL:  Well, I don't know.  I'm curious to see if they're going to try  for another tax bill, try to make the personal income tax cuts permanent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY:  ... thing was health care, though, and that - and that's what he  took issue on and said here, is he was so furious that the senate wouldn't  back their plans for health care.</p><p>So he's like, hey, we've done our job on the house side, and he repeatedly  said that, and he took - he took offense to John McCain coming in and  actually destroying it in the 12th hour.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>McDOWELL:  And passing that stupid spending bill.  That basically took  making the individual tax cuts permanent - took that off the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think so?</p><p>McDOWELL:  In my opion.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KISSEL:  He cares about the party, though.  I'm not sure he'd want to make  it look like chaos right before the mid-terms.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Marc, we going to see phase two of the tax plan (ph), you  think?</p><p>LOTTER:  I think they're working on it.  I'm not sure if they'll get it  done this year.  I think there's a hope for that, but I think right now  we've got to make sure that we keep what we've got going, the momentum, and  if we can make it permanent, it's probably something that's better for  republicans to be able to campaign on for 2018 than (ph) to actually get it  done right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  Marc, great to see you.   Thanks so much.</p><p>LOTTER:  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Marc Lotter, joining us there.  Coming up, nervous investors  sent the market (ph) sliding on fears of a (ph) technology regulation  crackdown.  </p><p>Is it time to get out of tech?  And what about the rest of the market?   Take a look at the damage, yesterday.  Netflix down better than 6 percent.</p><p>Then there's this.  Megamillions climbs to a half a billion dollars, the  biggest jackpot in nearly two year.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Wednesday morning, welcome back everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, March 28, your  top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the east coast.  A wild day on Wall  Street yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial average swinging better than 700  points from the high to the low.  The selling accelerated in the final hour  of trading and the declines driven by a tech wreck, the largest names in  the sector, all sharply lowering yesterday's trade.</p><p>Take a look, Amazon down 4 percent, Facebook down 5 percent, Netflix down  more than 6 percent.  The Nasdaq, the worst performer on the day, down  nearly 3 percent on the session.  Yesterday, the Dow was down one and a  half percent and the S&amp;P were down were down - was down one and three  quarters percent.</p><p>Take a look at the future because the selling is continuing this morning.   We are expecting the markets to open lower, although, well off of the low  as I should point out.  Dow Industrials now down just about 10 points.   We're waiting on the final read of the fourth quarter GDP.  The expectation  calls for growth of 2.7 percent for the fourth quarter and that would be  final.  So, we'll get that to you in about two hour's time. </p><p>Global markets, following the U.S. lower this morning, the (FT 100) down a  third of a percent, the CAC (INAUDIBLE) and the DAX INDEX down one percent  a piece.  In Asia, over night, steep declines there as well.  It's taking a  cue from Wall Street.  Worst performer was Hong Kong, Hang Seng down two  and a half percent. </p><p>Farewell to a hero, thousands attend the funeral for the New York City  firefighter who died fighting a blaze on a movie set.  And now, a lawsuit  has been filed against Ed Norton's production company over that fire.   Another ball headed to the NBA, Lonzo Ball's younger brother declares for  the NBA draft.</p><p>Plus, the numbers are in for Mega Millions, but nobody won the $485 million  jackpot, and so, we're going to preview that and then there's Roseanne  returning to the small screen, this time, as a Trump supporter.  All that  coming up this morning, but first, there's this, technology taking a  tumble.</p><p>(Stocks) tumble, those big tech names weighed on the major averages  yesterday with the Nasdaq down nearly 3 percent on the session.  The so- called fang stocks, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google have lost  more than $250 billion in market value just in the past week, alone.   Joining me, right now, is the Yardeni Research President and the author of  Predicting the Markets, Ed Yardeni, who has done so well for so many years  and Ed, it is great to see you again. </p><p>ED YARDENI, YARDENI RESEARCH PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us, congratulations on the book. </p><p>YARDENI:  My pleasure. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about that in a minute, but first...</p><p>YARDENI:  Sure. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  ...get your take on what we saw this week, concerns over the  regulatory headwinds coming for the tech sector.  What would you do with  tech right now? </p><p>YARDENI:  The market has had a great run since March 2009 and it was really  melting up in January.  And now it feels a little bit like a mini meltdown.   It's really just been a correction and I think we're just, kind of, coming  back to the planet Earth, recognizing that it's not straight up with  technology.  There are going to be issues, regulatory issues and issues of  whether some of these technologies can actually be achieved. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So - so, look at the backdrop, then, for us, for investing.  I  mean, what would you do, right now, and how do you see the backdrop? </p><p>YARDENI:  Well, for anybody who's been in this market for a while, I'd stay  with it.  I don't see any particular reason to bail out of here.  I don't  see a bare market because I don't see a recession coming anytime soon.  </p><p>For anybody who's thinking about getting in, you're a little late, stocks  are not exactly cheap. So, you may just want to take opportunities like  this to get into some stocks that are showing selling earnings growths.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is that really what you want to drive your decisions - the  earnings growth because here...</p><p>YARDENI:  Yes. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  ...we are, what, two weeks away from starting to get the first  quarter numbers...</p><p>YARDENI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  ...right? The - the first quarter ends this week and we're  expecting the S&amp;P 500 earnings to be up 16 percent...</p><p>YARDENI:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  ...in the first quarter, that's a good number. </p><p>YARDENI:  Well, you know, we had the tax cut at the end of last year and,  as a result of that, analysts actually raised their numbers for earnings  for this year, substantially, by $12 a share, basically.  That's a - it's a  really big - big gain, but it may actually be more than that because they  didn't really have a complete read on how the tax cut would, in fact, hit  earnings positively and I think that's going to be reflected in the  upcoming earning season. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think the tax plan has a long runway in terms of an impact  on earnings and the broad economy? </p><p>YARDENI:  Well, look, the - the immediate impact is dramatic.  We're  looking at an earnings growth number of 16 to 17 percent, this year.  So,  it's great that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, 18 percent higher year over year?</p><p>YARDENI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>YARDENI:  Well, that's what the analysts are thinking, but they were a  little - a little bit optimistic.  But I think then we settled down to the  norm which is about 7 percent growth, but that's good.  That's what -  that's what the market typically does, it goes up with earnings.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell - tell me about investing in this market, today.  You  wrote a book about you, you are legendary in terms of looking at the  backdrop and - and allocating money. </p><p>YARDENI:  Right. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How would you do that today? </p><p>YARDENI:  Well, I think, the - the key issue for investors always has been,  at least in the 40 years that I've been in the business, has been  inflation.  And so, you really want to have a pretty strong feel of where  inflation is going.  And there is a widespread concern that it's going to  come back, but it hasn't.  And I think that's very powerful for us is  keeping inflation down. </p><p>In that case, I don't see a big increase in bond yield.  So, if you've had  some dividend yielding stocks and then they'll continue to do well,  although, they're not cheap, obviously.  And I would focus - continue to  focus on growth.  I think we are looking at a technology driven world where  the innovations are just extraordinary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your book is called Predicting the Markets, based on your 40  years in the financial sector.  So, you're - you're talking about the lack  of inflation even though we are seeing some moves in wage growth.  You  would imagine...</p><p>YARDENI:  Yes. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  ...wage growth happens when you have a better economic story...</p><p>YARDENI:  Right. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  ...and we're talking about 2.7 percent growth. </p><p>YARDENI:  Right.  Well, there is a Phillips curve theory that says when the  unemployment rates are very low, the way the inflation should go up.  And  this kind of makes sense.  However, that's not the whole story.  The other  story is the price of inflation, itself, can feed back into keeping a lid  on wage inflation if you have tremendous global competition, which we do. </p><p>If we have tremendous technological innovation, which we do, Amazon being  one example of how technology is impacting lower inflation.  And then,  aging and demographics around the world, I think, is another force keeping  inflation down.  So, I know there's a lot of concern about inflation coming  back, but I don't think it is. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So - so, you've got a lot of big ideas in this book.  You - you  also take into account that this is an Amazon economy, which is keeping  inflation in check. </p><p>YARDENI:  Yes, absolutely. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>YARDENI:  And, you know, I keep following what the Fed and other central  banks are doing and they - they're still, kind of, stuck on this idea that  they should be able to get inflation higher, but at what point are they  going to put up a flag and say, maybe inflation isn't just a monetary  phenomenon, maybe there are other forces keeping it down? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So, tell us, right now, how you want to recommend  investing, today, because you're looking, not just at the growth story...</p><p>YARDENI:  Right. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  ...you're also looking at where evaluations are best. </p><p>YARDENI:  Right - right.  Well, everything is expensive. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. </p><p>YARDENI:  And so, I think you really do want to be where the earnings  growth is, but I think you want to diversify and still have stocks that  have been growing dividends.  I mean, that, historically, that's really  been the best way to make money over the long term in the market, is invest  in good companies that are raising their dividends and there's plenty of  them. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you worry about the current upset around trade and tariffs? </p><p>YARDENI:  Well, I worry about it.  I think, to the extent, that the market  worries about it.  I have to worry about it.  I think globalization is here  to stay.  I think they're just too much interdependence to settle a shut  off world trade.  And I don't really think this administration wants to  move away from free trade.  I really don't have a problem with fair trade  as long as it is free trade.  And I think this administration is using a  lot of threats to make trade fair for the United States...</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. </p><p>YARDENI:  ...and it's working.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's face it, we have deficits - trade deficits...</p><p>YARDENI:  Yes we do. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  ...across the world. </p><p>YARDENI:  Yes. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pretty significant actually.  $800 billion...</p><p>YARDENI:  Yes. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  ...when you look at...</p><p>YARDENI:  Right. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  ...collectively speaking.  So, in terms of their policies, then  you think the markets are getting it wrong? </p><p>YARDENI:  Well, I think the markets are - have, sort of, a life of their  own.  It's not just about the fundamentals.  It's also, sometimes, about  the internal working as a market.  And I think we're just seeing a  consolidation and some of the profit taking and, sort of, the high flyers  coming back to reality about what can and can't be achieved. </p><p>So, I think once if we can solve it for a few more months, it is a good  thing because then the market will mosey along with earnings.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you expecting 3 present economic growth this year? </p><p>YARDENI: I am. I think the frustrating thing for our economy is that all  this stimulus the Administration is throwing at it, some of it does get  leaked through the trade deficit and that's why there is this pressure to  do something about that. But I think we could grow 3%; I don't see 4%. I  don't think that demographics and productivity numbers are going to make  that number work. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Not even a couple years out? </p><p>YARDENI:  Not even a couple of years out.  The demography is such the labor  force growth is extremely slow. I mean back in the 60s, 70s and 80s, a good  part of what I wrote about in my book is the baby boomers flooded in, women  flooded in and we had tremendous participation rate increases. But now the  baby boomers are getting older and millennials are not providing the labor  force growth. </p><p>BARTIROMO: And that is why the participation rate is where it is?</p><p>YARDENI: That's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Ed, it's great to see you. Thanks so much. Congrats on the  book. Check it out. Ed Yardeni. </p><p>Coming up, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu under orders to rest  after going to the hospital with flu-like symptoms. We're told he is okay  and resting right now. Then find out the gross reason for delay of game at  Dodger Stadium last night. Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)   </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back. A tough day yesterday.  Thousands mourn in honor,  a New York City firefighter killed on a movie set. Cheryl Casone with the  details.  Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Good morning Maria.  It was really was an  inspiring and emotional show of from the New York Fire Department along  with friends, family, and firefighters from around the country that  attended the funeral service for Lieutenant Michael Davison at St.  Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue. The 37 year old father of four young  children died after fighting flames in a building in Harlem that was being  used as a movie set for a film called \"Motherless Brooklyn.\"  Meanwhile a  tenant in the building is now suing after Edward Norton's production  company for $7 million.  The tenant claiming she suffered severe permanent  personal injuries because of the film company's negligence. </p><p>Another headline we're following for you this morning, Israeli Prime  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly feeling better after he was  hospitalized.  Netanyahu had a high fever and cough after not taking enough  time to recover from a prior throat infection. He tweeted out yesterday  that he was on his way home from the hospital to get some rest.</p><p>Well the Mega Millions Jackpot grew into a whopping $502 million, after no  one won last night.  This is the fourth largest jackpot in Mega Millions  history.  The next drawing is going to be Friday night and your chances of  winning, just you know 258.9 million in 1.  Yes, so good luck with that.  </p><p>All right, the classic sitcom \"Rosanne\" is back on TV after 21 years and  this time the title character played by Roseanne Barr supports President  Trump. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>JACKIE HARRIS, SISTER OF ROSEANNE BARR:  How could you have voted for him  Roseanne? </p><p>ROSEANNE BARR:  He talked about jobs, Jackie.  He said he'd shake things  up. I mean this might come as a complete shock to you, but we almost lost  our house the way things are going. </p><p>HARRIS:  Have you looked at the news because now things are worse. </p><p>BARR:  Not on the real news. </p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>CASONE:  Roseanne Barr herself is a Trump supporter. The nine-episode  season started last night. John Goodman has returned as Dan, Roseanne  Conner's husband and along with daughter Darlene, played by Sara Gilbert,  who is now an executive producer on the show. They explained Dan's death by  saying oh, it was all a dream. By the way, Dan is alive, never mind. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes and of course she has been trashed on twitter as a result of  her support for Donald Trump. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:   Wait.  You got into a twitter fight with Roseanne,  didn't you? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, no, I am a fan. It is great the show is back. I  think that, you know look, a lot of mainstream America is not represented  on television. And you know what?  All sorts of people voted for Donald  Trump and I think it's very savvy of Roseanne to bring this character back  right now. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it's both sides that are portrayed, it's the right and the  left.  It's the conversations that people actually have in their homes. And  she was -- Roseanne was a trailblazer when she started in terms of her  stand up and doing the show.  So I've got to sit down and watch it. </p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right.  It's a conversation happening across...</p><p>MCDOWELL:   Whitney Cummings, who is a female comedian also is working on  it as one of the writers, and I know that was like - because I follow her  on Instagram.   I know that that's an important addition to the cast or the  writing staff.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE :  I was just going to say that Tim Allen had a great  show that represented the right and got canceled and it was on ABC.  It had  great ratings. </p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right.  Why did it get canceled? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: \"Home Improvement?\"</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, no, no.  It was called \"Last Man Standing.\"  It got  canceled - it got cancelled for nebulous reasons, no one really knows but  it had great ratings.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll take a break.  When we come back, the biggest winner in  this year's March Madness, Sister Jean, the 98-year-old spiritual leader of  Loyola Chicago men's basketball team just made Bobblehead history. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  YouTube TV will be the first ever presenting  sponsor for the NBA finals.  This as (ph) Nike extends its contract with  the NFL.  Lauren Simonetti was (ph) told the details in sports this  morning, Laura. </p><p>LAURA SIMONETTI, SPORTS:  (SPORTS)</p><p>BARITROMO:  Laura thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Sure. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  (Inaudible) we'll see you a little Lauren Simonetti.  Still  ahead, we are live from the New York auto show.  Wait until you see what's  there.  We talk about what's driving Ford Motor Company in the future. </p><p>I'm going to check in on those autonomous cars post that accident.

Thanks so much we'll see you in a little while. Good morning everybody, thanks for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo. Happy Wednesday, it is Wednesday March 28th. Your top stories right now, 6 A.M. on the East Coast. Technology taking it's toll, stocks stumble yesterday, weighed down by major technology names. Facing concerns over new regulatory scrutiny. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 344 points, down one and a half percent. Along the top loser's yesterday, Facebook, Alphabet and Apple which all turned negative for the year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The news coming as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly agrees to testify before lawmakers on Capital Hill. Facebook down another 5 percent. Future this morning, looking like this, we're looking at weakness at the trading this morning. Dow industrial set to open down about 50 points. NASDAQ also down 45 points right now. Investors are watching for the final reading of the fourth quarter GDP that is due out at 8:30 A.M. eastern. We are expecting growth of two point seven percent. That is the economist estimate.</p><p>For Europe this morning right across the board, take a look at the European embassy's(ph) FT 100 down two thirds of one percent and the CAC cost(ph) and the DAX index both down better than 1 percent right now. In Asia over night, similar stories, steep declines across the board. Worse performers is Hong Kong, HANG SENG index down two and a half percent. The global sell off coming amid a possible crack down. Speculation is mounting that the White House is considering regulating Chinese investments in technology companies. Senator Lindsey Graham waiting on taking that action against China.</p><p>LINDSEY GRAHAM: They steal everything you bring to China, they manipulate the currency, they dump steal in a below value into the world economy and Trump said during the campaign he was going to push back. He has. And if the French and the Germans were smart, they would join President Trump to change Chinese business practices.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Then major implications for the sector and the markets coming up this morning. The trade deal secured, President Trump making moves, reaching an agreement with South Korea, his first deal since taking office. We are breaking down the deal as the commander in chief makes good on yet another campaign promise. And new problems to report for Tesla. The details as the National Transportation Safety Board investigates another fatal crash. The stock down (ph) another two percent this morning.</p><p>Too slow. FBI Directory Christopher Wray says he will double the number of personnel assigned to reviewing the GOP demanding documents in the investigation of the Clinton e-mail investigation, FBI abuse and the firing of Andrew McCabe. We'll tell you what's next after that subpoena got things moving. And then talk about a d'oh-nut. Springfield coming to Krispy Kreme with Simpsons themed pastries.</p><p>All that coming up this morning. And joining me to talk all about it this (ph) Fox Business hour is Dagen McDowell, Benchmark managing partner Kevin Kelly and the Wall Street Journal's editorial board member, Fox News contributor Mary Kissel.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, JOURNALIST, FOX BUSINESS NEWS: D'oh.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I knew she was going to do that. That's good. Thank you. Thank you so much.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK: You didn't do too bad a job yourself.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. Hey, welcome back from -- from the wedding.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Thank you very much. I missed you guys, but --</p><p>BARTIROMO: We missed you. Yes.</p><p>KELLY: Yes, but it worked out. I got to tear up the dance floor, you know. It was -- it was perfect.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How's the missus?</p><p>KELLY: She's doing exceptionally well. She's --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congratulations.</p><p>KELLY: Yes. Yes. It's -- this is -- it's called perseverance, 12 years a love story in the making. I mean, it --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: 12 years.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. Wow (ph).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wow.</p><p>KELLY: Yes. Yes, so -- so --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's really in love.</p><p>BARTIROMO: She's patient. She's a keeper.</p><p>KELLY: Yes. Yes, she's great.</p><p>BARTIROMO: A lot on the table this morning to discuss, you guys. We got trade, we got the market sell-off. Lot of uncertainty over there.</p><p>MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, lot of uncertainty and a lot of fake news about this trade deal, too, Maria. I hope we're going to get into that. It's not exactly I think what the White House is selling.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is that right?</p><p>KISSEL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we'll talk about that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And then also questions about Facebook going forward, it's profitability, how much is it worth. It's really hard to put a number on it. If you have users leaving or spending less time on the service and advertisers turning their back on Facebook, potentially. Again, that's a big question mark and it's certainly weighing on the broad market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is -- this is the real first test that we've seen for this company in terms -- you're right, valuation, but also the sustainability, if people are worried about user data.</p><p>KELLY: They -- they really --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mark -- Mark -- Mark Zuckerberg didn't invent anything. We kept playing that sound bite from Steve Jobs. He didn't invent anything, just preyed on our desire to be liked. It's a -- it's an advertising vehicle. He just did a better job than Classmates and Tripod and Geocities. I date myself, but thank god I am close to 50, because I actually remember a lot of these companies that tried to do what Facebook did.</p><p>It's at 2 billion users. How much bigger can it get?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: If (ph) those people spend less time on that service, those -- those earnings are going to be a lot lower than people think.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And boy, did investors react yesterday. That is our top story right now, the technology sector taking a beating. A steep sell-off in tech stocks yesterday pulled U.S. markets sharply lower with the DOW closing down nearly 400-points. One day after the indices posted their best day in more than two years. Technology stock has come under pressure amid concerns over increased government scrutiny in the wake of privacy questions surrounding Facebook.</p><p>All this coming amid speculation that the Trump administration is considering a crackdown on Chinese investments in U.S. technologies by using a law reserved for national emergencies. Joining us now to weigh in is director of defense studies at the Center for National Interest and the executive editor of National Interest Magazine, Harry Kazianis. Good to see you, Harry. Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>HARRY KAZIANIS, DIRECTOR OF DEFENSE STUDIES, CENTER FOR NATIONAL INTEREST: Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So let's start first with the crackdown on Chinese investments in technology. We know that China has participated in 10 percent off venture deals in the U.S. in the last five years. Your take on what could happen in terms of China investing in U.S. companies.</p><p>KAZIANIS: Maria, I think there being some sort of restrictions is a very practical and an important step. I think if we look at the history of Chinese actions, really over the last 10 years and things they've done to the United States, not just economic but geopolitical, there had to be some restrictions. You know, being in the defense sector, looking at this from that perspective, we look at some of the things the Chinese done in terms of stealing a lot of our defense intellectual property.</p><p>They've hacked in and stolen our aircraft carrier designs, the V-22 Osprey, the F-35, which is a trillion dollar defense program. So when you look at it from that perspective, there has to be some restrictions. And then we talk about the technology of the future, things like 5G, A.I. If Chinese companies were to come in and essentially, you know, buy parts of U.S. companies or get into joint ventures and then take that technology, we're essentially giving away our economic future to China. And I think that would be a big mistake.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, I know that we have CFIUS, Mary, and that really does regulate the -- whether or not we should see ownership of American companies. But at the same time, China has such strict situations with regard to American investing there. And we don't have anything like that.</p><p>KISSEL: No, I mean look, our tariff barriers are very low compared to China. And China also has a lot of barriers that are not set in stone or formalized, right? They -- they say well, you know, if you come here and you really want to get in, you have to give us 51 percent control and we to have a communist party member on your board in China, things like that.</p><p>So Harry's absolutely right. There are a lot of problems here. Harry, my question to you is what is strategic? You know, I understand that we don't want investment in dual use technologies, defense, certain telecommunication industries, but where else does this go? Does it go to energy companies? I mean, what's the limit here?</p><p>KAZIANIS: I think the thing that I worry about most, Mary, is technologies of the future. Like I was saying, 5G could be a revolutionary technology. I mean, most of us at home are getting -- you know, on our internet speeds, about 100, 150 megs per second. That is the speeds of -- of 5G over cellular networks. That could be revolutionary in terms of self driving cars, medical devices.</p><p>And in terms of, you know, strategy and -- and overall geopolitics and intelligence, if the Chinese were to gain footholds in those arenas, the amount of intelligence they could gather would be astronomical. Now, I don't want to sound like I'm panicking over, you know, what the Chinese can do in terms of intelligence capabilities, but I think we have some very real concerns when you combine that, in terms of all of the geopolitical things the Chinese have done over 10 years.</p><p>So I think it's good to be cautious, I think it's something that we have to do. But we have to remember, the U.S. China relationship is changing, really since the fall of the Soviet Union in1991. This relationship was begging to be changed. I mean, one of the reasons why America and China actually came together in the first place is because of the Soviet Union.</p><p>When the Soviet Union collapsed, there was always going to be some sort of inevitable change, but it was always economics that brought us together. Now it's actually --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Just want to (ph) point out, Kevin, one -- one thing that Devin Nunes told me on Sunday is not only are we dealing with these economic issues with China, but right now, they're buying up a lot of infrastructure across the world. They're investing in these countries and then getting a sealine position and setting up military bases right there. This is another thing that this administration is watching over (ph).</p><p>KELLY: Yes, especially in Africa, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.</p><p>KELLY: In -- in -- in Djibouti. And I think one of the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>KELLY: -- important things to note is that China is going to get this 5G technology whether we like it or not, right? And one of the -- the things this administration has done is block the Broadcom deal with Qualcomm. The issue actually has to do with will we have that infrastructure, that technology? Are we going to have access to it in times of national defense? And I think that's the biggest -- biggest question.</p><p>If -- if we don't have access to it and only the Chinese do, if they're scooping up U.S. companies, that's the biggest issue. But I think the -- I think one of the things we're tiptoeing around is North Korea. I mean, China is completely enabling North Korea and a lot of their weaponized attacks across the world, whether it's in South Korea, here.</p><p>So the only way North Korea survives and thrives is through China. Now, do you think that's one of the biggest conflicts of interest that we're having right now with China and their technology? Harry?</p><p>KAZIANI: I do. I do. And I -- and I think the -- the point on North Korea is so key here. I mean, no wonder the -- you know -- Kim Jung-un is going to, you know, meet with Xi Jinping so early, in terms of having multiple different summits and whatnot. And I think when we talk about issues on the Korean Peninsula and how this all comes to play, I think it's extremely important for the United States to continue making sure that we apply maximum pressure on both of those countries.</p><p>Because there's a relationship where essentially North Korea feeds off China, but China also feeds off North Korea. And I think as long as we're ensuring that pressure on both sides is being maintained, I think that's the smartest way to go. So I -- I think all of these situations we're talking about, the recalibrating of the U.S. China relationship, North Korea, it's all one big pot that we have to worry about.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We always talk about the big picture in terms of the U.S. and China and China's investment in technologies. There's a story in the Wall Street Journal that pinpoints how it does effect mama and daddy, if you will, in -- in rural parts of America.</p><p>And a lot of smaller telecomm companies have relied on gear made by Huawei, the bigger company since 2012 because there was a fear -- there was a congressional report done -- there was a fear that China would exploit that technology being in the United States in order to spy or even hack into our data networks.</p><p>But smaller telecomm companies have relied on that very gear because it's cheaper. And there was an -- the FCC put out a proposal on Monday that might -- that will likely restrict these smaller companies drawing on this $8.5 billion government-run fund to build out these rural networks. So again, there are broad implications for these rules that are sent out of Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And -- and the administration is watching each of these nuances. Meanwhile, we've got to talk about this. The state media has reported -- the Chinese state new media reporting that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un did in fact make a surprise visit to Beijing to meet with President Xi Jinping.</p><p>The North Korean leader reportedly told his Chinese counterpart that Pyongyang is committed to denuclearization, and is willing to talk to U.S. officials. President Trump just tweeted about this moments ago, want to get this tweet out right away.</p><p>Here's what the president just said, for years and through many administrations, everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was not even a small possibility.</p><p>Now there is a good chance that Kim Jong-un will do what is right for his people and for humanity. Look forward to our meeting. And of course, we know that the president is planning on meeting the head of the North Korea in may, Harry, do you -- do we know what Kim Jong-un would want in exchange for potentially giving up his nuclear weapons?</p><p>Do we believe that he even would consider such a thing?</p><p>KAZIANIS: Well Maria, that's the golden question in this whole situation. What does Kim Jong-un want? I think at a bare minimum, he's going to want some sort of peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, some sort of diplomatic recognition by the United States, potentially as much as hundreds of billions of dollars in economic assistance.</p><p>That might be one of the reasons he actually went to China. He -- he is going to demand a lot, but we're also going to demand a lot. We're going to need to have really tough inspections to go in and make sure the North Koreans are actually living up to the deal.</p><p>But (ph) even gets worse, I mean do they give up their chemical weapons or missiles? We have a lot of questions this morning and not a lot of answers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mary Kissel, you're not buying it, and you're -- and you're also not buying this first major trade deal with South Korea. We spoke --</p><p>KISSEL: No, but just first -- first on this North Korea meeting, Kim Jong- un's goal here, Maria, is to combine the two Koreas and to have North Korea run South Korea, that's the goal.</p><p>He wants to eject U.S. troops from the Korean Peninsula, he is never going to voluntarily give up his nuclear program. The only way that North Korea talking to China is a good thing is if China is brokering a deal to take Kim Jong-un and put him into exile in Monaco or some prison somewhere in the world.</p><p>That's the only way that that's going to be a good -- a good meeting.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I just think that China reinserted itself real quick on this deal, why aren't you buying this up (ph) (inaudible).</p><p>KISSEL: So Trump administration says that this is great for free trade, this is not market opening, this is called manage trade. This is called managed trade, this is where we're going back to the 1980's where we're trying to set quotas and limits on how certain goods move between countries.</p><p>It's not market opening, it -- it's not good for trade, it rewards certain industries, in fact, I'd say it's a little bit of a swamp coming back to Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, all right, we'll keep watching that. Harry, great to have you this morning, thanks so much for your insights.</p><p>KAZIANIA: Thanks for having me, guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Harry Kazianis there, coming up the NTSB launching a probe into a fatal Tesla crash, whether the automated driving system is to blame. The impact on the brand, the company, the stock, which had another tough day yesterday, this morning it is down again.</p><p>The FBI and the GOP leaders need to agree on one thing, the response to demands to turn over documents on alleged abuses at the agency has gone way too slow. Find out how the director is picking up the pace after that subpoena from Bob Goodlatte, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERICAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. President Trump is tweeting this morning. Guess (ph) what he just sent out, the second amendment will never be repealed, as much as democrats would like to see this happen and despite the words yesterday of former Supreme Court Justice Stevens, no way.</p><p>We need more republicans in 2018 and must always hold the Supreme Court. Meanwhile there's this, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg decides to testify before Congress.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now, finally he says he's going to do it.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, ANCHOR: Yes, I mean we were kind of wondering what he was going to do. Zuckerberg is now expected to face pretty tough questions about the companies handling of user data.</p><p>This entire controversy started after British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica -- excuse me -- allegedly misused the personal data of 50 million Facebook users. So Facebook stock actually dropped nearly five percent yesterday over worries about more regulation, stocks down 15 percent for the month of March.</p><p>This makes it the worst month for this stock since July of 2012. This morning, again, stock to watch is down on the pre-market, it's come back a little bit, but is down more than half a percent.</p><p>We should say that it -- he is still declining to talk to British lawmakers. Maria, so he'll talk to those here in the United States. (Inaudible) investigators are looking into another fatal crash involving the Tesla that happened last Friday in California.</p><p>National Transportations Safety Board says it not clear if the car's autopilot was on at the time. The Model X caught fire after it hit a highway barrier and was struck by two other vehicles, one man died as a result of this crash.</p><p>Tesla stocks plunged eight percent yesterday, we should say, and shares are lower in the pre-market, nearly two percent to the downside right now. Well let's stay in the car theme, because Uber is putting the breaks on its driverless car testing in California.</p><p>They are temporarily suspending all testing after a woman was killed by one of its cars while crossing the street in Tempe, Arizona. Cameras show the safety driver, who we later found out was a convicted felon, looking down, away from the road at the time of the crash.</p><p>This is the video, Uber says it will not renew its permit in California to test the vehicles for the foreseeable future. Also in California, Uber reaching a $10 million settlement in a discrimination lawsuit.</p><p>Two women engineers accused Uber of gender and racial discrimination, they claimed that Uber's employee ranking system favors men and white or Asian employees. According to filing, the settlement compensates for financial and emotional harm, to about 285 women and 135 men of color.</p><p>And I'm going to leave you with this, something a little brighter, in an ode to Homer Simpson, we love him, Krispy Kreme is releasing a real life version of Homer's favorite donut.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So you like donuts? Well have all of the (ph) donuts in the world.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>That's a lot of donuts. The Simpson's donut is a glazed donut then they dip it in strawberry flavored white chocolate truffle, that's how it's iced, and then there's rainbow sprinkles on top.</p><p>You can't get them in the U.S., this is very frustrating, they're only available in Australia. Thanks a lot Krispy Kreme.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So I guess that means you didn't bring any?</p><p>CASONE: Well you know I would have (inaudible) get my hands on them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you, Cheryl. The president just tweeted this, we want to get this out here, he says this, received message last night from Xi Jingping of China that his meeting with Kim Jong-un went very well and that Kim looks forward to his meeting with me.</p><p>In the mean time, and unfortunately, maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all costs. The president just -- it's important to not that John Bolton, now the -- his national security advisor, was behind the -- the Bush administration effort to basically intervene and prevent the transfer of weapons material, the anti-proliferation measures that were put in place during the Bush administration, so (inaudible) ...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KISSEL: Yes, proliferation security initiative very good, and he also saw appeasement up close, spoke out very strongly against it during the Bush years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very important.</p><p>McDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right (ph), we'll keep following that. We'll take a break.</p><p>When we come back, a New York City Firefighter is laid to rest yesterday after being killed on a movie set.</p><p>Meanwhile, actor Edward Norton's production company is facing a multi- million dollar suit because of that blaze.</p><p>Plus, Rosanne reboot getting political. The NBC show taking a page from real life with major support for the president.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, the FBI is finally responding to Bob Goodlatte's subpoena. He's doubling up.</p><p>FBI Director Christopher Wray is doubling the number of personnel assigned to responding to the House subpoena for documents relating to the ongoing Hilary Clinton investigation, the FBI abuse controversy and the FBI's internal recommendation to fire former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.</p><p>This comes after House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte issued a subpoena for those documents. He told me he would on Sunday Morning Futures - about the slow response, and he asked about the next move, as I asked him about the subpoena.</p><p>He issued the judicial proceeding days later.</p><p>(VIDEO BEGINS)</p><p>BOB GOODLATTE, REPRESENTATIVE, REPUBLICAN: The department and the Bureau have been slow - I would say, now, very slow - in getting them to us.</p><p>The last time I was on your program, I expressed confidence that we would have those documents forthcoming, and here we are several weeks later, still don't have them, so this is coming to a head.</p><p>(VIDEO ENDS)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is former Special Assistant to President Trump, former Press Secretary to Vice President Pence, and today (ph) RNC consultant Mark Lauder (ph). Mark, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>MARC LOTTER, RNC CONSULTANT: Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think they're going to get these documents? I mean it's absolutely extraordinary to me that they requested 1.2 million documents, and they've only been given 3,000.</p><p>LOTTER: I do think they'll get the documents. It's an enormous request, and having worked for many different government agencies, these take a lot of time and a lot of manpower to get through.</p><p>But I think it's also very good that the - that the FBI recognizes the problem, and they're dealing with it by doubling the staff.</p><p>I mean this is a public relations nightmare for the FBI. Not only are they being questioned in terms of how they've handled the investigations, how they've handled the various activities, now they're being questioned about the process. So eliminate the process questions, and let's get to the bottom of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well is it just a P.R. nightmare, or is it something more? I mean the fact is, is there's been stonewalling for almost a year.</p><p>And not only that, but we now know because of these text message, of the bias at the top of the FBI, and how they used kid gloves with the Hillary Clinton investigation, but we're very happy to investigate Donald Trump.</p><p>So I mean, I think it might be more than just P.R.</p><p>LOTTER: Well, it is more than that, in terms of the actual underlying issues, and it's something that Director Wray has talked about getting to the bottom of, and it's something that Congress definitely wants to.</p><p>But having to fight a battle over process is not good for the FBI, so that's - it's a (ph) good sign that Director Wray has moved in this direction, to double the amount of people that are dealing with these requests.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's move on to the speculation around the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. A (ph) Nevada Republican Congressman told a local journalist this week he heard through the grapevine that House Speaker Paul Ryan is on his way out.</p><p>Reports say majority whip (ph) Steve Scalise or House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy could replace him.</p><p>Here's what Speaker Ryan told me when I asked him about his future plans just last month.</p><p>(VIDEO BEGINS)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you going to stick around in order to see the fruits of your labor ...</p><p>PAUL RYAN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: I can't really answer that question (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO: ... because the rumblings are you're going to hopefully keep the House, as you just said, but then ...</p><p>RYAN: Yes, no, I feel good about - I really think we're going to keep the House.</p><p>BARTIROMO: ... resign and step down after November?</p><p>RYAN: Look, my wife and I have that conversation in the spring of every election year. We haven't had that yet. We'll figure it out then.</p><p>(VIDEO ENDS)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Paul Ryan has dismissed any plans to step down. Do you think we see somebody else holding the gavel soon?</p><p>LOTTER: No, I don't. I think the Speaker does - he - we just passed historic tax cuts with the President, they've got a big agenda, and I know that the Speaker has a number of items on his plate that he still wants to get to.</p><p>He's raising money left and right for republicans running for congress and to keep the majority. I think you'll see him be a Speaker again next year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I wonder what happens. I mean, I - what I've heard was the inside is that eventually he will step down, but not before the mid-terms. What do you think, Mary?</p><p>KISSEL: Well, I don't know. I'm curious to see if they're going to try for another tax bill, try to make the personal income tax cuts permanent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY: ... thing was health care, though, and that - and that's what he took issue on and said here, is he was so furious that the senate wouldn't back their plans for health care.</p><p>So he's like, hey, we've done our job on the house side, and he repeatedly said that, and he took - he took offense to John McCain coming in and actually destroying it in the 12th hour.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>McDOWELL: And passing that stupid spending bill. That basically took making the individual tax cuts permanent - took that off the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You think so?</p><p>McDOWELL: In my opion.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KISSEL: He cares about the party, though. I'm not sure he'd want to make it look like chaos right before the mid-terms.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Marc, we going to see phase two of the tax plan (ph), you think?</p><p>LOTTER: I think they're working on it. I'm not sure if they'll get it done this year. I think there's a hope for that, but I think right now we've got to make sure that we keep what we've got going, the momentum, and if we can make it permanent, it's probably something that's better for republicans to be able to campaign on for 2018 than (ph) to actually get it done right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. Marc, great to see you. Thanks so much.</p><p>LOTTER: Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Marc Lotter, joining us there. Coming up, nervous investors sent the market (ph) sliding on fears of a (ph) technology regulation crackdown.</p><p>Is it time to get out of tech? And what about the rest of the market? Take a look at the damage, yesterday. Netflix down better than 6 percent.</p><p>Then there's this. Megamillions climbs to a half a billion dollars, the biggest jackpot in nearly two year. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good Wednesday morning, welcome back everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, March 28, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the east coast. A wild day on Wall Street yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial average swinging better than 700 points from the high to the low. The selling accelerated in the final hour of trading and the declines driven by a tech wreck, the largest names in the sector, all sharply lowering yesterday's trade.</p><p>Take a look, Amazon down 4 percent, Facebook down 5 percent, Netflix down more than 6 percent. The Nasdaq, the worst performer on the day, down nearly 3 percent on the session. Yesterday, the Dow was down one and a half percent and the S&amp;P were down were down - was down one and three quarters percent.</p><p>Take a look at the future because the selling is continuing this morning. We are expecting the markets to open lower, although, well off of the low as I should point out. Dow Industrials now down just about 10 points. We're waiting on the final read of the fourth quarter GDP. The expectation calls for growth of 2.7 percent for the fourth quarter and that would be final. So, we'll get that to you in about two hour's time.</p><p>Global markets, following the U.S. lower this morning, the (FT 100) down a third of a percent, the CAC (INAUDIBLE) and the DAX INDEX down one percent a piece. In Asia, over night, steep declines there as well. It's taking a cue from Wall Street. Worst performer was Hong Kong, Hang Seng down two and a half percent.</p><p>Farewell to a hero, thousands attend the funeral for the New York City firefighter who died fighting a blaze on a movie set. And now, a lawsuit has been filed against Ed Norton's production company over that fire. Another ball headed to the NBA, Lonzo Ball's younger brother declares for the NBA draft.</p><p>Plus, the numbers are in for Mega Millions, but nobody won the $485 million jackpot, and so, we're going to preview that and then there's Roseanne returning to the small screen, this time, as a Trump supporter. All that coming up this morning, but first, there's this, technology taking a tumble.</p><p>(Stocks) tumble, those big tech names weighed on the major averages yesterday with the Nasdaq down nearly 3 percent on the session. The so- called fang stocks, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google have lost more than $250 billion in market value just in the past week, alone. Joining me, right now, is the Yardeni Research President and the author of Predicting the Markets, Ed Yardeni, who has done so well for so many years and Ed, it is great to see you again.</p><p>ED YARDENI, YARDENI RESEARCH PRESIDENT: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us, congratulations on the book.</p><p>YARDENI: My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's talk about that in a minute, but first...</p><p>YARDENI: Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: ...get your take on what we saw this week, concerns over the regulatory headwinds coming for the tech sector. What would you do with tech right now?</p><p>YARDENI: The market has had a great run since March 2009 and it was really melting up in January. And now it feels a little bit like a mini meltdown. It's really just been a correction and I think we're just, kind of, coming back to the planet Earth, recognizing that it's not straight up with technology. There are going to be issues, regulatory issues and issues of whether some of these technologies can actually be achieved.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So - so, look at the backdrop, then, for us, for investing. I mean, what would you do, right now, and how do you see the backdrop?</p><p>YARDENI: Well, for anybody who's been in this market for a while, I'd stay with it. I don't see any particular reason to bail out of here. I don't see a bare market because I don't see a recession coming anytime soon.</p><p>For anybody who's thinking about getting in, you're a little late, stocks are not exactly cheap. So, you may just want to take opportunities like this to get into some stocks that are showing selling earnings growths.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, is that really what you want to drive your decisions - the earnings growth because here...</p><p>YARDENI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: ...we are, what, two weeks away from starting to get the first quarter numbers...</p><p>YARDENI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: ...right? The - the first quarter ends this week and we're expecting the S&amp;P 500 earnings to be up 16 percent...</p><p>YARDENI: Yes, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: ...in the first quarter, that's a good number.</p><p>YARDENI: Well, you know, we had the tax cut at the end of last year and, as a result of that, analysts actually raised their numbers for earnings for this year, substantially, by $12 a share, basically. That's a - it's a really big - big gain, but it may actually be more than that because they didn't really have a complete read on how the tax cut would, in fact, hit earnings positively and I think that's going to be reflected in the upcoming earning season.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You think the tax plan has a long runway in terms of an impact on earnings and the broad economy?</p><p>YARDENI: Well, look, the - the immediate impact is dramatic. We're looking at an earnings growth number of 16 to 17 percent, this year. So, it's great that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, 18 percent higher year over year?</p><p>YARDENI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>YARDENI: Well, that's what the analysts are thinking, but they were a little - a little bit optimistic. But I think then we settled down to the norm which is about 7 percent growth, but that's good. That's what - that's what the market typically does, it goes up with earnings.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell - tell me about investing in this market, today. You wrote a book about you, you are legendary in terms of looking at the backdrop and - and allocating money.</p><p>YARDENI: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How would you do that today?</p><p>YARDENI: Well, I think, the - the key issue for investors always has been, at least in the 40 years that I've been in the business, has been inflation. And so, you really want to have a pretty strong feel of where inflation is going. And there is a widespread concern that it's going to come back, but it hasn't. And I think that's very powerful for us is keeping inflation down.</p><p>In that case, I don't see a big increase in bond yield. So, if you've had some dividend yielding stocks and then they'll continue to do well, although, they're not cheap, obviously. And I would focus - continue to focus on growth. I think we are looking at a technology driven world where the innovations are just extraordinary.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your book is called Predicting the Markets, based on your 40 years in the financial sector. So, you're - you're talking about the lack of inflation even though we are seeing some moves in wage growth. You would imagine...</p><p>YARDENI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: ...wage growth happens when you have a better economic story...</p><p>YARDENI: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: ...and we're talking about 2.7 percent growth.</p><p>YARDENI: Right. Well, there is a Phillips curve theory that says when the unemployment rates are very low, the way the inflation should go up. And this kind of makes sense. However, that's not the whole story. The other story is the price of inflation, itself, can feed back into keeping a lid on wage inflation if you have tremendous global competition, which we do.</p><p>If we have tremendous technological innovation, which we do, Amazon being one example of how technology is impacting lower inflation. And then, aging and demographics around the world, I think, is another force keeping inflation down. So, I know there's a lot of concern about inflation coming back, but I don't think it is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So - so, you've got a lot of big ideas in this book. You - you also take into account that this is an Amazon economy, which is keeping inflation in check.</p><p>YARDENI: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>YARDENI: And, you know, I keep following what the Fed and other central banks are doing and they - they're still, kind of, stuck on this idea that they should be able to get inflation higher, but at what point are they going to put up a flag and say, maybe inflation isn't just a monetary phenomenon, maybe there are other forces keeping it down?</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. So, tell us, right now, how you want to recommend investing, today, because you're looking, not just at the growth story...</p><p>YARDENI: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: ...you're also looking at where evaluations are best.</p><p>YARDENI: Right - right. Well, everything is expensive.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>YARDENI: And so, I think you really do want to be where the earnings growth is, but I think you want to diversify and still have stocks that have been growing dividends. I mean, that, historically, that's really been the best way to make money over the long term in the market, is invest in good companies that are raising their dividends and there's plenty of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you worry about the current upset around trade and tariffs?</p><p>YARDENI: Well, I worry about it. I think, to the extent, that the market worries about it. I have to worry about it. I think globalization is here to stay. I think they're just too much interdependence to settle a shut off world trade. And I don't really think this administration wants to move away from free trade. I really don't have a problem with fair trade as long as it is free trade. And I think this administration is using a lot of threats to make trade fair for the United States...</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>YARDENI: ...and it's working.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's face it, we have deficits - trade deficits...</p><p>YARDENI: Yes we do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: ...across the world.</p><p>YARDENI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Pretty significant actually. $800 billion...</p><p>YARDENI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: ...when you look at...</p><p>YARDENI: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: ...collectively speaking. So, in terms of their policies, then you think the markets are getting it wrong?</p><p>YARDENI: Well, I think the markets are - have, sort of, a life of their own. It's not just about the fundamentals. It's also, sometimes, about the internal working as a market. And I think we're just seeing a consolidation and some of the profit taking and, sort of, the high flyers coming back to reality about what can and can't be achieved.</p><p>So, I think once if we can solve it for a few more months, it is a good thing because then the market will mosey along with earnings.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you expecting 3 present economic growth this year?</p><p>YARDENI: I am. I think the frustrating thing for our economy is that all this stimulus the Administration is throwing at it, some of it does get leaked through the trade deficit and that's why there is this pressure to do something about that. But I think we could grow 3%; I don't see 4%. I don't think that demographics and productivity numbers are going to make that number work.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Not even a couple years out?</p><p>YARDENI: Not even a couple of years out. The demography is such the labor force growth is extremely slow. I mean back in the 60s, 70s and 80s, a good part of what I wrote about in my book is the baby boomers flooded in, women flooded in and we had tremendous participation rate increases. But now the baby boomers are getting older and millennials are not providing the labor force growth.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that is why the participation rate is where it is?</p><p>YARDENI: That's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Ed, it's great to see you. Thanks so much. Congrats on the book. Check it out. Ed Yardeni.</p><p>Coming up, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu under orders to rest after going to the hospital with flu-like symptoms. We're told he is okay and resting right now. Then find out the gross reason for delay of game at Dodger Stadium last night. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A tough day yesterday. Thousands mourn in honor, a New York City firefighter killed on a movie set. Cheryl Casone with the details. Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Good morning Maria. It was really was an inspiring and emotional show of from the New York Fire Department along with friends, family, and firefighters from around the country that attended the funeral service for Lieutenant Michael Davison at St. Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue. The 37 year old father of four young children died after fighting flames in a building in Harlem that was being used as a movie set for a film called \"Motherless Brooklyn.\" Meanwhile a tenant in the building is now suing after Edward Norton's production company for $7 million. The tenant claiming she suffered severe permanent personal injuries because of the film company's negligence.</p><p>Another headline we're following for you this morning, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly feeling better after he was hospitalized. Netanyahu had a high fever and cough after not taking enough time to recover from a prior throat infection. He tweeted out yesterday that he was on his way home from the hospital to get some rest.</p><p>Well the Mega Millions Jackpot grew into a whopping $502 million, after no one won last night. This is the fourth largest jackpot in Mega Millions history. The next drawing is going to be Friday night and your chances of winning, just you know 258.9 million in 1. Yes, so good luck with that.</p><p>All right, the classic sitcom \"Rosanne\" is back on TV after 21 years and this time the title character played by Roseanne Barr supports President Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>JACKIE HARRIS, SISTER OF ROSEANNE BARR: How could you have voted for him Roseanne?</p><p>ROSEANNE BARR: He talked about jobs, Jackie. He said he'd shake things up. I mean this might come as a complete shock to you, but we almost lost our house the way things are going.</p><p>HARRIS: Have you looked at the news because now things are worse.</p><p>BARR: Not on the real news.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>CASONE: Roseanne Barr herself is a Trump supporter. The nine-episode season started last night. John Goodman has returned as Dan, Roseanne Conner's husband and along with daughter Darlene, played by Sara Gilbert, who is now an executive producer on the show. They explained Dan's death by saying oh, it was all a dream. By the way, Dan is alive, never mind.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes and of course she has been trashed on twitter as a result of her support for Donald Trump.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wait. You got into a twitter fight with Roseanne, didn't you?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, no, I am a fan. It is great the show is back. I think that, you know look, a lot of mainstream America is not represented on television. And you know what? All sorts of people voted for Donald Trump and I think it's very savvy of Roseanne to bring this character back right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And it's both sides that are portrayed, it's the right and the left. It's the conversations that people actually have in their homes. And she was -- Roseanne was a trailblazer when she started in terms of her stand up and doing the show. So I've got to sit down and watch it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right. It's a conversation happening across...</p><p>MCDOWELL: Whitney Cummings, who is a female comedian also is working on it as one of the writers, and I know that was like - because I follow her on Instagram. I know that that's an important addition to the cast or the writing staff.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE : I was just going to say that Tim Allen had a great show that represented the right and got canceled and it was on ABC. It had great ratings.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you're right. Why did it get canceled?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: \"Home Improvement?\"</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, no, no. It was called \"Last Man Standing.\" It got canceled - it got cancelled for nebulous reasons, no one really knows but it had great ratings.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll take a break. When we come back, the biggest winner in this year's March Madness, Sister Jean, the 98-year-old spiritual leader of Loyola Chicago men's basketball team just made Bobblehead history.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. YouTube TV will be the first ever presenting sponsor for the NBA finals. This as (ph) Nike extends its contract with the NFL. Lauren Simonetti was (ph) told the details in sports this morning, Laura.</p><p>LAURA SIMONETTI, SPORTS: (SPORTS)</p><p>BARITROMO: Laura thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: (Inaudible) we'll see you a little Lauren Simonetti. Still ahead, we are live from the New York auto show. Wait until you see what's there. We talk about what's driving Ford Motor Company in the future.</p><p>I'm going to check in on those autonomous cars post that accident.

The trip was organized and mostly paid for by the Global Antitrust Institute, a part of the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Regulators spent the days in classes with the institute\u2019s staff, which included a senior federal judge and a former commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission. The program was presented as continuing education for antitrust regulators \u2014 a way to learn more about the economic underpinnings of competition law.</p><p>But critics and past attendees of similar conferences run by the institute said the sessions were more about delivering a clear message to international officials that benefited the companies paying for the event The best way to foster competition is to maintain a hands-off approach to antitrust law.</p><p>The Global Antitrust Institute is bankrolled in large part by tech companies \u2014 corporate donors like Google, Amazon and Qualcomm \u2014 that are facing antitrust scrutiny from some of the regulators who attended its programs, according to hundreds of pages of emails and documents obtained through open records laws, interviews with four past conference participants and observation of a conference last year in Huntington Beach.</p><p>The documents included donation checks for hundreds of thousands of dollars from Google and Amazon, as well as a three-year, multimillion-dollar donation agreement from Qualcomm. Those checks were a key component of the institute\u2019s $2.1 million budget in the year that ended in June 2019.</p><p>The emails illustrated how the institute\u2019s leaders, including Joshua Wright, who has long-standing ties to Google, have worked closely with tech companies to fend off antitrust criticism. And they showed how the institute cultivated and tapped relationships with top competition officials \u2014 even, in an aggressive courtship, asking Brazil\u2019s top antitrust regulator to recruit the country\u2019s judges to attend its conferences with offers of business-class flights.</p><p>\u201cThis is not a significant expenditure for these companies,\u201d said Michael Carrier, a professor at Rutgers University\u2019s law school. And the potential benefit, \u201ceven making it moderately less likely to be on the losing end of an ambitious antitrust case, is worth that price many times over.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s difficult to determine the impact of the institute. But in Brazil, a tribunal last year dismissed three separate investigations into Google, which controls 97% of the country\u2019s search traffic, for a lack of evidence.</p><p>Regulatory scrutiny is, unquestionably, a global issue for tech companies. Until recently, Europe was the main threat of antitrust action. Google has lost three competition cases there since 2017. Amazon is now the target of an inquiry in Europe for abusing its dominance in online commerce to squeeze smaller rivals. Qualcomm has paid more than $1 billion in fines to Europe for its anticompetitive behavior.</p><p>Now other countries are also starting to take a more aggressive approach. Australia and Brazil are investigating Google, while Amazon is facing an antitrust probe in India.</p><p>The companies are also facing investigations at home. After years of a hands-off approach to monopoly enforcement, Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple are under investigation from federal watchdogs, state attorneys general and Congress. The Justice Department is expected to bring a case against Google in the coming months in what would be one of the biggest antitrust actions in the United States since the 1990s.</p><p>The chief executives of Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple will appear before lawmakers soon as part of a congressional antitrust investigation into their market powers.</p><p>Wright, the institute\u2019s executive director, said that its mission, curriculum and lectures were available online for the public to assess and that \u201copen-minded observers\u201d would see the quality of its instruction from legal academics and economists with experience enforcing antitrust laws and prosecuting cases.</p><p>\u201cThat combination of academic and practical experience is one reason enforcement agencies\u2019 officials from around the world consistently choose to send their staff to our programs,\u201d Wright said in a statement.</p><p>Teaching antitrust restraint</p><p>The long era of restraint in antitrust enforcement in the United States can be traced back, in part, to an ideology that tied economic analysis to legal cases. The view was that it\u2019s not enough for a company to dominate a market and crush competitors, there must be evidence of so-called consumer harm \u2014 usually in the form of higher prices. That notion permeated the U.S. judicial system with the aid of economics seminars for federal judges funded by corporate donors.</p><p>The Manne Economics Institute for Federal Judges, which ran from 1976 to 1999, was organized by the Law and Economics Center \u2014 now housed at George Mason University\u2019s law school. By 1990, about 40% of all sitting federal judges had attended one of these seminars, according to the program\u2019s director.</p><p>Researchers found that judges who attended the seminars were more likely to approve mergers, rule against environmental protections and organized labor, and use economic language in rulings compared with judges who did not attend, according to an academic study looking at the effects of the program.</p><p>The Global Antitrust Institute, which was established in 2014 as part of George Mason University\u2019s Law and Economics Center, has taken a page from the success of the federal judges program and adapted it for an international audience. It is also starting to offer an economics program for U.S. federal judges, with one scheduled for October in Napa, California.</p><p>Wright said it had already trained more than 850 foreign judges and regulators. It has hosted a senior judge at Supreme People\u2019s Court, China\u2019s top judicial body, as well as the current and former superintendent of Brazil\u2019s top competition regulator as \u201cvisiting scholars.\u201d</p><p>The institute does not disclose the source of its funding, but The New York Times obtained copies of the group\u2019s annual budgets and donation checks in document requests. It is funded almost entirely by companies and foundations affiliated with companies.</p><p>Tech companies have been major backers of the institute for several years. In 2017, Google, for example, donated $200,000 to the group and contributed an additional $300,000 in 2018.</p><p>On its website, Google discloses a long list of organizations that receive money from its government affairs and public policy team. On that list is George Mason University\u2019s Law and Economics Center and the George Mason University Foundation, which is where donations to the Global Antitrust Institute are directed. Google does not mention the Global Antitrust Institute by name.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re committed to transparency about the academic organizations to whom we make grants. Such organizations aren\u2019t acting on our behalf, and we expect and require our grantees to disclose their funding,\u201d said Julie Tarallo McAlister, a Google spokeswoman.</p><p>Amazon, whose dominant shopping site and cloud computing unit are the target of antitrust inquiries, has donated at least $225,000 to the group, according to copies of donation checks. Amazon also listed the George Mason University Foundation among \u201ctrade associations, coalitions, nonprofits and social welfare organizations\u201d that received more than $10,000 in payments from the company. It did not mention the Global Antitrust Institute.</p><p>In thanking Amazon last year, Wright told Pat Bajari, Amazon\u2019s chief economist and vice president, that its donation would support the institute\u2019s mission to provide competition enforcers and foreign judges with the \u201ceconomic foundation for rigorous antitrust analysis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike most large companies, we support a broad range of organizations doing research in areas connected to our business. That does not mean we always agree with their viewpoints or that we direct the work that they do,\u201d an Amazon spokesman, Jack Evans, said in a statement.</p><p>Another company secretly committed to donating $2.9 million over three years until 2020. While the company\u2019s name was redacted in grant documents, one of the agreements directed questions about the donation to a manager who has worked at chipmaker Qualcomm for the last 14 years.</p><p>Qualcomm has spent years fighting regulators around the world and incurred billions of dollars of fines over accusations of anti-competitive practices.</p><p>In 2017, after the FTC filed an antitrust lawsuit against Qualcomm, Koren Wong-Ervin, a director at the institute at the time, emailed an executive at the company to express that a recent debate about the technology licensing terms at the heart of the case was one-sided and not favorable to Qualcomm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m considering a GAI panel on the hill to counter this one,\u201d Wong-Ervin wrote. The Qualcomm executive responded that she would appreciate that.</p><p>Wong-Ervin, a former legal adviser to Wright at the FTC, left her position at the Global Antitrust Institute in September 2017 to become the director of antitrust policy and litigation at Qualcomm. Wong-Ervin, who left her position at Qualcomm this year, declined to comment. Clare Conley, a Qualcomm spokeswoman, also declined to comment.</p><p>Although it\u2019s not clear how much, if any, impact the group\u2019s education programs have had on the decisions of international regulators or judges who attended, \u201cnobody would be paying for this stuff if they didn\u2019t think it had an effect,\u201d said Suresh Naidu, a professor of economics and public and international affairs at Columbia University and one of the authors of the academic study on the economics seminars for federal judges.</p><p>Maintaining the status quo</p><p>The theme of the Global Antitrust Institute\u2019s teaching is clear, said Marshall Steinbaum, an assistant professor at the University of Utah\u2019s economics department. He reviewed a reading list and curriculum of last year\u2019s conference in Huntington Beach and characterized the program as \u201cin line with the institute\u2019s long-term agenda of weakening antitrust laws.\u201d</p><p>Among the reading material is a paper by Hal Varian, who is now Google\u2019s chief economist and who argues that the usual economic hallmarks of monopoly power do not apply to tech companies because of the nature of digital products \u2014 they\u2019re expensive to develop initially but can be resold again and again at little additional cost \u2014 and therefore should not be used by antitrust enforcers to justify aggressive action.</p><p>Tommaso Valletti, who served as the chief competition economist for the European Commission from 2016 to 2019, has attended one of the institute\u2019s events and knows the group\u2019s positions and teaching practices. He said the institute presented one-sided examples of competitive markets working correctly to reinforce the view that markets left on their own work well \u2014 to the benefit of entrenched tech companies.</p><p>\u201cThey do not give a balanced perspective of economics and its application to antitrust,\u201d said Valletti, who now heads the economics and public policy department at Imperial College in London. \u201cThey still portray a simplistic vision of markets, which I believe fits well their goals.\u201d</p><p>The Global Antitrust Institute\u2019s head, Wright, is a divisive figure within the world of antitrust law. He became the institute\u2019s executive director when he returned to George Mason University after serving as one of the five Federal Trade Commission members from 2013 to 2015.</p><p>When Wright stepped down from the FTC, he joined Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati \u2014 the law firm that represented Google in antitrust matters. He was a counselor at the firm until 2019 when he also served as the head of the antitrust institute.</p><p>Mr. Wright is an advocate of the status quo in antitrust enforcement. As a contingent of economists and lawyers push for a new approach for dealing with monopolies in the face of Big Tech, Wright, who also has a doctorate in economics, has derisively designated the movement \u201chipster antitrust\u201d in a 2018 paper.</p><p>He is also known for his close ties to Google. During the F.T.C. nomination process in 2012, Wright was criticized for his paid work for the search giant and agreed to recuse himself from Google matters. Google had helped to fund several of his academic works including a 2011 paper \u201cGoogle and the Limits of Antitrust: The Case Against the Case Against Google.\u201d</p><p>A week before he was sworn in, the agency announced that it had wrapped up an investigation into Google without taking any action. While he had not played a direct role in that decision, Wright\u2019s emails with Google reveal how closely they worked together.</p><p>In a 2012 email, Adam Kovacevich, a former public policy director at Google, asked Wright whether he planned to attend an event in which Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah and vocal critic of Google, would be speaking. At the time, Lee seemed to be toning down his criticism of the company.</p><p>Kovacevich, who left Google in 2019, suggested that it \u201cmight be worth lobbing a question about his comments about Google.\u201d Wright replied \u201cCool... absolutely. Heh - maybe get one of my antitrust students to ask.\u201d Wright also worked closely with Google to deflect media criticism of the company.</p><p>When a CNN reporter asked Wright in an email whether Google\u2019s favoring its own content in search results violated antitrust laws, he defended the company in a lengthy reply. He forwarded his response to Google and added \u201cJust FYI.\u201d Kovacevich responded \u201cThanks, I encouraged him to get in touch.\u201d</p><p>In a 2011 email, Wright asked a legal assistant at Google about an outstanding invoice. When she said it had already paid $125,000, Wright said there should be \u201canother one or two.\u201d</p><p>A Brazilian budget squeeze</p><p>The gap between the deep pockets of the institute\u2019s corporate donors and the overseas regulatory agencies is especially stark in a country like Brazil, where the annual budget for Brazil\u2019s antitrust regulator is about $15 million.</p><p>Brazil\u2019s competition authority, the Administrative Council for Economic Defense, better known as CADE, is clear about its financial constraints. So when the institute invited CADE officials to attend a conference in 2016, Alexandre Cordeiro Macedo, the agency\u2019s general superintendent, who oversees its antitrust investigations, said that they were eager to participate but that it would be difficult to afford sending staff.</p><p>The institute offered to pay for up to six CADE officials to attend the conference in Washington. Since then, other CADE staff have attended institute conferences in Oahu, Santa Monica and Tokyo. In each case, the institute has covered travel, hotel, transportation and most meals \u2014 even allowing some officials to spend an extra night at a resort to recover from jet lag.</p><p>Since 2015, 27 CADE officials have attended the group\u2019s conferences, according to the agency. Last year, the institute paid for 10 Brazilian judges to fly business class to attend a conference at a Four Seasons hotel in Lisbon, Portugal. Cordeiro was also a visiting scholar at the institute, spending two months there in 2017.</p><p>It\u2019s created a close working relationship. When CADE received an invitation for the Huntington Beach conference, the agency could barely contain its excitement.</p><p>\u201cI just want to let you know that among all the other training opportunities that we offer along the year, the one from GAI is without a doubt the most appealing to our staff,\u201d wrote a CADE official in an April 2019 email.</p><p>CADE has allowed the institute to handpick attendees. After 24 agency candidates applied for the six spots at the 2016 conference in Washington, the institute selected the six candidates it wanted. A year later, for a conference in Dubai, GAI selected from a pool of eight CADE candidates for two attendees and two wait-list spots.</p><p>When the institute was trying to recruit Brazilian judges for a conference in Lisbon last year, Douglas Ginsburg, who is a senior judge with the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington and chairman of the institute\u2019s board of advisers, appealed to Cordeiro.</p><p>\u201cIt would be particularly good if you could recruit judges,\u201d Ginsburg wrote in February. He added that a secretary for one judge had asked about whether the institute would pay for business class flights for others. A few days later, Cordeiro responded by saying he had recruited seven judges.</p><p>In a written statement, Cordeiro said that he was an academic as well as a public servant so it \u201cis natural to be consulted about possible parties interested to take part in debates of this nature\u201d and that there is nothing wrong with recommending \u201cother public authorities for a renowned international academic conference.\u201d He said the institute has paid for his flights and accommodations in the past, but he has never received any other form of financial support.</p><p>Ginsburg did not respond to emails or a phone call seeking comment.</p><p>Separately, CADE said it was not aware of the institute\u2019s corporate donors and noted that its officials do not participate in training sponsored \u201cdirectly\u201d by private companies.</p><p>\u201cCADE has strict rules regarding the performance of its employees and that participation in events of any nature does not influence the work carried out within the scope of the municipality,\u201d the agency wrote.</p><p>In addition to the three separate investigations into Google dismissed by the tribunal last year, there are two open investigations into Google\u2019s handling of Android, its smartphone software, and Google\u2019s use of third-party content in Google News and Google Shopping.</p><p>Elizabeth Farina, president of CADE from 2004 to 2008, said there needed to be transparency about the source of the money and accountability for the staff who take part. When asked whether she would have let her staff attend conferences like the ones offered by the Global Antitrust Institute, Farina, who is now the chief executive of a consultancy, said no.</p><p>\u201cIn general, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLTRIB-httpswwwsltribcomnewsnationworld20200727techbackedinstitute</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLTRIB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FT-M2Y1-JCB3-X35V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144579</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3049\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Salt Lake Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0001QUW</classCode><className>QUALCOMM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The opulent meal was the culmination of a weeklong conference in scenic Huntington Beach, California, for 30 foreign government officials who enforce competition laws. The trip was organized and mostly paid for by the Global Antitrust Institute, a part of the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia.      Regulators spent the days in classes with the institute\u2019s staff, which included a senior federal judge and a former commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission. The program was presented as continuing education for antitrust regulators \u2014 a way to learn more about the economic underpinnings of competition law.      But critics and past attendees of similar conferences run by the institute said the sessions were more about delivering a clear message to international officials that benefited the companies paying for the event: The best way to foster competition is to maintain a hands-off approach to antitrust law.      The Global Antitrust Institute is bankrolled in large part by tech companies \u2014 corporate donors like Google, Amazon and Qualcomm \u2014 that are facing antitrust scrutiny from some of the regulators who attended its programs, according to hundreds of pages of emails and documents obtained through open records laws, interviews with four past conference participants and observation of a conference last year in Huntington Beach.      The documents included donation checks for hundreds of thousands of dollars from Google and Amazon, as well as a three-year, multimillion-dollar donation agreement from Qualcomm. Those checks were a key component of the institute\u2019s $2.1 million budget in the year that ended in June 2019.      The emails illustrated how the institute\u2019s leaders, including Joshua Wright, who has long-standing ties to Google, have worked closely with tech companies to fend off antitrust criticism. And they showed how the institute cultivated and tapped relationships with top competition officials \u2014 even, in an aggressive courtship, asking Brazil\u2019s top antitrust regulator to recruit the country\u2019s judges to attend its conferences with offers of business-class flights.      \u201cThis is not a significant expenditure for these companies,\u201d said Michael Carrier, a professor at Rutgers University\u2019s law school. And the potential benefit, \u201ceven making it moderately less likely to be on the losing end of an ambitious antitrust case, is worth that price many times over.\u201d      It\u2019s difficult to determine the impact of the institute. But in Brazil, a tribunal last year dismissed three separate investigations into Google, which controls 97% of the country\u2019s search traffic, for a lack of evidence.      Regulatory scrutiny is, unquestionably, a global issue for tech companies. Until recently, Europe was the main threat of antitrust action. Google has lost three competition cases there since 2017. Amazon is now the target of an inquiry in Europe for abusing its dominance in online commerce to squeeze smaller rivals. Qualcomm has paid more than $1 billion in fines to Europe for its anticompetitive behavior.      Now other countries are also starting to take a more aggressive approach. Australia and Brazil are investigating Google, while Amazon is facing an antitrust probe in India.      The companies are also facing investigations at home. After years of a hands-off approach to monopoly enforcement, Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple are under investigation from federal watchdogs, state attorneys general and Congress. The Justice Department is expected to bring a case against Google in the coming months in what would be one of the biggest antitrust actions in the United States since the 1990s.      The chief executives of Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple will appear before lawmakers soon as part of a congressional antitrust investigation into their market powers.      Wright, the institute\u2019s executive director, said that its mission, curriculum and lectures were available online for the public to assess and that \u201copen-minded observers\u201d would see the quality of its instruction from legal academics and economists with experience enforcing antitrust laws and prosecuting cases.      \u201cThat combination of academic and practical experience is one reason enforcement agencies\u2019 officials from around the world consistently choose to send their staff to our programs,\u201d Wright said in a statement.      Teaching antitrust restraint     The long era of restraint in antitrust enforcement in the United States can be traced back, in part, to an ideology that tied economic analysis to legal cases. The view was that it\u2019s not enough for a company to dominate a market and crush competitors, there must be evidence of so-called consumer harm \u2014 usually in the form of higher prices. That notion permeated the U.S. judicial system with the aid of economics seminars for federal judges funded by corporate donors.      The Manne Economics Institute for Federal Judges , which ran from 1976 to 1999, was organized by the Law and Economics Center \u2014 now housed at George Mason University\u2019s law school. By 1990, about 40% of all sitting federal judges had attended one of these seminars, according to the program\u2019s director.      Researchers found that judges who attended the seminars were more likely to approve mergers, rule against environmental protections and organized labor, and use economic language in rulings compared with judges who did not attend, according to an academic study looking at the effects of the program.      The Global Antitrust Institute, which was established in 2014 as part of George Mason University\u2019s Law and Economics Center, has taken a page from the success of the federal judges program and adapted it for an international audience. It is also starting to offer an economics program for U.S. federal judges, with one scheduled for October in Napa, California.      Wright said it had already trained more than 850 foreign judges and regulators. It has hosted a senior judge at Supreme People\u2019s Court, China\u2019s top judicial body, as well as the current and former superintendent of Brazil\u2019s top competition regulator as \u201cvisiting scholars.\u201d      The institute does not disclose the source of its funding, but The New York Times obtained copies of the group\u2019s annual budgets and donation checks in document requests. It is funded almost entirely by companies and foundations affiliated with companies.      Tech companies have been major backers of the institute for several years. In 2017, Google, for example, donated $200,000 to the group and contributed an additional $300,000 in 2018.      On its website, Google discloses a long list of organizations that receive money from its government affairs and public policy team. On that list is George Mason University\u2019s Law and Economics Center and the George Mason University Foundation, which is where donations to the Global Antitrust Institute are directed. Google does not mention the Global Antitrust Institute by name.      \u201cWe\u2019re committed to transparency about the academic organizations to whom we make grants. Such organizations aren\u2019t acting on our behalf, and we expect and require our grantees to disclose their funding,\u201d said Julie Tarallo McAlister, a Google spokeswoman.      Amazon, whose dominant shopping site and cloud computing unit are the target of antitrust inquiries, has donated at least $225,000 to the group, according to copies of donation checks. Amazon also listed the George Mason University Foundation among \u201ctrade associations, coalitions, nonprofits and social welfare organizations\u201d that received more than $10,000 in payments from the company. It did not mention the Global Antitrust Institute.      In thanking Amazon last year, Wright told Pat Bajari, Amazon\u2019s chief economist and vice president, that its donation would support the institute\u2019s mission to provide competition enforcers and foreign judges with the \u201ceconomic foundation for rigorous antitrust analysis.\u201d      \u201cLike most large companies, we support a broad range of organizations doing research in areas connected to our business. That does not mean we always agree with their viewpoints or that we direct the work that they do,\u201d an Amazon spokesman, Jack Evans, said in a statement.      Another company secretly committed to donating $2.9 million over three years until 2020. While the company\u2019s name was redacted in grant documents, one of the agreements directed questions about the donation to a manager who has worked at chipmaker Qualcomm for the last 14 years.      Qualcomm has spent years fighting regulators around the world and incurred billions of dollars of fines over accusations of anti-competitive practices.      In 2017, after the FTC filed an antitrust lawsuit against Qualcomm, Koren Wong-Ervin, a director at the institute at the time, emailed an executive at the company to express that a recent debate about the technology licensing terms at the heart of the case was one-sided and not favorable to Qualcomm.      \u201cI\u2019m considering a GAI panel on the hill to counter this one,\u201d Wong-Ervin wrote. The Qualcomm executive responded that she would appreciate that.      Wong-Ervin, a former legal adviser to Wright at the FTC, left her position at the Global Antitrust Institute in September 2017 to become the director of antitrust policy and litigation at Qualcomm. Wong-Ervin, who left her position at Qualcomm this year, declined to comment. Clare Conley, a Qualcomm spokeswoman, also declined to comment.      Although it\u2019s not clear how much, if any, impact the group\u2019s education programs have had on the decisions of international regulators or judges who attended, \u201cnobody would be paying for this stuff if they didn\u2019t think it had an effect,\u201d said Suresh Naidu, a professor of economics and public and international affairs at Columbia University and one of the authors of the academic study on the economics seminars for federal judges.      Maintaining the status quo     The theme of the Global Antitrust Institute\u2019s teaching is clear, said Marshall Steinbaum, an assistant professor at the University of Utah\u2019s economics department. He reviewed a reading list and curriculum of last year\u2019s conference in Huntington Beach and characterized the program as \u201cin line with the institute\u2019s long-term agenda of weakening antitrust laws.\u201d      Among the reading material is a paper by Hal Varian, who is now Google\u2019s chief economist and who argues that the usual economic hallmarks of monopoly power do not apply to tech companies because of the nature of digital products \u2014 they\u2019re expensive to develop initially but can be resold again and again at little additional cost \u2014 and therefore should not be used by antitrust enforcers to justify aggressive action.      Tommaso Valletti, who served as the chief competition economist for the European Commission from 2016 to 2019, has attended one of the institute\u2019s events and knows the group\u2019s positions and teaching practices. He said the institute presented one-sided examples of competitive markets working correctly to reinforce the view that markets left on their own work well \u2014 to the benefit of entrenched tech companies.      \u201cThey do not give a balanced perspective of economics and its application to antitrust,\u201d said Valletti, who now heads the economics and public policy department at Imperial College in London. \u201cThey still portray a simplistic vision of markets, which I believe fits well their goals.\u201d      The Global Antitrust Institute\u2019s head, Wright, is a divisive figure within the world of antitrust law. He became the institute\u2019s executive director when he returned to George Mason University after serving as one of the five Federal Trade Commission members from 2013 to 2015.      When Wright stepped down from the FTC, he joined Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati \u2014 the law firm that represented Google in antitrust matters. He was a counselor at the firm until 2019 when he also served as the head of the antitrust institute.      Mr. Wright is an advocate of the status quo in antitrust enforcement. As a contingent of economists and lawyers push for a new approach for dealing with monopolies in the face of Big Tech, Wright, who also has a doctorate in economics, has derisively designated the movement \u201c hipster antitrust \u201d in a  2018 paper .      A week before he was sworn in, the agency announced that it had wrapped up an investigation into Google without taking any action. While he had not played a direct role in that decision, Wright\u2019s emails with Google reveal how closely they worked together.      In a 2012 email, Adam Kovacevich, a former public policy director at Google, asked Wright whether he planned to attend an event in which Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah and vocal critic of Google, would be speaking. At the time, Lee seemed to be toning down his criticism of the company.      Kovacevich, who left Google in 2019, suggested that it \u201cmight be worth lobbing a question about his comments about Google.\u201d Wright replied \u201cCool... absolutely. Heh - maybe get one of my antitrust students to ask.\u201d Wright also worked closely with Google to deflect media criticism of the company.      When a CNN reporter asked Wright in an email whether Google\u2019s favoring its own content in search results violated antitrust laws, he defended the company in a lengthy reply. He forwarded his response to Google and added \u201cJust FYI.\u201d Kovacevich responded: \u201cThanks, I encouraged him to get in touch.\u201d      In a 2011 email, Wright asked a legal assistant at Google about an outstanding invoice. When she said it had already paid $125,000, Wright said there should be \u201canother one or two.\u201d      A Brazilian budget squeeze     The gap between the deep pockets of the institute\u2019s corporate donors and the overseas regulatory agencies is especially stark in a country like Brazil, where the annual budget for Brazil\u2019s antitrust regulator is about $15 million.      Brazil\u2019s competition authority, the Administrative Council for Economic Defense, better known as CADE, is clear about its financial constraints. So when the institute invited CADE officials to attend a conference in 2016, Alexandre Cordeiro Macedo, the agency\u2019s general superintendent, who oversees its antitrust investigations, said that they were eager to participate but that it would be difficult to afford sending staff.      The institute offered to pay for up to six CADE officials to attend the conference in Washington. Since then, other CADE staff have attended institute conferences in Oahu, Santa Monica and Tokyo. In each case, the institute has covered travel, hotel, transportation and most meals \u2014 even allowing some officials to spend an extra night at a resort to recover from jet lag.      Since 2015, 27 CADE officials have attended the group\u2019s conferences, according to the agency. Last year, the institute paid for 10 Brazilian judges to fly business class to attend a conference at a Four Seasons hotel in Lisbon, Portugal. Cordeiro was also a visiting scholar at the institute, spending two months there in 2017.      It\u2019s created a close working relationship. When CADE received an invitation for the Huntington Beach conference, the agency could barely contain its excitement.      \u201cI just want to let you know that among all the other training opportunities that we offer along the year, the one from GAI is without a doubt the most appealing to our staff,\u201d wrote a CADE official in an April 2019 email.      CADE has allowed the institute to handpick attendees. After 24 agency candidates applied for the six spots at the 2016 conference in Washington, the institute selected the six candidates it wanted. A year later, for a conference in Dubai, GAI selected from a pool of eight CADE candidates for two attendees and two wait-list spots.      When the institute was trying to recruit Brazilian judges for a conference in Lisbon last year, Douglas Ginsburg, who is a senior judge with the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington and chairman of the institute\u2019s board of advisers, appealed to Cordeiro.      \u201cIt would be particularly good if you could recruit judges,\u201d Ginsburg wrote in February. He added that a secretary for one judge had asked about whether the institute would pay for business class flights for others. A few days later, Cordeiro responded by saying he had recruited seven judges.      In a written statement, Cordeiro said that he was an academic as well as a public servant so it \u201cis natural to be consulted about possible parties interested to take part in debates of this nature\u201d and that there is nothing wrong with recommending \u201cother public authorities for a renowned international academic conference.\u201d He said the institute has paid for his flights and accommodations in the past, but he has never received any other form of financial support.      Ginsburg did not respond to emails or a phone call seeking comment.      Separately, CADE said it was not aware of the institute\u2019s corporate donors and noted that its officials do not participate in training sponsored \u201cdirectly\u201d by private companies.      \u201cCADE has strict rules regarding the performance of its employees and that participation in events of any nature does not influence the work carried out within the scope of the municipality,\u201d the agency wrote.      In addition to the three separate investigations into Google dismissed by the tribunal last year, there are two open investigations into Google\u2019s handling of Android, its smartphone software, and Google\u2019s use of third-party content in Google News and Google Shopping.      Elizabeth Farina, president of CADE from 2004 to 2008, said there needed to be transparency about the source of the money and accountability for the staff who take part. When asked whether she would have let her staff attend conferences like the ones offered by the Global Antitrust Institute, Farina, who is now the chief executive of a consultancy, said no.      \u201cIn general, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42698505607</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FT-28N1-JCSC-J3DJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3096\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Salt Lake Tribune</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0001QUW</classCode><className>QUALCOMM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Most of the criticism directed at Facebook focused on the platform's impact on the 2016 election. Initially, concerns were raised about the ease with which false or misleading stories circulated through the platform, giving rise to the remarkably elastic term \"fake news.\" Then, it became clear that Russian agents used Facebook's advertising tools to target particularly vulnerable voters in key districts with false stories and ads designed to stoke racial and political tensions. Finally, the Cambridge Analytica story broke. More than 87 million users had their data harvested under false pretenses by the political consulting firm for the purpose of precision targeting of ads for a number of political campaigns. It was this last scandal that finally led to Zuckerberg's appearance before Congress. It also led to the short-lived #DeleteFacebook movement and to the company's drop in market value by $75 billion within the space of a week -- although their share price quickly recovered and is now nearly as high as it's ever been.</p><p>Zuckerberg's testimony was less than enlightening. Predictably, he excelled at the non-answer and the deflection of responsibility. What the congressional sessions chiefly revealed was that many members of Congress were not adequately prepared to question Facebook's CEO about his company's practices regarding privacy and user data, a dynamic that Zuckerberg used to his advantage. When Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah asked him how Facebook made money without charging its users, Zuckerberg, with well-calibrated bemusement, replied, \"Senator, we run ads.\" Those watching the hearings might have been forgiven for wondering whether their best interests were any better served by Congress than by the social media company that played fast and loose with their personal data.</p><p>Zuckerberg's testimony also served as a key moment in what has come to be popularly known as the tech backlash, or \"techlash.\" Facebook was not the only technology company dealing with mounting public criticism throughout 2017 and the early months of 2018. Last October, representatives from Google, Facebook, and Twitter appeared before Congress to answer questions about Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. This January, Apple was called upon by two major groups of investors to address the allegedly addictive nature -- particularly for children -- of its iPhones. In March, Uber and Tesla were in the public's critical eye for fatal accidents involving their autonomous vehicles, and YouTube was strongly criticized for disturbing content on its children's channel. Twitter has for months been criticized for allowing its service to be used by white supremacists and anti-Semitic hate groups. Algorithms used by corporations and civil institutions to help determine everything from loan eligibility to criminal sentencing have also been subject to greater scrutiny by scholars, journalists, and advocacy groups.</p><p>These public outcries over egregious cases of malevolent use of digital tools or of ethical negligence on the part of tech companies themselves have been reinforced by a steady chorus of mea culpas issuing from current and former Silicon Valley executives and designers. Many of these confessions have amounted to the belated admission that digital platforms driven by ad revenue models were designed for addiction in order to perpetuate the stream of data collected from users, a standard feature of what has come to be known as \"surveillance capitalism.\" Sean Parker, Facebook's first president and a co-founder of Napster, stated Facebook's early motivation plainly: \"How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?\"</p><p>These are the broad outlines of the tech backlash. But against what, exactly, is the backlash? Is it against the ascendency of technology as the driving principle of modern society? Are we in the midst of a radical reordering of the way individuals relate to the devices, processes, and systems that increasingly order their lives? A closer look will reveal something far more modest: a limited series of reactions to specific cases of carelessness or overtly unethical behavior by tech companies. Indeed, we have been here before -- recall, for example, the outrage in 2014 over Facebook's mood manipulation experiments on unsuspecting users -- and we have good reason to expect that the current tech backlash will not amount to the substantive critique of contemporary technology that we very much need. Although some have said, and not entirely without justification, that this time is different, early indications strongly suggest that the tech companies will successfully navigate the storm and that technology's place in contemporary society will be undisturbed.</p><p>The Magnificent Bribe</p><p>The tech backlash can be framed, in part, as a reaction to the technological accident. \"When you invent the ship,\" the French tech theorist Paul Virilio wrote, \"you also invent the shipwreck; when you invent the plane, you invent the plane crash.... Every technology carries its own negativity, which is invented at the same time as technical progress.\" This negativity, the ever-looming accident, is the potential for harm that every new technology inevitably brings into existence.</p><p>Along these lines, one type of critique of the Cambridge Analytica scandal described it as the event that should awaken the field of computer science to the ethical ramifications of its work, in the same way that other disciplines have had their own moral wake-up calls, some of them deliberate outcomes and others accidents. For chemistry, perhaps it was the invention of dynamite and later poison gas, for physics the atomic bomb, for civil engineering bridge and dam failures, for biology eugenics, and for medicine the infamous Tuskegee syphilis study. Now computer science has had its own moment of reckoning, should it choose to perceive it as such, one that should spur the development of a professional code of ethics and institutional safeguards against unethical design practices.</p><p>The tech backlash can also be understood as a backlash against corporations and bad actors rather than technology per se. The problem, on this view, does not lie with the nature of digital technology's progress, but rather with the corporations that have designed, developed, and deployed digital tech for the sake of their bottom line, or else with malevolent users who have used it to unethical ends. In their own often specious defense, companies or bad actors may then talk about \"accidents\" and \"unintended consequences\" in order to deflect and diffuse responsibility for their actions.</p><p>These interlocking framings of the tech backlash are not altogether wrong, but they are incomplete and sometimes misleading. Focusing on the technological accident or intentionally malicious use can obscure what matters most: how a technology, used well and as intended, ultimately settles into the taken-for-granted material infrastructure of our daily lives.</p><p>Technology is a key component of the material infrastructure of our moral and political lives. It is most consequential precisely when it fades from notice and assumes a taken-for-granted status. Accidents and malicious use, in fact, often have the effect of foregrounding technologies and systems that have become invisible to us precisely because of their smoothly functioning ubiquity. We may be momentarily discomfited by the newly perceived fragility or vulnerability of the technologies upon which we depend; rarely, however, do we reconsider the nature and extent of our dependence.</p><p>Lewis Mumford, in the 1964 article \"Authoritarian and Democratic Technics,\" warned of a \"magnificent bribe\" at the heart of modern technology. Although its democratic aspects are \"highly favorable,\" it is nevertheless authoritarian:</p><p>\"Under the democratic-authoritarian social contract, each member of the community may claim every material advantage, every intellectual and emotional stimulus he may desire, in quantities hardly available hitherto even for a restricted minority: food, housing, swift transportation, instantaneous communication, medical care, entertainment, education. But on one condition: that one must not merely ask for nothing that the system does not provide, but likewise agree to take everything offered, duly processed and fabricated, homogenized and equalized, in the precise quantities that the system, rather than the person, requires.\"</p><p>It is a compelling image that helps us understand why tech backlashes, however powerful they may sometimes appear, never amount to much. It may be too late to refuse the bribe altogether -- but we would do well to understand its terms if we are to make sense of our situation and the possible futures available to us.</p><p>How the Tech Backlash Fails</p><p>Social media platforms are the most prominent focal point of the tech backlash. Critics have understandably centered their attention on the related issues of data collection, privacy, and the political weaponization of targeted ads. But if we were to imagine a world in which each of these issues were resolved justly and equitably to the satisfaction of most critics, further questions would still remain about the moral and political consequences of social media. For example: If social media platforms become our default public square, what sort of discourse do they encourage or discourage? What kind of political subjectivity emerges from the habitual use of social media? What understanding of community and political action do they foster? These questions and many others -- and the understanding they might yield -- have not been a meaningful part of the conversation about the tech backlash.</p><p>We fail to ask, on a more fundamental level, if there are limits appropriate to the human condition, a scale conducive to our flourishing as the sorts of creatures we are. Modern technology tends to encourage users to assume that such limits do not exist; indeed, it is often marketed as a means to transcend such limits. We find it hard to accept limits to what can or ought to be known, to the scale of the communities that will sustain abiding and satisfying relationships, or to the power that we can harness and wield over nature. We rely upon ever more complex networks that, in their totality, elude our understanding, and that increasingly require either human conformity or the elimination of certain human elements altogether. But we have convinced ourselves that prosperity and happiness lie in the direction of limitlessness. \"On the contrary,\" wrote Wendell Berry in a 2008 Harper's article, \"our human and earthly limits, properly understood, are not confinements but rather inducements to formal elaboration and elegance, to fullness of relationship and meaning. Perhaps our most serious cultural loss in recent centuries is the knowledge that some things, though limited, are inexhaustible.\"</p><p>We also often fail to question our commitment to the power of tools and technique. The Cambridge Analytica scandal revolved around the unethical manner in which data was collected from unsuspecting Facebook users by exploiting Facebook's terms of service as well as around Facebook's complicity and failure to acknowledge responsibility for its role in the affair. When Zuckerberg appeared before Congress, the few pointed questions he was asked also centered on Facebook's responsibility to protect user data. While privacy is clearly important, the questions offered little concern about the legitimacy or advisability of data-driven politics -- about the acquisition and exploitation of voter data and the manipulation of increasingly sophisticated means of precision advertising. No one seemed to worry that the political process is being reduced to this type of data sophistry. While Congress rightly condemned a particularly nefarious method of data acquisition, the capture of political life by technique remained unchallenged.</p><p>This line of questioning opens up a broader set of concerns about the project to manage human life through the combined power of big data and artificial intelligence. In an earlier age, people turned to their machines to outsource physical labor. In the digital age, we can also outsource our cognitive, emotional, and ethical labor to our devices and apps. Our digital tools promise to monitor and manage, among other things, our relationships, our health, our moods, and our finances. When we allow their monitoring and submit to their management, we outsource our volition and our judgment. We seem incapable, however, of raising any deeper concerns than whether the terms of service are intelligible and our data secure.</p><p>The tech backlash, in other words, leaves untouched the consequences of technologies that are successfully integrated into our social milieu. From this perspective, the tech backlash is not so much a rejection of the machine, to borrow an older, more foreboding formulation, but, at best, a desire to see the machine more humanely calibrated. It reveals, in fact, how deeply committed we are to our technologies. It reveals as well how thoroughly our thinking and our public debates unfold within parameters determined by a logic that may justly be called technological.</p><p>Consider some of the proposed remedies that have emerged in connection with the tech backlash. In the immediate aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, a spontaneous movement began on Twitter using the hashtag #DeleteFacebook. It gained modest traction and spurred online debates about the moral and political merits of abstaining from the platform. A number of prominent tech writers, notably Siva Vaidhyanathan, a University of Virginia media scholar and author of the forthcoming Antisocial Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy, argued that individual decisions to abandon the platform were ineffective and even counter-productive. Vaidhyanathan, among others, argued that deleting Facebook was a privilege that many users, especially those in developing countries for whom Facebook provides their only access to the Internet, could not afford. \"If the people who care the most about privacy, accountability and civil discourse evacuate Facebook in disgust,\" Vaidhyanathan wrote in a New York Times op-ed, \"the entire platform becomes even less informed and diverse.\"</p><p>Ultimately, the movement sputtered, proving the critics partly right. Less than a month after the scandal became public in mid-March, a widely reported survey of 1,000 Americans (not all of whom had Facebook accounts) found that nine percent claimed to have deleted their accounts. A reporter for TechRadar did the seemingly incredible math -- apparently 19 million Americans had deleted their accounts. The implication was dubious, as the survey did not specify a timeline, or ask users about their response specifically to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Indeed, the latest publicly available analytics reports actually suggest an increase during April in the number of U.S. Facebook users compared to the previous year, and rising daily use compared to March. Moreover, as noted earlier, Facebook's stock price has already fully recovered. The bribe remained too enticing for the vast majority of users and investors.</p><p>Those who find deleting Facebook an inadequate and unrealistic response often present regulating the big tech companies as the only way forward. It is almost certainly true that individual decisions by consumers will not lead to meaningful reform of the tech industry. It is also true that the tech companies are unlikely to regulate themselves in the best interest of their users. Where regulatory interventions can secure more just and equitable outcomes, they ought to be pursued. Mark Zuckerberg himself has said that government regulation is \"inevitable.\" Questions remain, however, about the scope of such regulations and whether or not there is sufficient political will and competence to make them a reality.</p><p>More importantly, legal remedies will not address the deeper and abiding moral and political consequences of digital tech. Not every problem with technology is amenable to legal or political remedy, especially when the contours and contexts of political debate have already been shaped by the technologies in question.</p><p>A More Humane Technology?</p><p>One of the more interesting responses to emerge in connection with the tech backlash is the founding of the Center for Humane Technology. The center is principally the work of Tristan Harris, one of the most prominent former Silicon Valley insiders now working to reform the industry. The center aims \"to realign technology with humanity's best interests\" and focuses its work on the erosion of human attention, on technology that \"hijacks our minds.\" By \"creating humane design standards, policy, and business models that more deeply align with our humanity and how we want to live,\" the center hopes to solve the problems Silicon Valley has created.</p><p>On its website, the center outlines four planks of action: inspiring humane design, applying political pressure, creating a cultural awakening, and engaging tech industry employees. In many respects, its efforts embody the best the tech backlash can offer. Its vision, however, presupposes broad public agreement about what exactly constitutes more humane technology. It trades, in other words, on a shared vision of human flourishing that may not actually exist. It speaks of \"our humanity\" and \"how we want to live,\" but it is not altogether clear that it offers a meaningful answer to the questions of what constitutes humanity, of how we want to live, of what we means. It is not clear either that the center has reckoned with the power of the magnificent bribe.</p><p>Moreover, as is the case with regulation, so also with the center's efforts: As useful as they may prove to be, they will not finally touch upon the deepest consequences of our emerging technologies. They do not raise the most searching questions that should be asked of any technology, particularly those that impact the lives of hundreds of millions of users worldwide. They take for granted the existing configuration of the techno-human milieu and that it must proceed, more or less, along the same trajectory. Their aspirations, bold as they may seem, are in reality modest. They amount to a recalibration of the system, not a challenge or reimagining.</p><p>This is unfortunate, for the center does come close to what is really needed: a way toward a more humane technology. But it has not accounted for the relationship between modern technology and the liberal democratic project. Liberal democracy professes a fundamental neutrality regarding competing visions of the good life, offering instead to protect basic human rights while creating the context for individuals to flourish with maximal freedom. In the space created by this professed neutrality, modern technology has flourished, unchecked by a robust and thick understanding of human flourishing. Paradoxically, modern technology may now be undermining the assumptions, social structures, and institutions required by liberal democracy.</p><p>The tech backlash, emerging as it has within this centuries-old trajectory, will not achieve the perspective necessary to offer a substantive evaluation of our technological disorders. The critique emanates from within the system, assumes the overall beneficence of the system, and serves only to maximize the system's power and efficiency by working out its bugs. Meanwhile, the big tech companies can rest ever more assured of their ability to withstand an occasional public battering and emerge unscathed so long as the bribe remains sufficiently enticing. So far, the tech backlash seems likely not to weaken the tech industry but to strengthen it, enhancing the power of the present techno-social configuration.</p><p>This is not, however, a case for either inaction or despair. It is, rather, a plea to make the most of the present moment when the curtain has been pulled back ever so slightly on the industry that does so much to shape our world. A backlash will not be enough; by definition it is sudden and fleeting and its course is determined by the forces against which it reacts. What is needed is a more sustained and clear-eyed reconsideration of our situation and a renewed capacity to imagine alternative configurations of the technological order.</p><p>***</p><p>L. M.

nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors contemplating the outlook for technology stocks will forever remember 1999 and 2000, when a wave of hype drove the valuations of companies engaged in the provision of new technology to all time highs, and then to crushing lows. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since the end of the global financial crisis a fresh burst of optimism has gripped the US tech sector, aided by plentiful liquidity, and several of the largest US technology companies are among the largest businesses on earth, while also leaving behind a trail of sceptical investors, concerned about the valuations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                     FANG stocks                   </p><p>Tom Slater, head of US equities at Baillie Gifford, and manager of several funds that have large exposures to US technology stocks, and specifically the group of companies known as the FAANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google, although not everyone includes Apple, which makes the group 'FANG').</p><p>He says the major difference for investors now when compared with 1999 is that: \"In 1999, really the challenge the investor in technology stocks faced was to try to pick the companies that would win from the rise of new technology, but the difference now is that when it comes to technology, we know who the winners are, so it is not like 1999 at all.\"</p><p>The outperformance from the FANG stocks was as a result of huge and unexpected - by market standards - disruption-led growth --- Tom Wildgoose, Nomura</p><p>Charles Jones, who runs the Waverton Global Equity fund said: \"The attractiveness of the internet is that a small amount of capital can be used to deliver a strong value proposition to customers and build a large business extremely quickly, generating high returns on capital and a very great deal of money for investors.\" </p><p>To varying degrees, all of the FANG stocks have capitalised on this.</p><p>Many of the 'old tech' companies were founded before the creation of the internet and have either manufactured physical computing equipment or sold software under licence.</p><p>The 'old tech' businesses which have flourished, most notably Microsoft, have worked hard to sustain or improve their value proposition through investing in ever more impressive hardware, or delivering software in more efficient ways to the end customer (more recently through cloud infrastructure and the Software-as-a-Service model). </p><p>The continued advances in not only consumer and enterprise technology but also industrial automation, will likely remain rapid and a key source of ongoing efficiencies for customers, so that any technology business with a strong or improving value proposition should be able to continue to grow profitably and remain a winner for adviser portfolios.</p><p>Conversely, any business which fails to sustain its value to customers may be a very poor investment.</p><p>In 2019, Netflix has been the weakest performer since the arrival of new consumer streaming services has eroded its value to the customer, whilst Microsoft and Facebook's value proposition has remained strong (despite regulatory concerns around the latter) and they have delivered significant share price appreciation to investors. </p><p>In short, it is perhaps better to avoid thinking of 'FANG' vs 'Old Tech', and focus on how much a company's product or service is desired by its customers.</p><p>Tom Wildgoose, who runs the Nomura Global High Conviction fund says: \"As is the case in any sector, you need to be stock specific in your tech sector analysis.</p><p>\"The outperformance from the FANG stocks was as a result of huge and unexpected - by market standards - disruption-led growth.</p><p>\"Investors simply did not anticipate the impact of these companies, however this is much better understood now, so such dramatic outperformance seems unlikely.</p><p>\"Amazon is still on very high valuation multiples and continued outperformance looks challenging, although this has been the case before.</p><p>\"Netflix is a similar case; again the growth was better than generally expected.</p><p>\"From here, Amazon's business looks more defensible than Netflix, which is a positive for the stock, but such high valuations make neither look attractive to us.\"</p><p>James Thomson, who runs the Rathbones Global Opportunities fund is another global equity manager who is keen on the shares of large US technology companies, though he believes that the company's that will do best in future have somewhat different characteristics to those that have done well to date.</p><p>                     US advantage                   </p><p>He said: \"The enormous advantage the US companies have in terms of technology is not going away, it is a permanent advantage, and as businesses they are very attractive, with lots of recurring revenue and high profit margins.</p><p>\"Amazon have spent a lot of money growing their business, and that is a stock we own.</p><p>\"We also own Microsoft, they have started to win a lot of business clients for their cloud computing business, we like that they are winning business clients, and think generally it is an attractive area of growth for companies in the future.\"</p><p>But while Mr Thomson is optimistic about the prospects for the largest US technology companies over the long-term, he is more cautious about the shorter-term outlook.</p><p>This is because the share prices of the big US technology companies have benefited from the popularity of the growth style of investing over the past decade.</p><p>The growth style of investing tends to do best when interest rates and GDP growth are relatively low.</p><p>This benefits technology companies in two ways.</p><p>The first is that most of those businesses do not pay dividends, something which matters less when interest rates are low, because investors who could choose to place the cash in the bank to receive interest payments, have less incentive to do so, and so are more likely to place it in equities.</p><p>But after a ten year positive run for growth equities, the second half of 2019 has been a different story, as the value equities have performed better, and as optimism that the US may avoid recession has grown.</p><p>Mr Thomson said if this trend continues then it is likely that big tech stocks will underperform relative to the rest of the market.</p><p>Andrew Cole, multi-asset investor at Pictet said: \"One further factor that might take some of the shine off the FANG stocks in the year ahead is the increasing importance of ESG factors to a growing proportion of investors.</p><p>\"Governance issues exist in a number of the more highly valued areas of the market and we've seen these concerns damage the pricing of both public and private companies, looking to IPO, in recent months.</p><p>\"Isn't it likely that given increased ESG pressures that it is those companies that tick the biggest ESG boxes, where investors will be happier paying increasing multiples?\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata
