one where they definitely it was a huge missed out and the with their handling it is adding gas needs for growing fire past the problem is that I'm not coming out here and we try to assuage always here and more investors and users dad to worry and you can see a politician rhetoric and grandstanding start to continue that could lead to potential oversight any impact on the habitat and mud which the golden goose here Danielle very very briefly what does Facebook and what does not like they need to do now the need to need investors user's field but there's a power on the plane have their arms around situation the continent's security you're not gonna be an issue going forward and this will be something that would be more than a blip on the radar rather the start of a broader issue with the platform it this is a pivotal time for these book to hand all users investors as well as regulators students OK Daniel Ives good to get your point of view Thank you very much joining us from new Jersey well in the next half hour we'll be live at the British Parliament in London now that's because former Facebook operations manager Sandy miraculous will be telling Parliament what he knows about the company's use of private data more bad news for Facebook because it's one of the big tech firms who could face much bigger tax bills in the European Union the likes of Amazon Google and Apple would also be affected the proposals to tax online sales would apply to companies with global revenues of over 750 million EURO that's about 920 million dollars now just 3% rate is being talked about and that could raise over 6 billion dollars a year the European commissioner responsible for taxation <person><nameText>Pierre Moscovici </nameText></person>has been telling the BBC why the changes are needed every Physical presence so the result is that as far as we know those companies face something like 9% corporate tax while the rest of the economy but he's 23% and the there is a problem of a level playing field a problem fairness and equity era and it cannot go on that way those companies need to be their fair share of tax Let's talk now to carry stone has a corporate tax lawyer at Mishcon de Reya Kerry Thanks so much for joining us this new system although it's an interim system seems to make a lot more sense doesn't it correct me if I'm wrong it means that these companies will be taxed on the revenues they make within that country as opposed to tax according to whether headquarters are Yes exactly and judicially corporate tax regime works so that companies have been taxed when they have people on the ground or offices and there is a it pays for a longer-term crash was also announced this morning to change the basis of that taxation says a digital presence that will be taxed in the meantime the EU because of the concerns mentioned are introducing an interim measure of this the digital tax which will apply to revenues However not profits and of the companies that crash caused a little bit of alarm hasn't it in some places the fact the architect revenues better profit explain us Yes but the difference this all profits are the pace costs figure for the company so here they are just looking at the actual resonate refuge generated by digital users costs and not taking into account costs and there's also a little bit of concern about potential for double taxation so if he unilaterally introduce the tax there's more taxing year but these global entities are they don't have a credit elsewhere probably not in the short term and some of the concerns also gave to how the US and other jurisdictions I react we have some breaking News actually carry the last few minutes and this coming from The European Commission proposal the that the levy on tax of companies digital companies is ill judged in the absence of globally agreed rules That's according to Ireland's prime minister it he's calling ill judged its highly unsurprising that Ireland will come out and say his ill judged because countries like Ireland and Luxembourg make a lot of money don't they from these big companies having their headquarters with the country's and pain that level of tax absolutely there's low tax jurisdictions such as Let's make an island who are going to have to prove these measures if they are to be accepted that may be a problem for the EU and the this may cause issues for them and he's saying Irish Prime Minister is saying I will strongly argued the European Union should wait for the OECD to complete its work before deciding how to act we are still waiting we for an interim solution from before the OECD comes out with its results absolutely as per a report published by the OECD last week they are proposing next next year

seems incredibly naive to think that this wouldn't at some point all come out Yes especially because they've actually been fined previously for security breach sort of refined in new York in 2014 security breach then so even having been fired find previously for breached the still not tighten up their security and technical details are emerging show that they've had some lax security hackers didn't need to do anything too sophisticated to breach security Sir the got a lot of questions that need to ask him we've seen the Uber go through various scandals including previous data issues we've seen other big tech companies suffer big hacks like this you think a company like Uber can bounce back from this kind security breach for is this somehow different this time round this will be very embarrassing through the day they will probably fares and very large fines who though inquired a privileged position in many places they are pretty much a monopoly in terms of the service they provide some people do like the convenience of Uber and they have shown how they can do the right thing and and fully disclosed and co-operate with authorities and is an opportunity with a new CEO of them to do that and the staff to scratch OK well I'll watch every twist and turn an interest in and from GCSE Thank you very much indeed rights I don't how you make calls perhaps through WhatsApp audio past FaceTime audio perhaps it's People well we will turn our attention to Sky because the internet calling messaging service is the latest one to fall Foul of Chinese regulators they forced its removal from Apple and Android apps schools in the country the authorities are stepping up their monitoring of the communications Sky so Microsoft says it is working to get the service back up and running as our correspondent Stephen McDonell reports now from Beijing so Chinese officials had decided to try and prevent their citizens from accessing Skype this follows similar moves in recent times with WhatsApp and other communications apps what this is about is trying to reign in use on any communication platforms not fully controlled by the Communist party in the case of Skype the blocking occurs by pressuring companies into removing it from the app stores and the suppliers to Apple and also enjoyed services it is a similar motivation which led to the blocking of example Twitter and Facebook he if the years of not there was a time here when people used to think that Skype was that safe way to communicate away from prying eyes in the EU is a Chinese officials I'm not sure how this place that view really has been otherwise Scott owners Microsoft so they are working hard to get the service back up and running in China another problem with that is the only way they're going to be able to do that officially is to allow Chinese censors Charlie's officials to listen in on Skype communications are not sure what Skype users will think of that and also not sure what sort of impact that might have on Skype's international reputation Stephen McDonnell Let's round up some other business News for now I will stick with China because that is where the tech giant Apple says it is stopping some students from working in Overtime one of its suppliers factories in China the teenagers had volunteered for extra hours of box being paid but that was in breach of local laws the UK finance Minister Philip Hammond has set out the government's economic and spending plans in the autumn budget he warned that growth will slow to 1.5 % this year compared to the previous forecast of 2% feels said he's setting aside a further 4 billion dollars to prepare for the country's departure from the European Union and US jobs figures now the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week to 200 and 39000 signalling a steady job growth after recent hurricane related disruptions benefit claims have risen in recent weeks due to a backlog of people claiming in Puerto Rico after Hurricanes and Maria Let's take a look at how the markets are doing so the FTSE 100 in London and it is high by almost half a % it growth before the finance minister delivered his budget and has

The headlines: Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in Venezuela on a day of rival demonstrations. Police used pepper spray against supporters of the opposition leader, Juan Guaido, in the capital Caracas, while a huge number of pro-government demonstrators also gathered in the city. Dozens of civilians have been evacuated from Baghouz, the last village still held by the Islamic State group in Syria. </p><p>At least four trucks carrying people left the village on Saturday. Western-backed Syrian Democratic Forces are poised to resume their final push on the area. And R Kelly has been released from prison after the payment of more than $160,000 in overdue child support. The singer has previously spent three nights in jail after being charged in four sex abuse cases, allegations he denies. Internet users should have greater control over personal data to ensure their own safety online. It's part of a proposal to change the way big tech companies are regulated. It follows a report from a House of Lords committee which says companies are failing to regulate themselves effectively. Our business correspondent Rob Young has more. Molly Russell was 14 years old when she took her own life in 2017. She had viewed graphic images of ourselves harm online. Her father has said he believes social media was partly to blame for her death. There had been growing concerns about content and behaviour online and calls for companies to do more. I think that lots of people feel powerless in this situation, but of course we can act, we are a nation state, Parliament sovereign as we are at discovering in the Brexit process. We can legislate if we need to. It would be far better to do it in concert with social media companies. If we think they should to things they are refusing to do, then we can and must legislate. The House of Lords Communications committee says the industry is responsive been piecemeal and inadequate, so the committee is calling for big tech to be reined in. There are more than a dozen UK regulators covering the digital world, but no-one body has complete oversight. The Lord's recommend the creation of a new digital authority. It also wants protection is given to people in the real world to apply online. One key principle for regulation would be respect for privacy to keep our growing volume of online data safe. There is also a call for a classification framework similar to that for films. The government is currently working on its own plans to more strictly regulate web companies. Internet firms say they work hard to keep their services free, and some of the most serious issues people recognise. More needs to be done to address potential online harms. Rob Young, BBC News. Now on BBC News, the actor-director Kenneth Branagh is Talking Movies in the second part of a special interview for the programme's 20th birthday. Hello from New York. I'm Tom Brook. In Talking Movies, a special edition to celebrate our 20th anniversary, a conversation with top British actor and director Kenneth Branagh on the changes that have taken place in the film industry during the time that Talking Movies has been on the air. Kenneth Branagh joined a special event in New York to mark Talking Movies' two decades on the air. The audience, a media crowd, including former members of the production team, got to sample excerpts of the show going right back to 1999. Hello from New York. I'm Tom Brook. In today's programme, Tim Robbins' new political comedy, Cradle Will Rock. Now, let's move on to the digital revolution and the impact it's having on the film industry. The writer's strike has dominated the news. Members of the Writer's Guild of America downed tools. Hello and welcome to Austin in Texas. I'm Tom Brook. During its existence, Talking Movies has covered many key developments in cinema, from the changing status of movie stars to the rise of the streaming services to demands for gender equality in the industry. Over the years, big names have given their views. Why shouldn't women get paid? I mean, we're not in the Stone Ages anymore. We've burned all the bras, we've gone through that, it's equality. If a person does equal amount of work and does it just as well, then absolutely. I've covered the movie industry very much from the outside, but how does somebody influential, a key figure working on the inside of the industry, view the changes of recent years? Well, let's have a very big round of applause for Sir Kenneth Branagh.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-0fa0498ea3aa487f9ab720707b909fa5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKW-WC81-JBH6-C4HR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"802\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Not what you were expecting? Let me explain why. There's only so much we can do standing on a stage delivering presentations, leading discussions in meetings or writing about what should be done to combat these issues that have plagued our industry for so long. Talk is cheap; now is the time to act.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If 2017 was the year of scandal, then 2018 was all about consolidation; we needed to rebuild the framework and establish new benchmarks of trust. Yet somewhere along the way we've lost our nerve, and in today's ever-changing landscape, standing still is as good as</p><p>moving backwards. Becoming better digitally</p><p>doesn't just happen overnight; it takes working with the right partners to challenge, guide and show the true value that this new technology can yield if you don't hold back. As an industry, we're finally moving beyond the blame game (despite what the headlines would have you believe) and looking at the big picture, where being compliant doesn't automatically mean playing it safe. This goes hand-in-hand with what I've talked about a lot so far in 2019: the importance of adopting a pioneer mindset. Not only will this allow you to break new ground and thrive in this digital age, but it frees you from the constraints of traditional thinking too.</p><p>Look, I'm not expecting miracles in one go, but adopting a 'wait and see' mentality isn't a viable strategy either. For starters, the pace of change is too quick and if you aren't prepared, you risk being left behind. Let me be clear, though, there has to be a fundamental shift in the way you think and operate, seizing the opportunity when it presents itself,</p><p>and embracing, rather than fearing new technology.</p><p>This is where everyone in the advertising ecosystem needs to play their part in realigning perceptions and setting the record straight on what the digital world looks like today. The hesitancy to think programmatic-first comes from some misguided and outdated perceptions about its capabilities, as buzzwords have dominated headlines and been used in the worst possible context to crank up anxiety.</p><p>Creating a brand-safe environment is a collective concern for all stakeholders, which means equal responsibility in how we go about this. We need to educate, inform and show progress to rebuild trust and transparency in the ecosystem overall, and deploying the right ad-tech solutions will be key to this aim. We've seen things like Ads.txt for digital and code libraries specifically for mobile that</p><p>have helped to regulate unauthorised inventory sales, adding additional protection for advertisers and contributing to a better cost-effective process overall. But we can still do more and should keep pushing forward to address issues head-on.</p><p>The biggest challenge we face right now is the growing battle to convince users to hand over their data. This month marks one year since GDPR came into play. Looking back, the mass scramble to get up to code ahead of implementation has calmed, and if anything has opened up the discussion around data privacy all the more. In the region, the IAB GCC will be looking to more advanced markets in adopting policies that will fit our local nuances, but this isn't likely to take shape until 2020. The more immediate and global concern is this: if the same type and kind of user data can't be accessed as freely as it once was, then it will be</p><p>a game-changer for everyone in the supply chain.</p><p>If users are to be the gatekeepers, then the rules of engagement will need to change and a bargain will need to be struck. Users should understand and appreciate the benefits of data-driven advertising, just as publishers and advertisers must be transparent in how their data is used. There's a trade-off for all parties, but convincing users of intention is a continuous uphill struggle, especially when big tech continues to come under fire.</p><p>Take Facebook. Revenue-wise, it is still flying, pulling in $15.08 billion in revenue for Q1, up 26 per cent year-over-year compared with Refinitiv's consensus estimates, but stagnating user growth on its own platform (Instagram is another story) and seemingly endless data breaches have dented its once dominant position. It's not like it's the only one facing these issues; it's just been unfortunate enough to be made an example of. A lot. However, Facebook still remains the best way to reach audiences, its global reach unrivalled, so don't write it off just yet because I'll tell you this: Zuckerberg won't go down without a fight. From new regulation to a redesign of the platform, Facebook 2.0's expected pivot to privacy will shift the landscape once again.</p><p>And herein lies both the problem and the opportunity, depending on your point of view. To become a leader in your field, calculated risks are a necessity. The market isn't going to slow down for you to keep pace, which is why it all comes back down to business mindset. A pioneer will tear down walls, define new territory and find new ways to navigate this evolving digital terrain. The time has come to shake up the system and leave a new legacy behind. I'm all in, now it's over to you.</p><p>BY AYMAN HAYDAR, CEO, MMPWW</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAMPME-145449104</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAMPME2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W6T-J601-F11P-X3WK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">363103</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"869\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Motivate Publishing Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

Here's the sign-up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  For <person><nameText>Wells Fargo, </nameText></person>the hits keep coming</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The penalties that the Federal Reserve meted out today -- replacing four directors and limiting the bank's growth -- are big. But they're also just the latest in a series of rebukes amid scandals over the lender's practices over the years.</p><p>  To recap:</p><p><person><nameText>Wells Fargo </nameText></person>was hit by a record $185 million fine for fraudulently opening customer accounts to churn up fees.</p><p>   President Trump, who had promised to rein in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (one of the regulators that had punished <person><nameText>Wells Fargo</nameText></person>) said that the agency's fines against the lender would not be reduced.</p><p>   The bank offered refunds to mortgage customers who were improperly charged fees.</p><p>   The bank's C.E.O. at the time, <person><nameText>John Stumpf, </nameText></person>was effectively ousted.</p><p>   About $75 million of compensation was clawed back from Mr. Stumpf and the former head of community banking, Carrie Tolstedt.</p><p>  What the Fed said in its statement today:</p><p>  The board's action will restrict <person><nameText>Wells Fargo's </nameText></person>growth until its governance and risk management sufficiently improves but will not require the firm to cease current activities, including accepting customer deposits or making consumer loans.</p><p>  And here's what Janet Yellen, in one of her final acts as Fed chairwoman, said of the latest punishments for <person><nameText>Wells Fargo</nameText></person>:</p><p>  ''We cannot tolerate pervasive and persistent misconduct at any bank and the consumers harmed by <person><nameText>Wells Fargo </nameText></person>expect that robust and comprehensive reforms will be put in place to make certain that the abuses do not occur again.''</p><p>  Shares in <person><nameText>Wells Fargo </nameText></person>were down nearly 6 percent in after-hours trading.</p><p>  How <person><nameText>Wells Fargo </nameText></person>will comply with the Fed's orders</p><p>  In a lengthy news release, the bank outlined a number of steps that it will take to satisfy the regulator's demands.</p><p>  Among them:</p><p>   Submitting plans to further improve both corporate governance and compliance operations</p><p>   Have third parties conduct reviews of those plans and how well they work</p><p>   Having another third party review risk management practices after the Fed's limit on asset growth is removed</p><p>  Here's what Tim Sloan, <person><nameText>Wells Fargo's </nameText></person>C.E.O., said:</p><p>  ''We take this order seriously and are focused on addressing all of the Federal Reserve's concerns. It is important to note that the consent order is not related to any new matters, but to prior issues where we have already made significant progress.''</p><p>  In the department of predictable things ...</p><p>  Peter Grauer, the chairman of Bloomberg L.P., disclosed today that he was stepping down as a director of the Blackstone Group. We can think of 20 billion reasons why.</p><p>  Stocks have their worst day since Brexit</p><p>  Rising anxiety over inflation and rising rates sent the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling 666 points, or 2.5 percent, its biggest one-day drop since the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union.</p><p>  The S&amp;P 500 fell 2.1 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 2 percent.</p><p>  The plunge marked a stark shift in investor sentiment. Stocks have glided higher for two years, lifted by solid economic growth and corporate profits, low interest rates and few signs of inflation.</p><p>  That smooth ride might now be ending.</p><p>  Climbing bond yields have weighed heavily on stocks this week. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury finished at 2.85 percent Friday, up from 2.66 percent a week ago, and at its highest level in four years. The Dow industrials finished the week off 4.1 percent, its biggest drop since January 2016.</p><p>  By historical standards, Friday's sell-off falls well short of some of history's biggest. In fact, it doesn't even crack the top 1,000, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. Here are the top five:</p><p>  1) -23.52 percent (12/12/1914)</p><p>  2) -22.61 percent (10/19/1987)</p><p>  3) -12.82 percent (10/28/1929)</p><p>  4) -11.73 percent (10/29/1929)</p><p>  5) -9.92 percent (11/06/1929)</p><p>  Jon Huntsman Sr., chemicals billionaire, has died</p><p>  Mr. Huntsman died this afternoon at the age of 80, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. He had been diagnosed with prostate cancer.</p><p>  He built his fortunes -- and his family's power within the state of Utah -- thanks to the fortunate marriage of chemicals and fast food. His chemical company won a contract to create a foam clamshell container for McDonald's Big Mac, a business win that turned Huntsman into an industrial powerhouse.</p><p>  He later turned to philanthropy, and in particular support for cancer research. He also was a founder of Huntsman Gay Global Capital, a private equity firm known today as HGGC.</p><p>  Mr. Huntsman is survived by his children, including Jon Huntsman Jr., the former Utah governor and presidential candidate, and Peter Huntsman, who now runs the Huntsman chemical company.</p><p>  Wage growth picks up</p><p>  The United States economy added 200,000 jobs last month, above the 180,000 Wall Street economists had expected, with strong job growth continuing in January.</p><p>  The numbers: </p><p>   The unemployment rate was at 4.1 percent, the same as in December and the lowest since 2000.</p><p>   Average earnings rose by 9 cents an hour and are up 2.9 percent over the past year.</p><p>   Revisions in the November and December figures produced a net loss of 24,000 jobs.</p><p>  The bigger picture</p><p>  Economists warned about reading too much into January's strong wage numbers -- several times during the recovery, wage growth has appeared to accelerate, only to fall back to earth. But they said there was little doubt that the latest numbers were an encouraging sign.</p><p>  Critics' corner</p><p>   ''Wage gains for non-supervisory workers is less headline worthy, being 2.4% Y/Y, but the underlying trend is still up. Greater growth in lower wage industries remains the underpinning of the jobs market,'' Steven Blitz of TS Lombard writes.</p><p>   ''In a rational world, this would be a major inflection point stimulating profound public debate, Congressional hearings and a Presidential commission to map out possible policy paths in an age of Artificial Intelligence. Instead all we get is an already tired juvenile discussion around who gets political credit for the secular improvement in job creation and the economy,'' Joseph Brusuelas of RSM US writes.</p><p>Dell is weighing a possible I.P.O. or merger with VMware</p><p>  The computer maker said it is considering an initial public offering or a combination with its publicly held subsidiary VMware, Reuters reported.</p><p>  The reasons</p><p>Dell is under pressure to increase profits after its debt-laden, $67 billion acquisition of the data-storage provider EMC Corporation in 2016.</p><p>   It faces increased competition in its core hardware businesses and from cloud-based services provided by Amazon, Microsoft and others.</p><p>  The context</p><p>Dell went private five years ago in a $24.9 billion deal with private equity firm Silver Lake Partners.</p><p>   In 2016, Dell bought EMC for $67 billion. EMC owned 81 percent of VMware, which was publicly traded.</p><p>  Is Apple about to go on a shopping spree?</p><p>  The iPhone maker holds $269 billion in cash abroad and has said it will be bringing the vast majority of that back home thanks to the new tax law.</p><p>  On Thursday's earnings conference call, the company indicated it won't be just sitting on that pile cash either.</p><p>  Here's what Luca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, said:</p><p>  ''Our current net cash position is $163 billion, and given the increased financial and operational flexibility from the access to our foreign cash, we are targeting to become approximately net cash neutral over time.''</p><p>  When asked about M.&amp;A., Mr. Maestri responded:</p><p>  ''The thought process is always to acquire something that allows us to either accelerate our product road maps, filling a gap in our portfolio, providing a new experience to customers. So it's always the customer experience in mind, right, that we make acquisitions. We look at all sizes, and we will continue to do so. We have plenty of financial flexibility, of course. We had that even prior to tax reform.''</p><p>Exxon's shares are having their worst day in six years</p><p>  Interest rate/inflation concerns might be driving the stock market's decline today, but Exxon Mobil isn't helping.</p><p>  The stock is down 5.8 percent Friday after its earnings fell short of analysts' expectations.</p><p>Exxon's shares have underperformed over the last 12 months even as the price oil has rebounded. The stock is 0.6 percent over the past year, compared with a 222 percent gain in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index.</p><p>  Critics' corner</p><p>   ''The big question still hanging over both Exxon and Chevron is whether the Big Oil model can thrive in shale at scale and actually deliver the return on capital their model demands,'' Liam Denning writes. (Gadfly)</p><p>   ''OPEC may be helping Big Oil stay sweet on crude for now. Last quarter's earnings flubs, though, signal companies may have more mess to come,'' Lauren Silva Laughlin writes. (Breakingviews)</p><p>CBS and Viacom may actually make a deal this time</p><p>  Both boards have agreed to form special committees to consider a merger. It's a big step toward a reunion of the two companies, which split in 2006.</p><p>  The context</p><p>   Shari Redstone, who with her father controls the two companies, has pushed since 2016 to bring them back together.</p><p>Disney's deal for the bulk of 21st Century Fox has again left media companies wondering whether bigger might not only be better, but necessary.</p><p>   The CBS chief, Les Moonves, is more open to a deal than the last time, though still wary.</p><p>  The big question: Could another company like Verizon jump in as a spoiler?</p><p>  Critics' corner</p><p>   Tara Lachapelle writes: ''CBS isn't safe from the industry's broad ratings pressure and subscriber declines, which is why scale is important. Viacom won't provide enough of it, but it will offer substantial cost-saving opportunities.'' (Gadfly)</p><p>   The analyst Rich Greenfield writes: ''CBS needs far greater scale and a recombination with Viacom is the most logical first step, albeit only a first step with several follow-on strategic moves needed (acquisitions or merger with an even larger entity).''

(BuzzFeed)</p><p>Amazon, Apple and Alibaba shine. Alphabet, not so much.</p><p>  The big takeaways from the big tech earnings day yesterday:</p><p>Apple sold fewer iPhones than expected in the quarter, but at higher prices, so profit was up 12 percent anyway. And it plans to spend almost all of its fabled cash hoard -- perhaps on a combination of buybacks and a big deal.</p><p>Amazon more than doubled its profit from a year ago, to $1.9 billion. This was the first time its earnings have surpassed $1 billion in a quarter.</p><p>   Alphabet reported a $3 billion loss, in part because of the tax law. But its results disappointed because of rising costs: It's spending to capture market share in smartphone searches.</p><p>   Alibaba's profit rose by a third, as the Chinese internet giant offered more and better services to vendors.</p><p>  Critics' corner</p><p>   ''Investors are warming to this less highflying but still steady version of Apple,'' Shira Ovide writes.

(Bloomberg)</p><p>   Christopher Thompson writes, ''Last month's profit warning meant investors knew what was coming, but Deutsche still managed to give them an unpleasant surprise.'' (Breakingviews)</p><p>  HNA's new money source: its workers</p><p>  The Chinese conglomerate has about $90 billion in debt from splashing out on things like Deutsche Bank and Hilton Hotels. Its borrowing costs are going up, and asset sales are becoming necessary -- it's under the gun to find more money.</p><p>  Which is why it appears to be asking employees for cash, according to Alexandra Stevenson and Cao Li of the NYT:</p><p>  In an email dated Jan. 4, one HNA unit told employees that it needed nearly $8 million to fund a duty free business. It advertised a 9.8 percent annualized interest rate. One week later, HNA's media and entertainment arm said it was looking to raise nearly $80 million from employees, pledging strong returns and a plan to build up the business.</p><p>  What Gary Cohn had to say about an infrastructure plan</p><p>  The White House adviser told Republican lawmakers at a retreat this week that infrastructure could be paid for in part by a new gas tax, according to Axios.</p><p>  But Jonathan Swan of Axios has heard skeptical noises:</p><p>  Top Republican sources tell me raising the gas tax seems unlikely given they've just passed a massive tax cut.

I'm John Vause.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Coming up on CNN NEWSROOM, with the U.S. seeing its deadliest day of the pandemic so far, the president turns his fire on the World Health Organization, threatening to withhold funding.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Britain's prime minister still in the ICU while the man who he deputized may not have authority to make key decisions without the approval of the cabinet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And in Wuhan, China, the place where the outbreak began, residents emerged from an 11-week long lockdown and take their first steps back to normality.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>VAUSE: We begin this hour in France, which has been on lockdown for almost a month but the death toll has continued to rise, now passing 10,000. Only three other countries have reached that threshold, Italy, Spain and the United States.</p><p>According to the French government, more than 1,400 people died Tuesday, the largest single day increase so far. Officials warn there is much worse to come.</p><p>By contrast, numbers out of Italy look promising with the lowest daily rate of new infections in almost a month. And Spain is expected to lift lockdown restrictions on Monday. The health ministry says they're looking to reopen parts of the economy, despite the number of new deaths and infections rising for the first time after declining for a week.</p><p>First, we head to France. Cyril Vanier is live.</p><p>To try and slow the spread of the virus, some cities and towns are even banning outdoor exercise.</p><p>CYRIL VANIER, CNN ANCHOR: We are now in the 4th week of this lockdown. Everybody here is looking for signs that it is getting better. Unfortunately, what we got yesterday evening from the health ministry was the exact opposite.</p><p>It was the highest daily death toll France has had since the beginning of this pandemic, topping 1,400 dead. I think that number tells us two things.</p><p>First of all, sadly, it was to be expected because we had seen a spike in the number of new patients about a week ago. You know there will be a lag between the number of new patients and the number of deaths that usually follow, several days later.</p><p>Secondly, this reveals a crisis within the crisis.</p><p>And we have only just understood how significant this is that is, what is happening in the care homes around the country for the sick and the elderly?</p><p>There's about 7,000 such care homes. Only a minority have been infected but those that have paid a very heavy price in terms of human lives. When the virus got into these establishments, we are talking about people who are 70, 80, 90, who also have health issues.</p><p>When the virus got into these establishments, it has spread very fast and it killed very fast. I was struck by the story, the account given by nurses, who would leave at the end of the day, a patient that they believed was virus free, expecting to see them the following day, only to hear a few hours later that that patient had passed due to the coronavirus.</p><p>The reason I mention this is because, of those 1,400 people, more than half of the deaths yesterday come from these care homes, the most vulnerable section of the population.</p><p>VAUSE: Cyril Vanier live with the latest from France.</p><p>We will hear from reporters across Europe in the hour ahead.</p><p>We have seen it in China, Iran, Italy and Spain. Once this virus takes hold, every day the death toll is worse than the day before. So it goes until it peaks.</p><p>In the U.S., many are wondering just how bad it will get before it gets better. According to Johns Hopkins University, the U.S. saw its deadliest day since the outbreak began. More than 1,900 lives lost on Tuesday. The overall American death toll is shy of 13,000. Confirmed cases are now above 400,000.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This will be very painful of a week. And, next week, at least part of next week but probably all of it. If one person dies, it is a painful week. And we know that is going to unfortunately happen, this is a monster. The strategy is totally working.</p><p>[02:05:00]</p><p>TRUMP: Every American has a role to play in winning this war. And we are going to be winning it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: The U.S. president also says he would love to reopen the country with a big bang. Nick Watt has more on the states that are dealing with the crisis and preparing for potential disaster.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NICK WATT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Today, in New York City, more than 800 deaths reported. Triple yesterday's total.</p><p>But here on the front lines, the new case count appears to be flattening.</p><p>DR. RODRIGO KONG, STATEN ISLAND UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL: For the past couple of days, discharging more patients than we are admitting. But this is actually the time when we should redouble our efforts.</p><p>WATT: The battle is not over. The war goes on. The NYPD just announced a 13th member has now died from the virus. And more than 500 New York fire department personnel have it.</p><p>ANTHONY ALMOJERA, FDNY EMS LIEUTENANT: And I'm still getting EMTs and medics call because they're upset -- they are upset they got sick, because they're not out here. I mean, that's -- I don't know what to say. I mean, that's who's taking care of you.</p><p>WATT: Nationwide numbers still rising.</p><p>DR. ASHISH JHA, DIRECTOR, HARVARD GLOBAL HEALTH INSTITUTE: A lot of the other parts of the country are not anywhere near flattening the curve. They're still rising exponentially.</p><p>WATT: Michigan one of few states keeping racial data. The black population there is around 14 percent, yet 40 percent of coronavirus deaths are in that black population.</p><p>TYRONE CARTER (D), MICHIGAN STATE REPRESENTATIVE: There's still a huge gap between races when it comes to health care and this is magnifying it.</p><p>WATT: In Chicago, black people make up 30 percent of the population, but 72 percent of COVID deaths; in Louisiana, similar numbers.</p><p>DR. CAMARA PHYLLIS JONES, FAMILY PHYSICIAN AND EPIDEMIOLOGIST: They are dying more, because they have -- our bodies have borne the burden of chronic disinvestment, active neglect in our communities. All of those insults on our bodies have given us more of these so-called pre- existing conditions, so once we are infected, we have more severe outcomes.</p><p>WATT: The administration is now looking for a light at the end of this tunnel.</p><p>DR. JEROME ADAMS, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL: Normal is going to be a different normal, whenever we do reopen. Once we get a vaccine, we can get more back to the way we treat flu season.</p><p>WATT: They are watching how other countries gradually reopen; just hours ago, severe lockdown restrictions were lifted in Wuhan. People are now allowed to leave. And four months after the first case in that city, China now claiming a whole day without a single COVID-19 death nationwide.</p><p>Here in California, the governor says the curve is bending and stretching. So it will peak sometime in May. In Los Angeles County, they've designated this stay home week. So we are a few weeks out from that peak.</p><p>So if we all stay home, hopefully, that peak will be as low as possible. Meantime, California is lending ventilators to other states in the U.S. that need them right now. These are loans, these are not gifts. The governor making it clear that, at some point, California might need them back -- Nick Watt, CNN, Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: In the middle of the global pandemic, the U.S. president has threatened to withhold funding from the World Health Organization. As he often does, President Trump walked that back moments later.</p><p>But he has complained for weeks that the WHO criticized his decision in late January to restrict travel from China. Now that complaint has now grown, Trump accusing the WHO of failing in every aspect of this pandemic. CNN's chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JIM ACOSTA, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: President Trump spent much of his press conference on the coronavirus blaming the World Health Organization for the pandemic. The president blasted the WHO, accusing them of \"calling it wrong\" when it came to the global impact the virus would have.</p><p>The president was also occasionally wrong about the pandemic himself, at times telling Americans the virus would disappear by this month. At one point during the briefing, the president said he halt U.S. funding to the WHO. When he was reminded that would come during a pandemic, the president seemed to back away from that idea. Here is what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We are going to put a hold on money spent to the WHO. We will put a very powerful hold on it and we will see.</p><p>QUESTION: Quick follow-up. Is the time to freeze funding to the WHO During a pandemic?</p><p>TRUMP: Maybe not. I am not saying I'm going to do it but we will look at it.</p><p>QUESTION: You did say that.</p><p>TRUMP: No I didn't. We will look at ending funding.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ACOSTA: The president also weighed in on a memo written back in late January by his trade adviser, Peter Navarro, who warned the coronavirus could become a deadly pandemic, leading to scores of deaths in the U.S.</p><p>The president said he had not seen the memo and didn't look for it. The president has described the coronavirus as an unforeseen problem in the past -- Jim Acosta, CNN, the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[02:10:00]</p><p>VAUSE: What would have happened if some countries had acted sooner?</p><p>Implemented a nationwide lockdown?</p><p>What if business leaders supported a shutdown of the economy?</p><p>What if instead of lashing out at political rivals, the country's leaders worked together?</p><p>What if officials had not played down the threat but warned of potential dangers?</p><p>That scenario is playing out in New Zealand, where the government reports the number of confirmed cases has dropped for a third day for a total of just over 1,200. And the death toll stands at one. Not 1,000, not 100, one. We are joined by the deputy prime minister of New Zealand.</p><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to be with us.</p><p>WINSTON PETERS, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND: You are welcome. Thank you for having me on.</p><p>VAUSE: When will the government know if it's the right time to start to ease off on these restrictions on movement?</p><p>There is a temptation I imagine to relax and help the economy and allow people to get back to their normal lives?</p><p>PETERS: The restrictions first went out on the 19th of March. They went to level 3 on the 23rd. Then we realized we should go to level 4. That is the top of the alert. We have 1,210 since it began. We started with 35 on the 19th of March. These were all from overseas connections.</p><p>Today, we have 12 in hospital, 4 in the ICU and one death. As you say, for the third day, the numbers are down. But we have to keep on testing people because absence of evidence is not evidence of the absence.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VAUSE: New Zealand in many ways might be a case study in what should be done during a pandemic.</p><p>Was there a moment the government looked at what was happening in Italy and Spain and saw the grim predictions and said, we have to do something differently?</p><p>PETERS: We looked at all the responses from different countries, Wuhan, for a start and then other countries. We tried to put together as much evidence as we could from that, going back to the Spanish flu of 1918, 101 years ago.</p><p>So we put the best knowledge we could together and tried to, at the same time, this is extraordinarily difficult, get an economic analysis of where this will go. And we are still trying to with heightened testing deal get a better feel for the actuality of this event in this country.</p><p>We don't want to be coming out of a level 4 to a lower level in the future because we could have made a mistake. With the level of public confidence and taking the public with us will be a serious issue here. So when we move, we want to know if we are moving with as much certainty as we can.</p><p>VAUSE: It seems the plan was essentially that a lockdown had to come sooner or later. And you may as well do it quick and right and make sure there is broad support across the country.</p><p>PETERS: You're right. We decided to go early and go real hard and put the message out and help as many people as possible. We tried to show that people's economic livelihoods were preserved so that we get cooperation to get on top of this.</p><p>We are all dealing worldwide with something we have yet to put our scientific finger on, so to speak. In the meantime, populations are critical and cooperation of the population is critical for our success. We know that and we are grateful to these people.</p><p>They are cooperating and staying at home, keeping a social distance of 2 meters and are trying collectively to beat this plague.</p><p>VAUSE: There has been a zero tolerance policy for violating the lockdown. One of those violators was a government minister, called out and demoted by the prime minister. I want you to listen to what she said. You have heard, it many viewers have not.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JACINDA ARDERN, NEW ZEALAND PRIME MINISTER: Under normal circumstances, I would sack the minister. What he did was wrong and there are no excuses. Disrupting our current plans to take on this global pandemic by removing the minister of health, in my mind, was not in the best interest of New Zealand.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: How important was that the prime minister showed the country that everyone is accountable no matter who they are?</p><p>PETERS: It was very important. I am sure the prime minister found this a very difficult moment. His colleagues, fellow cabinet ministers, find this difficult. It is hard to understand. It was an action that had to have a reaction from the highest level.</p><p>[02:15:00]</p><p>PETERS: But in this crisis of medical and health management it is still a priority for us. But we all make mistakes. We are going to make mistakes. But our job is to collectively learn from them. And the law applies to the highest in the country.</p><p>VAUSE: There has been this decision to include the leader of the opposition, the national party. In some ways, that has made this a national effort.</p><p>Has it removed a lot of the politics around this?</p><p>PETERS: Not entirely. And that is sad. But at least this is a committee where the they get to chair the committee and get to have the priority on the questions and it is an attempt in very conflated circumstances to hold the governors and ministers to account. It appears to be working but there is always a tendency, sad to say, for some people see political advantage during a crisis like this.</p><p>VAUSE: Before we go, the prime minister had some good news for children not just in New Zealand but around the world. Here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARDERN: You will be pleased to know that we consider both the Tooth Fairy and Easter Bunny to be essential workers. As you can imagine, at this time, they will be particularly quite busy at home with their families as well and their own bunnies.</p><p>So I say to the children of New Zealand, if the Easter Bunny doesn't make it to your household, then we have to understand that it's a bit difficult at the moment for the Bunny to perhaps get everywhere.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: My takeaway is that, amongst the lockdowns and regulations, there are moments of humanity as well.</p><p>PETERS: Exactly right. You have to keep a sense of proportion. You have to remain common sensed, focused, feet on the ground, eyes wide open. But human compassion is a very critical component at this time.</p><p>VAUSE: Mr. Peters, the deputy prime minister of New Zealand, thank you very much.</p><p>PETERS: Thank you very much.</p><p>VAUSE: Nervous eyes are on London this hour. Just ahead, the prime minister is still in hospital as the U.K. braces for what could be its worst days yet in the pandemic. With Boris Johnson ill, the foreign secretary is filling in but the lines of succession in the U.K. are more complicated than you may think.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>[02:20:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>VAUSE: To London now, where the British prime minister spent a second night in intensive care. Boris Johnson tested positive for the coronavirus almost two weeks ago. His declining health is adding to the anxieties of an already anxious nation. As the pandemic inches towards its peak in the U.K., there may be signs of hope.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PATRICK VALLANCE, U.K. SCIENCE ADVISER: It's possible we're beginning to see the start of a change where we might see numbers flattening off. We won't be sure about that for a week or so. And we need to keep looking at it but it does begin to suggest that things might be moving in the right direction.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: For more on the health of Boris Johnson, CNN's Max Foster at St. Thomas Hospital in London. That's where the prime minister is in the ICU -- Max.</p><p>MAX FOSTER, CNN LONDON CORRESPONDENT: The last update we had was 12 hours ago but it was more positive than previous updates because his condition had stabilized. He is not on a respirator. He doesn't have pneumonia. Let's wait and see what updates we get about his condition overnight.</p><p>This was his second night in intensive care. This is still a very serious situation. We also have the wider political concerns as well, the decisions that he cannot currently make. The big one looming is whether or not to review the lockdown currently in place in the United Kingdom. That decision is due next week.</p><p>Will Dominic Raab have to make a call on that?</p><p>Let's go to Nina dos Santos. Away from the immediate concerns of the prime minister's health, there are political questions which will arise every day, decisions the prime minister can only make.</p><p>NINA DOS SANTOS, CNNMONEY EUROPE EDITOR: That's right. Dominic Raab is deputizing as necessary but that doesn't necessarily mean he can encompass all of the tasks that are looming in the immediate future.</p><p>Those tasks will have to do with containing this coronavirus pandemic that, in the United Kingdom, you heard yesterday, according to the government, scientific advisers, maybe showing some signs of plateauing.</p><p>But that's only dependent on people adhering to the current rules, to stay inside your home, try and keep a far distance from other people and stick to those rules until the government tells you otherwise.</p><p>The problem they have is that we have a long Easter weekend looming. The weather has been pretty clement recently. That could tempt people outside. So far, things are holding. If they do, the government's scientific advisers hope this could be the start of a flattening curve.</p><p>Yesterday, we learned that more than 6,000 people are now dead in the United Kingdom because of coronavirus; 55,242 people have tested positive, 213,000 have been tested.</p><p>The country needs to ramp up those tests immediately for frontline workers of the National Health Service, who are most at risk and also traveling about. They have to get to their jobs, after all. They also need to mass text the population to have an idea of when it will be safety ease that lockdown and ease those restrictions -- Max.</p><p>FOSTER: Nina over there in Downing Street behind me. Thank you for joining us with that update.</p><p>Dominic Raab currently running the country; when required -- slightly murky this plan they have in place. The prime minister is in the hospital, he is still in charge. Then there is the question of who succeeds Dominic Raab if he gets the virus and ends up in a critical condition as well. Let's look at the murky succession plans with Nic Robertson.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Dominic Raab, now the U.K.'s de facto decision-maker, offers reassurance about the man he is deputizing for, Boris Johnson, in very good hands in a nearby hospital ICU.</p><p>DOMINIC RAAB, BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY: The government business will continue.</p><p>ROBERTSON (voice-over): The country, effectively in Raab's hands now, effectively because, unlike the United States, the U.K. has no constitutional line of succession, no codified constitution. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If Boris Johnson is elected as the leader of the Conservative Party...</p><p>ROBERTSON (voice-over): The country does not elect a leader. It elects a party, who pick their leader. That means it is the party's leader, Boris Johnson, who designates who takes his place.</p><p>Months ago, when drawing up his cabinet, he gave the nod to Raab as likely successor when he appointed him first secretary of state as well as foreign secretary.</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, U.K. PRIME MINISTER: I just want to say one crucial thing to everyone thinking about --</p><p>[02:25:00]</p><p>ROBERTSON (voice-over): Despite being increasingly ill over the past few days, Downing Street has insisted Johnson was running the country, only finally handing some leadership powers to Raab before going into ICU.</p><p>MICHAEL GOVE, BRITISH MINISTER FOR THE CABINET OFFICE: The prime minister has designated foreign secretary Dominic Raab as first secretary of state. That means he takes on the responsibilities of chairing the meetings the prime minister would have chaired. We are all working together to implement the plan the prime minister set out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTSON (voice-over): Beyond Raab, no steps of succession are guaranteed, the expectation is that, after him, the Chancellor of the Exchequer will go to the home secretary, Priti Patel, then Michael Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, will step up as needed. For now, the plan is clear according to Raab. The cabinet will work together following the prime minister's instructions.</p><p>RAAB: I have total confidence in the arrangements the prime minister has put in place so that I can discharge responsibility in deputizing for him while he is out of action. We hope that will be a limited period of time.</p><p>ROBERTSON (voice-over): Johnson is not the first to hand over powers. Churchill did in 1953, reluctantly following a stroke he managed to keep secret for a while. Margaret Thatcher for hand surgery, John Major for flu, Tony Blair for heart surgery, all relinquished decision-making powers, briefly and conventionally.</p><p>They designated replacements who duly stood aside on their return.</p><p>When Johnson returns remains an open question. Best-case scenario according to doctors could be a week, perhaps two, depending on his recovery. Until then, officials here insist the government can cope with any eventuality -- Nic Robertson, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) FOSTER: Nick was describing previous situations. But it is just not the same. It is much more serious. We don't know -- those other situations were hand surgery, for example. We don't know how this will end. We don't know how long he will have to convalesce for. So there are great minds trying to figure out who is actually in charge.</p><p>VAUSE: It is a troubling situation and the lack of information coming from Downing Street is not helping. Max, thank you.</p><p>When we come back, the coronavirus is killing African Americans at a much higher rate than any other ethnic group in the United States. Right now no one knows why.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>[02:30:00]</p><p>JOHN VAUSE, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Welcome back, everybody. There are signs of hope in Italy and Spain that maybe they've turned a corner in this fight against the Coronavirus. For more, Journalist Al Goodman is in Madrid, but we will start with CNN Contributor Barbie Nadeau in Rome. And Barbie, there's now this very difficult sort of balancing act. How much longer should these restrictions stay in place before the economy completely and totally collapses? How soon can factories restart without endangering lives from the virus?</p><p>BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: That's right. You know, all the papers this morning are talking about phase two and what that's going to look like. Currently, the lockdown is scheduled to end on Monday, April 13th, but nobody thinks that's going to happen. We're expecting to hear the Prime Minister later in the week layout what happens next.</p><p>And what they're discussing is how they could possibly open some of the factories and to kickstart the economy, and then eventually how they're going to let society back out. Now as this lockdown enters its second month, we're past 30 days now of the lockdown, you know, people are getting nervous about what's the -- what the future looks like. It's almost terrifying to go out again. You know, people are worried that contagion will start that it will just start all over, and we'll be faced with the same thing we were faced with a month ago.</p><p>So there's a lot -- a lot on the plate here, a lot on the table for the government to try to sort out but everybody's optimistic that we've turned the corner here in Italy, and that things are just going to keep getting better, John.</p><p>VAUSE: Barbie, thank you. Al, to you though in Madrid, what we're hearing from the government there, the numbers are fluctuating a small surge perhaps in the number of cases. But overall, they say, they expect that but the trend is what they're looking at, and that's downwards. AL GOODMAN, JOURNALIST: That's right. And they say that this slight increase in the number of deaths and new cases in the last 24 hour reporting period was due to probably a lag in the information coming into Madrid, from the Madrid regions. They're confident that the stabilization phase is on.</p><p>They're looking to phase two. The lockdown has been in place for almost a month. It's already been extended for another two weeks almost to the end of April. But the government is disclosing more plans about what has happens after all of this.</p><p>And the Spanish health minister at a press conference answering a question from CNN had this to say about what's coming after Easter. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SALVADOR ILLIA, HEALTH MINISTER, SPAIN: Next Monday, we are going to reopen some parts of our economy. We're going to go back to the situation we had at the beginning of our decree at the 14th of March. And we are taking out the appropriate measures to avoid a spike in the cases.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOODMAN: And the way that they're going to try to avoid an a spike in the cases is they gradually open things up as they're going to test he announced 60,000 Spaniards, a representative sample of the population over the next three weeks to determine just how deeply the Coronavirus has penetrated into the society and for people who are not showing symptoms.</p><p>So that will give them a chance of how they will open up, where they will open up, and they're expecting that this will give them more ideas, they say, on how quickly they can open up and get things back to normal. Right now, everybody's waiting to see how it's going to look on Monday after Easter. John?</p><p>VAUSE: OK, we will hold our breath and wait. Al, thank you. Al Goodman in Madrid, Barbie Nadeau in Rome, thanks to you both. The Coronavirus appears to be taking a greater toll on African Americans in the United States compared with every other ethnic group. This racial disparity has emerged from early data on COVID-19 fatalities in Louisiana, in particular. CNN's Ed Lavandera reports on some of the reasons why.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ED LAVANDERA, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Ronald Lewis embodied the soulful spirit of New Orleans. He led the Big 9 Social Club, which hosts epics second line parades around his Lower Ninth Ward neighborhood. Hurricane Katrina took his home, but friends say he came back and became like a godfather of New Orleans culture.</p><p>RACHEL BREURLIN, FRIEND OF RONALD LEWIS: To love New Orleans, he understood the complexity of New Orleans. He brought out the best in us in our ability to come together. LAVANDERA: On March 18, Lewis was rushed to the hospital. Two days later, he died. It wasn't until the day of his funeral that his family says they learned he was infected with the Coronavirus.</p><p>BREURLIN: That was shocking. You know, he had just gone into the hospital. And I still really haven't wrapped my mind around it all the way.</p><p>LAVANDERA: Ronald Lewis' family says the 68-year-old suffered from diabetes and was recovering from a mild heart attack last year, but they never thought the COVID-19 infection would take his life. The mortality statistics across the country aren't jarring. In Louisiana, African Americans make up 32 percent of the population, but make up slightly more than 70 percent of Coronavirus deaths.</p><p>In Michigan and Illinois, African Americans make up about 15 percent of the overall population, yet account for about 40 percent of COVID- 19 deaths.</p><p>COREY HEBERT, PHYSICIAN: This is an abomination, but it's not unexpected. And I want everyone to understand that New Orleans is a microcosm of every urban center in America.</p><p>LAVANDERA: Dr. Hebert has worked as a physician in New Orleans for 25 years. He broke down the factors contributing to the high death rate among African Americans. Underlying health issues like heart disease and diabetes are prevalent. And if you drive around New Orleans, it's easy to find poor neighborhoods where people don't have access to healthcare. Many of these neighborhoods are also food deserts, where the best grocery store might be the corner store. It's a recipe for disaster says Dr. Herbert.</p><p>[02:35:28]</p><p>HERBERT: When you are chronically oppressed, when you are chronically trying to get the scraps in the crumbs, that actually decreases your ability to have a good immune system because you're constantly in a fight or flight syndrome, constantly with cortisol levels and epinephrine levels because you don't know where your next meal is going to come from.</p><p>The odds of you say, I'm going to get some broccoli for that next meal versus, you know, a hamburger. That hamburger cost $0.99 and the broccolis $3.99 a bunch. You know that's a life or death situation for you, and some people just really don't understand it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So we're not worried about it at all.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's fake.</p><p>LAVANDERA: But as the Coronavirus started to spread around the world, social media conspiracy theories were spreading even faster.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Minority can't catch it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Minorities can't catch Coronavirus. LAVANDERA: Clips like these went viral. Medical experts worry this misinformation has kept and can keep many African Americans from getting life-saving information. Actor Idris Elba who announced in March he was sickened by the Coronavirus took to social media to fight back at the disinformation.</p><p>IDRIS ELBA, ACTOR: Please stop sending the conspiracy theory nonsense about black people not being able to get Coronavirus or COVID-19. It's dumb. It's silly. It's very dangerous. People need to know facts, need to understand the truth, so that they can protect themselves. Stop sending this stuff out. It's very dangerous for all.</p><p>LAVANDERA: And the number of deaths due to Coronavirus continues to jump here in the state of Louisiana. Health officials here report that in the last 24 hours, 70 more people have died. That is the largest increase in one day that this state has seen since this pandemic broke out. Ed Lavandera, CNN, New Orleans.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Well, he volunteered for one the most crucial and most dangerous jobs at a hospital right now, putting COVID-19 patients on ventilators. We'll explain why he's risking his own life after a short break. Plus, some of the world's wealthiest tech tycoons stepping up for Coronavirus relief including one who's pledged a quarter of his entire fortune to charity.</p><p>[02:40:00]</p><p>VAUSE: Sense of normalcy is setting over the place where this outbreak began. No one has been allowed to leave the city of Wuhan for 76 days, a draconian lockdown which will become a standard operating procedure to contain the virus there. Now anyone deemed healthy or low risk is actually allowed to travel. CNN Senior Producer Steven Jiang joining us again from Beijing.</p><p>Good to have you with us, Steven. It's important to note, in Wuhan in China, not all restrictions have been lifted. They've been eased. School, for example, is still out. They haven't returned to school. They don't know when. And many seem almost reluctant to return to business as usual. What's the situation?</p><p>STEVEN JIANG, CNN SENIOR PRODUCER: Well, that's right. But still, the ease of the lifting of the travel restrictions was a big moment for the city. As you mentioned, millions of people have been trapped in their homes and residences for 76 days to be exact, really with the kind of lockdown measures wreaking havoc on their lives and livelihood.</p><p>That's why hours before the midnight reopening time, if you will, we saw cars lining up on expressways. State media actually interview the first driver in line. He was from a nearby town, only 80 kilometers away. But because of the lockdown, he had been stuck in Wuhan for over two months, separated from his family, missed Chinese New Year. That's why he arrived at the checkpoint eight hours before midnight. And that kind of eagerness is being echoed throughout the city.</p><p>But we are now seeing a mass exodus from the city because remember, five mi1llion people had already left town even before the January 23rd lockdown. So now the outbound traffic is mostly consisted of out of towners stuck in town because of the lockdown as well as the migrant workers trying to go back to their jobs and a limited amount of business traffic.</p><p>Now, the authorities are expecting some 65,000 people to leave Wuhan today on Wednesday, most of them will be taking trains. That's why we see local railway officials literally dust off their bullet trains making them shiny, clean, and disinfected. They're running 276 trains today from Wuhan carrying some 55,000 people bound for -- mostly bound for the manufacturing hub in southern China.</p><p>The city's Airport has reopened as well. They're running 54 flights on Wednesday. Only a fraction, obviously, of their normal operations before the outbreak, but still it's the first time in over two months. We see commercial flights take off and land in the airport.</p><p>But still, John, as you -- as you mentioned, this is nowhere near normal. Authorities are telling local residents most of whom are obviously still staying input that they should stay at home as much as possible and avoid non-essential travel and activities.</p><p>That's why you see even though parks and shops have reopened, a lot of most entertainment venues and other places remain closed, and you still see a lot of obsessive health checks throughout a city, not to mention that schools remain closed, as you mentioned, and a lot of access restrictions for both commercial and residential buildings.</p><p>So it's a milestone for the city. But we're nowhere near being normal if being normal means going back to the state of things before the outbreak. John?</p><p>VAUSE: I think that will be the case pretty much for everyone around the world. When this ends, it will not end the way we think it will. I guess things won't be normal for a while if ever. Steven, thank you, Steven Jiang in Beijing.</p><p>Wuhan celebrated the lifting of the lockdown with a midnight light show. Images of medical workers, first responders, and others who've kept the city running were displayed on skyscrapers and bridges of the Chinese provinces which helped the city were recognized as well.</p><p>We've heard a lot about a critical shortage of ventilators which has forced doctors in many countries to make life and death decisions. Who misses out and dies, who gets one and a chance to live. Before this pandemic, usually a patient would stay on a ventilator for up to five days. Now, doctors say it's between two to three weeks. And the grim reality of COVID-19 is that most patients who are intubated still won't survive.</p><p>Dr. Cory Deburghgraeve, an anesthesiologist at the Chicago Hospital wrote in The Washington Post about Watching Death in real-time. \"It's a powerless feeling watching someone die. The oxygen level drops, the heart rate drops, the blood pressure drops, these patients are dying on the ventilator. And sometimes when they take away the body, the tube is still in the airways.</p><p>Dr. Deburghgraeve is with us now from Chicago. So Cory, thank you for taking time to talk with us. I guess where you are right now, the number of patients is still surging, and there's a lot worse to come. So at this point, how you and your colleagues are holding up on all this? How are you coping?</p><p>CORY DEBURGHGRAEVE, ANESTHESIOLOGIST: Yes. So obviously, it's very challenging and it's a totally new challenge, you know. And medicine and especially with anesthesia, we try to be very forward-thinking and anticipate problems, but you know, who could have anticipated a pandemic like this? So, you know, we're taking it one step at a time trying to anticipate and come up with new kind of unique solutions to problems.</p><p>But you know, everyone's doing the best they can. It's very taxing physically, emotionally, mentally. So, you know, we have a good community within my hospital, a lot of us have been reaching out to the community for donations, for masks, for you know, people bringing us food, things like that just to be really supportive. But you know, it's taking a lot on us.</p><p>[02:45:31]</p><p>VAUSE: And one thing about this virus, it seems pretty brutal once it takes hold and the symptoms seem especially cruel. Has that sort of you know, surprised, have been a shock to you?</p><p>DEBURGHGRAEVE: Well, yes. You know, as an anesthesiologist, I'm used to seeing my patients, you know, they're not excited for surgery, but they kind of know what to expect and, you know, generally people are OK with the pain control and waking up after surgery. And with this, it's such a change because people really sometimes they come in with a cough a few hours ago, and then all sudden they're being intubated and put on a ventilator. So it's hard because it's a total change from what we're used to.</p><p>And you know, sometimes I walk into the patient's room and I have this entire what looks like a spacesuit on me. And it makes it hard to have that human connection with someone, you know, they're gasping for air, they're panicking, they look pale. So it's a lot on us.</p><p>VAUSE: There always seems to be in almost a sort of an article of faith. If o1nly we have in our ventilators, we're all going to be fine. That's not the reality. And here's how one doctor explained it to the New York Times how hard it is to keep someone alive. \"Doctors are left wi1th impossible choices. Too much oxygen poisons the air sacs worsening the lung damage, too little damages the brain and kidneys. Too much air pressure damages lung, too little means the oxygen can't get in. Doctors try to optimize, to tweak.\"</p><p>You know, realistically, I mean, can this be maintained this sort of level of attention, the sort of care maintaining and tweaking, you know, with so many people in need, and so many more to come? DEBURGHGRAEVE: Right. And that's the concern. You know, each of these patients, what they're suffering is called ARDS or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. It's not something that's unheard of. We've seen it with other respiratory viruses and illnesses. But typically, the average hospital I would guess, will only have a few at that patients that they're dealing with.</p><p>Now, we have ICU is full of these patients, and each one of them needs such tailored specific care. You know, it's not like, you know, there's one antibiotic for this infection and one treatment for that. This is really every patient is so individualized and has such different needs. So that requires lots of nurses, respiratory therapists, doctors going in and out of the room throughout the day to make small little tweaks here and there. It's taxing the system, no doubt.</p><p>VAUSE: And you mentioned just a moment ago about the protective gear that you have to wear, and you wrote about that in the Washington Post. And you also talked about that moment that you get this message on your pager that you are required. And you wrote, I grab my backpack of medications and my duffel bag of protective gear and run for the stairs. There isn't time to wait for the elevator. I go two floors up to the ICU, get into my protective gear outside the room, mask, face shield, hood, secondary hood, personal air filter, gown, two sets of sanitized gloves.</p><p>How many times a day are you being paged and intubating a patient? And in many cases, you know, this person, you could be the last person they ever see.</p><p>DEBURGHGRAEVE: Right. You know, to answer your second question first, it's a unique challenge for me because I expect all my patients to wake up usually. And in this case, you hope that they wake up, but you have no idea. It's difficult to predict. So you know, I take it very seriously that I may be the last face or voice they hear. And I try to spend some time with the patient if I can, and try to really show an extra level of compassion.</p><p>But to address your first question, how many times in a day, it really varies. I'm working overnight shifts generally, and it really varies. Initially, earlier during the pandemic, it was one to two. Now, we're seeing like four or five a night. And then we're just one small or one medium-sized hospital in the city. There's several hospitals that are experiencing the same thing. So it's quite a bit.</p><p>And you know, you put that protective gear on that you mentioned, putting it on as the easy part because you assume it's clean, taking it off after the intubation is what's really challenging because now it's contaminated, and you can't really -- you have to be really careful not to touch any part of your body with the contaminated equipment.</p><p>VAUSE: Because the rate of infection and mortality among healthcare workers has been much higher around the world compared with the general population. Again, I want to quote your op-ed because you made your end of life wishes clear to your family. And if you end up on a ventilator, you're doing OK. You said, just leave me alone, but you had this. If I'm going through liver and kidney failure, and if I'm cognitively impaired at that point, and if you can tell my body is failing, and I'm not going to get back to being who I am, dot, dot, dot, it was a hard conversation. I cannot imagine how hard.</p><p>But I guess one of main reasons you had that conversation is because you're a lifelong asthmatic, you have respiratory issues, which means if you're infected, you most likely develop severe life-threatening symptoms. And because you're a healthcare worker, the odds of getting infected are much higher. So why do this? Why did you volunteer?</p><p>[02:50:06]</p><p>DEBURGHGRAEVE: Yes. You know, it's an interesting -- it's an interesting question. And my family and loved ones have asked me the same thing because they know that it is an increased risk for healthcare workers and with my asthma. But you know, I've been training my whole life since I was a little kid, I wanted to be a doctor, and I just wanted to help people. And I just really idolized my heroes I saw on TV or in real life who were doctors.</p><p>And now that I'm in the profession that I love so much, especially with an anesthesia, when something like this comes up, and I see that it's going to really tax the system, and there's some of my colleagues are older, some of them have young children. I thought, I'm not taking care of elderly, elderly parents. I don't have young kids at home, so I'm happy to take this on.</p><p>It's a scary risk, no doubt, but I really am trying to think about my patients first and me second, and you know, while still, of course, taking care of myself and being very vigilant about if any symptoms develop. But I just -- I can't imagine not working during this time when I know that doctors are needed.</p><p>VAUSE: It's incredible. I wish you nothing but the best. Stay well.</p><p>DEBURGHGRAEVE: Thank you, John.</p><p>VAUSE: And to find out how you can help those who've been hit hardest by this pandemic and help those health professionals on the front lines as well as service workers, please go to cnn.com/impact.

But as some of those startups grew into behemoths, they turned this force on its head. Far from leveling the playing field, Big Tech now largely owns it, and rather than democratising the economy, the Internet has ended up exacerbating the world's inequality problem.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big Tech's rise has made a few people extremely wealthy. The richest among them, Amazon owner Jeff Bezos, lost $7 billion - more than the total wealth of several countries, including Burundi and Sierra Leone ($3 billion each) - in a single day last week. And yet the biggest risk he faces as a result is falling to second place in the global wealth ranking, after another tech founder, Bill Gates.</p><p>Meanwhile, some 736 million people still lived in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) in 2015, and billions more lived on less than $2.50 per day. Many workers worldwide - including low-level employees at tech companies like Amazon and freelancers who use platforms like Uber to find customers - face poor and deteriorating working conditions and stagnant wages. As labour's share of income declines, capital's share increases - trends that benefit the wealthy above all.</p><p>Given the power of major tech companies to stifle competition, reversing these trends will require government intervention. And, indeed, taming Big Tech has become a major issue ahead of the 2020 presidential election in the United States. In particular, Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren - in my view, the two strongest candidates vying for the Democratic Party's nomination to challenge President Donald Trump - have called for breaking up major tech companies.</p><p>But the solutions being proposed, including by legal scholars like Lina Khan, tend to focus on making better use of antitrust laws. This approach is unlikely to work, because markets have changed dramatically since antitrust laws were conceived.</p><p>In the late 19th century, L\u00e9on Walras produced the first models of how competitive markets work, showing how buyers and sellers decide, based on prices, how much to buy and sell. Walras visualised an auctioneer responsible for bringing buyers and sellers together and adjusting prices until market equilibrium - when aggregate demand for each good equals aggregate supply - is achieved.</p><p>Subsequent work, such as that by Kenneth Arrow and G\u00e9rard Debreu, expanded upon this model, but the auctioneer remained in the background.</p><p>With the emergence of digital platforms like Alibaba, Amazon, and Uber, however, everything changed. These platforms perform the work of Walras's imaginary auctioneer, only they are real - and profit-driven. They may even be willing to make large initial losses - as Amazon did for its first seven years in operation, when it accumulated some $2 billion in debt - in order to maximise later gains.</p><p>They know that they need only reach the point where they can reap the benefits of economies of scale, bringing enough buyers and sellers to the \"auction\" to make search, information, and transaction costs plummet.</p><p>In this sense, digital platforms are natural monopolies. Applying antitrust laws to break them up would thus eliminate their most fundamental advantage and destroy their ability to deliver benefits to economies and consumers.</p><p>This dilemma is not altogether new. Some central banks, such as the Reserve Bank of India, were once private organisations. But giving a single private agent power over something as consequential as money creation was quickly determined to be too risky. And dividing the responsibility among several authorities would make it impossible for any to serve a transaction-smoothing function, resulting in a costly fragmentation of the monetary system.</p><p>It is worth noting one other potential barrier to using antitrust laws to break up Big Tech. In the US, at least, such laws have focused primarily on protecting consumers. Recognising that, many digital platforms have avoided hurting consumers, instead gouging the sellers who use their services to connect to buyers. But there is growing research - such as that conducted by Suresh Naidu, Eric Posner, and Glen Weyl - indicating that antitrust law should also be applied to protecting workers.</p><p>Still, given the ways digital platforms have transformed markets, governments must think beyond antitrust. One approach worth considering focuses not on breaking up tech giants, but rather on ensuring that their profits are more widely shared. This could be achieved, say, with regulations that require platforms to disperse shares to a large number of individuals and also to funds dedicated to providing domestic and global public goods.</p><p>For the most influential platforms, governments may consider pushing a gradual shift to non-profit models, akin to public utilities. This approach should be used sparingly to avoid excessive and burdensome state intervention in the economy.</p><p>But it is not in society's interest to have a single organisation that is integral to the functioning of the entire economy - whether a central bank or digital platform - run by a small coterie of individuals for their own gain.</p><p>The precise contours of a strategy for constraining Big Tech will emerge and evolve over time. But I am hopeful that either Sanders or Warren, who seem to have the right moral intention, would be able to lead that process in a way that serves the interests of consumers, workers, and business owners alike.</p><p>- Project Syndicate</p><p>Kaushik Basu is former Chief Economist of the World Bank</p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHATIM-158504448</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHATIM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XDJ-DGG1-JDJN-61SS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338756</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"952\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Khaleej Times - Galadari Printing and Publishing Co.

One government is reaching for the kryptonite. Four of the world's six biggest companies by market value are the so-called big tech firms of Apple, Google's owner, Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook. They've had almost a quarter-century to run amok.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google's chief in 2010, Eric Schmidt, said that his firm's job was to \"get right up to the creepy line and not cross it\". In truth, all these companies have gone way beyond the creepy line. Indeed, their businesses are built on it. By providing open freeways for bullying, hate speech, livestreamed atrocities, terrorist propaganda and recruitment, revenge porn, foreign meddling in elections, networking of paedophiles, illegal opioid sales.</p><p>And, less obviously but just as creepily, is the privacy problem. The big tech industry depends on \"one-way-mirror operations engineered for our ignorance\", in the words of Shoshana Zuboff, a Harvard professor emerita in social psychology. In the early age of online naivety, for instance, \"we thought that we search Google, but now we understand that Google searches us\", she says. She calls the new reality \"surveillance capitalism\", also the name of her book.</p><p>The man who invented the worldwide web, Britain's Tim Berners-Lee, is so disgusted by the way big tech has oligopolised the internet that he calls it \"digital feudalism\". He's started a new company called Inrupt in a quest to provide an alternative, to return control of private data to users.</p><p>And, adding injury to injury, big tech companies are among the world's most successful tax dodgers.</p><p>The governments of the world have had enough of the age of online anarchy. Governments are trying to figure out how to make them behave, trying piecemeal regulations and laws, responding to each new big tech outrage with another regulation. The European Union is the leader in this, but dozens of other governments are trying their own solutions. In Australia, for example. The federal government set up an Office of the e-Safety Commissioner in 2015 to work co-operatively with big tech to protect children from online harms. And now the Morrison government is holding community consultations about its planned bill to create a code of conduct for big tech firms that, if they flout it, the government promises to make binding. Morrison's guiding principle, he says, is that \"the rules that exist in the real world need to exist in the digital world\".</p><p>But this is all about finding sticks to manage titans. The country reaching for the kryptonite is perhaps the one least expected - the US. The Trump administration and some legislators are considering not just a patchwork solution but a panacea. It would be a fundamental change.</p><p>The potential solution? To remove the legislative loophole that allowed all of the mayhem in the first place. Big tech sought, and won, a little-known magic power in 1996. It's a legal clause called Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Section 230 essentially protects the tech firms from the consequences of whatever they might publish, screen or sell on their platforms. It's been called \"big tech's favourite law\". For obvious reasons.</p><p>The platform owner collects all the traffic, all the attention, all the profits. But takes no responsibility for the material generating all the traffic, attention and profit. The key clause: \"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\" These are The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet, according to the title of a book on the subject by Jeff Kosseff.</p><p>But when this special exemption was granted in 1996, big tech was not big. \"No longer are tech companies the underdog upstarts,\" Donald Trump's Attorney-General, William Barr, said in a speech last week. \"They have become titans.\" He gave notice that the administration was reviewing Section 230. US frustration with big tech is bipartisan. The vice-president to Barack Obama, Joe Biden, now running for the Democratic candidacy, said recently that Section 230 should be \"revoked\".</p><p>That would be the cleanest and most sweeping of any solution yet proposed. At a stroke, Facebook, YouTube, Google, Twitter and all the others would lose their magic protection. They would be held legally liable for the material on their platforms. They would be instantly responsible for the product from which they profit. Just like every other company. The internet would be transformed.</p><p>Of course, these mega-businesses are not going to cop any constraint without a mighty fight. Their lobbyists are working their own magic on Capitol Hill right now. That's not new. What is new is that a range of other big companies are lining up to lobby against them. These include Disney, Marriott and IBM. The tech titans remain dominant, yet they are in a weaker political position than at any time in years as the kryptonite comes just a little closer.</p><p>Peter Hartcher is international editor.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc79fcrha69g7189ini575</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y8T-SVV1-F0J6-J4GS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"858\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

And she doesn't like the way it's going: \"I have never seen such a dark side of the open web as I'm seeing now.\" Inman-Grant also happens to be Australia's internet safety regulator. \"So much hostility, so much abuse at scale, and it hasn't let up,\" she tells me.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The pandemic created an apparent surge in hateful and criminal conduct online when many countries restricted public movement and shut many businesses. But it wasn't a surge. It seems it was a threshold opportunity for sustained human malice. Inman-Grant's agency, the Office of the eSafety Commission, reports a 97 per cent increase in child sex abuse material since May in Australia. And an increase of more than 200 per cent in what it calls image-based abuse - revenge porn and sextortion. Cyber abuse is up by half. \"It hasn't plateaued - it's continuing to rise.\"</p><p>The office is more than doubling its staff of investigators in response. But the numbers are tiny. It's hiring 30 to expand its existing complement of 24. The office, the first online safety regulator in the world and now five years old, is very successful within a limited remit. Even though most harmful material is hosted on servers abroad, the Australian agency has been able to work with online firms to get revenge porn and sextortion images removed with a success rate of 90 per cent, for instance. The Morrison government is looking at increasing its powers But it's essentially a game of whack-a-mole, as Inman-Grants says, an endless game of hitting one problem only for others to spring up immediately. Systemic reform of the web is required, and preferably at source - the US.</p><p>The American internet is essentially unregulated: \"Some of the worst terrorist and child sex abuse and revenge porn sites in the world are hosted in the US,\" says Inman-Grant. \"They don't have a regulatory structure or government agency to go after these sites.\" And then, of course, there's Big Tech. Outside China's Great Firewall, all the dominant firms are American. \"Social media allows hatred and misogyny to be amplified and directed. It's able to go viral. It's invasive and it's pervasive.\"</p><p>This Wild West web is no accident. In the internet's infancy, Silicon Valley lobbied the US Congress successfully to give it an all-purpose escape clause, a licence to sidestep legal liability for what its companies did online. This magical release from responsibility is brilliantly simple. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 allows a tech company to pretend that it's not a publisher - it's just a neutral platform for others. So it has none of the responsibilities of a publisher. The result is anarchy. Big Tech plunders anything it wants from its platforms to maximise profit, but takes no responsibility for any of it.</p><p>Section 230 is also an anachronism. It was written 24 years ago. Before \"social media\" existed. Before these businesses became the biggest on the planet. Political tolerance of this anomaly is exhausted in many countries. Dozens are seeking local regulatory solutions. And even in the US, tolerance is now approaching its limits. A reckoning looms. Donald Trump in May ordered US regulators to revisit Section 230. He was in a rage that social media sites had blocked a video he'd posted. Conservatives were being censored, he claimed. It seems unlikely that any legislation will pass before the November 3 election, however.</p><p>His rival, Joe Biden, has threatened to reach for the nuclear button, revision of Section 230, too. His spokesman said that social media firms should be treated the same as any other company - held accountable for disseminating content they know to be false. Biden's running mate, Kamala Harris, has her own history with civilising the web. On the face of it, she might be expected to take a tough line. As a prosecutor in California, she led the first successful criminal prosecution of a revenge porn site, ugotposted.com, and put its operator into jail for 18 years. She's put a priority on privacy. She criticised Facebook, which she described as a public utility, for pursuing growth at the expense of its users' privacy: \"There needs to be serious regulation,\" she said. Yet she's also been criticised for allowing Big Tech to get far bigger when she had the opportunity to do something about it as California's attorney-general. Harris has said that the Big Tech firms are so dominant that a forced break-up needed to be considered. But she's stopped short of committing to such a policy.</p><p>Inman-Grant understands how US tech politics works. She worked for a congressman on tech matters. And for Microsoft and Twitter too. In a twist of fate, she even helped Silicon Valley to shape Section 230. The poacher has turned gamekeeper. She tempers expectations of radical reform in the US. Any Trump-led revision of Section 230 would likely attend only to his own personal gripe, says Inman-Grant. A Biden-Harris administration with a Democrat-controlled Congress is more likely to conduct a systemic review, probably a \"reasoned and structured\" one. Privacy would get serious attention, and \"gig economy\" businesses would likely come under serious scrutiny over workers' rights.</p><p>But, she notes, the Congress under either party would be seeking to balance the regulatory urge against the fact that \"they're in the middle of a tech Cold War with China and the tech sector is the crown jewel of the US economy\".

And she doesn't like the way it's going: \"I have never seen such a dark side of the open web as I'm seeing now.\" Inman-Grant also happens to be Australia's internet safety regulator. \"So much hostility, so much abuse at scale, and it hasn't let up,\" she tells me.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The pandemic created an apparent surge in hateful and criminal conduct online when many countries restricted public movement and shut many businesses. But it wasn't a surge. It seems it was a threshold opportunity for sustained human malice. Inman-Grant's agency, the Office of the eSafety Commission, reports a 97 per cent increase in child sex abuse material since May in Australia. And an increase of more than 200 per cent in what it calls image-based abuse - revenge porn and sextortion. Cyber abuse is up by half. \"It hasn't plateaued - it's continuing to rise.\"</p><p>The office is more than doubling its staff of investigators in response. But the numbers are tiny. It's hiring 30 to expand its existing complement of 24. The office, the first online safety regulator in the world and now five years old, is very successful within a limited remit. Even though most harmful material is hosted on servers abroad, the Australian agency has been able to work with online firms to get revenge porn and sextortion images removed with a success rate of 90 per cent, for instance. The Morrison government is looking at increasing its powers but it's essentially a game of whack-a-mole, as Inman-Grants says, an endless game of hitting one problem only for others to spring up immediately. Systemic reform of the web is required, and preferably at source - the US.</p><p>The American internet is essentially unregulated: \"Some of the worst terrorist and child sex abuse and revenge porn sites in the world are hosted in the US,\" says Inman-Grant. \"They don't have a regulatory structure or government agency to go after these sites.\" And then, of course, there's Big Tech. Outside China's Great Firewall, all the dominant firms are American. \"Social media allows hatred and misogyny to be amplified and directed. It's able to go viral. It's invasive and it's pervasive.\"</p><p>This Wild West web is no accident. In the internet's infancy, Silicon Valley lobbied the US Congress successfully to give it an all-purpose escape clause, a licence to sidestep legal liability for what its companies did online. This magical release from responsibility is brilliantly simple. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 allows a tech company to pretend that it's not a publisher - it's just a neutral platform for others. So it has none of the responsibilities of a publisher. The result is anarchy. Big Tech plunders anything it wants from its platforms to maximise profit, but takes no responsibility for any of it.</p><p>Section 230 is also an anachronism. It was written 24 years ago. Before \"social media\" existed. Before these businesses became the biggest on the planet. Political tolerance of this anomaly is exhausted in many countries. Dozens are seeking local regulatory solutions. And even in the US, tolerance is now approaching its limits. A reckoning looms. Donald Trump in May ordered US regulators to revisit Section 230. He was in a rage that social media sites had blocked a video he'd posted. Conservatives were being censored, he claimed. It seems unlikely that any legislation will pass before the November 3 election, however.</p><p>His rival, Joe Biden, has threatened to reach for the nuclear button, revision of Section 230, too. His spokesman said that social media firms should be treated the same as any other company - held accountable for disseminating content they know to be false. Biden's running mate, Kamala Harris, has her own history with civilising the web. On the face of it, she might be expected to take a tough line. As a prosecutor in California, she led the first successful criminal prosecution of a revenge porn site, ugotposted.com, and put its operator into jail for 18 years. She's put a priority on privacy. She criticised Facebook, which she described as a public utility, for pursuing growth at the expense of its users' privacy: \"There needs to be serious regulation,\" she said. Yet she's also been criticised for allowing Big Tech to get far bigger when she had the opportunity to do something about it as California's attorney-general. Harris has said that the Big Tech firms are so dominant that a forced break-up needed to be considered. But she's stopped short of committing to such a policy.</p><p>Inman-Grant understands how US tech politics works. She worked for a congressman on tech matters. And for Microsoft and Twitter too. In a twist of fate, she even helped Silicon Valley to shape Section 230. The poacher has turned gamekeeper. She tempers expectations of radical reform in the US. Any Trump-led revision of Section 230 would likely attend only to his own personal gripe, says Inman-Grant. A Biden-Harris administration with a Democrat-controlled Congress is more likely to conduct a systemic review, probably a \"reasoned and structured\" one. Privacy would get serious attention, and \"gig economy\" businesses would likely come under serious scrutiny over workers' rights.</p><p>But, she notes, the Congress under either party would be seeking to balance the regulatory urge against the fact that \"they're in the middle of a tech Cold War with China and the tech sector is the crown jewel of the US economy\". Still, \"the only way is up for the US in terms of smart regulation\". A more thorough global solution is likely to be an \"international network of regulators, a network working against a network\" of tech firms. But don't hold your breath. Inman-Grant expects that will take 10 to 15 years.</p><p>Peter Hartcher is international editor.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc7bxanvboclu1kxj1rlbn</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M4-S9H1-F0J6-J0NN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"995\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Republicans' view that the tech industry plays favorites has grown, and there's more agreement than there used to be.\"</p><p>Because antitrust scrutiny and litigation is rooted in protecting consumers, Mr. Jamison believes Democrats and Republicans will probably come up with legislation that focuses on protecting consumers served by the tech industry.</p><p>One easy way to do that is to draft a privacy law, which is already a top priority for House Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>\"Customers feel violated when people know things about them and it's very tempting for politicians to come to the rescue,\" Mr. Jamison said. \"As long as they focus on customer benefit, we should be OK. If they start moving down the path of, 'We're just worried about them because they're big or there are other social ills we want to cure using antitrust litigation,' then they start doing harm as opposed to good.\"</p><p>Kate Patrick covers technology and finance news for InsideSources.com.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PSTGAZ-18112924545897</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PSTGAZ2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TVD-J231-JC8R-355S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144577</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"681\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 P.G.

The Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) announcement on Tuesday that it was fining Facebook $5 billion for mishandling users' data is only the latest in a series of regulatory actions against big tech.</p><p>The shift towards greater accountability is welcome. Technology companies have come to wield power akin to that of a state. They have huge amounts of information, much of it personal and sensitive, about their users. It is probably easier to keep an extramarital affair secret from a spouse than from a smartphone. Armed with that data, the companies know the users better than they know themselves, and so can sustain their attention and attract their clicks. They have power, too, over what they see, think and feel. President Trump railed last month that Twitter was \"biased toward Democrats\", complaining that if he were a liberal he would \"pick up five times more followers\". Twitter denies any such skew, but it is true that such platforms could easily tilt the playing field in favour of certain politicians.</p><p>Governments are therefore starting to bare their regulatory teeth. They have three main challenges. The first is to make sure that technology companies keep a close eye on users' data. The FTC has landed Facebook with the largest fine in the regulator's history for exposing millions of users' data to the political analytics company Cambridge Analytica. That followed a similar investigation by the information commissioner in this country. Mr Zuckerberg complained that Facebook would need to invest \"a significant amount\" in new tools to adhere to the settlement Facebook reached with the commission. That shows that the regulation is working.</p><p>The second challenge is to keep the market competitive. Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, is the b\u00eate noire of Silicon Valley, having fined Google a total of (EURO)8.2 billion in antitrust investigations, lambasting the company for blocking its competitors from placing advertisements on other sites. Although Mr Trump has often sided with America's tech sector, complaining that EU competition investigations are acts of economic aggression, his own agencies are now following suit. The Department of Justice has announced that it is investigating Google and Apple, while the FTC looks at Facebook and Amazon. Britain's competition watchdog has launched a vital inquiry into the digital advertising market here too.</p><p>The third and most contentious challenge is policing the material that ends up online. Ursula von der Leyen, president-elect of the European Commission, has announced that she will propose laws that would force online platforms to remove some types of content. Britain has its own plans for a crackdown on \"online harms\" which, though ambitious, are startlingly vague.

The Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) announcement on Tuesday that it was fining Facebook $5 billion for mishandling users' data is only the latest in a series of regulatory actions against big tech.</p><p>The shift towards greater accountability is welcome. Technology companies have come to wield power akin to that of a state. They have huge amounts of information, much of it personal and sensitive, about their users. It is probably easier to keep an extramarital affair secret from a spouse than from a smartphone. Armed with that data, the companies know the users better than they know themselves, and so can sustain their attention and attract their clicks. They have power, too, over what they see, think and feel. President Trump railed last month that Twitter was \"biased toward Democrats\", complaining that if he were a liberal he would \"pick up five times more followers\". Twitter denies any such skew, but it is true that such platforms could easily tilt the playing field in favour of certain politicians.</p><p>Governments are therefore starting to bare their regulatory teeth. They have three main challenges. The first is to make sure that technology companies keep a close eye on users' data. The FTC has landed Facebook with the largest fine in the regulator's history for exposing millions of users' data to the political analytics company Cambridge Analytica. That followed a similar investigation by the information commissioner in this country. Mr Zuckerberg complained that Facebook would need to invest \"a significant amount\" in new tools to adhere to the settlement Facebook reached with the commission. That shows that the regulation is working.</p><p>The second challenge is to keep the market competitive. Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, is the b\u00eate noire of Silicon Valley, having fined Google a total of (EURO)8.2 billion in antitrust investigations, lambasting the company for blocking its competitors from placing advertisements on other sites. Although Mr Trump has often sided with America's tech sector, complaining that EU competition investigations are acts of economic aggression, his own agencies are now following suit. The Department of Justice has announced that it is investigating Google and Apple, while the FTC looks at Facebook and Amazon. Britain's competition watchdog has launched a vital inquiry into the digital advertising market here too.</p><p>The third and most contentious challenge is policing the material that ends up online. Ursula von der Leyen, president-elect of the European Commission, has announced that she will propose laws that would force online platforms to remove some types of content. Britain has its own plans for a crackdown on \"online harms\" which, though ambitious, are startlingly vague. They range over everything from child sex abuse images and terrorist recruitment to cyberbullying and the manipulation of public opinion. Much of what the government wants to regulate is legal and the plans would give the regulator draconian powers to control what goes online. The edges will need to be rounded off. Nicky Morgan, the new culture secretary, has got her work cut out.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-151433443</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNB-HXS1-JCBW-N35N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"564\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 26, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In recent weeks, growing disgruntlement with giant technology companies has hardened into a full-blown backlash. The prevailing mood is that Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google have grown too big for their boots (see \"Techlash\").</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The complaints against the big four are many and varied, from enabling the dissemination of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23431191-000-knowledge-how-to-tell-truth-from-lies/\">fake news</url> to monopolistic behaviour and rampant hawking of user-generated data. These are genuine concerns that need to be addressed. But, as yet, they do not add up to much more than an incoherent howl of frustration.</p><p>What is desperately needed is a cool-headed critique of what is wrong and how to fix it. Right now, that is a work in progress; the endgame of techlash is impossible to predict. But while some form of reckoning is probably justified, a sense of perspective is required.</p><p>We must not forget that the reason the tech giants are in this position is largely because we let them get there. Big tech is merely doing what successful consumer companies have always done: working out what their customers want and giving it to them. We collectively decided that the services on offer were worth the tiny price being charged. Arguably, all that has changed is that our bill has now landed and we are suffering a collective bout of buyer's remorse.</p><p>To be fair, the bill contains hidden extras \u2013 alleged manipulation of democratic elections, for example. But as individual consumers, we have little to complain about. These companies provide services that many of us want and like, and do so at very little cost to us besides annoying ads and the collection of information that, unaggregated, is worthless.</p><p>If consumer demand has created a monster, then restraint and knowledge can do much to tame it</p><p>Pointing this out is not an act of self-flagellation, but part of the search for a solution. If consumer demand and our ignorance really have created a monster, then restraint and knowledge can do much to tame it.</p><p>Some of that clearly needs to be done on our behalf, through anti-monopoly laws, for example. One of the problems is that big tech has raised the bar for market entry so high that new players don't stand a chance. Laws such as the European Union's soon-to-arrive General Data Protection Regulation will help too. Self-regulation is also an option, although it often amounts to little more than powerful industries being allowed to mark their own homework. Perhaps the most useful offer the tech giants could make is meaningful levels of opt-in or opt-out \u2013 not a blanket \"if you want our services, you have to accept our terms\".</p><p>But the biggest lever remains in the hands of consumers. In 2006, in the early days of the age of social media and user-generated content, <url normalizedValue=\"https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/1101061225_400.jpg\">Time magazine's person of the year was \"YOU\"</url>. The cover featured a mirrored panel with the words: \"You control the information age. Welcome to your world.\"</p><p>That may seem like a naive declaration from a different time, but it isn't. If, like many, you are itching for a techlash, then start by looking in the mirror.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This article appeared in print under the headline \"Taming the big tech beasts\"</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSCI-mg23731643000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWSCI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RKR-VXG1-DY5K-Y0MW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">158275</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"534\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 New Scientist Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>New Scientist</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"17543\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issn>ISSN: 0262 4079</issn><volume>Vol. 237</volume><issueNumber>No. 3164</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 7, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008XKG</classCode><className>OUTPUT &amp; DEMAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000445</classCode><className>DATA PROTECTION LAWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>STX001548</classCode><className>SELF REGULATING ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>STX001462</classCode><className>REGULATORY COMPLIANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000D0V7</classCode><className>USER GENERATED CONTENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000445</classCode><className>DATA PROTECTION LAWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000D7DY</classCode><className>INFORMATION SECURITY &amp; PRIVACY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000D4VG</classCode><className>DATA SECURITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>ST00099QF</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

One is reaching for kryptonite.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Four of the world's six biggest companies by market value are the so-called Big Tech firms of Apple, Google's owner Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook. They've had almost a quarter-century to run amok.</p><p>Google's chief in 2010, Eric Schmidt, said his firm's job was to \"get right up to the creepy line and not cross it\". In truth, all these companies have gone way beyond the creepy line. Indeed, their businesses are built on it. By providing open freeways for bullying, hate speech, live-streamed atrocities, terrorist propaganda and recruitment, revenge porn, foreign meddling in elections, networking of paedophiles and illegal opioid sales.</p><p>And, less obviously but just as creepily, is the privacy problem. The Big Tech industry depends on \"one-way-mirror operations engineered for our ignorance\", in the words of Shoshana Zuboff, a Harvard professor emerita in social psychology. In the early age of online naivete, \"we thought that we search Google, but now we understand that Google searches us\", she says. She calls the new reality \"surveillance capitalism\", also the name of her book.</p><p>The man who invented the worldwide web, Britain's Tim Berners-Lee, is so disgusted by the way Big Tech has oligopolised the internet that he calls it \"digital feudalism\". He's started a new company called Inrupt to provide an alternative, to return control of private data to users. And, adding injury to injury, Big Tech companies are among the world's most successful tax dodgers.</p><p>The governments of the world have had enough of the age of online anarchy. Governments are trying to figure out how to make them behave, trying piecemeal regulations and laws, responding to each new Big Tech outrage with another regulation. The European Union is the leader in this, but dozens of governments are trying their own solutions.</p><p>In Australia, the federal government set up an Office of the eSafety Commissioner in 2015 to work co-operatively with Big Tech to protect children from online harms.</p><p>Its remit has kept expanding as digital dystopia keeps growing and now ranges from cyberbullying to revenge porn and paedophilia, but without powers to compel tech firms. The ACCC is suing Google for harvesting private information about people's locations to sell targeted ads. The company didn't tell people that turning off \"location history\" wasn't actually enough to turn off location history, says the ACCC. And now the Morrison government is holding community consultations about its planned bill to create a code of conduct for Big Tech firms that, if they flout, the government promises to make binding. Morrison's guiding principle, he says, is \"the rules that exist in the real world need to exist in the digital world\".</p><p>But this is all about finding sticks to manage titans. The country reaching for the kryptonite is perhaps the one least expected - the US. The Trump administration and some legislators are considering not just a patchwork solution but a panacea. It would be a fundamental change. You can tell it's getting serious. Tech chiefs used to celebrate the internet as \"the world's largest ungoverned space\". Now, after decades of resisting any regulation, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg last week pleaded for some: \"Big Tech needs more regulation.\" Knowing more regulation is inevitable, Zuckerberg shrewdly is trying to stay at the negotiating table.</p><p>The potential solution? To remove the legislative loophole that allowed all of the mayhem in the first place. Big Tech sought, and won, a little-known magic power in 1996. It's a legal clause called Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Section 230 protects the tech firms from the consequences of whatever they publish, screen or sell on their platforms. It was the difference between treating them as publishers, which are responsible for what they circulate, and bulletin boards, which bear no responsibility for what third parties may post.</p><p>It's been called \"Big Tech's favourite law\". For obvious reason. The platform owner collects all the traffic, all the attention, all the profits. But takes no responsibility for the material generating all the traffic, attention and profit. The key clause: \"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\"</p><p>But when this special exemption was granted in 1996, Big Tech was not big. \"No longer are tech companies the underdog upstarts,\" Donald Trump's Attorney-General, William Barr, said in a speech last week. \"They have become titans.\" He gave notice that the administration was reviewing Section 230. US frustration with Big Tech is bipartisan. Joe Biden, now running for the Democratic candidacy, said recently that Section 230 should be \"revoked\".</p><p>That would be the cleanest solution. At a stroke, Facebook, YouTube, Google, Twitter and all the others would lose their magic protection. They would be legally liable for the material on their platforms. They would be instantly responsible for the product from which they profit. Just like every other company. Morrison's wish - \"the rules that exist in the real world need to exist in the digital world\" - would be granted.</p><p>A bipartisan group of US legislators is drawing up a bill that would not go quite this far, but it would require online platforms to meet behaviour benchmarks in order to qualify for the magic protections of Section 230.</p><p>Of course, these mega-businesses are not going to cop any constraint without a mighty fight. Their lobbyists are working their own magic on Capitol Hill right now. That's not new. What is new is other big companies are lining up to lobby against them. These include Disney, Marriott and IBM. The tech titans remain dominant, yet they are in a weaker political position than at any time in years as the kryptonite comes just a little closer.</p><p>Peter Hartcher is international editor.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc79fd6ng3s7l1ik1kt575</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y8T-SVV1-F0J6-J4MC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1024\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

One government is reaching for the kryptonite. Four of the world's six biggest companies by market value are the so-called Big Tech firms of Apple, Google's owner Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook. They've had almost a quarter-century to run amok.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google's chief in 2010, Eric Schmidt, said that his firm's job was to \"get right up to the creepy line and not cross it\". In truth, all these companies have gone way beyond the creepy line. Indeed, their businesses are built on it. By providing open freeways for bullying, hate speech, live-streamed atrocities, terrorist propaganda and recruitment, revenge porn, foreign meddling in elections, networking of paedophiles, illegal opioid sales.</p><p>And, less obviously but just as creepily, is the privacy problem. The Big Tech industry depends on \"one-way-mirror operations engineered for our ignorance\", in the words of Shoshana Zuboff, a Harvard professor emerita in social psychology. In the early age of online naivete, for instance, \"we thought that we search Google, but now we understand that Google searches us\", she says. She calls the new reality \"surveillance capitalism\", also the name of her book.</p><p>The man who invented the worldwide web, Britain's Tim Berners-Lee, is so disgusted by the way Big Tech has oligopolised the internet that he calls it \"digital feudalism\". He's started a new company called Inrupt in a quest to provide an alternative, to return control of private data to users. And, adding injury to injury, Big Tech companies are among the world's most successful tax dodgers.</p><p>The governments of the world have had enough of the age of online anarchy. Governments are trying to figure out how to make them behave, trying piecemeal regulations and laws, responding to each new Big Tech outrage with another regulation. The European Union is the leader in this, but dozens of other governments are trying their own solutions. In Australia, for example, the federal government set up an Office of the e-Safety Commissioner in 2015 to work co-operatively with Big Tech to protect children from online harms.</p><p>Its remit has kept expanding as digital dystopia keeps growing and now ranges from cyberbullying to revenge porn and paedophilia, but without powers to compel tech firms. The ACCC is suing Google for harvesting private information about people's locations to sell targeted ads. The company didn't tell people that turning off \"location history\" wasn't actually enough to turn off location history, says the ACCC. And now the Morrison government is holding community consultations about its planned bill to create a code of conduct for Big Tech firms that, if they flout, the government promises to make binding. Morrison's guiding principle, he says, is that \"the rules that exist in the real world need to exist in the digital world\".</p><p>But this is all about finding sticks to manage titans. The country reaching for the kryptonite is perhaps the one least expected - the US. The Trump administration and some legislators are considering not just a patchwork solution but a panacea. It would be a fundamental change. You can tell it's getting serious. Tech chiefs used to celebrate the internet as \"the world's largest ungoverned space\". Now, after decades of resisting any regulation, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg last week pleaded for some: \"Big Tech needs more regulation.\" Knowing that more regulation is inevitable, Zuckerberg shrewdly is trying to stay at the negotiating table to minimise any constraint.</p><p>The potential solution? To remove the legislative loophole that allowed all of the mayhem in the first place. Big Tech sought, and won, a little-known magic power in 1996. It's a legal clause called Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Section 230 essentially protects the tech firms from the consequences of whatever they might publish, screen or sell on their platforms. It was the difference between treating them as publishers, which are responsible for what they circulate, and bulletin boards, which bear no responsibility for what third parties may post.</p><p>It's been called \"Big Tech's favourite law\". For obvious reason. The platform owner collects all the traffic, all the attention, all the profits. But takes no responsibility for the material generating all the traffic, attention and profit. The key clause: \"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\" These are The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet, according to the title of a book on the subject by Jeff Kosseff.</p><p>But when this special exemption was granted in 1996, Big Tech was not big. \"No longer are tech companies the underdog upstarts,\" Donald Trump's Attorney-General, William Barr, said in a speech last week. \"They have become titans.\" He gave notice that the administration was reviewing Section 230. US frustration with Big Tech is bipartisan. The vice-president to Barack Obama, Joe Biden, now running for the Democratic candidacy, said recently that Section 230 should be \"revoked\".</p><p>That would be the cleanest and most sweeping of any solution yet proposed. At a stroke, Facebook, YouTube, Google, Twitter and all the others would lose their magic protection. They would be held legally liable for the material on their platforms. They would be instantly responsible for the product from which they profit. Just like every other company. The internet would be transformed. Morrison's wish - \"the rules that exist in the real world need to exist in the digital world\" - would be granted.</p><p>A bipartisan group of US legislators is drawing up a bill that would not go quite this far, but it would require online platforms to meet some behaviour benchmarks in order to qualify for the magic protections of Section 230.</p><p>Republicans are angry at Big Tech for allegedly putting covert roadblocks on conservative campaigns and causes. Democrats are angry at them for enabling Russia's meddling in support of Trump at the 2016 election.</p><p>Of course, these mega-businesses are not going to cop any constraint without a mighty fight. Their lobbyists are working their own magic on Capitol Hill right now. That's not new. What is new is that a range of other big companies is lining up to lobby against them. These include Disney, Marriott and IBM. The tech titans remain dominant, yet they are in a weaker political position than at anytime in years as the kryptonite comes just a little closer.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Hartcher is international editor.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520243899</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y8T-PN01-JBJ7-N2HG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1104\"/><timeReceived>00:20 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Cook said that while he is a big believer in the free market, the mechanism is not functioning well, necessitating regulation. Mint analyses the reasons for regulation and the likely impact on India.</p><p>Why does Cook believe that regulation is inevitable?</p><p>After the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where personal data of around 50 million Facebook users was illegally acquired by the UK-based political consulting firm and misused to influence voters during the US polls, regulators have become more sceptical about how tech firms store and share user data. Tech firms have failed to plug data leaks. In September, a bug in Instagram compromised email IDs and phone numbers of up to six million users. In October, Google said that data from up to 500,000 Google+ users might have been exposed to third-party developers by a bug.</p><p>What can regulation change?</p><p>The rollout of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union has provided a new perspective on how privacy needs to be handled and tempered demands for similar laws in the US and other countries. Regulations such as GDPR are designed to alter tech companies' approach to data privacy. It mandates them to keep users informed in an easy-to-understand language on the kind of data being collected and how it would be used. In case of a breach, users have to be informed immediately. Failure to comply can result in penalties of up to&amp;#38;euro;20 million or 4% of annual global turnover.</p><p>What's the implication for regulators in India?</p><p>A draft data protection Bill has strict mandates such as data localization. It requires all governance-related data to be stored on servers within India to protect the privacy of Indian citizens.</p><p>What does this mean for users in India?</p><p>Experts say this would undermine the privacy and security of users as more countries may raise such demands: numerous copies of data would abound, making it harder to protect them from hackers. The government may use regulation to control and access data and force firms to share user data with it. The draft Bill exempts the state from seeking users' consent before accessing their personal data, if it is needed for the function of the state and parliament. Experts say it would be best to have a separate law for data localization.</p><p>What would be the cost of regulation?</p><p>Industry bodies such as the Internet and Mobile Association of India that represent domestic and global firms have been critical of the draft Bill. They argue that the new regulation on collection and storage of user data will increase the cost burden on tech firms, particularly start-ups. A Delhi-based public policy think tank, The Dialogue, forecasted a loss of nearly 1 percentage point in GDP and added that data localization norms could cost an average Indian worker up to 11% of his/her monthly salary.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.

The big question is whether these will establish anti-competitive practices and whether US authorities will go to the extent of breaking up these homebred firms, which have become iconic American companies and stock exchange darlings. In the 1990s, similar proceedings against Microsoft had allowed small firms like Google to dream big. Since then much has happened that again calls for creating a level playing field.</p><p>Facebook flourishes despite failing to curb fake news and privacy violations, even putting democracy itself at risk. In its early years, Google\u2019s unofficial motto was \u2018Don\u2019t Be Evil\u2019 but its dominant search engine was later accused of various biases, and now draws most of the online advertising and revenues leaving only a pittance for actual content creators. Such has been the obsessive quest for dominance that the big five American tech companies have made over 400 acquisitions to stall potential threats. But the challenges of breaking up big tech companies are immense.</p><p>Even if Facebook is split by hiving away WhatsApp and Instagram, its monopoly in social networking may not end because of network effects. Of course, regulators could have stopped Facebook from these acquisitions in the first place but proving anti-competitive behaviour is tough. Antitrust regulation must focus on consumer data and identify harmful behaviour. Monetising of consumer data by tech platforms can work against consumer interest and lead to unfair personalised pricing. Conversely, tech platforms may offer greater audience reach to merchandise sellers and content producers but the terms have to be fair and equitable. Without competition or uniform regulations, big tech will keep calling all the shots.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIET-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8F-JXX1-DXJR-H0WG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382885</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"317\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Here's an idea from my time in office</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tech giants Facebook and Google are not our saviours. They are not a 'new type of corporation'. Sure, they may have pretty interfaces on your screen and bean bags in their offices. But you should never forget what they are: profit driven, hungry conglomerates that obliterate their competition, refuse to pay their fair share tax, rapaciously collect private data and, of course, destroy journalism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A decade ago, Rolling Stone described the investment bank Goldman Sachs as a \"great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money\".</p><p>What we've learnt recently about the tech giants makes Goldman Sachs look like a soft touch by comparison.</p><p>For the past decade these behemoths have grown with impunity. Regulators have struggled to understand them and politicians have been afraid to challenge them, frightened of being deemed Luddites in the digital age. They are rarely, if ever, called into account.</p><p>All of which made the report this week from the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission (ACCC) so amazing.</p><p>The message to Google and Facebook from Australia's competition commission was pretty clear: \"You are behaving like reckless jerks.\" Of course, that's not the language of Rod Sims, the mild-mannered but highly effective head of the ACCC. But that was his point.</p><p>What he actually said was: \"Digital platforms don't recognise original content and source in ranking.\" The upshot of the ACCC report into digital platforms was this: Google and Facebook take the work of others and amalgamate it.</p><p>Think journalism, art and video.</p><p>They don't actually create it. They just bring it together.</p><p>Then they suck up all the advertising dollars that would otherwise go to those creating the content.</p><p>Why? Because businesses have no choice but to pay the money to Google and Facebook rather than the actual source.</p><p>The ACCC identified this as a reality of business that can't be avoided. The outcome is that the tech giants are getting rich while anyone who produces content goes broke. The model is unfair.</p><p>It is also not sustainable.</p><p>So far the policy has been to allow these companies to 'self-regulate', which is a nice way of saying let them do anything they want, without any oversight. Simms has made it clear that this needs to come to an end. So how do you fix it? How do you make it fair?</p><p>Well the ACCC has made 11 recommendations. But I had an idea. Well not just me: Nick Xenophon, The Greens' Scott Ludlum and I did.</p><p>Almost two years ago we launched an inquiry into the future of journalism. It had lofty goals.</p><p>Unfortunately the three of us were far better at starting inquiries than surviving in parliament.</p><p>Nick left (voluntarily) to pursue an ill-fated career in South Australian politics. I left (pretty much involuntarily) to pursue a career of depression and irrelevance.</p><p>Scott left (constitutionally) when he became the first politician caught in the Section 44 mess, triggering a series of events he certainly didn't foresee. Whatever our fates, our idea was this: put a levy on companies like Google and Facebook and use that money to make investment in journalism and content creation tax free.</p><p>That was it. Simple. Australia already has tax-free exemptions for research and development; why not have the same for journalism and content creation.</p><p>Make the big tech companies pay for it. It's not like they are struggling, after all.</p><p>The next (likely) Labor government is going to have to take the tech giants on. It will get ugly. They will fight any constraint.</p><p>Aside from what they are doing to journalism and content; the future of the Australian tax system also sits in the balance.</p><p>Their ability to offshore their profits has made them some of the world's most effective tax dodgers.</p><p>They will also need to tackle how these companies collect, and then sell, our most private data.</p><p>Some might argue, that the choice is in the hand of the consumer. If you don't like how the tech giants behave; just don't use their products. Delete Facebook and don't use Google.</p><p>But that's a false choice.</p><p>As the ACCC has noted, businesses can't avoid them.</p><p>And frankly, I love their products, and for good reason too. My Facebook page has a lifetime of friends, from school to university to work that I keep up to date with. I'm obsessed with Twitter to get immediate news. I spend my days Googling childhood shows and obscure articles.</p><p>I shouldn't have to choose. I shouldn't have to be forced to consider getting rid of them.</p><p>What we need is regulation that holds these companies in check, allows them to remain profitable, and lets us enjoy their benefits without destroying journalism and content creation. The ACCC report is definitely worth reading. If you get a chance you should Google it.</p><p>Better still, I'll even post it on my Facebook page.Sam Dastyari is a former NSW senator</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DAITEL-ec21e9b8fdc611e88969d13562fe559cf0a7c3aadf895e59150e1d464a0b0cfc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DAITEL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TYC-V241-JD3N-54DT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244786</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"825\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Telegraph Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 13, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In the lengthy piece, besides asking for Facebook's 'break-up', Hughes recommended the formation of a new agency in the USA that can ensure regulatory monitoring of social media platforms and tech companies and also uphold privacy rights of social media users online.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">From the total number of social media platforms available online, the biggest and most influential is Facebook. It accounts for nearly 80 per cent of the total social media users worldwide.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since then, Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president for global affairs and communication, has hit back at the idea raised by Hughes, through another op-ed piece in the New York Times. However, the points mentioned by Hughes could not be refuted by Clegg entirely. A wide-angle analysis of how Facebook has done little to address serious issues in the areas of user privacy, spread of negative propaganda, monopoly tendency, dominance over other social media platforms and more, can explain the situation.</p><p>BIRTH AND GENESIS OF FACEBOOK: Way back in 2003, Harvard University in Boston, USA was struggling with the idea of having a 'face book', a paper-based platform where names and personal information of the university's students would be available. Inspired by an editorial in the student paper, Crimson, undergraduate student and \"programming prodigy\" Mark Zuckerberg launched 'theface-book.com' on February 04, 2004.</p><p>At the time, membership was only restricted to students of Harvard University. As more than half of Harvard's students had registered by March of 2004, Zuckerberg sought the help of Dustin Moskovitz, Andrew McCollum, and Chris Hughes to help manage the website. As its popularity grew over the following few months, the platform opened up membership to Columbia, Stanford, Yale and other Ivy league institutions of USA and later in Canada.</p><p>Soon after the company was moved to Palo Alto, California, it began to get investments from some of the biggest names in Information Technology in the USA. Somewhere in between this, 'the' was dropped from 'thefacebook.com'. Finally, on September 26, 2006, Facebook opened free membership for anyone around the world with a valid email id.</p><p>At the moment, it has more than 2.20 billion monthly active users. Besides helping with networking and communication, the platform is also facilitating online commerce, video communication and providing other services like gaming, hosting pages and groups etc. The company is currently valued at nearly $ 500 billion.</p><p>The social network platform's total worth and global outreach makes it a formidable facility for users and small and medium entrepreneurs. Over the years, it has remained free, though more and more revenue-generating options for the platform have been popping up.</p><p>PRIVACY ISSUES: One of the biggest problems faced by users of Facebook is the issue of privacy. Without the proper privacy settings on, strangers can still get a hold of user's facebook status posts, photos, shared files etc. Some firms have harvested the material that people openly shared for all manner of purposes, including targeting advertising and creating voter profiles.</p><p>A plethora of such incidents drove regulators to intensify scrutiny of Facebook's privacy practices. The Federal Trade Commission of USA considered a multibillion-dollar fine against the company for violating a 2011 privacy consent decree. In March of this year, the agency said it would create a task force to monitor big tech companies and potential anti-competitive conduct.</p><p>To address the problem with privacy, Zuckerberg said in March, that instead of encouraging public posts on the social media platform, he would focus on private and encrypted communications, in which users message mostly smaller groups of people they know. This shift would partly be achieved by integrating Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger so that users worldwide could easily message one another across the networks, he said. Facebook has acquired apps like Instagram and WhatsApp. Messenger is a separate messaging app linked with Facebook. In effect, he said, Facebook would change from being a digital town square to creating a type of \"digital living room\".</p><p>But this would not entirely address the privacy problem faced by users. Many users have time and again complained about how they are bombarded with advertisements of things that they have recently talked about with their friends or peers on messenger or WhatsApp.</p><p>Also, Facebook can gain access of phonebooks in smart-phones of users. The names and numbers of contacts on the smart-phones, which has Facebook apps installed, are scanned. Later users are sent 'Facebook friend request suggestions' based on recent calls made to contacts.</p><p>Such private information of users are being collected and used for advertisements and other purposes as has been revealed through the Cambridge Analytica scandal and a few others in the past.</p><p>After every single incident, Facebook claimed to be taking steps that will address privacy issues seriously. But till date there is no concrete evidence of what is actually being done and how significant such steps have been in ensuring privacy of users.</p><p>DISINFORMATION AND 'VIRAL' CONTENT: As its number of users worldwide continued to grow alongside internet penetration and affordability of smart-phones, Facebook continued to introduce new facilities into its 'news feed'. Primarily, the 'news feed' is a hub where the latest activities by the user's friends, family members and pages being followed show up. Around 2010, Facebook opened up the scope for users to share links of news and video clips from other websites.</p><p>Most users are unaware of the authenticity of websites that claim to be 'news sites' but are essentially propaganda machines. So, they end up sharing 'news' which are false. Such tendencies have led to many violent conflicts across the world in developing and developed countries.</p><p>In Bangladesh, for example, in 2012, Uttam Kumar Barua of Ramu was tagged in an anti-islamic post. This led to a mob attack on the Buddhist communities of Ramu on September 29, 2012. 12 Buddhist temples were burnt to ashes and dozens of houses were damaged. Uttam had later claimed innocence. The people of his community still blame him and his family for the mayhem.</p><p>Similar anti-Islamic posts on Facebook had also led to attacks on Hindu and Buddhist temples in many parts of the country over the past few years. Across the border in Myanmar on July 02, 2014, a swelling mob of angry Buddhist residents agitated near the Sun Teashop in the commercial hub of Mandalay. The teashop's Muslim owner had been falsely accused of raping a female Buddhist employee. The accusations, originally made on a blog, had gone 'viral' after they were shared on Facebook.</p><p>The situation took a severe turn as soon as ultra-nationalist Buddhist monk Wirathu shared the post. A wave of killings and persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar began.</p><p>It seems that many unaware users of Facebook are more likely to post a 'news item' that they have come across and share, without verifying its authenticity. In fact, according to a Pew study from 2013, about 30?per cent of Facebook users get their news on Facebook, which is higher than any other social networking sites such as YouTube (10 per cent) and Twitter (8 per cent).</p><p>Some users take advantage of the reach of social media platforms to make some content become 'viral' intentionally. These ultimately affect individuals and families in a myriad of ways. For example, 18-year-old Nusrat Jahan Rafi's complaint against her madrasa principal Sirajuddaula to Sonagazi Officer-in-Charge Moazzem Hossain on March 27, 2019, was recorded by the latter on his smart-phone. The more than five-minutes long clip was posted on Facebook leading to threats to Nusrat and her family members. Subsequently, Nusrat was set on fire at her Madrasa, upon orders from Sirajuddaula on April 06. She succumbed to her injuries on April 11.</p><p>During the recent terrorist attacks in Europe, some terrorists had switched on the 'Live' feed on Facebook to document and broadcast the attack.</p><p>But Facebook was not held responsible for the spread of these content and the consequences caused by these. Most of these horrifying content continue to be in circulation on Facebook. This also proves Facebook's lack of accountability.</p><p>In apps like WhatsApp, content is encrypted. Dreading the capabilities of such apps, during election in some countries of South Asia, some governments had to shut down social media platforms.</p><p>After the Easter Sunday attack on April 28 of this year, Sri Lanka had also shut down social media platforms for nearly a week. This was done to stop the spreading of rumours and stop terrorists from coordinating through these platforms.</p><p>MONOPOLY TENDENCIES: In his op-ed piece in the New York Times, Chris Hughes mentioned, \"Facebook's monopoly is also visible in its usage statistics. About 70 per cent of American adults use social media, and a vast majority are on Facebook products. Over two-thirds use the core site, a third use Instagram, and a fifth use WhatsApp. By contrast, fewer than a third report using Pinterest, LinkedIn or Snapchat. What started out as lighthearted entertainment has become the primary way that people of all ages communicate online.\"</p><p>Immediately after the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018, some users had taken part in the 'Delete Facebook' movement. These users channelled their social media addiction towards Instagram and WhatsApp. It was unknown to most of them that Instagram and WhatsApp are also owned by Facebook.</p><p>An example of Facebook's monopoly tendency was proved when they pushed users into installing 'Facebook messenger' into their smart-phones and devices. Messenger was released in 2011 to facilitate direct messaging between Facebook users. Facebook messenger became a separate app that had to be installed into devices for usage around 2015. Any user who did not install the app into their devices was not allowed to communicate with their friends and family members through Facebook's own messaging services during this time.</p><p>Hughes has also pointed out that Facebook is using its strength as a monopoly to copy the capabilities of competing apps. For example, Facebook copied Snapchat's version of 'stories' and disappearing messages. Even the 'living room' idea to address privacy mentioned by Zuckerberg in March of this year is inspired by the techniques used by China's Tencent, according to some IT observers in the US.</p><p>As Facebook continues to become a juggernaut that cannot be tamed, Hughes recommended US administration to break-up the social media network.</p><p>Hughes suggested the formation of a new agency in the USA that can regulate tech companies and ensure privacy of users, much like how Europe is making headway through the General Data Protection Regulation. The law guarantees users a minimal level of protection.</p><p>Such an agency can come up with a privacy bill that will specify the control that users would have over their digital information. \"The agency should also create guidelines for acceptable speech on social media\", said Hughes.</p><p>This could be considered by governments of developing countries like Bangladesh also. Technological professionals, who understand social media, their functions, facilities along with the legal and ethical aspects of these, can be recruited into departments under Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) or under the Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology?.</p><p>Such teams would also need to remain alert and updated about the laws and inquiries going on around the world on social media platforms. For example, lessons can be learnt from New Zealand and France's call to end online terror. Additionally, companies like Facebook, twitter, Google and others should be asked to open offices in Bangladesh. This would at least ensure some form of accountability.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tashfinster@gmail.com\">tashfinster@gmail.com</email></p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

As the billions rolled in, so did the plaudits: Google, Facebook, Amazon and others were making the world a better place. Today these companies are accused of being BAADD - big, anti-competitive, addictive and destructive to democracy. Regulators fine them, politicians grill them and one-time backers warn of their power to cause harm.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Much of this techlash is misguided. The presumption that big businesses must necessarily be wicked is plain wrong. Apple is to be admired as the world's most valuable listed company for the simple reason that it makes things people want to buy, even while facing fierce competition. Many online services would be worse if their providers were smaller. Evidence for the link between smartphones and unhappiness is weak. Fake news is not only an online phenomenon.</p><p>But big tech platforms, particularly Facebook, Google and Amazon, do indeed raise a worry about fair competition. That is partly because they often benefit from legal exemptions. Unlike publishers, Facebook and Google are rarely held responsible for what users do on them; and for years most American buyers on Amazon did not pay sales tax. Nor do the titans simply compete in a market. Increasingly, they are the market itself, providing the infrastructure (or \"platforms\") for much of the digital economy. Many of their services appear to be free, but users \"pay\" for them by giving away their data. Powerful though they already are, their huge stockmarket valuations suggest that investors are counting on them to double or even triple in size in the next decade.</p><p>There is thus a justified fear that the tech titans will use their power to protect and extend their dominance, to the detriment of consumers. The tricky task for policymakers is to restrain them without unduly stifling innovation.</p><p>The less severe contest The platforms have become so dominant because they benefit from \"network effects\". Size begets size: the more sellers Amazon, say, can attract, the more buyers will shop there, which attracts more sellers, and so on. By some estimates, Amazon captures over 40 per cent of online shopping in America. With more than two billion monthly users, Facebook holds sway over the media industry. Firms cannot do without Google, which in some countries processes more than 90 per cent of web searches. Facebook and Google control two-thirds of America's online ad revenues.</p><p>America's trustbusters have given tech giants the benefit of the doubt. They look for consumer harm, which is hard to establish when prices are falling and services are \"free\". The firms themselves stress that a giant-killing start-up is just a click away and that they could be toppled by a new technology, such as blockchain. Before Google and Facebook, Alta Vista and MySpace were the bee's knees. Who remembers them?</p><p>However, the barriers to entry are rising. Facebook not only owns the world's largest pool of personal data, but also its biggest \"social graph\" - the list of its members and how they are connected. Amazon has more pricing information than any other firm. Voice assistants, such as Amazon's Alexa and Google's Assistant, will give them even more control over how people experience the internet. China's tech firms have the heft to compete, but are not about to get unfettered access to Western consumers.</p><p>If this trend runs its course, consumers will suffer as the tech industry becomes less vibrant. Less money will go into start-ups, most good ideas will be bought up by the titans and, one way or another, the profits will be captured by the giants.</p><p>The early signs are already visible. The European Commission has accused Google of using control of Android, its mobile operating system, to give its own apps a leg up.</p><p>Facebook keeps buying firms which could one day lure users away: first Instagram, then WhatsApp and most recently tbh, an app that lets teenagers send each other compliments anonymously. Although Amazon is still increasing competition in aggregate, as industries from groceries to television can attest, it can also spot rivals and squeeze them from the market.</p><p>The rivalry remedy What to do? In the past, societies have tackled monopolies either by breaking them up, as with Standard Oil in 1911, or by regulating them as a public utility, as with AT&amp;T in 1913. Today both those approaches have big drawbacks. The traditional tools of utility regulation, such as price controls and profit caps, are hard to apply, since most products are free and would come at a high price in forgone investment and innovation. Likewise, a full-scale break-up would cripple the platforms' economies of scale, worsening the service they offer consumers. And even then, in all likelihood one of the Googlettes or Facebabies would eventually sweep all before it as the inexorable logic of network effects reasserted itself.</p><p>The lack of a simple solution deprives politicians of easy slogans, but does not leave trustbusters impotent. Two broad changes of thinking would go a long way towards sensibly taming the titans. The first is to make better use of existing competition law. Trustbusters should scrutinise mergers to gauge whether a deal is likely to neutralise a potential long-term threat, even if the target is small at the time.</p><p>Such scrutiny might have prevented Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and Google's of Waze, which makes navigation software. To ensure that the platforms do not favour their own products, oversight groups could be set up to deliberate on complaints from rivals - a bit like the independent \"technical committee\" created by the antitrust case against Microsoft in 2001. Immunity to content liability must go, too.</p><p>Second, trustbusters need to think afresh about how tech markets work. A central insight is that personal data are the currency in which customers actually buy services. The tech titans receive valuable information on users' behaviour, friends and purchasing habits in return for their products. America needs a new set of laws to govern the ownership and exchange of data, with the aim of giving solid rights to individuals.</p><p>In essence this means giving people more control over their information. If a user so desires, key data should be made available in real time to other firms - as banks in Europe are now required to do with customers' account information. Regulators could oblige platform firms to make anonymised bulk data available to competitors, in return for a fee, to foster innovation.</p><p>None of this will be simple, but it would tame the titans without wrecking the gains they have brought. Users would find it easier to switch between services. Upstart competitors would be better equipped to grow to maturity. And shareholders could no longer assume monopoly profits.The Economist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-TheAustralian20180120Australian27000357736877</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RFG-NYN1-F0JP-W1NJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1146\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 20, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

We are ending as we gear towards the close. We are hovering around 60 points or so. We were down one point ever so slightly, but then it continued to soar well into the green. We are the final hour of trading on Wall Street.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As I mentioned, we had a small bit of red around 11:00 a.m., but now, the Dow is firmly higher. Energy shares are leading the way. Those are the markets and these are the reasons why.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tankers attacked at the global choke point for crude oil. The U.S. lays the blame firmly at the door of Iran. And Telegram blocked. Beijing denies involvement in a cyberattack that coincided with protests in Hong Kong; and lawmakers warn: experts so-called deep fakes could actually inflict irreparable damage on businesses.</p><p>Live from the world's financial capital here in New York City. It is Thursday, the 13th of June. I'm Zain Asher, in for my colleague, Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>Good evening. Tonight, the U.S. claims it now knows who is behind a mysterious attack in the world's most important shipping route for crude oil. In the last hour, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pointed the finger of blame right at Iran. Two tankers were sabotaged while sailing through the Strait of Oman.</p><p>One of them the front Altair oil tanker reported three explosions. The second, a Japanese-owned chemical tanker claimed it was attacked twice with some sort of shell.</p><p>The U.S. Navy says it spotted an unexploded mine attached to one of the vessels. No one is claiming responsibility, but speaking a short time ago, Mike Pompeo claimed U.S. Intelligence indicates no one but Iran could have carried out these types of attacks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: It is the assessment of the United States government that the Islamic Republic of Iran is responsible for the attacks that occurred in the Gulf of Oman today.</p><p>This assessment is based on Intelligence, the weapons used, the level of expertise needed to execute the operation, recent similar Iranian attacks on shipping, and the fact that no proxy group operating in the area has the resources and proficiency to act with such a high degree of sophistication.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: Nic Robertson is joining us live now from London. So Nic, just give us more context as to the sort of Intelligence that the U.S. Secretary of State is basing his belief that it was Iran who indeed carried out these attacks.</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yes, he is not telling us what that Intelligence is. What we do know and how the situation has changed since four weeks ago, when there was attacks -- similar attacks -- we're told on for civilian tankers at a port near Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>What has changed is, there's a lot more U.S. military assets in the area. Indeed, they were able to dispatch the USS Bainbridge to the scene that was quite close by very quickly, quickly enough to help pick up and take on- board 21 of the crew members who were forced to evacuate one of the ships.</p><p>So that leaves the door open there that potentially the U.S. has been scrutinizing that area much more closely than it was before. What is interesting and different also about this attack was these vessels were on the move. We do understand that at least one mine was found on the side of one of the vessels.</p><p>We know according to accounts from people on the vessels, there were three explosions in one case, two explosions in another some sort of shell was how one of the witnesses described the explosions that he was witness to.</p><p>But precisely what evidence physical evidence or satellite intelligence or eavesdropping intelligence Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has. He didn't make that clear. In a scenario like this, he may not want to be telegraphing to Iran in this case, you know, precisely how the United States has come about this information.</p><p>But that secrecy over how the information is gathered, and precisely what it is, of course, is part of what Iran plays off of here.</p><p>ASHER: So just talk to us a bit more about the timing of these attacks. Here you have a Japanese-owned tanker attacked at a time when the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been in Iran to meet with the Supreme Leader and President Rouhani. Just explain to us the timing of these attacks.</p><p>ROBERTSON: Well, indeed, the Iranians give us to believe that Shinzo Abe was actually meeting with the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and we know what Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said. He said that, you know, that he is not -- President Trump is not a person to deal with.</p><p>[15:05:10] ROBERTSON: In essence, President Trump is not somebody who can be trusted to deal with. So that was the sort of context of the conversation that the meeting that was being held by Shinzo Abe was really to get to these current tensions, and to listen to Iran's concerns.</p><p>Iran is, of course, under extreme economic pressure at the moment. These meetings came about because of the spike in tensions four weeks ago, when those four other ships were targeted at a time when the United States and Iran were exchanging very tough language over the movement of U.S. Naval assets into the region.</p><p>So Shinzo Abe's mission was really to sort of de-escalate the situation. He didn't -- he certainly didn't seem to get that reception from the Supreme Leader, because he didn't seem to be intent on de-escalating with President Trump and the United States right now.</p><p>So in that way, the mission has been something of, you know, a failure, and it might raise the question, who would dare if you will? You know, Secretary of State Pompeo says Iran did this. But would Iran really dare to target a Japanese vessel when the Japanese Prime Minister is meeting with their Supreme Leader? Well, you know, part of the answer to that may be that this was not something that was sanctioned by the leadership in Iran, but sanction by one of its military wings.</p><p>ASHER: Very interesting. All right, Nic Robertson live for us there. Thank you so much. Appreciate that. Okay, so news on the attacks and the U.S. decision to blame Iran have sent price of crude oil higher.</p><p>Oil spiked as much as four percent before coming back down ever so slightly. Investors predict that rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could disrupt oil supplies. The attack is certainly unsettling trade along one of the world's most important oil trading routes.</p><p>The Gulf of Oman is the sole waterway to the oil-rich Persian Gulf region at its mouth, the Strait of Hormuz, where some 18 and a half million barrels pass through every single day. That's roughly 30 percent of all seaborne traded crude oil.</p><p>Branko Terzic is the President and CEO of Branko Terzic and Associates. He joins us live now from Washington. So Branko, thank you so much for being with us. So how do you think this will affect oil prices in the short term, do you think?</p><p>BRANKO TERZIC, PRESIDENT AND CEO, BRANKO TERZIC AND ASSOCIATES: In the short term, of course, it makes prices go up. People are nervous, and they will bid the price up. In the long term, the prices have to rely on supply and demand. If the Gulf does restrict the flow of oil that will restrict the supply and that'll have an effect on the price.</p><p>So we don't know in the long term what will happen, but we do know in the short term, there is obviously nervousness. This has happened before.</p><p>ASHER: So you've got 30 percent of the world's crude oil basically transported through the Strait of Hormuz, if that strait is choked off or limited or unable to be accessed, what sort of impact would that have on global trade?</p><p>TERZIC: Well, you mentioned the statistics that 30 percent of seaborne travel is through the Gulf, that's predominantly to -- not to the United States and not to Western markets. So the markets that do buy through from the Gulf sources will be the most affected. Europe, for example.</p><p>China is the world's greatest importer of oil and they of course, had now have a fleet in the Arabian Sea. So they will have a significant interest in this as well. And we have the question of who would make up that supply? Well, America has a sufficient opportunity to make up the supply with our shale oil. It's a very, very complicated dynamic that will take some time to sort out.</p><p>ASHER: Let's just talk about the timing of this in terms of what else is impacting the oil market right now. You've also got -- I mean, obviously there are fears now about oil supply. You've got oil prices being pushed higher because of this, but it comes at a time when you've got U.S. sanctions on oil producers in both Venezuela and Iran. So just talk through us about the timing. How does this fit into other things that are impacting oil prices right now?</p><p>TERZIC: Well, the oil prices have been low since last January. They hit their bottom, excuse me, in January, they've been coming up a little bit. Right now, we've had steady U.S. production. We've had a slowdown in global demand, and the largest purchaser, China has had sort of weak economic data.</p><p>So there isn't a lot of positive news to increase oil prices and of course against that, as you mentioned, Zain, we have the sanctions against Iran, which are now being interpreted even more tightly than they were a month ago.</p><p>[15:10:05] TERZIC: And we have the Venezuelan situation, which I think is less people are concerned about the Venezuelan oil, because we figured that's not coming in the market for a long time.</p><p>ASHER: So Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as you know, has just come out and said that, you know, based on U.S. intelligence, he believes that Iran is responsible for this attack. As tensions between the United States and Iran continue to increase, what sort of impact does that have just sort of all that sort of geopolitical tension surrounding this, what sort of impact does that have on oil prices as well?</p><p>TERZIC: Well, the real question is, what is the impact on the behavior of the Iranian government? They are down $10 billion since the November sanctions were put into place. That's a lot of money. They're looking at even further restrictions in sales.</p><p>And you know, this kind of rash action might be from one of the factions of the Revolutionary Guard or somebody. But it's very difficult to imagine that a large country like that is going to just sit by and allow sanctions to destroy the economy, something is going to have to give.</p><p>We remember pre-World War II, the U.S. sanctions on the Japanese oil supply caused Japan to take heinous acts by attacking the United States, some historians say. So we have a serious concern as to what Iran will do as much as what will be the impact on global oil prices.</p><p>ASHER: All right Branko Terzic live for us there. Thank you so much. Appreciate that.</p><p>TERZIC: Thank you.</p><p>ASHER: The United Nations Security Council is expected to discuss the attack on the two tankers. That meeting will be held next hour, I want to bring in John Kirby. He is joining us from Washington. He is a former State Department spokesperson and a military and diplomatic analyst for CNN. John, thank you so much for being with us.</p><p>So Mike Pompeo has come out and said that he believes it is Iran and that Iran is to blame for these attacks. Just walk us through the Intelligence that you believe that that is based on?</p><p>JOHN KIRBY, CNN MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC ANALYST: My guess is -- not having seen the Intelligence, it's based on perhaps overhead Intelligence reconnaissance imagery that they might have. Certainly, it's based on the knowledge that this was at, you know, that they found a limpet mine, a magnetic mine attached to one of the ships.</p><p>We have imagery of that unexploded. That is exactly the same kind of mine that we believe that the Iranians used to attack those tankers off of the UAE just a couple of weeks ago. So that's consistent with their modus operandi. Certainly, it's consistent with their general concern in that part of the Gulf of Oman.</p><p>So I think it's been a mosaic of information that they have, not to mention that, you know, we've had a chance to talk to some of the sailors that came off one of those tankers that was on board one of the U.S. Navy destroyers. I have no doubt that they were talking to those sailors about what they saw and what they heard, what their perceptions were of the attacks when it happened on their ships. So I suspect it's a mosaic of information that has led them to this.</p><p>ASHER: I was talking to one of our reporters just about 10 minutes ago about the timing of this. She has given that you have a Japanese-owned tanker that explodes that's attacked at a time when Shinzo Abe is in Iran meeting with President Rouhani and the Supreme Leader.</p><p>I mean, just because the Secretary of State believes that Iran is responsible, that doesn't necessarily mean it is the leadership of Iran that sanctioned these attacks, does it?</p><p>KIRBY: Boy, that is a great question, Zain. I think you hit the nail right on the head. We have to understand that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, the Naval component, which is most likely responsible for these attacks doesn't report to the civil state government. They don't report to Rouhani. They don't report to Zarif, the Foreign Minister, and they sometimes act unilaterally without advising anybody in the government.</p><p>They kind of report directly to the Supreme Leader, but even he has a very loose command and control over what they're doing. So I think it is entirely plausible that this attack was conducted unilaterally by the IRGC who Trump designated as a terrorist group a few weeks ago, and not necessarily in coordination or consult with the whole government.</p><p>It clearly wouldn't be in Tehran's -- the civil state government's interest -- to have an attack on a Japanese tanker with the Prime Minister of Japan right there in the city. So I think that is a very good question and I would not be surprised at all to find out that it was a unilateral action.</p><p>ASHER: Okay, so going forward. What does this mean, though, for tensions between the United States and Iran?</p><p>KIRBY: Great question. So I suspect now the administration is considering what their options are, is it just going to be economic sanctions? Increasing the economic pressure? Pompeo said today that the efforts still remains a diplomatic and an economic one, but we have added a lot more military forces to the region in addition to what we already had, which was sizable.</p><p>So I suspect they're also looking at potential military options, though, I guess, that they would prefer not to have to use those. So I think they're going to be looking at the range of options.</p><p>I think they're also going to be as you rightly pointed out, Zain, marshaling the international community bringing this up at the UN trying to increase international pressure. And I suspect that's going to be the first arm that they try to get, which is international sanctions, you know, international pressure, not just U.S. unilateral pressure.</p><p>[15:15:19] ASHER: So just given the geopolitical tension in the region, the Gulf of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz, I mean, how does shipping companies guarantee the safety of seafarers at a time like this?</p><p>KIRBY: It's very difficult to do that. These tankers are not equipped for self-defense. Now, you know, in the age -- I said age -- back a few years ago when piracy was big off of Somalia and off Yemen, some civilian commercial vessels were arming themselves and creating some sort of generic force protection capability. These tankers don't have that. So there's no way to defend themselves.</p><p>It is possible that one outcome of all this could be some international naval escorting of tankers in and out of the Gulf. When I was a young officer, an Ensign in 1988 that's what I did. My frigate escorted tankers in and out of the Strait of Hormuz, you could see a return to that possibly if there's a considerable increase of Naval assets in the region, but they don't have the ability to protect themselves.</p><p>And look about a third of the global oil supply go in and out of the strait every single year. It is a choke point. It is also a crucial oil waterway for the world. So I think the Iranians are trying to send the message that while they probably won't shut the straight down, because they would suffer, they're certainly trying to send the message that they could definitely make that oil flow much more precarious.</p><p>ASHER: All right, John Kirby, thank you so much. Appreciate that.</p><p>KIRBY: My pleasure.</p><p>ASHER: The Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee has a warning, deep fakes are coming and social media companies can't wait until after the next election to do something about it. Plus, the latest. It's all about security on the high seas. I was just speaking to Admiral John Kirby about a suspected sabotage in a key Middle Eastern route. I am talking to the head of the world's largest international shipping association. That's next.</p><p>ASHER: The U.S. Congress held its first hearing on deep fake videos Thursday. Officials are worried about the next evolution of election hacking. Now social media companies can't or won't do enough to stop it. The deep fakes use artificial intelligence to show people doing or saying things they didn't actually do.</p><p>A law professor who testified explained how deep fakes can inflict damage in the corporate world.</p><p>[15:20:10] (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DANIELLE CITRON, PROFESSOR OF LAW, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAN: We can imagine the deep fake about sort of the night before an IPO, timed just right, with the CEO saying something that he never said or did basically admitting to the company was insolvent. Right? And so the deep fake, it's the night before the EPO could upend the IPO right? The market will respond far faster than we can debunk it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: All right, Donie O'Sullivan has been following these hearings. So what can actually be done? I mean, that's the scary scenario that she paints there. What could be done to combat the effects, do you think and detect them?</p><p>DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, of course. So we have been speaking to some researchers based out in California who are trying to build a system to detect these deep fakes. I think the fear though is, is that the technology to make the deep fakes is going to sort of out run the technology to detect them.</p><p>It was interesting there to hear that professors speak about these sort of dangers to corporations that this technology could pose, you know, we've heard a lot about how it could be used in the electoral process both on this side of the Atlantic and around the world.</p><p>But you know, the sort of scenario she outlines there is something that you can really imagine happening, you know, just the night before an IPO that a video drops like this. And by the time that it's debunked, or if it's even ever debunked, the effect will have already kicked in.</p><p>ASHER: So it just in terms of combating that, because obviously that is a dire scenario as well. Is it -- whose responsibility is it? Is it private companies? Is it the government? Is it lawmakers? What do you think?</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: And that partially was, I guess, the point they had these hearings today is Congress is really trying to get their hands around this and try to figure out what to do about this new threat. This is technology that's really only sort of come on the scene over the past 18 months to two years. So it really is sort of an unprecedented problem.</p><p>And I think what we will start seeing as the result of these hearings and sort of heightened interest in Washington as a result of briefings from the Intelligence community who say that, you know, America's adversaries could use this technology, we will see lawmakers asking more questions of Silicon Valley.</p><p>Facebook, for its part has said that, you know, they are funding some research into detection and how to handle this problem. The other companies haven't said a whole lot about this, I think the truth is, is that everybody is still trying to figure this out.</p><p>But I think nobody wants to be caught off guard the way they were in 2016, with the sort of fake news epidemic of bots and trolls, and all that sort of stuff that was going on, but prior to the election, they want to get out ahead of us, particularly here in the U.S.</p><p>ASHER: So for ordinary consumers who use social media, is there any way to detect whether a video is deep fake or not? Because when you know -- when the video came out of Mark Zuckerberg, it was 90 percent believable, but not a hundred percent. Because oftentimes, what they're saying is so unbelievable that you sort of realize there's something not quite right about this.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: So there are -- I mean, there are steps, you know, you can take on certain, deep fake videos that you can sometimes see, you know, the lips can be a bit off, the eyes or the face. But I think really, and probably a good general rule whether it's deep fake or any information, particularly on social media these days is just to be skeptical, because, you know, it doesn't have to be --</p><p>ASHER: We're skeptical anyway because we work in news.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Absolutely.</p><p>ASHER: You have to be with this job.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Too skeptical. But we -- you know, I think when it comes to - - it doesn't have to be technology like artificial intelligence that creates a sort of impressive fake video in order to trick people. We saw the Nancy Pelosi video a few weeks ago that wasn't using artificial intelligence at all. That was just a video slowed down using editing software that's been around for decades. And that still had the effect of going viral.</p><p>So I think whether it's a deep fake or if it's a Facebook post, just be skeptical of what see.</p><p>ASHER: All right. Good advice, Donie O'Sullivan live for us. Thank you so much. It's not just the weight of Washington that Silicon Valley should fear, cracking down on tech is in vogue and State Attorneys Generals in the United States are gearing up to get in on the action.</p><p>This week, Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives kicked off their sweeping investigation into the power of tech firms. Meantime, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have divvied up the biggest names.</p><p>The D.O.J. is going to be looking at Apple and Google, the FTC is going to look at Amazon and Facebook. Now, the top floor men and women in at least a dozen states are preparing their own inquiries while Washington can make sweeping structural changes and levy big fines, these states can nip at tech's heels by bringing competition violations through the courts.</p><p>Hadas Gold is following politics, media and business, and she joins us live now from London. So Hadas, just walk us through what specifically these Attorneys Generals across the United States want from the D.O.J. and the F.T.C.</p><p>[15:25:00] HADAS GOLD, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, Zain, this can be a little bit confusing because while there are the Federal antitrust rules, every state also tends to have a lot of their own antitrust and competition rules. And that's where you see these State Attorney General sometimes bringing lawsuits against big companies.</p><p>We've actually already seen this happen in the past and states have actually started to become sort of the front line for a lot of these cases. For example, there are already State Attorney Generals who are trying to block the Sprint and T-Mobile attempted merger.</p><p>But now this week, about 41 Attorneys Generals from different states, including from D.C. and Guam, they signed a letter to the F.T.C. urging them to take a tougher stance on large tech platforms, saying that all of this ownership of personal data makes them pretty much insulated from competition making it harder for startups to get up and into this business.</p><p>Now, this is where we're seeing a lot of this action coming forward on taking a stance against big tech. Because as you know, the F.T.C. and the D.O.J. or divvying up all these platforms, but the State Attorneys Generals, they want to work faster. And actually, there was a specific quote from the Nebraska Attorney General that really stuck out for me and he said, we need to do as Attorneys Generals is to steal a motto actually, from one of the big platforms for Facebook, they said we need to move fast and see whether we need to break things -- Zain.</p><p>ASHER: And so just in terms of what these Attorneys Generals though, want, I mean, are they looking for these -- some of these companies, which is what a lot of people talked about in the past to be broken up, do they want to see Facebook broken up? What do they want?</p><p>GOLD: Some of them do. And some of them, they see this as a competition issue because if it affects their state directly, if there's a company in their state that they feel as though is negatively affected, the competition is negatively affected by these big tech platforms, they want action against that, and for a lot of these State Attorneys Generals, they feel that the Federal government does not move fast enough.</p><p>And they are now we are finally seeing in the last few weeks, the F.T.C. and the D.O.J. starting to get involved, the House Judiciary Committee is starting the hearings on this. But that can be slow moving and oftentimes that you do see State Attorneys Generals actually teaming up with on another four big cases, and also teaming up with the Federal government to bring these cases forward.</p><p>And once you have that sort of momentum building that can really help in a case like this.</p><p>ASHER: A lot of people say that the government has been slow to adapt. I mean, you intimated this as well, the government has been slow to adapt to a rapidly changing industry. So what can the lawmakers do to keep up?</p><p>GOLD: Well, some lawmakers say that actually the rules currently on the books are enough in order to bring some of these antitrust cases against the big tech platforms that actually they should utilize what they already have, instead of trying to bring in new rules to change this.</p><p>But we are seeing a move actually to try to bring in some new laws to protect consumers. Actually, in the last week or so we saw \"The New York Times\" editorial board even advocating for a U.S. style, European GDPR. That is the personal data protection laws that we have here in Europe, \"New York Times\" saying it's time for something like that in the United States.</p><p>And if you actually look at polling from consumers, they do have big concerns, especially about privacy. But actually, when you look at the polling about whether consumers think that big tech needs to be broken up, it's not as high so maybe the way in is through personal privacy.</p><p>ASHER: All right, Hadas Gold live for us there. Thank you so much. Appreciate that. Turning to turmoil in Hong Kong. China's foreign ministry is denying knowledge of a cyberattack against the encryption messaging app Telegram.</p><p>Its founder pointed out the attack coincided with some of this week's biggest protest in Hong Kong. Protesters use Telegram and other apps to coordinate demonstrations without ticking off authorities. Telegram says the attack was powerful and originated from IP addresses inside China. Beijing says it's completely in the dark.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GENG SHUANG, SPOKESMAN, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY (through translator): I don't know about the situation you speak of, but I can tell you here is that China has always been opposed to any kind of cyberattack. China is also a victim of cyberattacks. We have always advocated that the international community should maintain security of the internet space through talks and cooperation on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefits.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: And Thursday saw fresh clashes between police and protesters. Government offices in the financial district remain shut. Eighty one people were injured in Wednesday's violent clashes between protesters and authorities. Hong Kong's Police Commissioner says his officers had no choice but to use force.</p><p>And investors are concerned by all the turmoil and the extradition law as well. The Hang Seng ended slightly lower again Thursday. Some experts say, the ongoing clashes may jeopardize Hong Kong's reputation as a global financial center.</p><p>On Wall Street, U.S. stocks coming down ever so slightly. The major indices bouncing back from two days of modest losses. Energy stocks rallied after a jump in oil price. You can see that the Dow there, we've got 30 minutes or so for trading. The Dow is up about 30 points or so.</p><p>When we come back, the U.S. claims Iran is behind attacks along a key shipping route in the Middle East. I'll speak to a shipping industry official who is urging leaders to deescalate tension before the situation get any worse.</p><p>[15:30:00]</p><p>ASHER: Hello, everyone, I'm Zain Asher, there's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in a moment. When the shipping industry warns an increase in attacks is an urgent problem. And Tyson Foods gets in on the fake meat craze with the chicken free chicken nugget. Before that though, these are the headlines we're following for you at this hour.</p><p>The U.S. is blaming Iran for attacks on two tankers today in the Gulf of Oman. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said it was too sophisticated for any proxy group in the region to pull off, but he didn't offer evidence for the claim. Both crews were rescued, the UN Security Council meets next hour on the attacks.</p><p>Amanda Knox is back in Italy for the first time since her acquittal on murder charges there in 2011. She'll be there -- Knox spent four years in prison for the murder of fellow student Meredith Kercher. Media outlets made a sensation of her trial over years of hearings and appeals.</p><p>Mexican officials say they're acting quickly to send National Guard forces to their southern border as part of a negotiated agreement to avoid U.S. tariff increases. Mexico agreed to reduce the flow of Central American immigrants to the United States. The deal gives Mexico 45 days to show results.</p><p>Returning now to our top story, the second major attack in a month along the world's busiest oil shipping route. The U.S. is blaming Iran for sabotaging two tankers sailing along the Gulf of Oman. The incident has shaken energy markets, sending crude oil prices climbing.</p><p>[15:35:00] Industry leaders warn the increase in attacks and escalated threats are an urgent concern. Joining me live now from London, Jakob Larsen is the head of Maritime Security for BIMCO; the world's largest international shipping association. So Jakob, thank you so much for being with us. So just in terms of in-ness --</p><p>JAKOB LARSEN, HEAD, MARITIME SECURITY, BIMCO: Thank you --</p><p>ASHER: Climber of extreme geopolitical tensions, what can shipping companies do to keep seafarers safe?</p><p>LARSEN: Well, shipping companies can take a number of steps to reduce the risk to the ships and crew. One step which is often mentioned is of course to completely stay away from the area. And of course, that's an option, but it's not an option that many ship owners really want to take.</p><p>And you could say that, if you did that, you would also sort of give the wind to those that are trying to interrupt international trade. So, I think most ship owners, they are looking to the advice that we and I think other associations put out. So watch that way you're going.</p><p>When you're in port, use your propellers randomly, use your bow thrusters(ph), use your eco-sounder to create a lot of disturbance so as to avoid vintage mines being put onboard the vessel. And when you're at sea, keep extra lookout, keep close dialogue with the military authorities. There's a voluntary reporting area established for the whole region which is administered by the U.K. Maritime Trade Operations, and we encourage all our members and international shipping generally to follow the recommendations and report to U.K. MTO so they can have veto which is as good as possible.</p><p>ASHER: And you know, this might seem extreme. But if tensions get that much worse, can you see a future whereby certain tankers are escorted by military Naval vessels?</p><p>LARSEN: Yes, I think that's a -- there's percentage in that. I mean, there's something that we have seen before in the aftermath of the Iran -- Iraq war. Back in the '80s, we saw this scenario unfolding in the Persian Gulf and it might just happen again. It all depends on what the next steps are from the U.S. and whomever is behind these attacks.</p><p>ASHER: So just in terms of when an attack actually happens, what procedures are there in place? I mean, I'm sure that a lot of shipping companies I assume are somewhat prepared for this sort of worst-case scenario.</p><p>LARSEN: Yes, I think most ship owners, they have their emergency response plans. It's all radiate, part of what you are required to have in accordance with international regulations, so most ship owners have this in place and they drill these scenarios regularly. So for a ship owner going into this area, I think the prudent thing is to really look into what are the risks and what would happen to the vessel in case it's struck by a shell, a missile or a mine or whatever has actually hit these vessels.</p><p>You can take certain steps, you can keep your crew above the water line, you can ensure that the watertight integrity of the vessel is as good as possible, and you go in, and as I said before also keep sharp lookout and then keep the -- keep a liaison with the U.K. Maritime Trade Operations.</p><p>ASHER: So when you have a situation whereby 30 percent of the world's oil suppliers travel through the Strait of Hormuz, you know, if tensions increase significantly, you know, what does that mean for global trade?</p><p>LARSEN: Yes, what we have seen already is a spike in the oil prices, and if tensions continue, oil prices will probably go up a bit further. And we all know that this hampers the general economic activity in the world, and that again has an influence on production, which again influences on world trade.</p><p>So that's a big concern. That aside, of course, the tanker industry, all the oil tankers operating in the area, they would be particularly concerned with the scenario we are seeing right now and with the potential scenarios we see for the future.</p><p>ASHER: All right, Jakob Larsen live for us there, thank you so much, appreciate it. All right, still to come, Boris Johnson is one step closer to taking up residence at number 10 Downing Street. Have a report from London for you after the break.</p><p>[15:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASHER: Boris Johnson is the clear frontrunner in the race to succeed Theresa May as British Prime Minister. He won the first round of the contest to be the leader of the Conservative Party by a clear margin, with the backing of 114 Tory MPs, his nearest rival Jeremy Hunt trailed with 43 votes.</p><p>Phil Black is in London for us. So Boris Johnson felt -- received 114 votes. Is there anything at this point that you can foresee that will stop Boris Johnson from becoming Britain's next Prime Minister.</p><p>PHIL BLACK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi Zain, not in this first stage of the leadership election, you wouldn't think. So this first stage involves just members of parliament, Conservative members of parliament. With that sort of support, if Boris Johnson maintains it, then he will go almost certainly to the final two names which are then voted on by the broader Conservative Party membership across the country.</p><p>But even for Boris Johnson with a reputation for often conflicting political self-harm, it's difficult to see how he could lose so much support over the coming week or so that he wouldn't make it down to the final two. After that, however, when he goes out to the broader party membership, he campaigns, he meets with voters and speaks to journalists.</p><p>Under those circumstances, there's a theory that says Boris Johnson's unpredictability could in that situation get him into trouble. But at this stage, the result today proves what's being suspected, and that is that it is his contest to lose at this stage, Zain.</p><p>ASHER: So, as you mentioned, he is unpredictable, obviously, he is fairly divisive. He's of course extremely pro-Brexit. I'm just curious in your opinion, what do European leaders -- what do the leaders of Europe have to fear if Boris Johnson does become Britain's next Prime Minister?</p><p>BLACK: Well, Brexit credentials from the Conservative Party's point of view really matters in this leadership election. And particularly where the contenders stand on the issue of deal or no deal. Are they prepared to walk away from the European Union without a deal? And Boris Johnson says, yes, he is.</p><p>Come October 31st, the next deadline in the Brexit process, if there's no deal in place, he says Britain will leave regardless. Now, it's unclear whether or not that is in fact possible. He is talking about trying to come to some sort of new arrangement with Europe, but it's also unclear whether or not that has any chances as well because Europe has been pretty clear on this.</p><p>That is, they spent two years negotiating with the British government to come up with a very detailed withdrawal agreement that would allow Britain to leave in an orderly way. From their point of view, that negotiation is complete. The withdrawal agreement is on the table and they've consistently said they are not prepared to renegotiate that document.</p><p>And it's very likely that European leaders and officials will maintain that position. So, what it means is that Boris Johnson is promising to try and renegotiate, which doesn't seem likely, and at the same time, he's promising to leave without a deal.</p><p>It's also not clear that parliament will allow him to do so. So even though, he can't guarantee being able to deliver these things, it's important because this message really resonates with Conservative Party members and members of parliament. And that's why he's performing so strongly, and it's why he will not be easy to handle for European leaders if he does become the next British Prime Minister, Zain.</p><p>[15:45:00] ASHER: All right, Phil Black who is in London for us, Phil, thank you. A freelance have Fiverr in the splash on Wall Street today, its CEO tells us how the site works and where it wants to go, next. And the meat market is going green, two of the biggest names in business unveil plant-based products. That's next.</p><p>ASHER: Hi-fives all around for Fiverr. The Israeli start-up is soaring on its U.S. market debut. Shares were up more than 80 percent, they opened $26 each on the New York Stock Exchange, $24 percent jump above the IPO price. Fiverr is an online marketplace that connects companies with freelances, you can book tasks like for example logo design, translation, even 3D printing services.</p><p>Its CEO Micha Kaufman told Alison Kosik what makes Fiverr stand out in the gig economy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHA KAUFMAN, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, FIVERR: I think as a company, the way we should be thought of is as a skilled platform. And I think that, that is very different than other economy platforms. And we've been demonstrating very nice growth for almost a decade, and this is what we plan to do in the future.</p><p>And there's a lot of hail wind in the market forces, freelancing is getting much more adoption. Yet, this whole market is giant, it's over $100 billion in the U.S. alone in the categories in which we operate in right now. It is still low single digit percentage online. The revolution is just starting.</p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Walk us through exactly what Fiverr does.</p><p>KAUFMAN: So, Fiverr is basically a market that connects freelancers with businesses of all sizes for their digital needs. Things like marketing and advertising, videography, website design, voiceovers, anything you can imagine, it's the everything store for digital services. But the experience of buying a digital service on Fiverr is very similar to shopping on Amazon.</p><p>You browse, find something you like and you click order. It's that simple. You don't hire anyone. You buy very well defined products.</p><p>KOSIK: What about commission? Because this is where a lot of your revenue is coming from. What kind of commission do you take?</p><p>[15:50:00] KAUFMAN: So, basically, out take rate is slightly over 26 percent which is an industry-leading take rate. And we take the commission mostly on transactions.</p><p>KOSIK: And does that go down at all as the -- as the seller, you know, earns more money for let's say one company?</p><p>KAUFMAN: No, it's actually the same take rate and here's why? For sellers, for the first time in the freelancing history, they don't need to actively bid to win projects. They come into Fiverr, they create a profile, they use our tools to product their offerings, and they sit back and relax. We do the rest of the work, we source the lines --</p><p>KOSIK: Isn't freelancing complicated when it comes to tasks?</p><p>KAUFMAN: Well, this is -- this is between freelancing and the fact, that's authorities. We are the platform that just connects those freelancers. We don't hire them.</p><p>KOSIK: What concerns do you have about regulation and the impact of regulation on your company and its growth?</p><p>KAUFMAN: I think it's very clear the relationship between Fiverr and its freelancers is such where we don't employ them, and that is very clear. So, I think that the current relation doesn't actually apply to us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ASHER: Tyson is trying to take a bite out of the fake meat market. They announced two new products Thursday, a chicken free chicken nugget made of -- let me show you, pea protein, egg whites, flaxseed and bamboo fiber, and a blended party of meat and veggies. Shares are -- Beyond Meat which -- Tyson was actually an earlier investor, fell as much as 4 percent pre- market on the news there, down about 1 percent.</p><p>Paul La Monica is joining us live now. Paul, step into my kitchen here --</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, indeed, not a bad look, smells suspiciously like a real chicken.</p><p>ASHER: That is actually real chicken. So, just walk us through this, so with Tyson Foods, can they really at this point do you think -- I mean, obviously, they're huge. They pretty much own the meat market in the United States. But, can they really compete with Beyond Meat at this point, do you think?</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, I think it's still very early stages for the plant-based craze that we have right now. And Tyson is probably smart to be trying to get into it. As you pointed out, they actually were an early investor, they probably wish they sail --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASHER: Hey, right, yes --</p><p>LA MONICA: Beyond Meat has surged. But what's interesting here is that Tyson, you know, egg whites, last I checked, that egg probably came from a bird. So, it is not entirely plant-based --</p><p>ASHER: Right --</p><p>LA MONICA: In the way that Beyond Meat and Impossible is --</p><p>ASHER: So, this sort of -- Tyson is doing a sort of hybrid --</p><p>LA MONICA: Is a bit of a hybrid, yes, exactly --</p><p>ASHER: Yes, they're doing the hybrid thing. So, do you think that this whole sort of plant-based meat market that we're seeing explode in the United States, is it becoming overcrowded? You've got KFC getting in on the game, you've got Tyson getting -- Nestle is even trying to get in, what are your thoughts on that?</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, Nestle is going to be launching its own product, that's going to be very interesting to see how that affects Beyond Meat stock and what happened to Impossible as well, Impossible in some respects may be more well known to many Americans because they have the Impossible Whopper at Burger King.</p><p>But Impossible still doesn't have the distribution in grocery stores the way that you're going to see with Nestle when they launch and Beyond Meat already having their products in many grocery stores.</p><p>ASHER: I see.</p><p>LA MONICA: So, I think the biggest issue right now is that this is a legitimate, undeniable food trend. People want to eat healthier, they also want to eat in a way that may be more favorable to the environment.</p><p>ASHER: Right --</p><p>LA MONICA: In doing that through these plant-based types of products, I think will be good. But in the same way, I'm going to date myself here. In the late '90s where we didn't need to have 75 different alternatives to Amazon because there was only one Amazon that really survived and thrived - -</p><p>ASHER: Yes --</p><p>LA MONICA: We probably don't need tens of dozens of --</p><p>ASHER: Right --</p><p>LA MONICA: Plant-based meat companies.</p><p>ASHER: So KFC is getting in, they've got a new sort of meat product they're calling the Imposter, I love that name, but here's my question, if you're vegan, do you really go to KFC to buy food?</p><p>LA MONICA: It is a great question. I think that what a lot of these restaurant chains are hoping is that the fashionable term these days seems to be flexitarian, which I find amusing because --</p><p>ASHER: Yes --</p><p>LA MONICA: I'm an old school guy, I still call them omnivores, you eat meat and you eat plants. You eat --</p><p>ASHER: Right --</p><p>LA MONICA: Vegetables, but I think people are increasingly wanting the texture of meat, but without all the side effects --</p><p>ASHER: Products --</p><p>LA MONICA: Of meat, red meat in particular --</p><p>ASHER: Right --</p><p>LA MONICA: Also white meat for chicken, but what's going to be interesting, yes, if you go to KFC, do you really want something made out of fermented fungus, and I think that remains to be seen.</p><p>ASHER: And I actually want to make it clear to our audience that KFC is launching the Imposter in the U.K. for now --</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, we don't know if it's coming to the U.S. just yet.</p><p>ASHER: Right, so when you think about -- just to get it back to the markets ever so slightly, when you think about Beyond Meat and just how much it's surged since its IPO, over 250 percent or so above its IPO price. That is quite appealing for short sellers, don't you think?</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, I think that one of the problems is that the volume for Beyond Meat, the number of shares available is still relatively small. And that's one of the reasons why the price has been able to pop so dramatically as you have that low float.</p><p>[15:55:00] That makes it harder to short as well, so it's going to be fascinating to see whenever that lock up period expires, and insiders are allowed to sell in a couple of months, is there going to be this wave, an unloading of Beyond Meat's shares because some of these investors are going to be licking their chops so to speak --</p><p>ASHER: Yes --</p><p>LA MONICA: And saying, hey, I'm going to cash in now because you know, the stock is up dramatically --</p><p>ASHER: Yes --</p><p>LA MONICA: From that $25 --</p><p>ASHER: Of course --</p><p>LA MONICA: IPO price.</p><p>ASHER: So, when you think about a company like Beyond Meat and just how many different companies are jumping on the bandwagon on this especially after seeing how successful they have become. What can they do to continue to stand out?</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, I think that when you're a company like Beyond Meat, obviously, you want to have as many different restaurant partners as possible, so the fact that they are working with Tim Hortons, which is a corporate cousin of Burger King is good news for them.</p><p>So, it shows that restaurant brands, the owner of Burger King isn't going all in on Impossible so to speak. So, having as many partners as possible on the retail side would be great because they do have that leg up on Impossible. Because you can buy and bring home and cook for yourself a Beyond Meat burger.</p><p>Impossible you can't do that yet, unless you're going to Burger King or one of the Impossible partners, you're not going to be able to just take an Impossible patty and grill it yourself, yet because they're still trying to figure out retail distribution.</p><p>ASHER: All right, Paul La Monica, I have to offer you take some of this home.</p><p>LA MONICA: And I am going to have to decline.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ASHER: Oh, I thought you said -- I thought you were going to say you were going to take it home. You're going to decline, OK --</p><p>LA MONICA: Oh, sorry --</p><p>ASHER: I'll give it to the crew here --</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, the kids are likely in need --</p><p>ASHER: OK, thank you so much. There are just moments left to trade on Wall Street. We'll have the final numbers and the closing bell right after this break.</p><p>ASHER: Reminder of our breaking news this hour. The U.S. is blaming Iran for attacks on two tankers today in the Gulf of Oman. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said it was too sophisticated for any proxy group in the region to pull off, but he didn't offer evidence for the claim.</p><p>The U.S. Security Council meets next hour on the attacks. News of the attacks add the U.S.' decision to blame Iran have sent the price of crude higher. Oil spiked as much as 4 percent before paring gains. Investors predict that rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could disrupt oil supplies.</p><p>Right, turning to stock markets. The major indices have come down a bit in the past hour. Actually, they're back up again as well as up about 74 points or so. Energy stocks are the major gainers for the day. And that, my friends, is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, the closing bell is ringing on Wall Street, I'm Zain Asher in New York for you, the news continues right here on CNN.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019061301cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WBF-22V1-DXH2-6435-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8166\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 13, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Middle East, Stock Market, Energy and Oil, War, Attack, Violence, Internet, Social Media, Deep Fakes, Technology, Economy, Hong Kong</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mike Pompeo</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Gulf of Oman</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Amanda Knox</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mexico</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Stock Exchanges</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0ZDMDg5MEQ3OTlGNEJCMkI0M0EyM0MwN0E1Njk1MEQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDBGREFBMDgyNTQ0NERFRUI3MEUwNDBFOTM5NDExREI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A22R</classCode><className>BORDER CONTROL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZGX</classCode><className>CYBERCRIME</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOG2</classCode><className>DEEPFAKE TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp;

The closing bell rings, US stocks swing sharply  higher, the Fed has begun tapering. What a day it has been as the gavel  gets hit --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(RINGS BELL)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">QUEST: Oh! It's Wednesday, it's the 18th of December. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, we're all about tapering time. The Fed slows down the stimulus  just a smidgeon. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ford falls a little bit more. It falls foul of investors and warns about  profits at risk.</p><p>And also tonight, taking the company by the tail. Which do you prefer for  the new American Airlines? The employees get to vote, we will explain.</p><p>I'm Richard Quest, live at the CNN Center, where of course I mean business.</p><p>Good evening. What a day! Well, the suspense is over. The Federal Reserve  is to start tapering in January. The key line in the Fed statement, it said  quite clearly, \"In light of the cumulative progress towards maximum  employment and the improved conditions in the labor market, conditions the  committee decided to modestly reduce the pace of its asset purchases.\"</p><p>So, tapering is to begin. Since September 2012, the Fed's been buying $85  billion worth of US securities and mortgage-backed securities. Now, from  January, just watch the speedometer, it goes down just a smidgeon by $10  billion to $75 billion a month. It will break down in $35 billion and $40  billion of US treasuries and make $75 billion.</p><p>It's symbolic but it is happening, and this is what everybody had been  waiting for. We had debated whether it was going to be January or March of  next year, but clearly, the Fed's announcement, followed by Chairman Ben  Bernanke's news conference, which was his last before he steps down at the  end of January. And Bernanke said tapering -- according to the data at  least -- tapering is here to stay.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BEN BERNANKE, CHAIRMAN, US FEDERAL RESERVE: If the economies slows for some  reason or we are disappointed in the outcomes, we could skip a meeting or  two. On the other side, if things really pick up, then of course we could  go a bit faster. But my expectation is for similar moderate steps going  forward throughout most of 2014.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Now, the Fed has invigorated the markets. Come over to me over at  the board and you'll see just what these numbers look like. This is a  record. The Dow surged up 293 points. That's a gain of nearly more than  1.75 percent. </p><p>But it's the way the day had progressed. For most of the session, we really  were just bobbing up and down about, 30, 40 points. Then as we get to this  period here, just before the announcement, it goes down. </p><p>It comes back up again -- and you can't see it on this graph, but take my  word for it. I'm going to right in here. Just there, after we get the  announcement, the market goes down, and I suspect that's because nobody  really was able to work out just how much, what had -- it was literally  just a minute or two at exactly 2:00.</p><p>And then the rally began and it was slow to begin and then broad-based, and  it continued right up to a record, the Dow standing at 16,168. The S&amp;P 500,  the broader market, also closing at all-time high.</p><p>And this is about much more than just the Fed taking the foot off the gas.  This statement contains several other crucial parts of information. For  instance, the Fed adjusted its forward guidance. Rates are to stay low well  past the time when unemployment goes below 6.5 percent. Now, that's  interest rates. That's, of course, the Fed funds rate.</p><p>Inflation still well below the 2 percent target. We had economic  projections that were released. Unemployment is expected to fall faster  next year. Fewer board members now expect tightening on rates that will  take place next year.</p><p>Joining us now from Washington is Joseph Gagnon. He's the senior fellow at  the Peterson Institute for International Economics and has worked at the  Federal Reserve Board and at the US Treasury.</p><p>Sir, thank you for joining us. We knew it was coming. It's happened now,  and it's still -- even though we knew it was on its way, it's still  significant.</p><p>JOSEPH GAGNON, SENIOR FELLOW, PETERSON INSTITUTE FOR INTERNATIONAL  ECONOMICS: Yes, absolutely. It seems like a case of sell on the room rather  than buy on the news, in this case. But I wonder if the language about  keeping the rates lower long after the unemployment rate goes below 6.5  might actually have been the more important piece of news today that might  have encouraged markets to be so positive.</p><p>QUEST: This idea that even though stimulus may go next year, what really  matters is when interest rates go up, because that -- the tightening part  of the policy, isn't it?</p><p>GAGNON: Yes, I think so, I think so. Because the taper, although it's a bit  earlier than expected, it looks like it will be going slower than expected.  And so it probably doesn't have much news for the market, because we'll  still be having QE through the end of the year next year just about. </p><p>But the fact that they were willing to say that they would hold short-term  rates at zero well beyond unemployment reaching 6.5 percent to me was the  real news.</p><p>QUEST: And yet, at the same time, there is this inflation question -- I  mean issue. I'm looking at the projections. Now, they all believe that  inflation will remain low for the foreseeable future, in the 1 to 2 percent  range. </p><p>And everything the Fed basically says today about that unemployment well  past the time that the unemployment rate declines, is very much contingent  on them being right on the inflation question.</p><p>GAGNON: Yes, it is. And I think there's a huge uncertainty in both  directions because inflation's been lower than they had expected, but there  is a lot of concern that it could go up higher in the future, and they have  to be on guard against both possibilities.</p><p>QUEST: Looking at the GDP forecast that we got from the FOMC members, very  slightly down, it's almost unalterable, it's almost unaltered. But the  unemployment number, again, that did fall. </p><p>There you've got the GDP number slightly lower, but you've also got the  unemployment number. Which of all the data that you heard and the forecast  that we've seen and the projections that we've been given do you find the  most interesting?</p><p>GAGNON: Well, I would say it's the data that's come out recently that they  didn't talk about today, but spending data in the US economy and employment  data, monthly employment reports and stuff, have been stronger lately, and  in particular, showing the strength through the government shutdown and  despite the big sequester cuts is what I think has got people feeling  rather bullish.</p><p>QUEST: Good to talk to you, sir. Thank you for joining us and putting this  into perspective. Now, as we've talked about the taper rally, well, the  stock surge was quite impressive. Maribel Aber is at the New York Stock  Exchange. </p><p>We've just been talking there, not only do we have this taper, we do have  that wording in the last paragraph of the statement, which does say \"the  committee anticipate the funds will last well past the time of 6.5  percent.\" What was the market focusing on?</p><p>MARIBEL ABER, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Richard. It was focusing on  all of that, and as you said a little bit earlier there, we saw that tick  down a little bit right at 2:00. Took some time to vet that through. And  then all the sudden, you saw this gradual rise.</p><p>I think the markets in general were really happy to have the decision  finally behind us. And as you said, not putting on the brakes, per se, just  easing the foot off the gas, right? The markets seemed to like this gentle  ease if you will. The Dow was surging shortly after the taper announcement  came down.</p><p>You talked earlier about these records that we set today, the Dow set a  record close, the S&amp;P set a record close. That $10 billion pullback was in  the range that Wall Street expected, so not so dramatic that it's spooking  investors.</p><p>But now, I think, they're looking past this taper headline. They're  focusing on the message that this decision telegraphs about the economy.  The Fed is confident --</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>ABER: -- it can start to stand on its own. Richard?</p><p>QUEST: Maribel, thank you for that. I day that will -- I think all of us  who work in this business, all of us who sort of cover business news and  economic news will certainly remember.</p><p>It was also the day when shares in Ford -- now that has been a stellar  performer, bearing in mind the US economy and its recovery and the  recession -- shares in the Ford Motor Company plummeted after the company  issued a profit warning. The stock fell more than 6 percent in New York. </p><p>Ford now expects to earn between $7 billion and $8 billion next year, down  from $8.5 billion in 2013. Bosses are blaming tough economic conditions in  Europe and South America.</p><p>When we need to understand these market movements, Paul La Monica's the man  we turn to from CNN Money. He joins me now from New York. We've known that  Ford has had some difficulties, but it has always been the darling of the  motor industry because it didn't take US government cash and it did seem to  be performing so well. What's gone wrong?</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN MONEY ASSISTANT MANAGING EDITOR: Yes, exactly. As you  point out, Ford did not go bankrupt. GM and Chrysler did. I think what's  happening here is that GM and Chrysler are emboldened now because they've  cleaned up their balance sheets, they've gotten their act together, they're  making cars that people like to drive.</p><p>And Ford specifically said that tough competition in North America, the US  specifically, is a problem. I'm not so sure it's that the economy is weak  in the US as much as it is just that the Big Three is -- they're all back.</p><p>QUEST: In this environment, then, do we just take today's warning as a  hiccup? Or we've known Ford -- Ford of all of the companies has really been  very aggressive in restructuring its European assets. It's always had the  idea of a third, a third, a third. A third US, a third Europe, a third  Asia. Do see anything in this that changes that strategy?</p><p>LA MONICA: I doubt it. The only thing that could potentially change that  strategy is the eventual changing of the guard at Ford, and in some  respects, that's the bigger story, the Alan Mulally, will he stay, will he  not rumor hasn't died down, even though many people within the Ford  organization have been adamant to say that he's going to be there through  the end of 2014. </p><p>But you still hear all the chatter. Maybe he's the top candidate to replace  Steve Ballmer at Microsoft. So if Mulally's gone, I think anything's up for  -- up in the air in terms of new strategy.</p><p>QUEST: Yes. Now, that's the big one, isn't it? They say he will be CEO  right the way through 2014, or he'll stay to the end of his contract, I  forget the exact -- you could probably remind me the exact phraseology.  It's clever wording, isn't it, that leaves a little bit of a window of  interpretation --</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, it definitely seems that way.</p><p>QUEST: -- of when he might go?</p><p>LA MONICA: I really doubt that -- the only thing that's going to stop the  chatter about Mulally going to Microsoft is Microsoft announcing a new CEO  whose name is not Alan Mulally.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUEST: Good point. A busy day. You've got to admit, you don't see Ford down  6 percent ever day. You don't see tapering every day. Good to see you, Paul  --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, no tapering love for the Big Three, unfortunately. Tessla  down, too.</p><p>QUEST: No, I -- well, yes, but -- and also, and yet at the same time, the  US government selling -- managing to get rid of its GM stock. So all three  are, as you rightly point out, now fit for purpose and fit to fight. That's  basically it, isn't it?</p><p>LA MONICA: Definitely. And keep in mind, too, that even with the Ford sell- off today, the stock is up about 20 percent year-to-date. That has lagged  GM. </p><p>GM's had an amazing year, and a lot of people feel that they're on the  right track with a new CEO, Mary Barra coming in, and she's a product  person, so I think a lot of people are excited about GM in a way that they  hadn't been in a long time.</p><p>QUEST: Paul La Monica, thank you for joining us.</p><p>LA MONICA: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: What -- no wonder we enjoy this business so much when you've got so  many great stories all happening at once, a firmament in our very midst. </p><p>The arrest of an Indian diplomat in New York has sparked an international  row. US Secretary of State John Kerry says he empathizes with India. Did he  actually apologize, and if he -- whatever he said, why did he say it? We'll  talk about it after the break. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>(RINGS BELL)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: The US secretary of state, John Kerry, has been drawn into the  diplomatic row, not surprisingly, between India and the United States.  Secretary Kerry expressed regret over the arrest of India's deputy consul,  who's been held on suspicion of visa fraud last week. </p><p>Devyani Khobragade was strip-searched after being accused of underpaying  her New York maid. Before we talk more about this, let's get the background  from Pamela Brown.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PAMELA BROWN, CNN US NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Watch as police  remove the concrete security barriers in front of the US embassy in New  Delhi. Newspapers in India reporting the government is behind the anti-US  protest. Why? Retaliation sparked by an arrest of this Indian diplomat in  New York City, Devyani Khobragade.</p><p>According to this criminal complaint, Khobragade, a deputy consul general,  severely underpaid her babysitter, only paying her $3.31 an hour, far less  than minimum wage. The complaint also alleges the diplomat worked her  babysitter far more than the 40 hours per week, allegedly without overtime  pay, and then lied about all of this on visa documents, a violation of US  law.</p><p>UTTAM KHOBRAGADE, DEVIYANI KHOBRAGADE'S FATHER: My daughter has not done  anything wrong. She had nothing to do with this visa process.</p><p>BROWN: State Department diplomatic security arrested Khobragade last  Thursday after she dropped her daughter off at school. She was later strip- searched and put in a holding cell with other defendants. Her lawyer says  she pleaded not guilty.</p><p>DANIEL ARSHACK, DEVIYNAI KHOBRAGADE'S ATTORNEY: I have every expectation  that she will be completely vindicated.</p><p>BROWN: Her arrest sparked outrage among Indian officials, some calling her  treatment barbaric, one even calling for the partners of gay US diplomats  in India to be arrested. The country recently banned gay sex.</p><p>YASHWANT SINHA, FORMER INDIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: What the government of  India can do immediately is to cancel those visas, arrest all these  companions, put them behind bars.</p><p>BROWN: Indian officials also snubbed US delegates visiting India, one  tweeting, \"Refused to meet the visiting USA delegation in solidarity with  our nation.\"</p><p>KAMAL NATH, INDIAN ARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS MINISTER: More steps should be  taken against the United States until they give an unconditional apology.</p><p>BROWN: US Marshal Service officials stand by their strip-search procedures,  saying they treated the diplomat the same way they treat everyone else.</p><p>MARIE HARF, DEPUTY SPOKESPERSON, US STATE DEPARTMENT: Thus far, all  indications are that appropriate procedures were followed. But nonetheless,  we understand this is a very sensitive issue, and we're continuing to  review exactly what transpired.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: All right, let's talk about this with our World Affairs Reporter,  Elise Labott, who's in Washington. We need to get to the bottom of this.  I've -- I don't know why, but one day I did sit down and read the US State  Department's handbook on diplomatic immunity and how they're supposed to  treat people.</p><p>Now, if she'd been a full diplomatic agent, there was no question of  handcuffing her or anything like that, whatever she'd have done. But she's  not a diplomatic agent, is she? She has consular immunity. And now the  issue is, did Kerry apologize or not?</p><p>ELISE LABOTT, CNN WORLD AFFAIRS REPORTER: OK. Well, she has this consular  immunity, Richard, and that means that she can't be arrested for anything  that she's doing as part of her official duties. So, these crimes that  she's been accused of and actually pled guilty to in a Manhattan federal  court, by the way, are outside the scope of her duties.</p><p>I think what -- Secretary Kerry was apologizing for a few things. He was  apologizing for the treatment that she received. I think even though proper  procedures were followed, I think that there's an understanding that A, she  could have been afforded a little bit more courtesy and respect given her  status in New York as an Indian diplomat.</p><p>And B, this cultural sensitivity in India, where woman who are screened or  patted down or anything like that are kind of brought to a private room.  It's very -- the cultural sensitivity is very high there.</p><p>And I think he's also apologizing for the fact that this is getting out of  hand, that now India is taking all these actions against the United States,  and that this is really affecting relations, because --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: But there's a very -- all right. But -- I'm going to jump in here  because --</p><p>LABOTT: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: -- this is the difficulty, though.</p><p>LABOTT: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: You've got New York authorities saying we did nothing wrong. You've  got Kerry basically saying, well, they may not have done anything wrong,  but I'm still very sorry that they did nothing wrong. And you -- at what  point does India decide to bury the hatchet in this, or does it decide to  keep throttling forward?</p><p>LABOTT: OK. Well, technically, the marshals didn't do anything wrong, but  diplomatic security guards made the arrest. And then they handed her over  to the marshals. And the diplomatic security services could have said,  listen, treat her with kid gloves. Give her a little bit of respect and  leeway. They didn't do that, and I think that's one thing that there's an  understand of that.</p><p>And I think that -- the Indians here, it's kind of unclear. On one hand,  they're protesting the treatment of the diplomat and the manner in which  this was carried out, but the whole idea that she doesn't have immunity  from this crime in the first place.  And that's one of the little dirty little secrets here in Washington is  about how diplomats treat their domestic help. There have been a lot of  cases, even particularly in India this year of diplomats that are treating  --</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>LABOTT: -- their servants poorly. And so I think that both sides need to  take it down a notch, and I think that's what Secretary Kerry is trying to  do.</p><p>QUEST: In a word, in a sentence, you've studied diplomacy and diplomatic  relations for years. Does this story go away fast?</p><p>LABOTT: No. I think it -- I think that the moves that the Indians have  taken have been a bit excessive, and you saw in Deb Feyerick's (sic) piece  that they're calling for more action. And so, I think that that call might  have helped, but I think that the tensions are going to remain, especially  if this diplomat is prosecuted in US courts.</p><p>QUEST: Elise Labott in Washington putting it into perspective for us. Thank  you, Elise. </p><p>Now, Facebook knows what its users do on its site, and now they know what  they do when it's off it. An executive speaks exclusively to CNN on the  Facebook data dilemma and -- it's straight after in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: For the first time, a Facebook executive has spoken on camera about  how Facebook is using your offline data to market ads to you online. Samuel  Burke sat down with Facebook's vice president of global marketing for an  exclusive interview. Samuel joins me now live from New York.</p><p>Now, let's be clear about this. We know that they rampantly manage to take  our online searches and when you're on Facebook, but this is when you're  offline. This is when you're not on the Facebook site, is that right?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: That's correct. I think, Richard,  we've all had that \"oh wow\" moment when we realize they really are tracking  us. When you search for something on website and then you go to another  website and see an ad there for what you were searching for.</p><p>This is -- that's really nothing compared to what they're able to find out  about you offline, and then give ads to you online.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRED ASTAIRE AS SD KLUGER, NARRATOR, \"SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN\": Santa  can still look into his magic snowball and see just what you're up to.</p><p>BURKE (voice-over): Just like Santa Claus in the classic cartoon --</p><p>ASTAIR (singing): He sees you when you're sleeping, he knows when you're  awake --</p><p>BURKE: Big tech companies not only know what their users are up to online,  increasingly they know what they're doing offline. Facebook is partnering  with data collection firms that gather information from those customer  loyalty cards used in many brick and mortar stores. </p><p>Facebook's vice president of global marketing says the data is then used to  create customized ads and deals to its more than 1 billion customers.</p><p>CAROLYN EVERSON, VICE PRESIDENT OF GLOBAL MARKETING, FACEBOOK: I'll give  you a very real example. Let's say that I am a heavy snack user and I buy  snacks. And we now have the ability through about 50 percent of purchase  card data in the United States to tell a snack manufacturer that here are  the consumers that have purchased snacks and allow that marketer to target  them with a very specific ad.</p><p>BURKE (on camera): How can Facebook guarantee that all this data is  anonymous?</p><p>EVERSON: We have the data from, let's say, the grocery store, which is  really purchase card data. We have that bucket of data. We have the  Facebook data. Those two never shall meet in terms of us sharing specific  Facebook information or them sharing very specific purchase information. </p><p>So they would turn Samuel into a code that would never be identifiable as  Samuel, you would be a set of characters.</p><p>BURKE (voice-over): That procedure is called hashing, and despite this  advance in securing information, privacy advocates are worried about tech  companies collecting so much information.</p><p>MARC ROTENBERG, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, PRIVACY INFORMATION CENTER: We do  believe that hashing and more generally de-identification, which is a  technique for anonymizing, that is to remove the actual information of the  user, is a good privacy too, and we favor it.</p><p>But we think it also has to be tested independently, and we can't rely on  Facebook's representations about whether they're doing a good enough job.</p><p>BURKE: Facebook says their business depends on keeping users' data secure,  and they believe they'll prefer seeing ads and coupons customized to their  tastes and habits.</p><p>EVERSON: We firmly believe that the more relevant and useful the  advertising can be, that it's in service of the consumer.</p><p>BURKE: Maybe more importantly for Facebook, the people paying their bills,  the advertisers, see this customization as the Holy Grail.</p><p>EVERSON: We want to be able to offer a marketer the opportunity to know  precisely who they want to target to drive very specific business results,  and that's incredibly valuable for them.</p><p>BURKE: Now, Facebook's users will have to decide whether this type of data  sharing is naughty or nice.</p><p>ASTAIRE (singing): He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice --</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Samuel, I have only one sentence: how dare they? </p><p>BURKE: Well, you may not like this, Richard, but the fact of the matter is,  this data was already being collected about you before. Anytime you go into  a grocery store and use your loyalty --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: Yes! Who gives the -- hang on, hang on. Who gives the grocery store  permission to give the information to Facebook, whether hash tags or hashed  or whatever?</p><p>BURKE: Well, inadvertently, I suppose it's you, because you're using those  credit and loyalty cards, but it's the information -- the data companies  that have collected that information, that own that information about you  and me who are now sharing it with Facebook.</p><p>QUEST: And I'm guessing -- I've been told it's the last question, so you're  going to have to answer this very briefly -- I'm guessing that there is a  way to get out of this, but by jingo, you'd need a degree in computer  science to get through the privacy rules to opt out.</p><p>BURKE: Or only use cash, Richard. Don't use a loyalty card, and don't use a  credit card, then you might be able to --</p><p>(CROSSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: Oh, please, Samuel! </p><p>BURKE: -- get around it.</p><p>QUEST: Oh, please, Samuel! Oh, please, Samuel! Thank you. Excellent  reporting. Samuel -- Samuel Burke, who's never knowingly put his hand in  his pocket. Many thanks, indeed, Samuel, for joining us there. We'll have  more on the Fed tapering in just a moment. I'm really annoyed about that,  my data being just willy-nilly handed about. After the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest. There's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just  a moment. This is CNN, and on this network, the news always comes first.</p><p>Around 500 people have been killed and hundreds more people have been  wounded in violence in South Sudan. The UN fears the fighting is being  fueled by ethnic tensions. The government says it's politically motivated.  So far, between 15,000 and 20,000 people have fled the fighting, taking  refuge at the Untied Nations bases.</p><p>The US Federal Reserve is to begin easing the stimulus measures next month.  Tapering is to start. Reducing its monthly bond purchases by $10 billion to  $75 billion a month. The Fed says the economy is growing at a moderate pace  and stocks on Wall Street surged to new records after the announcement.</p><p>Security experts say the NSA should end the systematic collection of phone  records. The panel recommended reforming surveillance activities at the spy  agency. The suggestions include greater transparency, more oversight, and  greater self-restraint.</p><p>Police in New York say they were following standard procedures when they  strip-searched an Indian diplomat after her arrest on visa fraud charges.  India has taken steps in retaliation, which includes removing the concrete  security barriers outside the US embassy in New Delhi. US Secretary of  State John Kerry has expressed his regret over the situation.</p><p>The Turkish prime minister has denounced a corruption crackdown on his  allies as a dirty operation. Tayyip Erdogan says enemies are trying to  smear his administration as the country heads towards elections. Fifty-two  people, including three ministers' sons and businessmen close to the prime  minister, were detained on Tuesday.</p><p>So, tapering is to begin in January as Ben Bernanke prepares to leave his  post as the Fed chairman at the end of next month.  He already admits he  does not fully understand why the U.S. recovery has been so sluggish.  In  his press conference a few hours ago, he defended the handling of U.S.  monetary policy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BEN BERNANKE, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE:  We had been disappointed in the  pace of growth, and we don't fully understand why.  Some of it may just be  a slower pace of underlying potential, at least temporarily.  Productivity  has been disappointing.  It may be there's been some bad luck - for  example, the effects of the European crisis and the like.  But compared to  other advanced industrial countries - Europe, U.K., Japan - compared to  other countries, advanced industrial countries recovering from financial  crises, the U.S. recovery has actually been better than most.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Ben Bernanke.  Now, Bob Parker is the senior advisor at Credit  Suisse.  When I joined - when he joined me earlier in London, I asked him  what he made of the Fed's decision.  The tapering starts in January.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BOB PARKER, SENIOR ADVISOR, CREDIT SUISSE:  Two important points.  The  first point is that you know the risk of them announcing tapering in  December - that risk had certainly increased in recent weeks and it  increased first of all because in contrast to September and October we had  the agreement, albeit it a small agreement, between the Democrats and the  Republicans on a fiscal policy.  So, you know, that threat to the economy -  that threat of sequestration - has been removed.  And that was a concern  for the Federal Reserve earlier in the year.</p><p>And I think the second consideration, and probably the more important one,  is that recent data - whether you look at industrial production, whether  you look at today's housing figures, whether you look at recent data on  consumption -- everything shows that in the last month the U.S. economy,  after a temporary weak period in September -</p><p>QUEST:  Right.</p><p>PARKER:  -- and early October, is now accelerating.  And it's - you know -  it's I think intelligent to forecast U.S. growth next year at close to 3  percent.  And, you know, that growth upgrade takes away the case for  quantitative easing.</p><p>QUEST:  Looking now at the statement and reading what they say, it's almost  as if this was a trigger they have been waiting and wanting to pull, and  this gave them the reason to do it today.</p><p>PARKER:  That is certainly true, but I think one part to emphasize,  Richard, is that they are moving very slowly, and you know let's be very  clear.  If monetary policy in the United States was exceptionally easy with  $85 billion of quantitative easing per month, by moving to $75 billion --  and my forecast is the average for quantitative easing will be $70 billion  per month for the first quarter -- they've gone from being exceptionally  easy to slightly less easy.  But you can't describe this as a monetary  tightening.  We've still got with $75 billion a month a high volume of  quantitative easing.</p><p>QUEST:  But what they say is the committee will likely reduce the pace of  assets in further measured steps, and we go back to when Bernanke first  talked about this in June of this year.  Now he said - then he talked about  it all being over and done with by the end of 2014 - so I'm guessing if you  - if we extrapolate - they started later, therefore they'll finish later.   It's likely they'll still be QE into 15 probably.</p><p>PARKER:  I think that's probably right, and you know, although  circumstances may change.  My central case forecast would be QE averaging  $70 billion in the first quarter, by midyear 2014 I'm assuming that we will  be down to perhaps $40 to $50 billion per month, and that by the end of  2014 we'll still have QE, but obviously it's going to be much smaller -- it  may only be $10 to $20 billion a month.  And the whole program will  probably end in the first quarter of 2015.  It's going to be a very slow,  unwinding process, underpinning this good growth outlet for the U.S.  economy.  </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Bob Parker of Credit Suisse talking to me earlier about the Fed and  many of the other central banks have all pinned their forward guidance on  unemployment.  And the Bank of England will probably raise interest rates  sooner rather than later, and that reason is because unemployment in the  U.K. is falling faster than expected.  The jobless rate declines at 7.4  percent in the third quarter - the lowest since April 2009 - and it  approaches the 7 percent level which Mark Carney, the governor, has said  could trigger - could, not would, could - trigger a rise in rates.</p><p>The pound sterling - that, well it jumped on the jobless numbers.  I want  you to look and see how the pound has performed.  This chart shows its  performance in recent - in recent months.  We get to a low down here of  just under 147 or so, but then you come to a very sharp rise to where we  are now - just shy of 163 on stable -- on the cable rate.  And as you see  this gain here - no wonder the Bank of England is already now warning that  this sort of appreciation - bearing in mind an economy like the U.K.'s  which is so export-led, even though leading export partners like the E.U.  are in some economic troubles -- that could have a bad effect on the  strength of the U.K.'s recovery.  Or at least it's one of the factors that  we're (aware/wary).  But as you know, there's not a lot you can do about  currencies if that's the trend that the market wants to move in.  </p><p>The pound itself, however, the actual physical pound - well that is getting  much more robust.  No more in - from 2016 will there be old notes, instead,  polymer is going to be the substance by which they make the bank notes from  Threadneedlestreet.  Jim Boulden reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>JIM BOULDEN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Paying with plastic used to  mean using a credit card.  In a handful of countries like Australia, New  Zealand, Canada and Vietnam, it also means using a bank note made of  polymer instead of cotton paper.  Now the Bank of England will start to  switch to polymer notes as well after consulting the public.  The bank says  87 percent approved the plastic money over cotton paper.</p><p>MIKE CARNEY, GOVERNOR, BANK OF ENGLAND:  We think it is significant.  They  bring a lot of benefits.  They're more secure so they protect us against  counterfeiting much better than the existing notes, better technologies.</p><p>BOULDEN:  From 2016 five-pound notes will be printed on polymer, ten-pound  notes will follow, making Britain the largest economy with plastic notes.   But it's assuring all the queen will remain on the front of all notes.  So,  what are the reasons for the switch?  Well, polymer notes can last a lot  longer in circulation, and bank notes are getting evermore safety features  to try to thwart counterfeiting, including these windows in the polymer.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hard to get into.</p><p>BOULDEN:  As the CEO of the bank note printing company De La Rue told me  recently during an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the company's design  studios, a crucial part of the switchover is getting the public behind it.  </p><p>TIM COBBOLD, CEO, DE LA RUE:  I think you should expect many central banks  to look at all the available technologies, both from a durability and a  security point of view.  And as polymer becomes more common and more  accepted within the industry, I think you can expect all central banks to  at least be considering it.</p><p>BOULDEN:  The Bank of England says polymer notes will last more than twice  as long in circulation which would cut costs and promises the new notes  will stay cleaner.  They can even survive a washing machine, and  importantly, still fold nicely into any wallet.  Jim Boulden, CNN London.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Ah, but as I discovered once on a trip to Australia, yes, they can  withstand the washing machine, they can stand - withstand - a trip into the  ocean, but they can be ripped if you bite them.  If you just try and tear  them it won't work, but if you bite them - don't ask me why we decided to  do an experiment biting Austrian dollar bills, but anyway, that's a story  for another day. </p><p>European markets advanced on Wednesday.  Investors were awaiting the  outcome of the Fed's meeting.  Look at the numbers and make your own  judgment.  The best of the day is Xetra DAX which gained 1 percent.  The  Paris CAC (Inaudible) was also up.  The goal, for bank lenders - leaders -  agreeing to landmark banking union in Brussels tomorrow.  They goal is to  prevent banks from crippling national economies.  We've had the single  supervisory mechanism, now we need the single resolution mechanism, and  that's got to be agreed and signed off on.  </p><p>It's not just about the banks - European officials are also going after  some of Spain's top football clubs.  The Commission's investigating if  local governments in Spain have given unfair advantage to some football  clubs through tax breaks.  Our correspondent in Madrid is Al Goodman.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AL GOODMAN, CNN'S MADRID BUREAU CHIEF:  It's a three-part investigation by  the European Commission into some of Spain's and the world's best-known  football clubs like Real Madrid and FC Barcelona.  \"Professional football  clubs should finance their running costs and investments with sound  financial management rather than at the expense of the taxpayer,\" said  European Commission Vice President Joaquin Almunia.</p><p>First, Brussels will look into possible tax advantages for Real Madrid, FC  Barcelona and two clubs in Northern Spain - Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna in  Pamplona.  These four clubs are not private companies - they were given an  exemption from converting to that status.  Instead, they're run by their  season ticket holders like shareholders who elect the club's president.   Brussels says that legal status gives them a lower tax rate than other  clubs.  </p><p>Next, Brussels will look into a reported land transfer between the City of  Madrid and Real Madrid to see if there was inappropriate state aid.  The  land swap involved Real Madrid's old training grounds near its home,  Bernabeu Stadium, which became the site of four office and hotel  skyscrapers.  The new training grounds were moved out near the airport.   The Commission says the land swap was based on a piece of land being  revalued to nearly 23 million Euros, up from just 600 Euros in 1998.   Finally, Brussels will look into more than 100 million Euros in state- backed loans to three clubs in the Valencia region.  Spain's foreign  minister says all of these operations were in accord with Spanish law, and  he expects the investigation to be closed after European officials get more  information.  The clubs are either professing innocence or not commenting.  </p><p>Al Goodman, CNN Madrid.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  When we come back in just a second, greater freedom for gadgets  from takeoff to landing - it's already been in the United States, now one  of Europe's top carriers is to relax the rules for the first time.  We'll  have the story after the break. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  This week's \"Business Traveller\" update.  Delta Airlines - you  heard from the chief executive yesterday on this program - Delta has  announced today it will continue to ban voice calls onboard its flights,  regardless of what the official regulations may be.  In a statement, Delta  says on the question of flight communications, it feels passengers' voice  calls in the cabin are in their words (RING) \"disruptive.\"  It applies to  cellular calls and internet-based voice calls.  </p><p>Now, Delta says no because of course you'll remember the rules have changed  in terms of gadgets which you can use, and British Airways is to become the  first European carrier that will allow customers to use small handheld  electronic devices during taxiing, takeoff and landing - iPads, Kindles and  the like.  From tomorrow BA passengers can use their phones, tablets and e- readers in the flight-safe mode from the time they board to the time they  disembark  The European airlines are now catching up after the U.S. relaxed  the rules earlier this year.</p><p>How about this one - look at this.  Which of these two do you prefer?  Now  that of course is the old American Airlines logo.  That over there is the  new American Airlines log.  But there's been a great dispute over which is  better - the new or the old.  Now employees of the merged company are to be  allowed to vote on whether to go with the new or back to the old.  It's an  interesting question because some people hate the new and some people love  the old and vice-versa. On January the 2nd the result will be announced  as  to which the employees prefer.  It's not the first time of course this has  happened. </p><p>Margaret Thatcher famously showed her displeasure when British Airways  replaced - look at that - she took her handkerchief and - can we run that  again, please?  Because it's so good.  Bearing in mind that these were the  ethnic tailfins that British Airways had introduced.  And if we could show  that video again - I'm not sure whether we can - but if we could, you would  definitely - Margaret Thatcher, there she goes - out comes the  handkerchief.  She's shown the logo, she's shown the tailfin.  \"Dreadful\"  she said and in one fell swoop, she destroyed millions of dollars' worth of  branding. </p><p>JENNY HARRISON, CNN INTERNATIONAL METEOROLOGIST:  Wow.</p><p>QUEST:  And now American Airlines is asking their people which do they  prefer - the old or the new.</p><p>HARRISON:  I know which one I like.</p><p>QUEST:  Which one do you -- don't answer that, no.</p><p>HARRISON:  I'm not going to answer, I'm not going to answer.</p><p>QUEST:  You were going to.  </p><p>HARRISON:  I won't, I won't, I won't.  I won't.</p><p>QUEST:  You're not going to?</p><p>HARRISON:  I won't.</p><p>QUEST:  We wouldn't (inaudible).</p><p>HARRISON:  No.  I wouldn't dream of it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUEST:  Have you been at the cooking sherry before Christmas?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HARRISON:  No, you didn't bring me any over.  No, all this talk of planes -  they could be (inaudible) delays across in Europe into the U.K.  Very, very  strong winds, has been for the last couple of days.  Huge wind gusts.  I  want to show you some of the numbers.  They are shocking.  You wouldn't  want to be flying with these sort of winds, Richard.</p><p>Let me show you.  This is the satellite.  You can see all this action again  across the northwest.  Just going to zoom in and actually show you the U.K.  and Ireland in particular and also northern France.  This is where the  really high wind gusts have been reported.  Rain has been coming in as  well, very heavy amounts which is going to accumulate obviously in the next  couple of days.  But look at these wind gusts.  This what I mean.  Plymouth  in the U.K. which is (inaudible) 137 kilometers an hour, Castlederg there  in northern Ireland 120, Quessant in France, 116, Valencia as well 111  kilometers an hour.  These are some really strong winds, so over 80 miles  an hour, these winds. </p><p>These are some of the current wind gusts that have been coming down a  little bit, but once one system clears out of the way - like this one -  there is unfortunately another one literally just waiting in the wings.  I  was saying yesterday, as we continue over the next few days - the next week  actually, right up to Christmas day - it is going to be case of the same.   This is the forecast showing you the winds, and look at some of these  numbers --- in fact they seem to sit still so I think some of the data is  missing there.  But we could actually see some wind gusts again over 100  kilometers an hour.  And of course, coming in with it, very heavy amounts  of rain.  So be prepared for obviously delays at the airports, but also  very dangerous conditions on the road, particularly with winds that strong.  </p><p>And this is the rain accumulating some portions there of Wales and Ireland.   We could be seeing as much as five centimeters of rain.  This is what's  going to be happening over the next few days.  System after system coming  through bringing more of the same.  Some pretty severe thunderstorms in  there and amounts of rain.  Current temperatures on the upside are fairly  mild out in the west.  This is the rain coming in, snow to those higher  accumulations as well, and as for temperatures - well, you can see a little  bit cooler as we head into Thursday - mostly single digits of course below  freezing across central and eastern areas.  Richard.</p><p>QUEST:  You're right, I certainly would not like to be landing in that.</p><p>HARRISON:  You wouldn't.</p><p>QUEST:  Wouldn't want to be on a plane that's landing in those situations.   Jenny, thank you very much.  You can go back to the cooking show.</p><p>HARRISON:  (LAUGHTER).  I'm going to do something.  Look at those logos  again.  Look at the logos on the planes again.</p><p>QUEST:  The logos, the logos.  Well, certainly.  Right.  When we come back  after the moment, the big screen to the big board - AMC's Entertainment  went public today.  A conversation with Gerry Lopez on what it is we want  when we go to the movies beside a good movie and a good yarn.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  It's show time for AMC Entertainment, the parent company of AMC  Theatres, went public on the NYSE today on the big board.  The chief  executive Gerry Lopez rang the opening bell.  AMC shares closed today up 5  percent - that's a nice pop on an IPO at $18.90.  I asked him what AMC  gains by being on the market.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GERRY LOPEZ, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF AMC ENTERTAINMENT:  The key piece that we  gain by coming public is access to the U.S. equity capital markets.  Our  parent company Wonder -- Dalian Wanda Group out of Beijing is on a path to  globalize its businesses.  As they do so, it's a good idea to gain access  to the different capital markets across the globe.  Taking us public is one  of the many things - one of the many ideas - that they have, one of the  many initiatives that they're executing (against) as they look to continue  to grow, and grow not only in their home country but across the globe.</p><p>QUEST:  But of course once you're in the market, and the reason for my  question is, once you're in the market, you are so much more susceptible to  the whim of the market -- to the reporting of it to shareholders.  And many  CEOs do find being in the market to be much more of a strain than as a  private company where you're given much more leeway.</p><p>LOPEZ:  Well, you know everybody has a point of view on that, Richard, but  for us we were already a public filer.  We - although not trading our  equity publicly - we have had public debt throughout our entire period as a  private company.  So to us, we were already kind of public.  We had to file  every quarter, we had to deal with the debt holders, which you know, it's a  different group than the equity holders, but it's not that really  different.  The scrutiny, the compliance, the rules that you live by are  really not that dramatically different, so for us, gaining access to the  markets was really frankly more important - the flexibility that it brings  is something that we wanted.  So, sure, there's, you know, some burdens  that come with being a public company, but to us those were not a blocker,  and we are quite prepared to live within you know within those rules.   That's not a big deal for us.</p><p>QUEST:  What do you foresee as you compete against the Netflix at home and  all of the options at home and you're providing good business -  technologically, do you see anything on the horizon? </p><p>LOPEZ:  The reality, Richard, is that - is that the consumer that enjoys  Netflix and the consumer that enjoys a movie on an iPad at home on the go  is also the consumer that enjoys the movie in a theater.  People who love  movies love movies.  And they love movies at home, they love movies in our  theaters, they love movies in an airplane, they love movies everywhere they  go.  That consumer, that core customer, is the same across all of the many  different - </p><p>QUEST:  Really?</p><p>LOPEZ:  -- forms.  And you can enjoy - oh, absolutely.  The best DVD  customer at any of the retailers in the DVD world are also our best  customers in our theaters.  The truth is that as people want to have an  evening out, as young people want to date other young people, as, frankly,  some of the parents may want to get away from some of the young people on a  Saturday evening, we like our chances as to where the business is going.   If we continue to provide people with a great story and a good environment  in which to enjoy that story, I think - I think this business which many  have predicted is dead many years, you know for many times, will still be  around.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's \"Profitable Moment.\"  So, tapering will begin in January.   It's a historic day, of that that there's no doubt, but we do need to keep  it into proportion.  By no means is the Fed slowing down its purchase of  bonds.  It's just very gently, very easily easing up on the gas.  Because,  let's face it, it's still buying $75 billion a month and that's a great  deal of money.</p><p>And that's \"Quest Means Business\" for tonight.  I'm Richard Quest at the  CNN Center.  Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's  profitable.  </p><p>(BELL RINGS).  </p><p>QUEST: I'll see you back in New York tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2013 Cable News Network, Inc.

The closing bell rings, US stocks swing sharply higher, the Fed has begun tapering. What a day it has been as the gavel gets hit --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(RINGS BELL)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">QUEST: Oh! It's Wednesday, it's the 18th of December.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, we're all about tapering time. The Fed slows down the stimulus just a smidgeon.</p><p/><p>Ford falls a little bit more. It falls foul of investors and warns about profits at risk.</p><p/><p>And also tonight, taking the company by the tail. Which do you prefer for the new American Airlines? The employees get to vote, we will explain.</p><p/><p>I'm Richard Quest, live at the CNN Center, where of course I mean business.</p><p/><p>Good evening. What a day! Well, the suspense is over. The Federal Reserve is to start tapering in January. The key line in the Fed statement, it said quite clearly, \"In light of the cumulative progress towards maximum employment and the improved conditions in the labor market, conditions the committee decided to modestly reduce the pace of its asset purchases.\"</p><p/><p>So, tapering is to begin. Since September 2012, the Fed's been buying $85 billion worth of US securities and mortgage-backed securities. Now, from January, just watch the speedometer, it goes down just a smidgeon by $10 billion to $75 billion a month. It will break down in $35 billion and $40 billion of US treasuries and make $75 billion.</p><p/><p>It's symbolic but it is happening, and this is what everybody had been waiting for. We had debated whether it was going to be January or March of next year, but clearly, the Fed's announcement, followed by Chairman <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke's </nameText></person>news conference, which was his last before he steps down at the end of January. And <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>said tapering -- according to the data at least -- tapering is here to stay.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p><person><nameText>BEN BERNANKE, </nameText></person>CHAIRMAN, US FEDERAL RESERVE: If the economies slows for some reason or we are disappointed in the outcomes, we could skip a meeting or two. On the other side, if things really pick up, then of course we could go a bit faster. But my expectation is for similar moderate steps going forward throughout most of 2014.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>QUEST: Now, the Fed has invigorated the markets. Come over to me over at the board and you'll see just what these numbers look like. This is a record. The Dow surged up 293 points. That's a gain of nearly more than 1.75 percent.</p><p/><p>But it's the way the day had progressed. For most of the session, we really were just bobbing up and down about, 30, 40 points. Then as we get to this period here, just before the announcement, it goes down.</p><p/><p>It comes back up again -- and you can't see it on this graph, but take my word for it. I'm going to right in here. Just there, after we get the announcement, the market goes down, and I suspect that's because nobody really was able to work out just how much, what had -- it was literally just a minute or two at exactly 2:00.</p><p/><p>And then the rally began and it was slow to begin and then broad-based, and it continued right up to a record, the Dow standing at 16,168. The S&amp;P 500, the broader market, also closing at all-time high.</p><p/><p>And this is about much more than just the Fed taking the foot off the gas. This statement contains several other crucial parts of information. For instance, the Fed adjusted its forward guidance. Rates are to stay low well past the time when unemployment goes below 6.5 percent. Now, that's interest rates. That's, of course, the Fed funds rate.</p><p/><p>Inflation still well below the 2 percent target. We had economic projections that were released. Unemployment is expected to fall faster next year. Fewer board members now expect tightening on rates that will take place next year.</p><p/><p>Joining us now from Washington is Joseph Gagnon. He's the senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and has worked at the Federal Reserve Board and at the US Treasury.</p><p/><p>Sir, thank you for joining us. We knew it was coming. It's happened now, and it's still -- even though we knew it was on its way, it's still significant.</p><p/><p>JOSEPH GAGNON, SENIOR FELLOW, PETERSON INSTITUTE FOR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS: Yes, absolutely. It seems like a case of sell on the room rather than buy on the news, in this case. But I wonder if the language about keeping the rates lower long after the unemployment rate goes below 6.5 might actually have been the more important piece of news today that might have encouraged markets to be so positive.</p><p/><p>QUEST: This idea that even though stimulus may go next year, what really matters is when interest rates go up, because that -- the tightening part of the policy, isn't it?</p><p/><p>GAGNON: Yes, I think so, I think so. Because the taper, although it's a bit earlier than expected, it looks like it will be going slower than expected. And so it probably doesn't have much news for the market, because we'll still be having QE through the end of the year next year just about.</p><p/><p>But the fact that they were willing to say that they would hold short-term rates at zero well beyond unemployment reaching 6.5 percent to me was the real news.</p><p/><p>QUEST: And yet, at the same time, there is this inflation question -- I mean issue. I'm looking at the projections. Now, they all believe that inflation will remain low for the foreseeable future, in the 1 to 2 percent range.</p><p/><p>And everything the Fed basically says today about that unemployment well past the time that the unemployment rate declines, is very much contingent on them being right on the inflation question.</p><p/><p>GAGNON: Yes, it is. And I think there's a huge uncertainty in both directions because inflation's been lower than they had expected, but there is a lot of concern that it could go up higher in the future, and they have to be on guard against both possibilities.</p><p/><p>QUEST: Looking at the GDP forecast that we got from the FOMC members, very slightly down, it's almost unalterable, it's almost unaltered. But the unemployment number, again, that did fall.</p><p/><p>There you've got the GDP number slightly lower, but you've also got the unemployment number. Which of all the data that you heard and the forecast that we've seen and the projections that we've been given do you find the most interesting?</p><p/><p>GAGNON: Well, I would say it's the data that's come out recently that they didn't talk about today, but spending data in the US economy and employment data, monthly employment reports and stuff, have been stronger lately, and in particular, showing the strength through the government shutdown and despite the big sequester cuts is what I think has got people feeling rather bullish.</p><p/><p>QUEST: Good to talk to you, sir. Thank you for joining us and putting this into perspective. Now, as we've talked about the taper rally, well, the stock surge was quite impressive. Maribel Aber is at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p/><p>We've just been talking there, not only do we have this taper, we do have that wording in the last paragraph of the statement, which does say \"the committee anticipate the funds will last well past the time of 6.5 percent.\" What was the market focusing on?</p><p/><p>MARIBEL ABER, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Richard. It was focusing on all of that, and as you said a little bit earlier there, we saw that tick down a little bit right at 2:00. Took some time to vet that through. And then all the sudden, you saw this gradual rise.</p><p/><p>I think the markets in general were really happy to have the decision finally behind us. And as you said, not putting on the brakes, per se, just easing the foot off the gas, right? The markets seemed to like this gentle ease if you will. The Dow was surging shortly after the taper announcement came down.</p><p/><p>You talked earlier about these records that we set today, the Dow set a record close, the S&amp;P set a record close. That $10 billion pullback was in the range that Wall Street expected, so not so dramatic that it's spooking investors.</p><p/><p>But now, I think, they're looking past this taper headline. They're focusing on the message that this decision telegraphs about the economy. The Fed is confident --</p><p/><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p/><p>ABER: -- it can start to stand on its own. Richard?</p><p/><p>QUEST: Maribel, thank you for that. I day that will -- I think all of us who work in this business, all of us who sort of cover business news and economic news will certainly remember.</p><p/><p>It was also the day when shares in Ford -- now that has been a stellar performer, bearing in mind the US economy and its recovery and the recession -- shares in the Ford Motor Company plummeted after the company issued a profit warning. The stock fell more than 6 percent in New York.</p><p/><p>Ford now expects to earn between $7 billion and $8 billion next year, down from $8.5 billion in 2013. Bosses are blaming tough economic conditions in Europe and South America.</p><p/><p>When we need to understand these market movements, Paul La Monica's the man we turn to from CNN Money. He joins me now from New York. We've known that Ford has had some difficulties, but it has always been the darling of the motor industry because it didn't take US government cash and it did seem to be performing so well. What's gone wrong?</p><p/><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN MONEY ASSISTANT MANAGING EDITOR: Yes, exactly. As you point out, Ford did not go bankrupt. GM and Chrysler did. I think what's happening here is that GM and Chrysler are emboldened now because they've cleaned up their balance sheets, they've gotten their act together, they're making cars that people like to drive.</p><p/><p>And Ford specifically said that tough competition in North America, the US specifically, is a problem. I'm not so sure it's that the economy is weak in the US as much as it is just that the Big Three is -- they're all back.</p><p/><p>QUEST: In this environment, then, do we just take today's warning as a hiccup? Or we've known Ford -- Ford of all of the companies has really been very aggressive in restructuring its European assets. It's always had the idea of a third, a third, a third. A third US, a third Europe, a third Asia. Do see anything in this that changes that strategy?</p><p/><p>LA MONICA: I doubt it. The only thing that could potentially change that strategy is the eventual changing of the guard at Ford, and in some respects, that's the bigger story, the Alan Mulally, will he stay, will he not rumor hasn't died down, even though many people within the Ford organization have been adamant to say that he's going to be there through the end of 2014.</p><p/><p>But you still hear all the chatter. Maybe he's the top candidate to replace Steve Ballmer at Microsoft. So if Mulally's gone, I think anything's up for -- up in the air in terms of new strategy.</p><p/><p>QUEST: Yes. Now, that's the big one, isn't it? They say he will be CEO right the way through 2014, or he'll stay to the end of his contract, I forget the exact -- you could probably remind me the exact phraseology. It's clever wording, isn't it, that leaves a little bit of a window of interpretation --</p><p/><p>LA MONICA: Yes, it definitely seems that way.</p><p/><p>QUEST: -- of when he might go?</p><p/><p>LA MONICA: I really doubt that -- the only thing that's going to stop the chatter about Mulally going to Microsoft is Microsoft announcing a new CEO whose name is not Alan Mulally.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>QUEST: Good point. A busy day. You've got to admit, you don't see Ford down 6 percent ever day. You don't see tapering every day. Good to see you, Paul --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>LA MONICA: Yes, no tapering love for the Big Three, unfortunately. Tessla down, too.</p><p/><p>QUEST: No, I -- well, yes, but -- and also, and yet at the same time, the US government selling -- managing to get rid of its GM stock. So all three are, as you rightly point out, now fit for purpose and fit to fight. That's basically it, isn't it?</p><p/><p>LA MONICA: Definitely. And keep in mind, too, that even with the Ford sell- off today, the stock is up about 20 percent year-to-date. That has lagged GM.</p><p/><p>GM's had an amazing year, and a lot of people feel that they're on the right track with a new CEO, Mary Barra coming in, and she's a product person, so I think a lot of people are excited about GM in a way that they hadn't been in a long time.</p><p/><p>QUEST: Paul La Monica, thank you for joining us.</p><p/><p>LA MONICA: Thank you.</p><p/><p>QUEST: What -- no wonder we enjoy this business so much when you've got so many great stories all happening at once, a firmament in our very midst.</p><p/><p>The arrest of an Indian diplomat in New York has sparked an international row. US Secretary of State John Kerry says he empathizes with India. Did he actually apologize, and if he -- whatever he said, why did he say it? We'll talk about it after the break. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p/><p>(RINGS BELL)</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>QUEST: The US secretary of state, John Kerry, has been drawn into the diplomatic row, not surprisingly, between India and the United States. Secretary Kerry expressed regret over the arrest of India's deputy consul, who's been held on suspicion of visa fraud last week.</p><p/><p>Devyani Khobragade was strip-searched after being accused of underpaying her New York maid. Before we talk more about this, let's get the background from Pamela Brown.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>PAMELA BROWN, CNNUS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Watch as police remove the concrete security barriers in front of the US embassy in New Delhi. Newspapers in India reporting the government is behind the anti-US protest. Why? Retaliation sparked by an arrest of this Indian diplomat in New York City, Devyani Khobragade.</p><p/><p>According to this criminal complaint, Khobragade, a deputy consul general, severely underpaid her babysitter, only paying her $3.31 an hour, far less than minimum wage. The complaint also alleges the diplomat worked her babysitter far more than the 40 hours per week, allegedly without overtime pay, and then lied about all of this on visa documents, a violation of US law.</p><p/><p>UTTAM KHOBRAGADE, DEVIYANI KHOBRAGADE'S FATHER: My daughter has not done anything wrong. She had nothing to do with this visa process.</p><p/><p>BROWN: State Department diplomatic security arrested Khobragade last Thursday after she dropped her daughter off at school. She was later strip- searched and put in a holding cell with other defendants. Her lawyer says she pleaded not guilty.</p><p/><p>DANIEL ARSHACK, DEVIYNAI KHOBRAGADE'S ATTORNEY: I have every expectation that she will be completely vindicated.</p><p/><p>BROWN: Her arrest sparked outrage among Indian officials, some calling her treatment barbaric, one even calling for the partners of gay US diplomats in India to be arrested. The country recently banned gay sex.</p><p/><p>YASHWANT SINHA, FORMER INDIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: What the government of India can do immediately is to cancel those visas, arrest all these companions, put them behind bars.</p><p/><p>BROWN: Indian officials also snubbed US delegates visiting India, one tweeting, \"Refused to meet the visiting USA delegation in solidarity with our nation.\"</p><p/><p>KAMAL NATH, INDIAN ARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS MINISTER: More steps should be taken against the United States until they give an unconditional apology.</p><p/><p>BROWN: US Marshal Service officials stand by their strip-search procedures, saying they treated the diplomat the same way they treat everyone else.</p><p/><p>MARIE HARF, DEPUTY SPOKESPERSON, US STATE DEPARTMENT: Thus far, all indications are that appropriate procedures were followed. But nonetheless, we understand this is a very sensitive issue, and we're continuing to review exactly what transpired.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>QUEST: All right, let's talk about this with our World Affairs Reporter, Elise Labott, who's in Washington. We need to get to the bottom of this. I've -- I don't know why, but one day I did sit down and read the US State Department's handbook on diplomatic immunity and how they're supposed to treat people.</p><p/><p>Now, if she'd been a full diplomatic agent, there was no question of handcuffing her or anything like that, whatever she'd have done. But she's not a diplomatic agent, is she? She has consular immunity. And now the issue is, did Kerry apologize or not?</p><p/><p>ELISE LABOTT, CNN WORLD AFFAIRS REPORTER: OK. Well, she has this consular immunity, Richard, and that means that she can't be arrested for anything that she's doing as part of her official duties. So, these crimes that she's been accused of and actually pled guilty to in a Manhattan federal court, by the way, are outside the scope of her duties.</p><p/><p>I think what -- Secretary Kerry was apologizing for a few things. He was apologizing for the treatment that she received. I think even though proper procedures were followed, I think that there's an understanding that A, she could have been afforded a little bit more courtesy and respect given her status in New York as an Indian diplomat.</p><p/><p>And B, this cultural sensitivity in India, where woman who are screened or patted down or anything like that are kind of brought to a private room. It's very -- the cultural sensitivity is very high there.</p><p/><p>And I think he's also apologizing for the fact that this is getting out of hand, that now India is taking all these actions against the United States, and that this is really affecting relations, because --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>QUEST: But there's a very -- all right. But -- I'm going to jump in here because --</p><p/><p>LABOTT: Yes.</p><p/><p>QUEST: -- this is the difficulty, though.</p><p/><p>LABOTT: Yes.</p><p/><p>QUEST: You've got New York authorities saying we did nothing wrong. You've got Kerry basically saying, well, they may not have done anything wrong, but I'm still very sorry that they did nothing wrong. And you -- at what point does India decide to bury the hatchet in this, or does it decide to keep throttling forward?</p><p/><p>LABOTT: OK. Well, technically, the marshals didn't do anything wrong, but diplomatic security guards made the arrest. And then they handed her over to the marshals. And the diplomatic security services could have said, listen, treat her with kid gloves. Give her a little bit of respect and leeway. They didn't do that, and I think that's one thing that there's an understand of that.</p><p/><p>And I think that -- the Indians here, it's kind of unclear. On one hand, they're protesting the treatment of the diplomat and the manner in which this was carried out, but the whole idea that she doesn't have immunity from this crime in the first place. And that's one of the little dirty little secrets here in Washington is about how diplomats treat their domestic help. There have been a lot of cases, even particularly in India this year of diplomats that are treating --</p><p/><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p/><p>LABOTT: -- their servants poorly. And so I think that both sides need to take it down a notch, and I think that's what Secretary Kerry is trying to do.</p><p/><p>QUEST: In a word, in a sentence, you've studied diplomacy and diplomatic relations for years. Does this story go away fast?</p><p/><p>LABOTT: No. I think it -- I think that the moves that the Indians have taken have been a bit excessive, and you saw in Deb Feyerick's (sic) piece that they're calling for more action. And so, I think that that call might have helped, but I think that the tensions are going to remain, especially if this diplomat is prosecuted in US courts.</p><p/><p>QUEST: Elise Labott in Washington putting it into perspective for us. Thank you, Elise.</p><p/><p>Now, Facebook knows what its users do on its site, and now they know what they do when it's off it. An executive speaks exclusively to CNN on the Facebook data dilemma and -- it's straight after in a moment.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>QUEST: For the first time, a Facebook executive has spoken on camera about how Facebook is using your offline data to market ads to you online. Samuel Burke sat down with Facebook's vice president of global marketing for an exclusive interview. Samuel joins me now live from New York.</p><p/><p>Now, let's be clear about this. We know that they rampantly manage to take our online searches and when you're on Facebook, but this is when you're offline. This is when you're not on the Facebook site, is that right?</p><p/><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: That's correct. I think, Richard, we've all had that \"oh wow\" moment when we realize they really are tracking us. When you search for something on website and then you go to another website and see an ad there for what you were searching for.</p><p/><p>This is -- that's really nothing compared to what they're able to find out about you offline, and then give ads to you online.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>FRED ASTAIRE AS SD KLUGER, NARRATOR, \"SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN\": Santa can still look into his magic snowball and see just what you're up to.</p><p/><p>BURKE (voice-over): Just like Santa Claus in the classic cartoon --</p><p/><p>ASTAIR (singing): He sees you when you're sleeping, he knows when you're awake --</p><p/><p>BURKE: Big tech companies not only know what their users are up to online, increasingly they know what they're doing offline. Facebook is partnering with data collection firms that gather information from those customer loyalty cards used in many brick and mortar stores.</p><p/><p>Facebook's vice president of global marketing says the data is then used to create customized ads and deals to its more than 1 billion customers.</p><p/><p>CAROLYN EVERSON, VICE PRESIDENT OF GLOBAL MARKETING, FACEBOOK: I'll give you a very real example. Let's say that I am a heavy snack user and I buy snacks. And we now have the ability through about 50 percent of purchase card data in the United States to tell a snack manufacturer that here are the consumers that have purchased snacks and allow that marketer to target them with a very specific ad.</p><p/><p>BURKE (on camera): How can Facebook guarantee that all this data is anonymous?</p><p/><p>EVERSON: We have the data from, let's say, the grocery store, which is really purchase card data. We have that bucket of data. We have the Facebook data. Those two never shall meet in terms of us sharing specific Facebook information or them sharing very specific purchase information.</p><p/><p>So they would turn Samuel into a code that would never be identifiable as Samuel, you would be a set of characters.</p><p/><p>BURKE (voice-over): That procedure is called hashing, and despite this advance in securing information, privacy advocates are worried about tech companies collecting so much information.</p><p/><p>MARC ROTENBERG, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, PRIVACY INFORMATION CENTER: We do believe that hashing and more generally de-identification, which is a technique for anonymizing, that is to remove the actual information of the user, is a good privacy too, and we favor it.</p><p/><p>But we think it also has to be tested independently, and we can't rely on Facebook's representations about whether they're doing a good enough job.</p><p/><p>BURKE: Facebook says their business depends on keeping users' data secure, and they believe they'll prefer seeing ads and coupons customized to their tastes and habits.</p><p/><p>EVERSON: We firmly believe that the more relevant and useful the advertising can be, that it's in service of the consumer.</p><p/><p>BURKE: Maybe more importantly for Facebook, the people paying their bills, the advertisers, see this customization as the Holy Grail.</p><p/><p>EVERSON: We want to be able to offer a marketer the opportunity to know precisely who they want to target to drive very specific business results, and that's incredibly valuable for them.</p><p/><p>BURKE: Now, Facebook's users will have to decide whether this type of data sharing is naughty or nice.</p><p/><p>ASTAIRE (singing): He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice --</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>QUEST: Samuel, I have only one sentence: how dare they?</p><p/><p>BURKE: Well, you may not like this, Richard, but the fact of the matter is, this data was already being collected about you before. Anytime you go into a grocery store and use your loyalty --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>QUEST: Yes! Who gives the -- hang on, hang on. Who gives the grocery store permission to give the information to Facebook, whether hash tags or hashed or whatever?</p><p/><p>BURKE: Well, inadvertently, I suppose it's you, because you're using those credit and loyalty cards, but it's the information -- the data companies that have collected that information, that own that information about you and me who are now sharing it with Facebook.</p><p/><p>QUEST: And I'm guessing -- I've been told it's the last question, so you're going to have to answer this very briefly -- I'm guessing that there is a way to get out of this, but by jingo, you'd need a degree in computer science to get through the privacy rules to opt out.</p><p/><p>BURKE: Or only use cash, Richard. Don't use a loyalty card, and don't use a credit card, then you might be able to --</p><p/><p>(CROSSSTALK)</p><p/><p>QUEST: Oh, please, Samuel!</p><p/><p>BURKE: -- get around it.</p><p/><p>QUEST: Oh, please, Samuel! Oh, please, Samuel! Thank you. Excellent reporting. Samuel -- Samuel Burke, who's never knowingly put his hand in his pocket. Many thanks, indeed, Samuel, for joining us there. We'll have more on the Fed tapering in just a moment. I'm really annoyed about that, my data being just willy-nilly handed about. After the break.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest. There's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment. This is CNN, and on this network, the news always comes first.</p><p/><p>Around 500 people have been killed and hundreds more people have been wounded in violence in South Sudan. The UN fears the fighting is being fueled by ethnic tensions. The government says it's politically motivated. So far, between 15,000 and 20,000 people have fled the fighting, taking refuge at the Untied Nations bases.</p><p/><p>The US Federal Reserve is to begin easing the stimulus measures next month. Tapering is to start. Reducing its monthly bond purchases by $10 billion to $75 billion a month. The Fed says the economy is growing at a moderate pace and stocks on Wall Street surged to new records after the announcement.</p><p/><p>Security experts say the NSA should end the systematic collection of phone records. The panel recommended reforming surveillance activities at the spy agency. The suggestions include greater transparency, more oversight, and greater self-restraint.</p><p/><p>Police in New York say they were following standard procedures when they strip-searched an Indian diplomat after her arrest on visa fraud charges. India has taken steps in retaliation, which includes removing the concrete security barriers outside the US embassy in New Delhi. US Secretary of State John Kerry has expressed his regret over the situation.</p><p/><p>The Turkish prime minister has denounced a corruption crackdown on his allies as a dirty operation. Tayyip Erdogan says enemies are trying to smear his administration as the country heads towards elections. Fifty-two people, including three ministers' sons and businessmen close to the prime minister, were detained on Tuesday.</p><p/><p>So, tapering is to begin in January as <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>prepares to leave his post as the Fed chairman at the end of next month. He already admits he does not fully understand why the U.S. recovery has been so sluggish. In his press conference a few hours ago, he defended the handling of U.S. monetary policy.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p><person><nameText>BEN BERNANKE, </nameText></person>CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE: We had been disappointed in the pace of growth, and we don't fully understand why. Some of it may just be a slower pace of underlying potential, at least temporarily. Productivity has been disappointing. It may be there's been some bad luck - for example, the effects of the European crisis and the like. But compared to other advanced industrial countries - Europe, U.K., Japan - compared to other countries, advanced industrial countries recovering from financial crises, the U.S. recovery has actually been better than most.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>QUEST: <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke. </nameText></person>Now, Bob Parker is the senior advisor at Credit Suisse. When I joined - when he joined me earlier in London, I asked him what he made of the Fed's decision. The tapering starts in January.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>BOB PARKER, SENIOR ADVISOR, CREDIT SUISSE: Two important points. The first point is that you know the risk of them announcing tapering in December - that risk had certainly increased in recent weeks and it increased first of all because in contrast to September and October we had the agreement, albeit it a small agreement, between the Democrats and the Republicans on a fiscal policy. So, you know, that threat to the economy - that threat of sequestration - has been removed. And that was a concern for the Federal Reserve earlier in the year.</p><p/><p>And I think the second consideration, and probably the more important one, is that recent data - whether you look at industrial production, whether you look at today's housing figures, whether you look at recent data on consumption -- everything shows that in the last month the U.S. economy, after a temporary weak period in September -</p><p/><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p/><p>PARKER: -- and early October, is now accelerating. And it's - you know - it's I think intelligent to forecast U.S. growth next year at close to 3 percent. And, you know, that growth upgrade takes away the case for quantitative easing.</p><p/><p>QUEST: Looking now at the statement and reading what they say, it's almost as if this was a trigger they have been waiting and wanting to pull, and this gave them the reason to do it today.</p><p/><p>PARKER: That is certainly true, but I think one part to emphasize, Richard, is that they are moving very slowly, and you know let's be very clear. If monetary policy in the United States was exceptionally easy with $85 billion of quantitative easing per month, by moving to $75 billion -- and my forecast is the average for quantitative easing will be $70 billion per month for the first quarter -- they've gone from being exceptionally easy to slightly less easy. But you can't describe this as a monetary tightening. We've still got with $75 billion a month a high volume of quantitative easing.</p><p/><p>QUEST: But what they say is the committee will likely reduce the pace of assets in further measured steps, and we go back to when <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>first talked about this in June of this year. Now he said - then he talked about it all being over and done with by the end of 2014 - so I'm guessing if you - if we extrapolate - they started later, therefore they'll finish later. It's likely they'll still be QE into 15 probably.</p><p/><p>PARKER: I think that's probably right, and you know, although circumstances may change. My central case forecast would be QE averaging $70 billion in the first quarter, by midyear 2014 I'm assuming that we will be down to perhaps $40 to $50 billion per month, and that by the end of 2014 we'll still have QE, but obviously it's going to be much smaller -- it may only be $10 to $20 billion a month. And the whole program will probably end in the first quarter of 2015. It's going to be a very slow, unwinding process, underpinning this good growth outlet for the U.S. economy.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>QUEST: Bob Parker of Credit Suisse talking to me earlier about the Fed and many of the other central banks have all pinned their forward guidance on unemployment. And the Bank of England will probably raise interest rates sooner rather than later, and that reason is because unemployment in the U.K. is falling faster than expected. The jobless rate declines at 7.4 percent in the third quarter - the lowest since April 2009 - and it approaches the 7 percent level which Mark Carney, the governor, has said could trigger - could, not would, could - trigger a rise in rates.</p><p/><p>The pound sterling - that, well it jumped on the jobless numbers. I want you to look and see how the pound has performed. This chart shows its performance in recent - in recent months. We get to a low down here of just under 147 or so, but then you come to a very sharp rise to where we are now - just shy of 163 on stable -- on the cable rate. And as you see this gain here - no wonder the Bank of England is already now warning that this sort of appreciation - bearing in mind an economy like the U.K.'s which is so export-led, even though leading export partners like the E.U. are in some economic troubles -- that could have a bad effect on the strength of the U.K.'s recovery. Or at least it's one of the factors that we're (aware/wary). But as you know, there's not a lot you can do about currencies if that's the trend that the market wants to move in.</p><p/><p>The pound itself, however, the actual physical pound - well that is getting much more robust. No more in - from 2016 will there be old notes, instead, polymer is going to be the substance by which they make the bank notes from Threadneedlestreet. Jim Boulden reports.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>JIM BOULDEN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Paying with plastic used to mean using a credit card. In a handful of countries like Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Vietnam, it also means using a bank note made of polymer instead of cotton paper. Now the Bank of England will start to switch to polymer notes as well after consulting the public. The bank says 87 percent approved the plastic money over cotton paper.</p><p/><p>MIKE CARNEY, GOVERNOR, BANK OF ENGLAND: We think it is significant. They bring a lot of benefits. They're more secure so they protect us against counterfeiting much better than the existing notes, better technologies.</p><p/><p>BOULDEN: From 2016 five-pound notes will be printed on polymer, ten-pound notes will follow, making Britain the largest economy with plastic notes. But it's assuring all the queen will remain on the front of all notes. So, what are the reasons for the switch? Well, polymer notes can last a lot longer in circulation, and bank notes are getting evermore safety features to try to thwart counterfeiting, including these windows in the polymer.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hard to get into.</p><p/><p>BOULDEN: As the CEO of the bank note printing company De La Rue told me recently during an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the company's design studios, a crucial part of the switchover is getting the public behind it.</p><p/><p>TIM COBBOLD, CEO, DE LA RUE: I think you should expect many central banks to look at all the available technologies, both from a durability and a security point of view. And as polymer becomes more common and more accepted within the industry, I think you can expect all central banks to at least be considering it.</p><p/><p>BOULDEN: The Bank of England says polymer notes will last more than twice as long in circulation which would cut costs and promises the new notes will stay cleaner. They can even survive a washing machine, and importantly, still fold nicely into any wallet. Jim Boulden, CNN London.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p/><p>QUEST: Ah, but as I discovered once on a trip to Australia, yes, they can withstand the washing machine, they can stand - withstand - a trip into the ocean, but they can be ripped if you bite them. If you just try and tear them it won't work, but if you bite them - don't ask me why we decided to do an experiment biting Austrian dollar bills, but anyway, that's a story for another day.</p><p/><p>European markets advanced on Wednesday. Investors were awaiting the outcome of the Fed's meeting. Look at the numbers and make your own judgment. The best of the day is Xetra DAX which gained 1 percent. The Paris CAC (Inaudible) was also up. The goal, for bank lenders - leaders - agreeing to landmark banking union in Brussels tomorrow. They goal is to prevent banks from crippling national economies. We've had the single supervisory mechanism, now we need the single resolution mechanism, and that's got to be agreed and signed off on.</p><p/><p>It's not just about the banks - European officials are also going after some of Spain's top football clubs. The Commission's investigating if local governments in Spain have given unfair advantage to some football clubs through tax breaks. Our correspondent in Madrid is Al Goodman.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>AL GOODMAN, CNN'S MADRID BUREAU CHIEF: It's a three-part investigation by the European Commission into some of Spain's and the world's best-known football clubs like Real Madrid and FC Barcelona. \"Professional football clubs should finance their running costs and investments with sound financial management rather than at the expense of the taxpayer,\" said European Commission Vice President Joaquin Almunia.</p><p/><p>First, Brussels will look into possible tax advantages for Real Madrid, FC Barcelona and two clubs in Northern Spain - Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna in Pamplona. These four clubs are not private companies - they were given an exemption from converting to that status. Instead, they're run by their season ticket holders like shareholders who elect the club's president. Brussels says that legal status gives them a lower tax rate than other clubs.</p><p/><p>Next, Brussels will look into a reported land transfer between the City of Madrid and Real Madrid to see if there was inappropriate state aid. The land swap involved Real Madrid's old training grounds near its home, Bernabeu Stadium, which became the site of four office and hotel skyscrapers. The new training grounds were moved out near the airport. The Commission says the land swap was based on a piece of land being revalued to nearly 23 million Euros, up from just 600 Euros in 1998. Finally, Brussels will look into more than 100 million Euros in state- backed loans to three clubs in the Valencia region. Spain's foreign minister says all of these operations were in accord with Spanish law, and he expects the investigation to be closed after European officials get more information. The clubs are either professing innocence or not commenting.</p><p/><p>Al Goodman, CNN Madrid.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>QUEST: When we come back in just a second, greater freedom for gadgets from takeoff to landing - it's already been in the United States, now one of Europe's top carriers is to relax the rules for the first time. We'll have the story after the break.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>QUEST: This week's \"Business Traveller\" update. Delta Airlines - you heard from the chief executive yesterday on this program - Delta has announced today it will continue to ban voice calls onboard its flights, regardless of what the official regulations may be. In a statement, Delta says on the question of flight communications, it feels passengers' voice calls in the cabin are in their words (RING) \"disruptive.\" It applies to cellular calls and internet-based voice calls.</p><p/><p>Now, Delta says no because of course you'll remember the rules have changed in terms of gadgets which you can use, and British Airways is to become the first European carrier that will allow customers to use small handheld electronic devices during taxiing, takeoff and landing - iPads, Kindles and the like. From tomorrow BA passengers can use their phones, tablets and e- readers in the flight-safe mode from the time they board to the time they disembark The European airlines are now catching up after the U.S. relaxed the rules earlier this year.</p><p/><p>How about this one - look at this. Which of these two do you prefer? Now that of course is the old American Airlines logo. That over there is the new American Airlines log. But there's been a great dispute over which is better - the new or the old. Now employees of the merged company are to be allowed to vote on whether to go with the new or back to the old. It's an interesting question because some people hate the new and some people love the old and vice-versa. On January the 2nd the result will be announced as to which the employees prefer. It's not the first time of course this has happened.</p><p/><p>Margaret Thatcher famously showed her displeasure when British Airways replaced - look at that - she took her handkerchief and - can we run that again, please? Because it's so good. Bearing in mind that these were the ethnic tailfins that British Airways had introduced. And if we could show that video again - I'm not sure whether we can - but if we could, you would definitely - Margaret Thatcher, there she goes - out comes the handkerchief. She's shown the logo, she's shown the tailfin. \"Dreadful\" she said and in one fell swoop, she destroyed millions of dollars' worth of branding.</p><p/><p>JENNY HARRISON, CNN INTERNATIONAL METEOROLOGIST: Wow.</p><p/><p>QUEST: And now American Airlines is asking their people which do they prefer - the old or the new.</p><p/><p>HARRISON: I know which one I like.</p><p/><p>QUEST: Which one do you -- don't answer that, no.</p><p/><p>HARRISON: I'm not going to answer, I'm not going to answer.</p><p/><p>QUEST: You were going to.</p><p/><p>HARRISON: I won't, I won't, I won't. I won't.</p><p/><p>QUEST: You're not going to?</p><p/><p>HARRISON: I won't.</p><p/><p>QUEST: We wouldn't (inaudible).</p><p/><p>HARRISON: No. I wouldn't dream of it.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>QUEST: Have you been at the cooking sherry before Christmas?</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>HARRISON: No, you didn't bring me any over. No, all this talk of planes - they could be (inaudible) delays across in Europe into the U.K. Very, very strong winds, has been for the last couple of days. Huge wind gusts. I want to show you some of the numbers. They are shocking. You wouldn't want to be flying with these sort of winds, Richard.</p><p/><p>Let me show you. This is the satellite. You can see all this action again across the northwest. Just going to zoom in and actually show you the U.K. and Ireland in particular and also northern France. This is where the really high wind gusts have been reported. Rain has been coming in as well, very heavy amounts which is going to accumulate obviously in the next couple of days. But look at these wind gusts. This what I mean. Plymouth in the U.K. which is (inaudible) 137 kilometers an hour, Castlederg there in northern Ireland 120, Quessant in France, 116, Valencia as well 111 kilometers an hour. These are some really strong winds, so over 80 miles an hour, these winds.</p><p/><p>These are some of the current wind gusts that have been coming down a little bit, but once one system clears out of the way - like this one - there is unfortunately another one literally just waiting in the wings. I was saying yesterday, as we continue over the next few days - the next week actually, right up to Christmas day - it is going to be case of the same. This is the forecast showing you the winds, and look at some of these numbers --- in fact they seem to sit still so I think some of the data is missing there. But we could actually see some wind gusts again over 100 kilometers an hour. And of course, coming in with it, very heavy amounts of rain. So be prepared for obviously delays at the airports, but also very dangerous conditions on the road, particularly with winds that strong.</p><p/><p>And this is the rain accumulating some portions there of Wales and Ireland. We could be seeing as much as five centimeters of rain. This is what's going to be happening over the next few days. System after system coming through bringing more of the same. Some pretty severe thunderstorms in there and amounts of rain. Current temperatures on the upside are fairly mild out in the west. This is the rain coming in, snow to those higher accumulations as well, and as for temperatures - well, you can see a little bit cooler as we head into Thursday - mostly single digits of course below freezing across central and eastern areas. Richard.</p><p/><p>QUEST: You're right, I certainly would not like to be landing in that.</p><p/><p>HARRISON: You wouldn't.</p><p/><p>QUEST: Wouldn't want to be on a plane that's landing in those situations. Jenny, thank you very much. You can go back to the cooking show.</p><p/><p>HARRISON: (LAUGHTER). I'm going to do something. Look at those logos again. Look at the logos on the planes again.</p><p/><p>QUEST: The logos, the logos. Well, certainly. Right. When we come back after the moment, the big screen to the big board - AMC's Entertainment went public today. A conversation with Gerry Lopez on what it is we want when we go to the movies beside a good movie and a good yarn.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>QUEST: It's show time for AMC Entertainment, the parent company of AMC Theatres, went public on the NYSE today on the big board. The chief executive Gerry Lopez rang the opening bell. AMC shares closed today up 5 percent - that's a nice pop on an IPO at $18.90. I asked him what AMC gains by being on the market.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>GERRY LOPEZ, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF AMC ENTERTAINMENT: The key piece that we gain by coming public is access to the U.S. equity capital markets. Our parent companyWonder -- Dalian Wanda Group out of Beijing is on a path to globalize its businesses. As they do so, it's a good idea to gain access to the different capital markets across the globe. Taking us public is one of the many things - one of the many ideas - that they have, one of the many initiatives that they're executing (against) as they look to continue to grow, and grow not only in their home country but across the globe.</p><p/><p>QUEST: But of course once you're in the market, and the reason for my question is, once you're in the market, you are so much more susceptible to the whim of the market -- to the reporting of it to shareholders. And many CEOs do find being in the market to be much more of a strain than as a private company where you're given much more leeway.</p><p/><p>LOPEZ: Well, you know everybody has a point of view on that, Richard, but for us we were already a public filer. We - although not trading our equity publicly - we have had public debt throughout our entire period as a private company. So to us, we were already kind of public. We had to file every quarter, we had to deal with the debt holders, which you know, it's a different group than the equity holders, but it's not that really different. The scrutiny, the compliance, the rules that you live by are really not that dramatically different, so for us, gaining access to the markets was really frankly more important - the flexibility that it brings is something that we wanted. So, sure, there's, you know, some burdens that come with being a public company, but to us those were not a blocker, and we are quite prepared to live within you know within those rules. That's not a big deal for us.</p><p/><p>QUEST: What do you foresee as you compete against the Netflix at home and all of the options at home and you're providing good business - technologically, do you see anything on the horizon?</p><p/><p>LOPEZ: The reality, Richard, is that - is that the consumer that enjoys Netflix and the consumer that enjoys a movie on an iPad at home on the go is also the consumer that enjoys the movie in a theater. People who love movies love movies. And they love movies at home, they love movies in our theaters, they love movies in an airplane, they love movies everywhere they go. That consumer, that core customer, is the same across all of the many different -</p><p/><p>QUEST: Really?</p><p/><p>LOPEZ: -- forms. And you can enjoy - oh, absolutely. The best DVD customer at any of the retailers in the DVD world are also our best customers in our theaters. The truth is that as people want to have an evening out, as young people want to date other young people, as, frankly, some of the parents may want to get away from some of the young people on a Saturday evening, we like our chances as to where the business is going. If we continue to provide people with a great story and a good environment in which to enjoy that story, I think - I think this business which many have predicted is dead many years, you know for many times, will still be around.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>QUEST: Tonight's \"Profitable Moment.\" So, tapering will begin in January. It's a historic day, of that that there's no doubt, but we do need to keep it into proportion. By no means is the Fed slowing down its purchase of bonds. It's just very gently, very easily easing up on the gas. Because, let's face it, it's still buying $75 billion a month and that's a great deal of money.</p><p/><p>And that's \"Quest Means Business\" for tonight. I'm Richard Quest at the CNN Center. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable.</p><p/><p>(BELL RINGS).</p><p/><p>QUEST: I'll see you back in New York tomorrow.</p><p/><p>END</p><p/><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2013 Cable News Network, Inc.

The closing bell rings, US stocks swing sharply higher, the Fed has begun tapering. What a day it has been as the gavel gets hit --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(RINGS BELL)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">QUEST: Oh! It's Wednesday, it's the 18th of December.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, we're all about tapering time. The Fed slows down the stimulus just a smidgeon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ford falls a little bit more. It falls foul of investors and warns about profits at risk.</p><p>And also tonight, taking the company by the tail. Which do you prefer for the new American Airlines? The employees get to vote, we will explain.</p><p>I'm Richard Quest, live at the CNN Center, where of course I mean business.</p><p>Good evening. What a day! Well, the suspense is over. The Federal Reserve is to start tapering in January. The key line in the Fed statement, it said quite clearly, \"In light of the cumulative progress towards maximum employment and the improved conditions in the labor market, conditions the committee decided to modestly reduce the pace of its asset purchases.\"</p><p>So, tapering is to begin. Since September 2012, the Fed's been buying $85 billion worth of US securities and mortgage-backed securities. Now, from January, just watch the speedometer, it goes down just a smidgeon by $10 billion to $75 billion a month. It will break down in $35 billion and $40 billion of US treasuries and make $75 billion.</p><p>It's symbolic but it is happening, and this is what everybody had been waiting for. We had debated whether it was going to be January or March of next year, but clearly, the Fed's announcement, followed by Chairman <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke's </nameText></person>news conference, which was his last before he steps down at the end of January. And <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>said tapering -- according to the data at least -- tapering is here to stay.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>BEN BERNANKE, </nameText></person>CHAIRMAN, US FEDERAL RESERVE: If the economies slows for some reason or we are disappointed in the outcomes, we could skip a meeting or two. On the other side, if things really pick up, then of course we could go a bit faster. But my expectation is for similar moderate steps going forward throughout most of 2014.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Now, the Fed has invigorated the markets. Come over to me over at the board and you'll see just what these numbers look like. This is a record. The Dow surged up 293 points. That's a gain of nearly more than 1.75 percent.</p><p>But it's the way the day had progressed. For most of the session, we really were just bobbing up and down about, 30, 40 points. Then as we get to this period here, just before the announcement, it goes down.</p><p>It comes back up again -- and you can't see it on this graph, but take my word for it. I'm going to right in here. Just there, after we get the announcement, the market goes down, and I suspect that's because nobody really was able to work out just how much, what had -- it was literally just a minute or two at exactly 2:00.</p><p>And then the rally began and it was slow to begin and then broad-based, and it continued right up to a record, the Dow standing at 16,168. The S&amp;P 500, the broader market, also closing at all-time high.</p><p>And this is about much more than just the Fed taking the foot off the gas. This statement contains several other crucial parts of information. For instance, the Fed adjusted its forward guidance. Rates are to stay low well past the time when unemployment goes below 6.5 percent. Now, that's interest rates. That's, of course, the Fed funds rate.</p><p>Inflation still well below the 2 percent target. We had economic projections that were released. Unemployment is expected to fall faster next year. Fewer board members now expect tightening on rates that will take place next year.</p><p>Joining us now from Washington is Joseph Gagnon. He's the senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and has worked at the Federal Reserve Board and at the US Treasury.</p><p>Sir, thank you for joining us. We knew it was coming. It's happened now, and it's still -- even though we knew it was on its way, it's still significant.</p><p>JOSEPH GAGNON, SENIOR FELLOW, PETERSON INSTITUTE FOR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS: Yes, absolutely. It seems like a case of sell on the room rather than buy on the news, in this case. But I wonder if the language about keeping the rates lower long after the unemployment rate goes below 6.5 might actually have been the more important piece of news today that might have encouraged markets to be so positive.</p><p>QUEST: This idea that even though stimulus may go next year, what really matters is when interest rates go up, because that -- the tightening part of the policy, isn't it?</p><p>GAGNON: Yes, I think so, I think so. Because the taper, although it's a bit earlier than expected, it looks like it will be going slower than expected. And so it probably doesn't have much news for the market, because we'll still be having QE through the end of the year next year just about.</p><p>But the fact that they were willing to say that they would hold short-term rates at zero well beyond unemployment reaching 6.5 percent to me was the real news.</p><p>QUEST: And yet, at the same time, there is this inflation question -- I mean issue. I'm looking at the projections. Now, they all believe that inflation will remain low for the foreseeable future, in the 1 to 2 percent range.</p><p>And everything the Fed basically says today about that unemployment well past the time that the unemployment rate declines, is very much contingent on them being right on the inflation question.</p><p>GAGNON: Yes, it is. And I think there's a huge uncertainty in both directions because inflation's been lower than they had expected, but there is a lot of concern that it could go up higher in the future, and they have to be on guard against both possibilities.</p><p>QUEST: Looking at the GDP forecast that we got from the FOMC members, very slightly down, it's almost unalterable, it's almost unaltered. But the unemployment number, again, that did fall.</p><p>There you've got the GDP number slightly lower, but you've also got the unemployment number. Which of all the data that you heard and the forecast that we've seen and the projections that we've been given do you find the most interesting?</p><p>GAGNON: Well, I would say it's the data that's come out recently that they didn't talk about today, but spending data in the US economy and employment data, monthly employment reports and stuff, have been stronger lately, and in particular, showing the strength through the government shutdown and despite the big sequester cuts is what I think has got people feeling rather bullish.</p><p>QUEST: Good to talk to you, sir. Thank you for joining us and putting this into perspective. Now, as we've talked about the taper rally, well, the stock surge was quite impressive. Maribel Aber is at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>We've just been talking there, not only do we have this taper, we do have that wording in the last paragraph of the statement, which does say \"the committee anticipate the funds will last well past the time of 6.5 percent.\" What was the market focusing on?</p><p>MARIBEL ABER, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Richard. It was focusing on all of that, and as you said a little bit earlier there, we saw that tick down a little bit right at 2:00. Took some time to vet that through. And then all the sudden, you saw this gradual rise.</p><p>I think the markets in general were really happy to have the decision finally behind us. And as you said, not putting on the brakes, per se, just easing the foot off the gas, right? The markets seemed to like this gentle ease if you will. The Dow was surging shortly after the taper announcement came down.</p><p>You talked earlier about these records that we set today, the Dow set a record close, the S&amp;P set a record close. That $10 billion pullback was in the range that Wall Street expected, so not so dramatic that it's spooking investors.</p><p>But now, I think, they're looking past this taper headline. They're focusing on the message that this decision telegraphs about the economy. The Fed is confident --</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>ABER: -- it can start to stand on its own. Richard?</p><p>QUEST: Maribel, thank you for that. I day that will -- I think all of us who work in this business, all of us who sort of cover business news and economic news will certainly remember.</p><p>It was also the day when shares in Ford -- now that has been a stellar performer, bearing in mind the US economy and its recovery and the recession -- shares in the Ford Motor Company plummeted after the company issued a profit warning. The stock fell more than 6 percent in New York.</p><p>Ford now expects to earn between $7 billion and $8 billion next year, down from $8.5 billion in 2013. Bosses are blaming tough economic conditions in Europe and South America.</p><p>When we need to understand these market movements, Paul La Monica's the man we turn to from CNN Money. He joins me now from New York. We've known that Ford has had some difficulties, but it has always been the darling of the motor industry because it didn't take US government cash and it did seem to be performing so well. What's gone wrong?</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN MONEY ASSISTANT MANAGING EDITOR: Yes, exactly. As you point out, Ford did not go bankrupt. GM and Chrysler did. I think what's happening here is that GM and Chrysler are emboldened now because they've cleaned up their balance sheets, they've gotten their act together, they're making cars that people like to drive.</p><p>And Ford specifically said that tough competition in North America, the US specifically, is a problem. I'm not so sure it's that the economy is weak in the US as much as it is just that the Big Three is -- they're all back.</p><p>QUEST: In this environment, then, do we just take today's warning as a hiccup? Or we've known Ford -- Ford of all of the companies has really been very aggressive in restructuring its European assets. It's always had the idea of a third, a third, a third. A third US, a third Europe, a third Asia. Do see anything in this that changes that strategy?</p><p>LA MONICA: I doubt it. The only thing that could potentially change that strategy is the eventual changing of the guard at Ford, and in some respects, that's the bigger story, the Alan Mulally, will he stay, will he not rumor hasn't died down, even though many people within the Ford organization have been adamant to say that he's going to be there through the end of 2014.</p><p>But you still hear all the chatter. Maybe he's the top candidate to replace Steve Ballmer at Microsoft. So if Mulally's gone, I think anything's up for -- up in the air in terms of new strategy.</p><p>QUEST: Yes. Now, that's the big one, isn't it? They say he will be CEO right the way through 2014, or he'll stay to the end of his contract, I forget the exact -- you could probably remind me the exact phraseology. It's clever wording, isn't it, that leaves a little bit of a window of interpretation --</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, it definitely seems that way.</p><p>QUEST: -- of when he might go?</p><p>LA MONICA: I really doubt that -- the only thing that's going to stop the chatter about Mulally going to Microsoft is Microsoft announcing a new CEO whose name is not Alan Mulally.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUEST: Good point. A busy day. You've got to admit, you don't see Ford down 6 percent ever day. You don't see tapering every day. Good to see you, Paul --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, no tapering love for the Big Three, unfortunately. Tessla down, too.</p><p>QUEST: No, I -- well, yes, but -- and also, and yet at the same time, the US government selling -- managing to get rid of its GM stock. So all three are, as you rightly point out, now fit for purpose and fit to fight. That's basically it, isn't it?</p><p>LA MONICA: Definitely. And keep in mind, too, that even with the Ford sell- off today, the stock is up about 20 percent year-to-date. That has lagged GM.</p><p>GM's had an amazing year, and a lot of people feel that they're on the right track with a new CEO, Mary Barra coming in, and she's a product person, so I think a lot of people are excited about GM in a way that they hadn't been in a long time.</p><p>QUEST: Paul La Monica, thank you for joining us.</p><p>LA MONICA: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: What -- no wonder we enjoy this business so much when you've got so many great stories all happening at once, a firmament in our very midst.</p><p>The arrest of an Indian diplomat in New York has sparked an international row. US Secretary of State <person><nameText>John Kerry </nameText></person>says he empathizes with India. Did he actually apologize, and if he -- whatever he said, why did he say it? We'll talk about it after the break. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>(RINGS BELL)</p><p>QUEST: The US secretary of state, <person><nameText>John Kerry, </nameText></person>has been drawn into the diplomatic row, not surprisingly, between India and the United States. Secretary Kerry expressed regret over the arrest of India's deputy consul, who's been held on suspicion of visa fraud last week.</p><p>Devyani Khobragade was strip-searched after being accused of underpaying her New York maid. Before we talk more about this, let's get the background from Pamela Brown.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PAMELA BROWN, CNN US NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Watch as police remove the concrete security barriers in front of the US embassy in New Delhi. Newspapers in India reporting the government is behind the anti-US protest. Why? Retaliation sparked by an arrest of this Indian diplomat in New York City, Devyani Khobragade.</p><p>According to this criminal complaint, Khobragade, a deputy consul general, severely underpaid her babysitter, only paying her $3.31 an hour, far less than minimum wage. The complaint also alleges the diplomat worked her babysitter far more than the 40 hours per week, allegedly without overtime pay, and then lied about all of this on visa documents, a violation of US law.</p><p>UTTAM KHOBRAGADE, DEVIYANI KHOBRAGADE'S FATHER: My daughter has not done anything wrong. She had nothing to do with this visa process.</p><p>BROWN: State Department diplomatic security arrested Khobragade last Thursday after she dropped her daughter off at school. She was later strip- searched and put in a holding cell with other defendants. Her lawyer says she pleaded not guilty.</p><p>DANIEL ARSHACK, DEVIYNAI KHOBRAGADE'S ATTORNEY: I have every expectation that she will be completely vindicated.</p><p>BROWN: Her arrest sparked outrage among Indian officials, some calling her treatment barbaric, one even calling for the partners of gay US diplomats in India to be arrested. The country recently banned gay sex.</p><p>YASHWANT SINHA, FORMER INDIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: What the government of India can do immediately is to cancel those visas, arrest all these companions, put them behind bars.</p><p>BROWN: Indian officials also snubbed US delegates visiting India, one tweeting, \"Refused to meet the visiting USA delegation in solidarity with our nation.\"</p><p>KAMAL NATH, INDIAN ARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS MINISTER: More steps should be taken against the United States until they give an unconditional apology.</p><p>BROWN: US Marshal Service officials stand by their strip-search procedures, saying they treated the diplomat the same way they treat everyone else.</p><p>MARIE HARF, DEPUTY SPOKESPERSON, US STATE DEPARTMENT: Thus far, all indications are that appropriate procedures were followed. But nonetheless, we understand this is a very sensitive issue, and we're continuing to review exactly what transpired.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: All right, let's talk about this with our World Affairs Reporter, Elise Labott, who's in Washington. We need to get to the bottom of this. I've -- I don't know why, but one day I did sit down and read the US State Department's handbook on diplomatic immunity and how they're supposed to treat people.</p><p>Now, if she'd been a full diplomatic agent, there was no question of handcuffing her or anything like that, whatever she'd have done. But she's not a diplomatic agent, is she? She has consular immunity. And now the issue is, did Kerry apologize or not?</p><p>ELISE LABOTT, CNN WORLD AFFAIRS REPORTER: OK. Well, she has this consular immunity, Richard, and that means that she can't be arrested for anything that she's doing as part of her official duties. So, these crimes that she's been accused of and actually pled guilty to in a Manhattan federal court, by the way, are outside the scope of her duties.</p><p>I think what -- Secretary Kerry was apologizing for a few things. He was apologizing for the treatment that she received. I think even though proper procedures were followed, I think that there's an understanding that A, she could have been afforded a little bit more courtesy and respect given her status in New York as an Indian diplomat.</p><p>And B, this cultural sensitivity in India, where woman who are screened or patted down or anything like that are kind of brought to a private room. It's very -- the cultural sensitivity is very high there.</p><p>And I think he's also apologizing for the fact that this is getting out of hand, that now India is taking all these actions against the United States, and that this is really affecting relations, because --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: But there's a very -- all right. But -- I'm going to jump in here because --</p><p>LABOTT: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: -- this is the difficulty, though.</p><p>LABOTT: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: You've got New York authorities saying we did nothing wrong. You've got Kerry basically saying, well, they may not have done anything wrong, but I'm still very sorry that they did nothing wrong. And you -- at what point does India decide to bury the hatchet in this, or does it decide to keep throttling forward?</p><p>LABOTT: OK. Well, technically, the marshals didn't do anything wrong, but diplomatic security guards made the arrest. And then they handed her over to the marshals. And the diplomatic security services could have said, listen, treat her with kid gloves. Give her a little bit of respect and leeway. They didn't do that, and I think that's one thing that there's an understand of that.</p><p>And I think that -- the Indians here, it's kind of unclear. On one hand, they're protesting the treatment of the diplomat and the manner in which this was carried out, but the whole idea that she doesn't have immunity from this crime in the first place. And that's one of the little dirty little secrets here in Washington is about how diplomats treat their domestic help. There have been a lot of cases, even particularly in India this year of diplomats that are treating --</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>LABOTT: -- their servants poorly. And so I think that both sides need to take it down a notch, and I think that's what Secretary Kerry is trying to do.</p><p>QUEST: In a word, in a sentence, you've studied diplomacy and diplomatic relations for years. Does this story go away fast?</p><p>LABOTT: No. I think it -- I think that the moves that the Indians have taken have been a bit excessive, and you saw in Deb Feyerick's (sic) piece that they're calling for more action. And so, I think that that call might have helped, but I think that the tensions are going to remain, especially if this diplomat is prosecuted in US courts.</p><p>QUEST: Elise Labott in Washington putting it into perspective for us. Thank you, Elise.</p><p>Now, Facebook knows what its users do on its site, and now they know what they do when it's off it. An executive speaks exclusively to CNN on the Facebook data dilemma and -- it's straight after in a moment.</p><p>QUEST: For the first time, a Facebook executive has spoken on camera about how Facebook is using your offline data to market ads to you online. Samuel Burke sat down with Facebook's vice president of global marketing for an exclusive interview. Samuel joins me now live from New York.</p><p>Now, let's be clear about this. We know that they rampantly manage to take our online searches and when you're on Facebook, but this is when you're offline. This is when you're not on the Facebook site, is that right?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: That's correct. I think, Richard, we've all had that \"oh wow\" moment when we realize they really are tracking us. When you search for something on website and then you go to another website and see an ad there for what you were searching for.</p><p>This is -- that's really nothing compared to what they're able to find out about you offline, and then give ads to you online.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRED ASTAIRE AS SD KLUGER, NARRATOR, \"SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN\": Santa can still look into his magic snowball and see just what you're up to.</p><p>BURKE (voice-over): Just like Santa Claus in the classic cartoon --</p><p>ASTAIR (singing): He sees you when you're sleeping, he knows when you're awake --</p><p>BURKE: Big tech companies not only know what their users are up to online, increasingly they know what they're doing offline. Facebook is partnering with data collection firms that gather information from those customer loyalty cards used in many brick and mortar stores.</p><p>Facebook's vice president of global marketing says the data is then used to create customized ads and deals to its more than 1 billion customers.</p><p>CAROLYN EVERSON, VICE PRESIDENT OF GLOBAL MARKETING, FACEBOOK: I'll give you a very real example. Let's say that I am a heavy snack user and I buy snacks. And we now have the ability through about 50 percent of purchase card data in the United States to tell a snack manufacturer that here are the consumers that have purchased snacks and allow that marketer to target them with a very specific ad.</p><p>BURKE (on camera): How can Facebook guarantee that all this data is anonymous?</p><p>EVERSON: We have the data from, let's say, the grocery store, which is really purchase card data. We have that bucket of data. We have the Facebook data. Those two never shall meet in terms of us sharing specific Facebook information or them sharing very specific purchase information.</p><p>So they would turn Samuel into a code that would never be identifiable as Samuel, you would be a set of characters.</p><p>BURKE (voice-over): That procedure is called hashing, and despite this advance in securing information, privacy advocates are worried about tech companies collecting so much information.</p><p>MARC ROTENBERG, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, PRIVACY INFORMATION CENTER: We do believe that hashing and more generally de-identification, which is a technique for anonymizing, that is to remove the actual information of the user, is a good privacy too, and we favor it.</p><p>But we think it also has to be tested independently, and we can't rely on Facebook's representations about whether they're doing a good enough job.</p><p>BURKE: Facebook says their business depends on keeping users' data secure, and they believe they'll prefer seeing ads and coupons customized to their tastes and habits.</p><p>EVERSON: We firmly believe that the more relevant and useful the advertising can be, that it's in service of the consumer.</p><p>BURKE: Maybe more importantly for Facebook, the people paying their bills, the advertisers, see this customization as the Holy Grail.</p><p>EVERSON: We want to be able to offer a marketer the opportunity to know precisely who they want to target to drive very specific business results, and that's incredibly valuable for them.</p><p>BURKE: Now, Facebook's users will have to decide whether this type of data sharing is naughty or nice.</p><p>ASTAIRE (singing): He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice --</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Samuel, I have only one sentence: how dare they?</p><p>BURKE: Well, you may not like this, Richard, but the fact of the matter is, this data was already being collected about you before. Anytime you go into a grocery store and use your loyalty --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: Yes! Who gives the -- hang on, hang on. Who gives the grocery store permission to give the information to Facebook, whether hash tags or hashed or whatever?</p><p>BURKE: Well, inadvertently, I suppose it's you, because you're using those credit and loyalty cards, but it's the information -- the data companies that have collected that information, that own that information about you and me who are now sharing it with Facebook.</p><p>QUEST: And I'm guessing -- I've been told it's the last question, so you're going to have to answer this very briefly -- I'm guessing that there is a way to get out of this, but by jingo, you'd need a degree in computer science to get through the privacy rules to opt out.</p><p>BURKE: Or only use cash, Richard. Don't use a loyalty card, and don't use a credit card, then you might be able to --</p><p>(CROSSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: Oh, please, Samuel!</p><p>BURKE: -- get around it.</p><p>QUEST: Oh, please, Samuel! Oh, please, Samuel! Thank you. Excellent reporting. Samuel -- Samuel Burke, who's never knowingly put his hand in his pocket. Many thanks, indeed, Samuel, for joining us there. We'll have more on the Fed tapering in just a moment. I'm really annoyed about that, my data being just willy-nilly handed about. After the break.</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest. There's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment. This is CNN, and on this network, the news always comes first.</p><p>Around 500 people have been killed and hundreds more people have been wounded in violence in South Sudan. The UN fears the fighting is being fueled by ethnic tensions. The government says it's politically motivated. So far, between 15,000 and 20,000 people have fled the fighting, taking refuge at the Untied Nations bases.</p><p>The US Federal Reserve is to begin easing the stimulus measures next month. Tapering is to start. Reducing its monthly bond purchases by $10 billion to $75 billion a month. The Fed says the economy is growing at a moderate pace and stocks on Wall Street surged to new records after the announcement.</p><p>Security experts say the NSA should end the systematic collection of phone records. The panel recommended reforming surveillance activities at the spy agency. The suggestions include greater transparency, more oversight, and greater self-restraint.</p><p>Police in New York say they were following standard procedures when they strip-searched an Indian diplomat after her arrest on visa fraud charges. India has taken steps in retaliation, which includes removing the concrete security barriers outside the US embassy in New Delhi. US Secretary of State <person><nameText>John Kerry </nameText></person>has expressed his regret over the situation.</p><p>The Turkish prime minister has denounced a corruption crackdown on his allies as a dirty operation. Tayyip Erdogan says enemies are trying to smear his administration as the country heads towards elections. Fifty-two people, including three ministers' sons and businessmen close to the prime minister, were detained on Tuesday.</p><p>So, tapering is to begin in January as <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke </nameText></person>prepares to leave his post as the Fed chairman at the end of next month. He already admits he does not fully understand why the U.S. recovery has been so sluggish. In his press conference a few hours ago, he defended the handling of U.S. monetary policy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>BEN BERNANKE, </nameText></person>CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE: We had been disappointed in the pace of growth, and we don't fully understand why. Some of it may just be a slower pace of underlying potential, at least temporarily. Productivity has been disappointing. It may be there's been some bad luck - for example, the effects of the European crisis and the like. But compared to other advanced industrial countries - Europe, U.K., Japan - compared to other countries, advanced industrial countries recovering from financial crises, the U.S. recovery has actually been better than most.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST: <person><nameText>Ben Bernanke. </nameText></person>Now, Bob Parker is the senior advisor at Credit Suisse. When I joined - when he joined me earlier in London, I asked him what he made of the Fed's decision. The tapering starts in January.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BOB PARKER, SENIOR ADVISOR, CREDIT SUISSE: Two important points. The first point is that you know the risk of them announcing tapering in December - that risk had certainly increased in recent weeks and it increased first of all because in contrast to September and October we had the agreement, albeit it a small agreement, between the Democrats and the Republicans on a fiscal policy. So, you know, that threat to the economy - that threat of sequestration - has been removed. And that was a concern for the Federal Reserve earlier in the year.</p><p>And I think the second consideration, and probably the more important one, is that recent data - whether you look at industrial production, whether you look at today's housing figures, whether you look at recent data on consumption -- everything shows that in the last month the U.S. economy, after a temporary weak period in September -</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>PARKER: -- and early October, is now accelerating. And it's - you know - it's I think intelligent to forecast U.S. growth next year at close to 3 percent. And, you know, that growth upgrade takes away the case for quantitative easing.</p><p>QUEST: Looking now at the statement and reading what they say, it's almost as if this was a trigger they have been waiting and wanting to pull, and this gave them the reason to do it today.</p><p>PARKER: That is certainly true, but I think one part to emphasize, Richard, is that they are moving very slowly, and you know let's be very clear. If monetary policy in the United States was exceptionally easy with $85 billion of quantitative easing per month, by moving to $75 billion -- and my forecast is the average for quantitative easing will be $70 billion per month for the first quarter -- they've gone from being exceptionally easy to slightly less easy. But you can't describe this as a monetary tightening. We've still got with $75 billion a month a high volume of quantitative easing.</p><p>QUEST: But what they say is the committee will likely reduce the pace of assets in further measured steps, and we go back to when <person><nameText>Bernanke </nameText></person>first talked about this in June of this year. Now he said - then he talked about it all being over and done with by the end of 2014 - so I'm guessing if you - if we extrapolate - they started later, therefore they'll finish later. It's likely they'll still be QE into 15 probably.</p><p>PARKER: I think that's probably right, and you know, although circumstances may change. My central case forecast would be QE averaging $70 billion in the first quarter, by midyear 2014 I'm assuming that we will be down to perhaps $40 to $50 billion per month, and that by the end of 2014 we'll still have QE, but obviously it's going to be much smaller -- it may only be $10 to $20 billion a month. And the whole program will probably end in the first quarter of 2015. It's going to be a very slow, unwinding process, underpinning this good growth outlet for the U.S. economy.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Bob Parker of Credit Suisse talking to me earlier about the Fed and many of the other central banks have all pinned their forward guidance on unemployment. And the Bank of England will probably raise interest rates sooner rather than later, and that reason is because unemployment in the U.K. is falling faster than expected. The jobless rate declines at 7.4 percent in the third quarter - the lowest since April 2009 - and it approaches the 7 percent level which Mark Carney, the governor, has said could trigger - could, not would, could - trigger a rise in rates.</p><p>The pound sterling - that, well it jumped on the jobless numbers. I want you to look and see how the pound has performed. This chart shows its performance in recent - in recent months. We get to a low down here of just under 147 or so, but then you come to a very sharp rise to where we are now - just shy of 163 on stable -- on the cable rate. And as you see this gain here - no wonder the Bank of England is already now warning that this sort of appreciation - bearing in mind an economy like the U.K.'s which is so export-led, even though leading export partners like the E.U. are in some economic troubles -- that could have a bad effect on the strength of the U.K.'s recovery. Or at least it's one of the factors that we're (aware/wary). But as you know, there's not a lot you can do about currencies if that's the trend that the market wants to move in.</p><p>The pound itself, however, the actual physical pound - well that is getting much more robust. No more in - from 2016 will there be old notes, instead, polymer is going to be the substance by which they make the bank notes from Threadneedlestreet. Jim Boulden reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>JIM BOULDEN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Paying with plastic used to mean using a credit card. In a handful of countries like Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Vietnam, it also means using a bank note made of polymer instead of cotton paper. Now the Bank of England will start to switch to polymer notes as well after consulting the public. The bank says 87 percent approved the plastic money over cotton paper.</p><p>MIKE CARNEY, GOVERNOR, BANK OF ENGLAND: We think it is significant. They bring a lot of benefits. They're more secure so they protect us against counterfeiting much better than the existing notes, better technologies.</p><p>BOULDEN: From 2016 five-pound notes will be printed on polymer, ten-pound notes will follow, making Britain the largest economy with plastic notes. But it's assuring all the queen will remain on the front of all notes. So, what are the reasons for the switch? Well, polymer notes can last a lot longer in circulation, and bank notes are getting evermore safety features to try to thwart counterfeiting, including these windows in the polymer.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hard to get into.</p><p>BOULDEN: As the CEO of the bank note printing company De La Rue told me recently during an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the company's design studios, a crucial part of the switchover is getting the public behind it.</p><p>TIM COBBOLD, CEO, DE LA RUE: I think you should expect many central banks to look at all the available technologies, both from a durability and a security point of view. And as polymer becomes more common and more accepted within the industry, I think you can expect all central banks to at least be considering it.</p><p>BOULDEN: The Bank of England says polymer notes will last more than twice as long in circulation which would cut costs and promises the new notes will stay cleaner. They can even survive a washing machine, and importantly, still fold nicely into any wallet. Jim Boulden, CNN London.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Ah, but as I discovered once on a trip to Australia, yes, they can withstand the washing machine, they can stand - withstand - a trip into the ocean, but they can be ripped if you bite them. If you just try and tear them it won't work, but if you bite them - don't ask me why we decided to do an experiment biting Austrian dollar bills, but anyway, that's a story for another day.</p><p>European markets advanced on Wednesday. Investors were awaiting the outcome of the Fed's meeting. Look at the numbers and make your own judgment. The best of the day is Xetra DAX which gained 1 percent. The Paris CAC (Inaudible) was also up. The goal, for bank lenders - leaders - agreeing to landmark banking union in Brussels tomorrow. They goal is to prevent banks from crippling national economies. We've had the single supervisory mechanism, now we need the single resolution mechanism, and that's got to be agreed and signed off on.</p><p>It's not just about the banks - European officials are also going after some of Spain's top football clubs. The Commission's investigating if local governments in Spain have given unfair advantage to some football clubs through tax breaks. Our correspondent in Madrid is Al Goodman.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AL GOODMAN, CNN'S MADRID BUREAU CHIEF: It's a three-part investigation by the European Commission into some of Spain's and the world's best-known football clubs like Real Madrid and FC Barcelona. \"Professional football clubs should finance their running costs and investments with sound financial management rather than at the expense of the taxpayer,\" said European Commission Vice President Joaquin Almunia.</p><p>First, Brussels will look into possible tax advantages for Real Madrid, FC Barcelona and two clubs in Northern Spain - Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna in Pamplona. These four clubs are not private companies - they were given an exemption from converting to that status. Instead, they're run by their season ticket holders like shareholders who elect the club's president. Brussels says that legal status gives them a lower tax rate than other clubs.</p><p>Next, Brussels will look into a reported land transfer between the City of Madrid and Real Madrid to see if there was inappropriate state aid. The land swap involved Real Madrid's old training grounds near its home, Bernabeu Stadium, which became the site of four office and hotel skyscrapers. The new training grounds were moved out near the airport. The Commission says the land swap was based on a piece of land being revalued to nearly 23 million Euros, up from just 600 Euros in 1998. Finally, Brussels will look into more than 100 million Euros in state- backed loans to three clubs in the Valencia region. Spain's foreign minister says all of these operations were in accord with Spanish law, and he expects the investigation to be closed after European officials get more information. The clubs are either professing innocence or not commenting.</p><p>Al Goodman, CNN Madrid.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: When we come back in just a second, greater freedom for gadgets from takeoff to landing - it's already been in the United States, now one of Europe's top carriers is to relax the rules for the first time. We'll have the story after the break.</p><p>QUEST: This week's \"Business Traveller\" update. Delta Airlines - you heard from the chief executive yesterday on this program - Delta has announced today it will continue to ban voice calls onboard its flights, regardless of what the official regulations may be. In a statement, Delta says on the question of flight communications, it feels passengers' voice calls in the cabin are in their words (RING) \"disruptive.\" It applies to cellular calls and internet-based voice calls.</p><p>Now, Delta says no because of course you'll remember the rules have changed in terms of gadgets which you can use, and British Airways is to become the first European carrier that will allow customers to use small handheld electronic devices during taxiing, takeoff and landing - iPads, Kindles and the like. From tomorrow BA passengers can use their phones, tablets and e- readers in the flight-safe mode from the time they board to the time they disembark The European airlines are now catching up after the U.S. relaxed the rules earlier this year.</p><p>How about this one - look at this. Which of these two do you prefer? Now that of course is the old American Airlines logo. That over there is the new American Airlines log. But there's been a great dispute over which is better - the new or the old. Now employees of the merged company are to be allowed to vote on whether to go with the new or back to the old. It's an interesting question because some people hate the new and some people love the old and vice-versa. On January the 2nd the result will be announced as to which the employees prefer. It's not the first time of course this has happened.</p><p>Margaret Thatcher famously showed her displeasure when British Airways replaced - look at that - she took her handkerchief and - can we run that again, please? Because it's so good. Bearing in mind that these were the ethnic tailfins that British Airways had introduced. And if we could show that video again - I'm not sure whether we can - but if we could, you would definitely - Margaret Thatcher, there she goes - out comes the handkerchief. She's shown the logo, she's shown the tailfin. \"Dreadful\" she said and in one fell swoop, she destroyed millions of dollars' worth of branding.</p><p>JENNY HARRISON, CNN INTERNATIONAL METEOROLOGIST: Wow.</p><p>QUEST: And now American Airlines is asking their people which do they prefer - the old or the new.</p><p>HARRISON: I know which one I like.</p><p>QUEST: Which one do you -- don't answer that, no.</p><p>HARRISON: I'm not going to answer, I'm not going to answer.</p><p>QUEST: You were going to.</p><p>HARRISON: I won't, I won't, I won't. I won't.</p><p>QUEST: You're not going to?</p><p>HARRISON: I won't.</p><p>QUEST: We wouldn't (inaudible).</p><p>HARRISON: No. I wouldn't dream of it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUEST: Have you been at the cooking sherry before Christmas?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HARRISON: No, you didn't bring me any over. No, all this talk of planes - they could be (inaudible) delays across in Europe into the U.K. Very, very strong winds, has been for the last couple of days. Huge wind gusts. I want to show you some of the numbers. They are shocking. You wouldn't want to be flying with these sort of winds, Richard.</p><p>Let me show you. This is the satellite. You can see all this action again across the northwest. Just going to zoom in and actually show you the U.K. and Ireland in particular and also northern France. This is where the really high wind gusts have been reported. Rain has been coming in as well, very heavy amounts which is going to accumulate obviously in the next couple of days. But look at these wind gusts. This what I mean. Plymouth in the U.K. which is (inaudible) 137 kilometers an hour, Castlederg there in northern Ireland 120, Quessant in France, 116, Valencia as well 111 kilometers an hour. These are some really strong winds, so over 80 miles an hour, these winds.</p><p>These are some of the current wind gusts that have been coming down a little bit, but once one system clears out of the way - like this one - there is unfortunately another one literally just waiting in the wings. I was saying yesterday, as we continue over the next few days - the next week actually, right up to Christmas day - it is going to be case of the same. This is the forecast showing you the winds, and look at some of these numbers --- in fact they seem to sit still so I think some of the data is missing there. But we could actually see some wind gusts again over 100 kilometers an hour. And of course, coming in with it, very heavy amounts of rain. So be prepared for obviously delays at the airports, but also very dangerous conditions on the road, particularly with winds that strong.</p><p>And this is the rain accumulating some portions there of Wales and Ireland. We could be seeing as much as five centimeters of rain. This is what's going to be happening over the next few days. System after system coming through bringing more of the same. Some pretty severe thunderstorms in there and amounts of rain. Current temperatures on the upside are fairly mild out in the west. This is the rain coming in, snow to those higher accumulations as well, and as for temperatures - well, you can see a little bit cooler as we head into Thursday - mostly single digits of course below freezing across central and eastern areas. Richard.</p><p>QUEST: You're right, I certainly would not like to be landing in that.</p><p>HARRISON: You wouldn't.</p><p>QUEST: Wouldn't want to be on a plane that's landing in those situations. Jenny, thank you very much. You can go back to the cooking show.</p><p>HARRISON: (LAUGHTER). I'm going to do something. Look at those logos again. Look at the logos on the planes again.</p><p>QUEST: The logos, the logos. Well, certainly. Right. When we come back after the moment, the big screen to the big board - AMC's Entertainment went public today. A conversation with Gerry Lopez on what it is we want when we go to the movies beside a good movie and a good yarn.</p><p>QUEST: It's show time for AMC Entertainment, the parent company of AMC Theatres, went public on the NYSE today on the big board. The chief executive Gerry Lopez rang the opening bell. AMC shares closed today up 5 percent - that's a nice pop on an IPO at $18.90. I asked him what AMC gains by being on the market.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GERRY LOPEZ, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF AMC ENTERTAINMENT: The key piece that we gain by coming public is access to the U.S. equity capital markets. Our parent company Wonder -- Dalian Wanda Group out of Beijing is on a path to globalize its businesses. As they do so, it's a good idea to gain access to the different capital markets across the globe. Taking us public is one of the many things - one of the many ideas - that they have, one of the many initiatives that they're executing (against) as they look to continue to grow, and grow not only in their home country but across the globe.</p><p>QUEST: But of course once you're in the market, and the reason for my question is, once you're in the market, you are so much more susceptible to the whim of the market -- to the reporting of it to shareholders. And many CEOs do find being in the market to be much more of a strain than as a private company where you're given much more leeway.</p><p>LOPEZ: Well, you know everybody has a point of view on that, Richard, but for us we were already a public filer. We - although not trading our equity publicly - we have had public debt throughout our entire period as a private company. So to us, we were already kind of public. We had to file every quarter, we had to deal with the debt holders, which you know, it's a different group than the equity holders, but it's not that really different. The scrutiny, the compliance, the rules that you live by are really not that dramatically different, so for us, gaining access to the markets was really frankly more important - the flexibility that it brings is something that we wanted. So, sure, there's, you know, some burdens that come with being a public company, but to us those were not a blocker, and we are quite prepared to live within you know within those rules. That's not a big deal for us.</p><p>QUEST: What do you foresee as you compete against the Netflix at home and all of the options at home and you're providing good business - technologically, do you see anything on the horizon?</p><p>LOPEZ: The reality, Richard, is that - is that the consumer that enjoys Netflix and the consumer that enjoys a movie on an iPad at home on the go is also the consumer that enjoys the movie in a theater. People who love movies love movies. And they love movies at home, they love movies in our theaters, they love movies in an airplane, they love movies everywhere they go. That consumer, that core customer, is the same across all of the many different -</p><p>QUEST: Really?</p><p>LOPEZ: -- forms. And you can enjoy - oh, absolutely. The best DVD customer at any of the retailers in the DVD world are also our best customers in our theaters. The truth is that as people want to have an evening out, as young people want to date other young people, as, frankly, some of the parents may want to get away from some of the young people on a Saturday evening, we like our chances as to where the business is going. If we continue to provide people with a great story and a good environment in which to enjoy that story, I think - I think this business which many have predicted is dead many years, you know for many times, will still be around.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's \"Profitable Moment.\" So, tapering will begin in January. It's a historic day, of that that there's no doubt, but we do need to keep it into proportion. By no means is the Fed slowing down its purchase of bonds. It's just very gently, very easily easing up on the gas. Because, let's face it, it's still buying $75 billion a month and that's a great deal of money.</p><p>And that's \"Quest Means Business\" for tonight. I'm Richard Quest at the CNN Center. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable.</p><p>(BELL RINGS).</p><p>QUEST: I'll see you back in New York tomorrow.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2013121801cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5B38-4571-JB20-G13X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7846\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"12\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>December 18, 2013 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001TIV</classCode><className>AMERICAN AIRLINES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As well as having become a huge part of the way we live and work, it has driven growth in sectors such as healthcare. And this trend looks set to continue for the foreseeable future. \"[Tech] stocks are growing faster than the broader market, so if you invest in them you're getting exposure to this growth and companies that are changing the world,\" says Ryan Hughes, head of active portfolios at broker <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">AJ Bell</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Companies that have changed the way we live include <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">Facebook</url> (FB:NSQ),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">Amazon</url> (AMZN:NSQ),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">Apple</url> (US:AAPL),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">Netflix</url> (US:NFLX) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">Alphabet</url> (US:GOOGL), the company that owns Google. These companies, which are known as the FAANGs, reported good earnings during the last quarter. </p><p>Amazon and Alphabet should continue to grow because they are leading research and development in cloud technology. This is the use of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage and process data rather than on a local server or personal computer. \"Cloud technology has barely penetrated the market so there is tremendous room to grow,\" says Ben Rogoff, manager of funds including <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">Polar Capital Technology Trust</url> (PCT). \"There are really only about five businesses in the world that can do this because it costs billions and is a question of scale. These companies are Amazon, Google,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">Microsoft</url> (US:MSFT) and China's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">Tencent</url> (Chi:700).\"</p><p>Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">Willis Owen</url>, adds: \"As a society we're moving away from consuming things as a product to consuming them as a service instead. For example, we have moved from CDs to streaming services such as       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">Spotify</url> (US:SPOT).\"</p><p>Technology is changing sectors such as retail. For example, Amazon fulfilment, a way of getting inventory from the manufacturer directly to the customer, has driven ecommerce, which is still a massive growth trend. And through targeted advertising, Facebook and Instagram have potential as retailers, too. \"Thanks to their secular growth they are not dependent on market cycles,\" adds Mr Rogoff. </p><p>The rise in ecommerce has also helped propel the rise of fast, convenient and easy digital payment platforms such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">PayPal</url> (US:PYPL). \"Every time a dollar goes from being in the shop to online, the payment sector is growing,\" says Mr Rogoff.</p><p>Digital currency may also experience significant growth when Facebook launches its own cryptocurrency, Libra.</p><p>Over the much longer term, fund analysts and technology fund managers expect significant growth in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI), although it is still at a nascent stage. Healthcare and the automobile manufacturing sectors are likely to see the most change from the introduction of robotics and AI, which could improve processes and drive down costs. Much of the research and development in this area is being done in Japan. </p><p>Tech companies, meanwhile, could benefit from the US Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut of 0.25 per cent. \"Low interest rates can be good for tech because the growth rates that you see in tech continue to look very good compared with the rest of the market,\" explains Mr Lowcock. \"Large companies are not particularly indebted and lower interest rates can make it even easier to clear debt.\"</p><p>And an interest rate cut can make it easier for smaller companies to raise debt via corporate bonds.</p><p>There is also potential for an improvement in the income investors get from tech stocks. Last year, US president Donald Trump's one-time repatriation tax of 15.5 per cent on the profits businesses have accumulated overseas helped bring back huge amounts of cash, which over the long term could be used by companies to pay dividends. Apple, for example, had huge amounts of cash and has increased its dividend payments year on year by 13.33 per cent.</p><p>There are opportunities outside the US as well. China recently launched the the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">Shanghai Stock Exchange STAR Market</url>, a trading platform populated by regional tech stocks, formulated along the lines of the US Nasdaq market. China is also home to companies sush as       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">Alibaba</url> (Chi:241), a multinational conglomerate specialising in ecommerce, retail and internet. Alibaba has also begun to expand into other areas such as food delivery by buying Ele.me, an online food delivery service, which could mean Alibaba's share price grows further. </p><p>                     Tech risks                   </p><p>But the tech sector also faces significant macro risks, such as the uncertainty over how the trade war between the US and China is going to pan out. \"[A reason behind] the trade war is Mr Trump's desire to help protect American intellectual property in China,\" says Gary White, chief investment commentator at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">Charles Stanley</url>. On 1 August, Mr Trump announced 10 per cent tariffs which will affect a further $300bn (\u00a3247bn) of Chinese goods. These tariffs are due to come into effect on 1 September.</p><p>Three days later, Beijing responded by allowing the renminbi currency to fall below Rmb7 to the dollar for the first time since the global financial crisis and getting state-owned companies to suspend imports of US agricultural products. </p><p>These actions hit equity markets so that on 5 August, the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.5 per cent and the S&amp;P 500 fell 3 per cent.</p><p>There are also concerns that the tariffs could affect supply chains. \"Semiconductor stocks, for example, have complex supply chains all over the world and Apple relies on these for the supply of iPhone parts,\" says Mr White. </p><p>Big tech companies in the US are under increased scrutiny. At the end of last month, the US Department of Justice announced a broad antitrust investigation into whether leading online platforms are unfairly restricting competition. \"This could increase overheads if they have to operate in a more heavily regulated environment than they have done until now,\" says Mr Hughes.</p><p>And Facebook has been fined $5bn because the US consumer protection agency, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">The Federal Trade Commission</url>, discovered data privacy violations following the leak of up to 87m users' information through Facebook to Cambridge Analytica. </p><p>Another major risk is slowing global growth. Mr Hughes thinks that the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut indicates that there is a slowdown, but as it only cut US interest rates by 0.25 per cent it suggests that it is not expecting a recession imminently. \"However, we are in the longest period of expansion that we've seen, so I would say we're in the late end of the cycle,\" adds Mr Hughes.</p><p>Valuations of tech stocks also look high. \"Despite what looks like a sharp fall, the tech market is only really back to where it was two or three months ago, so not much has changed,\" says Mr Hughes.</p><p>And the tech sector is more volatile than many other equity sectors because many companies in this area fail, and dominant players can be overthrown by disrupters.</p><p>The dominance of the FAANG stocks means that global growth funds and US equity funds - as well as technology funds - are likely to have exposure to them. This means that if you add a technology fund to your portfolio you could unintentionally have more exposure to these companies than you intended. To avoid this, before you invest in a fund check what holdings it has. You can see what a fund's 10 largest holdings are on its monthly fact sheet or on data websites such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">morningstar.co.uk</url>.</p><p>Mr Hughes also suggests investors understand a manager's investment style to get an idea of what the fund they run might typically invest in.</p><p>Mr Hughes says that investors with less investment knowledge and who do not have a very high risk appetite should get exposure to technology shares via a global equities fund that invests across various sectors, so is potentially less volatile than a tech fund. Investors with more knowledge and a higher risk appetite could <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">consider a US equities fund</url> [read more on these in the big theme of the 26 July issue].</p><p>Investors with a high risk appetite and long-term investment horizon could consider a technology fund. However, Mr Lowcock suggests that no investor allocate more than 2 to 3 per cent of their portfolio to technology funds so that their overall portfolio, which is also likely to include global and US funds, would have at most an allocation of 5 per cent to 6 per cent to technology shares</p><p>                     Fund for tech exposure                   </p><p>Investors who want exposure to technology stocks but do not have a high enough risk appetite to invest in a technology fund could could consider <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">Baillie Gifford Global Discovery</url> (GB0006059330). This fund aims for growth over the long term, and is managed by Douglas Brodie, and deputy managers Svetlana Viteva and Luke Ward. They invest the fund in companies with significant growth prospects, in particular those in industries with the potential for structural change and innovation.</p><p>However, this fund is by no means low risk as its managers say their holdings could have a wide range of potential outcomes and it has a bias to smaller companies. \"It is at the risky growth end of the market, but is one way to get exposure to some of the trends going on,\" says Mr Lowcock.</p><p>The fund's managers aim for the fund to be diverse and get exposure to technology via companies that are not necessarily in the tech sector, such as UK-listed home delivery service <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">Ocado</url> (OCDO) and healthcare companies. Its largest holding is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">LendingTree</url> (US:TREE), an online lending platform in the US. </p><p>The fund had 22 per cent of its assets in technology shares at the end of June. </p><p>Baillie Gifford Global Discovery has beaten its benchmark, the S&amp;P Global Small Cap index over one, three and five years.</p><p>For exposure to tech stocks via a potentially less volatile fund, options include <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">Artemis Global Select</url> (GB00B568S201), which had 21 per cent of it assets in this sector as of 28 June. Its largest holdings include Microsoft. But this fund can also have up to 20 per cent of its assets in cash to help reduce capital loss when markets fall. </p><p>The fund has been managed by Simon Edelsten, Alex Illingworth and Rosanna Burcheri since 2011. They aim for growth by investing in what they consider to be high-quality stocks, so look for companies with strong market positions and balance sheets, and sustainable pricing power. They focus on companies that have the strength and financial resources for long-term growth, regardless of the short-term economic environment or current share price. </p><p>They have a disciplined approach to valuation, so they only invest in shares when they believe the time and price are right. </p><p>If you want to invest in tech shares via a passive fund, Patrick Connolly, chartered financial planner at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">Chase de Vere</url>, suggests       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">L&amp;G Global Technology Index</url> (GB00B0CNhl3), a cheaper option with an ongoing charge of only 0.32 per cent. The fund tracks FTSE World Technology Index and its 10 biggest holdings include large blue-chips such as Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">Oracle</url> (US:ORCL). However, because it is a passive fund it does not offer the prospect of beating this index and in times of volatility, as are to be expected with tech stocks, it will mirror the falls in the index. </p><p>Active technology fund options include <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">Polar Capital Global Technology</url> (IE00B42W4J83), run by a nine-strong team led by Nick Evans and Mr Rogoff. \"They're very good, very experienced tech investors,\" says Mr Lowcock. \"And they've got a very disciplined process for stockpicking.\"</p><p>The fund's largest holdings include Alibaba and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ajbell.co.uk/&#34; title=&#34;\">Advanced Micro Devices</url> (US:AMD), an American multinational semiconductor company.  </p><p>The fund aims for long-term capital appreciation by investing in a globally diversified portfolio of technology companies. Its investment team identifies  growth trends and selects stocks within those trends. </p><p>The fund has performed very well beating MSCI AWCI Information Technology index over one, three, five and 10 years.</p><p>All of these funds should be held for at least five years and the two technology funds for longer to give you enough time to recover from any steep falls in their value.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"6\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"112\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Fund/benchmark</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1-year total return (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3-year cumulative total return (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">5-year cumulative total return (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">10-year cumulative total return (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">Ongoing charge (%)*</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Artemis Global Select</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">10.17</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">46.27</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">106.52</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">N/A</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0.91</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Baillie Gifford Global Discovery</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">8.45</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">77.78</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">148.51</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">513.38</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0.77</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">L&amp;G Global Technology Index Trust</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">10.6</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">78.89</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">173.15</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">436.83</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0.32</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Polar Capital Global Technology</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">19.62</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">106.98</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">235.11</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">615.28</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">1.16</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">FTSE All World Technology index</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">8.93</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">77.23</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">175.14</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">na</entry><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">MSCI AC World index</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">5.63</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">37.7</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">83.55</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">218.7</entry><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">MSCI ACWI Information Technology index</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">10.24</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">78.76</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">174.99</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">444.08</entry><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">S&amp;P Global Small Cap +2% index</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">-4.16</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">22.99</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">-30.83</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">-32.27</entry><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Investment Association Global sector average</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">5.92</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">38.68</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">74.5</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">181.63</entry><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Source: FE Analytics &amp;

As well as having become a huge part of the way we live and work, it has driven growth in sectors such as healthcare. And this trend looks set to continue for the foreseeable future. \"[Tech] stocks are growing faster than the broader market, so if you invest in them you're getting exposure to this growth and companies that are changing the world,\" says Ryan Hughes, head of active portfolios at broker AJ Bell.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Companies that have changed the way we live include Facebook (US:FB), Amazon (US:AMZN), Apple (US:AAPL), Netflix (US:NFLX) and Alphabet (US:GOOGL), the company that owns Google. These companies, which are known as the FAANGs, reported good earnings in the last quarter.</p><p>Amazon and Alphabet should continue to grow because they are leading research and development in cloud technology. This is the use of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage and process data rather than on a local server or personal computer. \"Cloud technology has barely penetrated the market so there is tremendous room to grow,\" says Ben Rogoff, manager of funds including Polar Capital Technology Trust (PCT). \"There are really only about five businesses in the world that can do this because it costs billions and is a question of scale. These companies are Amazon, Google, Microsoft (US:MSFT) and China's Tencent (Chi:700).\"</p><p>Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at Willis Owen, adds: \"As a society we're moving away from consuming things as a product to consuming them as a service instead. For example, we have moved from CDs to streaming services such as Spotify (US:SPOT).\"</p><p>Technology is changing sectors such as retail. For example, Amazon fulfilment, a way of getting inventory from the manufacturer directly to the customer, has driven ecommerce, which is still a massive growth trend. And through targeted advertising, Facebook and Instagram have potential as retailers, too. \"Thanks to their secular growth they are not dependent on market cycles,\" adds Mr Rogoff.</p><p>The rise in ecommerce has also helped propel the rise of fast, convenient and easy digital payment platforms such as PayPal (US:PYPL). \"Every time a dollar goes from being in the shop to online, the payment sector is growing,\" says Mr Rogoff.</p><p>Digital currency may also experience significant growth when Facebook launches its own cryptocurrency, Libra.</p><p>Over the much longer term, fund analysts and technology fund managers expect significant growth in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI), although it is still at a nascent stage. Healthcare and the automobile manufacturing sectors are likely to see the most change from the introduction of robotics and AI, which could improve processes and drive down costs. Much of the research and development in this area is being done in Japan.</p><p>Tech companies, meanwhile, could benefit from the US Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut of 0.25 per cent. \"Low interest rates can be good for tech because the growth rates that you see in tech continue to look very good compared with the rest of the market,\" explains Mr Lowcock. \"Large companies are not particularly indebted and lower interest rates can make it even easier to clear debt.\"</p><p>And an interest rate cut can make it easier for smaller companies to raise debt via corporate bonds.</p><p>There is also potential for an improvement in the income investors get from tech stocks. Last year, US president Donald Trump's onetime repatriation tax of 15.5 per cent on the profits businesses have accumulated overseas helped bring back huge amounts of cash, which over the long term could be used by companies to pay dividends. Apple, for example, had huge amounts of cash and has increased its dividend payments year on year by 13.33 per cent.</p><p>There are opportunities outside the US as well. China recently launched the Shanghai Stock Exchange STAR Market, a trading platform populated by regional tech stocks, formulated along the lines of the US Nasdaq market. China is also home to companies such as Alibaba (Chi:241), a multinational conglomerate specialising in ecommerce, retail and internet. Alibaba has also begun to expand into other areas such as food delivery by buying Ele.me, an online food delivery service, which could mean Alibaba's share price grows further.</p><p>Tech risks But the tech sector also faces significant macro risks, such as the uncertainty over how the trade war between the US and China is going to pan out. \"[A reason behind] the trade war is Mr Trump's desire to help protect American intellectual property in China,\" says Gary White, chief investment commentator at Charles Stanley. On 1 August, Mr Trump announced 10 per cent tariffs which will affect a further $300bn (\u00a3247bn) of Chinese goods. These tariffs are due to come into effect on 1 September.</p><p>Three days later, Beijing responded by allowing the renminbi currency to fall below Rmb7 to the dollar for the first time since the global financial crisis and getting stateowned companies to suspend imports of US agricultural products.</p><p>These actions hit equity markets so that on 5 August, the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.5 per cent and the S&amp;P 500 fell 3 per cent.</p><p>There are also concerns that the tariffs could affect supply chains. \"Semiconductor stocks, for example, have complex supply chains all over the world and Apple relies on these for the supply of iPhone parts,\" says Mr White.</p><p>Big tech companies in the US are under increased scrutiny. At the end of last month, the US Department of Justice announced a broad antitrust investigation into whether leading online platforms are unfairly restricting competition. \"This could increase overheads if they have to operate in a more heavily regulated environment than they have done until now,\" says Mr Hughes.</p><p>And Facebook has been fined $5bn because the US consumer protection agency, The Federal Trade Commission, discovered data privacy violations following the leak of up to 87m users' information through Facebook to Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>Another major risk is slowing global growth. Mr Hughes thinks that the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut indicates that there is a slowdown, but as it only cut US interest rates by 0.25 per cent it suggests that it is not expecting a recession imminently. \"However, we are in the longest period of expansion that we've seen, so I would say we're in the late end of the cycle,\" adds Mr Hughes.</p><p>Valuations of tech stocks also look high.</p><p>\"Despite what looks like a sharp fall, the tech market is only really back to where it was two or three months ago, so not much has changed,\" says Mr Hughes.</p><p>And the tech sector is more volatile than many other equity sectors because many companies in this area fail, and dominant players can be overthrown by disrupters.</p><p>The dominance of the FAANG stocks means that global growth funds and US equity funds - as well as technology funds - are likely to have exposure to them. This means that if you add a technology fund to your portfolio you could unintentionally have more exposure to these companies than you intended. To avoid this, before you invest in a fund check what holdings it has. You can see what a fund's 10 largest holdings are on its monthly fact sheet or on data websites such as <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.morningstar.co.uk\">www.morningstar.co.uk</url>.</p><p>Mr Hughes also suggests investors understand a manager's investment style to get an idea of what the fund they run might typically invest in.</p><p>Mr Hughes says that investors with less investment knowledge and who do not have a very high-risk appetite should get exposure to technology shares via a global equities fund that invests across various sectors, so is potentially less volatile than a tech fund. Investors with more knowledge and a higher risk appetite could consider a US equities fund [read more on these in the big theme of the 26 July issue].</p><p>Investors with a high risk appetite and long-term investment horizon could consider a technology fund. However, Mr Lowcock suggests that no investor allocate more than 2 to 3 per cent of their portfolio to technology funds, so that their overall portfolio, which is also likely to include global and US funds, would have at most an allocation of 5 per cent to 6 per cent to technology shares.</p><p>Fund for tech exposure Investors who want exposure to technology stocks but do not have a high enough risk appetite to invest in a technology fund could consider Baillie Gifford Global Discovery (GB0006059330). This fund aims for growth over the long term, and is managed by Douglas Brodie, and deputy managers Svetlana Viteva and Luke Ward. They invest the fund in companies with significant growth prospects, in particular those in industries with the potential for structural change and innovation.</p><p>However, this fund is by no means low risk as its managers say their holdings could have a wide range of potential outcomes and it has a bias to smaller companies. \"It is at the risky growth end of the market, but is one way to get exposure to some of the trends going on,\" says Mr Lowcock.</p><p>'The tech sector is more volatile than many other equity sectors because many companies in this area fail, and dominant players can be overthrown by disrupters' The fund's managers aim for the fund to be diverse and get exposure to technology via companies that are not necessarily in the tech sector, such as UK-listed home delivery service Ocado (OCDO) and healthcare companies. Its largest holding is LendingTree (US:TREE), an online lending platform in the US.</p><p>The fund had 22 per cent of its assets in technology shares at the end of June.</p><p>Baillie Gifford Global Discovery has beaten its benchmark, the S&amp;P Global Small Cap index over one, three and five years.</p><p>For exposure to tech stocks via a potentially less volatile fund, options include Artemis Global Select (GB00B568S201), which had 21 per cent of it assets in this sector as of 28 June. Its largest holdings include Microsoft. But this fund can also have up to 20 per cent of its assets in cash to help reduce capital loss when markets fall.</p><p>The fund has been managed by Simon Edelsten, Alex Illingworth and Rosanna Burcheri since 2011. They aim for growth by investing in what they consider to be high-quality stocks, so look for companies with strong market positions and balance sheets, and sustainable pricing power. They focus on companies that have the strength and financial resources for longterm growth, regardless of the short-term economic environment or share price.</p><p>They have a disciplined approach to valuation, so they only invest in shares when they believe the time and price are right.</p><p>If you want to invest in tech shares via a passive fund, Patrick Connolly, chartered financial planner at Chase de Vere, suggests L&amp;G Global Technology Index (GB00B0CNH163), a cheaper option with an ongoing charge of only 0.32 per cent. The fund tracks FTSE World Technology Index and its 10 biggest holdings include large blue-chips such as Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Oracle (US:ORCL). However, because it is a passive fund it does not offer the prospect of beating this index and in times of volatility, as are to be expected with tech stocks, it will mirror the falls in the index.</p><p>Active technology fund options include Polar Capital Global Technology (IE00B42W4J83), run by a nine-strong team led by Nick Evans and Mr Rogoff. \"They're very good, very experienced tech investors,\" says Mr Lowcock. \"And they've got a very disciplined process for stockpicking.\"</p><p>The fund's largest holdings include Alibaba and Advanced Micro Devices (US:AMD), an American multinational semiconductor company.</p><p>The fund aims for long-term capital appreciation by investing in a globally diversified portfolio of technology companies. Its investment team identifies growth trends and selects stocks within those trends.</p><p>The fund has performed very well, beating MSCI AWCI Information Technology index over one, three, five and 10 years.</p><p>All of these funds should be held for at least five years and the two technology funds for longer to give you enough time to recover from any steep falls in their value.</p><p>Fund performance Fund/benchmark 1-year total return (%) Artemis Global Select 10.17 Baillie Gifford Global Discovery 8.45 L&amp;G Global Technology Index Trust 10.6 Polar Capital Global Technology 19.62 FTSE All World Technology index 8.93 MSCI AC World index 5.63 MSCI ACWI Information Technology index 10.24 S&amp;P Global Small Cap +2% index -4.16 Investment Association Global sector average 5.92 Source: FE Analytics, * Morningstar.

The mayor pointed to the north, where a five-story building with red trim is being constructed -- a future home for HBO's West Coast headquarters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To the southwest, the historic Culver Studios -- home to such movie productions as \"Gone With the Wind\" and \"Citizen Kane\" -- has been transformed by Amazon Studios since it started leasing space there in 2017. \"All of it is Amazon,\" she said, scanning construction several blocks away.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Let's face it. We're kind of hot right now,\" Sahli-Wells said. \"There are a lot of major companies that are locating in Culver City. Especially as we welcome some of the wealthiest corporations on the planet, it would be appropriate to ensure that all businesses are paying their fair share.\"</p><p>Culver City has become one of the fastest-growing digital media hubs in Southern California as Amazon, Apple, China-owned TikTok and other firms have expanded into the area, drawn to its location and movie history. The influx has brought thousands of new jobs to the city but also caused some growing pains. Now, Culver City officials are considering a tactic that Silicon Valley cities have pursued: raising business taxes to help manage the inevitable costs of growth.</p><p>If history is any guide, such a move could create tensions between the city and the towering tech giants reshaping it. Amazon and Apple have occasionally clashed with cities in other areas over proposed tax hikes or policies deemed unfriendly to their interests.</p><p>Colin Diaz, president of the Culver City Chamber of Commerce, said his members, which include Amazon and Apple, are \"open to discussion,\" but warned that some businesses may be forced to move.</p><p>\"It will definitely cause businesses to leave,\" Diaz said. \"There would be a noticeable impact.\"</p><p>Under the current tax, many businesses pay 0.1% to 0.3% of their gross receipts (depending on the industry type), while some companies pay a flat fee.</p><p>Discussions are in the early stages, however, and any increase would have to be approved by a majority of the council and by residents in a ballot measure.</p><p>The city hasn't updated the tax since 1965 and has generated significantly less revenue than L.A., Beverly Hills and Santa Monica. A city committee has weighed various models for increasing business tax revenue, including one that would raise as much as $33 million annually, up from $12 million, according to a presentation obtained by The Times . That hike, if implemented, would put Culver City's rates in line with those of Santa Monica. On Wednesday night, a tax advisory group proposed a nearly $10-million increase.</p><p>Culver City's leaders say the extra money is necessary because the city faces a projected $3-million operating deficit in its general fund starting in fiscal year 2023, mainly because of rising pension costs. By fiscal year 2029, that deficit is expected to grow to $6.8 million.</p><p>The financial crunch comes as the city must boost its housing supply to meet state guidelines. The city will need to accommodate 3,300 new homes over the next nine years. But that may not be enough to handle a population influx from more than 7,300 new jobs the city expects to bring in by 2022.</p><p>TikTok says it could grow to about 1,000 people. Amazon's staff is estimated to be 2,400 during 2021; HBO is expected to have 750 employees, and Apple will employ about 1,595 once construction of its new building is completed, according to Culver City estimates .</p><p>\"The real concern for Culver City, in this case, is that in many ways they've authorized these mixed-use developments ... without really understanding the bigger impact it would have on the city and the limits to the capacity of the train station, so now they're in this trap,\" said Kevin Klowden, executive director for the Milken Institute's Center for Regional Economics and California Center.</p><p>Similar pressures have flared up in Seattle and Silicon Valley, where rapid growth by technology companies has prompted cities to consider raising taxes to help pay for the growing demand on services.</p><p>While tech companies have been blamed for the surge in high-paying jobs that have driven up rents, cities have also been criticized for not prioritizing enough housing. In the San Francisco Bay Area, home prices and apartment rents have soared to the highest in the country, forcing some to live in their cars or park RVs on city streets.</p><p>\"We've gleaned lessons from big tech companies in other cities, and we want to make sure that we're learning those lessons and we're moving forward in a positive and a productive way,\" Sahli-Wells said.</p><p>In 2018, residents of Google's hometown, Mountain View, passed a measure to dramatically increase the city's typical $30 business license fee. The new fee, which is being phased in, would charge more for larger businesses based on employee headcount. For Google, the city's largest employer with more than 25,400 workers, that will mean paying $3.6 million starting in 2022, money that the city says will go toward its transportation projects.</p><p>\"Mountain View has been blessed and cursed with the rapid growth of employment,\" said Lenny Siegel, Mountain View's former mayor, who led the effort to increase the fee. \"We really can't handle much more employees given our housing and transportation situation. We already have too much.\"</p><p>In recent years, large tech companies have pushed back on cities taxing them more based on the number of employees. In 2018, Amazon voiced its disapproval on a headcount tax in Seattle, suspending its plans to build an office tower until after the City Council's vote. The council ended up approving the tax, only to repeal it shortly afterward.</p><p>In Apple's hometown of Cupertino, city leaders in 2016 and 2018 explored a headcount tax only to have those efforts squashed by fierce opposition from business groups backed by Apple. Both Apple and Google have supported plans to address the Bay Area's housing crisis.</p><p>\"It's not our taxes or regulation that is a threat to the companies but their own growth,\" said Siegel, who grew up in Culver City. \"The companies are responsible for helping the community handle their growth.\"</p><p>Culver City has a storied history in moviemaking. Its founder, Harry Culver, encouraged filmmaker Thomas Ince to move his studio from the beach to Culver City, which was incorporated in 1917. The city became known as \"the Heart of Screenland,\" where movies such as \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" and \"The Wizard of Oz\" were filmed.</p><p>Today, it is home to Sony Pictures Entertainment, the city's largest employer with about 3,500 workers. But the city became more of a hub for streaming services when Amazon Studios moved into the historic Culver Studios in 2017, with plans to lease 530,000 square feet of the campus. Amazon also rents 75,000 square feet at the Culver Steps across the street.</p><p>The company was drawn to Culver City's long history and legacy of moviemaking, said Albert Cheng, Amazon Studios' chief operating officer.</p><p>\"Having our home here in Culver Studios represents what we see as our investment in this space, which is honoring (and building on) the legacy of the amazing history of what the studio has, (with) over 100 years of movie and television production ... and creating a foundation on which we can take the industry to the future,\" Cheng said.</p><p>Other factors included the city's central location, making it easier for employees to access, as well as its proximity to the airport and Amazon Studios partners, such as agencies in Beverly Hills, Cheng said.</p><p>Cheng declined to comment on the city exploring an increase in the business tax. \"The City Council will do what it's going to do,\" he said.</p><p>Apple expanded to Culver City with the 2014 purchase of streaming music firm Beats, which already had an office there. Since then, Apple has leased space at One Culver and the Hayden Tract; it will eventually expand into a new office on Washington Boulevard.</p><p>Next year, HBO's West Coast office will move from Santa Monica to Culver City's Ivy Station, inside a 240,000-square-foot space.</p><p>HBO, Apple, TikTok and Sony declined to comment for this article.</p><p>The influx of Apple, Amazon, and other tech and media companies has been a boon to local restaurants and other small businesses.</p><p>Adam Guttentag, owner of Harajuku Taproom, said his pub on Sepulveda Boulevard has seen a roughly 20% increase in sales over last year, with more companies contacting him for holiday parties and happy hours. He declined to disclose sales figures.</p><p>\"Overall, the development is a positive thing,\" Guttentag said. \"(It's) a lot of good jobs, people with good disposable income. Those are people who enjoy fun dining experiences, and those are all good customers for us.\"</p><p>But the demand for office space from tech and media companies has driven up rents in Culver City at a faster pace than the rest of the L.A. metro market. Since the fourth quarter of 2010, rents for office space have increased 56% in Culver City, compared with 45% for L.A. County during the same period, according to CoStar Group, which tracks real estate trends.</p><p>Rising rents could make it harder for small businesses to absorb an increase in business taxes, forcing some to lay off workers or leave the area, said Diaz of the Culver City Chamber, which has representatives from Apple and Amazon on its board.</p><p>He said city businesses already contribute heavily to the city's general fund.</p><p>\"We're not against the conversation of looking at a business license tax increase,\" Diaz said. \"We also would want there to be some restraint as far as spending.\"</p><p>Ryan Patap, director of market analytics for CoStar Group, doesn't think an increase in Culver City's business tax will turn away large employers, because they want to be closer to where the talent is.</p><p>\"It doesn't seem to me that it would upend fundamentals and change people's decision-making,\" Patap said.</p><p>Sahli-Wells hasn't said how much she wants to see the tax raised. That amount could depend on whether residents support a March ballot measure that extends a 0.5% sales tax until 2033.</p><p>\"It's a moment of growth -- that's what is happening right now,\" Sahli-Wells said. \"I don't know how long it is going to last. I just want to make sure it goes smoothly.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: MEGHAN SAHLI-WELLS, mayor of Culver City, wants the city to increase its business taxes to improve housing and transit as tech companies create jobs.

Apple, Fa...</p><p>Sushma Ramachandran      Senior Financial Journalist     The chief executives of the world\u2019s four most powerful tech companies were grilled recently by the US lawmakers on a wide range of issues, ranging from competition to alleged theft of data by China. Apple, Facebook, Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet and Amazon had to face a barrage of questions that could ultimately decide the future course of monopoly laws in the US. Simultaneously, Australia has laid down regulations to ensure that tech giants will have to pay for the use of news from media outlets. Both developments are of immense relevance in India as these same companies dominate the digital arena here.    Even as Big Tech is facing potential curbs, these entities are also seeing a huge surge in growth and profitability \u2014 at a time when the global economy is facing severe disruptions owing to the pandemic.    Amazon\u2019s profits, for instance, rose by 40 per cent in the April-June quarter. Over the same period, Facebook\u2019s profits spiked by an unreal 98 per cent, while Apple recorded a 12 per cent growth. Alphabet was relatively a laggard with three per cent profit, but revenue increased by 13 per cent.    In contrast, the world economy is set to contract by as much as five per cent during 2020. The divergence is because the consumption of online content has risen exponentially while the overall demand for other products has fallen precipitously.    Amazon has benefited not just from its Prime Video content but also from the ease of online deliveries at a time when buying from brick and mortar retail outlets has slowed down. Other streaming and OTT platforms have also got a boost globally and in this country.    This has altered the established advertising-cum-subscription model, with ad revenues dipping and subscribers rapidly growing. Some media reports say subscribers have risen by as much as 60 per cent ever since the pandemic began.    The top player in the Indian market currently is the Disney-Hotstar brand with an estimated eight million subscribers followed by Amazon Prime, SonyLiv, Netflix and Voot as well as a host of others.    The other gainers in the digital space are gaming apps which have seen an enormous growth during the lockdown period. Fantasy sports apps are expected to see a spurt as soon as the IPL is revived. The digital arena, thus, continues to thrive at a time when the global Covid outbreak has threatened the very existence of traditional businesses.    A parallel occurrence to the growth of tech giants has been a widening of the digital divide in this country. This has followed a shift to online education after the schools closed down all over the country since the lockdown was imposed at the end of March.    Children with access to devices like smartphones, tablets, computers or even televisions, have been able to utilise the new mode of teaching.    Others, including the urban poor and those in rural areas, have simply been left rudderless without any teaching facilities for months on end now.    Tragic stories have surfaced of children and even parents committing suicide because they could not afford to buy smartphones. Voluntary organisations and individuals have begun drives to provide computers and televisions to children in many parts of the country.    An initiative has even been launched to provide used devices to the needy students. The fact is that this is just not enough to cover the millions of children who need to use online education. Official data says there are over 35 crore students in the country, but no data is available to show how many have access to digital devices or the Internet.    A study done by an NGO of over 40,000 children, covering 23 states in April, found that about 56 per cent children did not have smartphones. Apart from the devices, the other issue was connectivity problems with the Internet.    The Kerala government has tried to overcome this problem by offering classes on television. But this approach has a lacuna as there is no possibility of an interaction with the students.    With online education likely to remain a reality for some more time, it is time to adopt innovative solutions to ensure that millions of children do not lag behind their more affluent peers. One way could be to copy the model of universal healthcare and adopt the slogan of universal smartphones for schoolchildren.    Indigenously made smartphones or tablets could be mass produced and provided to all students of government schools. This would not only provide students with the much-needed devices, but also give a fillip to indigenous smartphone production, a cause close to this government\u2019s heart.    But this could take a while and fail to solve the immediate crisis facing the country\u2019s students. Another option could be to open the schools gradually, keeping social distancing norms in place.    And finally, the third and most attractive option could be to tap the deep pockets of the tech giants that are raking in profits right now    during the pandemic. Let them use their enormous resources to provide tech-based solutions to the millions of underprivileged children who cannot access any form of education right now. The fact is, unless the digital divide is bridged, there will be a long-term, adverse impact on these young students. The prosperity of the tech giants is growing owing to their access to the Indian market.    It is thus entirely in the fitness of things that they join hands with policymakers here to provide a concrete solution to the digital divide at this critical juncture.    The government needs to open a dialogue with Big Tech companies and try to solve this problem with their help.

Andreas Mundt is Germany's top antitrust official.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LONDON - Germany's top antitrust enforcer recently asked a room full of lawyers, academics and regulators to imagine a wall filled with their personal information collected by Facebook and Google. He told them to picture it stocked with their data broken up into categories such as finances, location, relationships and hobbies. \"That is you,\" Andres Mundt said. \"And I promise you this wall knows you better than your wife.\" </p><p>Few listened to Mundt when, a few years ago, he began raising alarms about the data collected by the tech giants. But in February, his agency ruled that Facebook had broken the country's law and demanded that the company stop automatically sharing data among the services it owns, such as Instagram and WhatsApp, or websites that use its \"like\" and \"share\" buttons. It was the first such ruling in Europe, putting in practice ideas that had never fully escaped academic and think tank debates. As U.S. regulators and lawmakers intensify their scrutiny of Big Tech, there is a lot of discussion about whether or how they could accuse the companies of violating antitrust law. Often, regulators look to whether a company is causing consumer harm - a standard that can be hard to prove when a service is free. The response from Mundt is simple. The only way to take on Facebook and some of its peers is to attack what they value most: data. He argues that the companies are so dominant in their core businesses that consumers, if they want to search the internet or be on social media, have no choice but to share their personal data. The data then strengthens the tech companies' position over rivals even more - and therefore is anticompetitive, Mundt said. After the Facebook ruling, Mundt received calls from regulators and lawyers around the world to discuss the idea. He helped organize a meeting of fellow antitrust officials in Colombia, where they spent four days discussing tech regulation. Joseph Simons, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, and Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Department antitrust division, were among those attending. \"The German authority is way out in front here and in a real sense the leading antitrust authority in the world with respect to these technology issues,\" said Thomas Vinje, partner at the Clifford Chance law firm in Brussels and a veteran of tech industry antitrust battles involving Microsoft and Google. Online platforms constantly collect data on users: what is clicked on, how fast a person scrolls past a post, what video a person stops to watch. The information helps a company such as Facebook infer characteristics about interests, personal connections and financial demographics to better target advertising, or train machine-learning algorithms that can be used for future products. It is an extraordinarily lucrative business model. Facebook made $55 billion from advertising last year, while Google's ad sales totaled $116 billion. What's distressing to regulators is the lack of new competitors, a trend Mundt attributes to a company's access to data and plentiful financial resources. He said Facebook controls more than 95 percent of the social networking market in Germany. Without competition, the network unfairly forces people to make an all-or-nothing choice between agreeing to unlimited data collection or not using Facebook at all. Mundt contends that Facebook and other tech giants don't need to be broken up, as Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others have suggested. Instead, he thinks governments should limit their ability to collect data. The approach can have an effect similar to a breakup by isolating a company's different services. \"The business model is to gather and process data, full stop. There is nothing else,\" Mundt said. \"If they don't have data, they can have 10,000 very intelligent engineers who tell you what you can make out of data, but without the data you don't make anything.\" Facebook is appealing the German decision, arguing that it was transparent with users about how data is collected. The social network argues that its use of data helps improve the service and that German regulators singled it out for practices common across the internet.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN68776782</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHY-4PW1-JC8S-D4VB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"695\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

There is a possibility in a little bit we could be hearing from individual participants, maybe the president a little bit later in the dinner.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the pool spray that they like to call it of the room is done. And, of course, the feast is on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the feast was on at the corner of Wall and Broad? See what I did there. The feast was on the corner of Wall and Broad.</p><p>Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto.</p><p>So let's talk about stocks. Let's talk about the president, because what's going on over here is something that was really reflective of what was going on over there, partly, the president not backing down on his trade fight with Mexico now, amid tensions that are still high with China.</p><p>But those two were linked by the Federal Reserve, and the chairman, Jerome Powell, saying that the Central Bank is prepared to act to protect the economy if, in fact, things get much worse on the trade front, in other words, if things slow down.</p><p>The markets immediately pounced on that as a sign that the Fed has the president's back and has our back just in case things slip, slide away on the trade front, the Dow up about 511 points today. The Nasdaq, which had entered a correction territory, down about 10 percent, or a little bit more from its highs, coming back today.</p><p>We have got a lot going on here. We have got FOX team coverage with John Roberts in London, where the president is not letting Mexico off the hook. We have also got FOX Business Network's Susan Li on a Fed chief who doesn't want to be on the hook.</p><p>We begin with John.</p><p>Hey, John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Hey. Good evening to you, Neil.</p><p>The stock market didn't seem to care a whole lot about what the president said regarding Mexico. We should point out that one of the guests at that dinner at the ambassador's residence at Winfield House has got an early flight tomorrow morning.</p><p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be leaving it first light head back to the United States because he will be leading negotiations with the Mexican delegation in Washington, D.C., to see if they will do something, if they're willing to do something more to stop Central American migrants from moving through Mexico toward the U.S. border.</p><p>The president today, seemingly unimpressed with recent Mexican claims that they have stepped up apprehensions and deportations of Central American migrants who are in Mexico illegally, the president suggesting that those tariffs that are scheduled to go into effect on Monday at 5 percent are going to go into effect.</p><p>And the president also dismissing some talk about some Republicans in Congress that they may move to block those tariffs before they go into effect. Listen to what the president said earlier today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't think they will do that. I think, if they do, it's foolish. There's nothing more important than borders. I have had tremendous Republican support.</p><p>And, as you know, Mexico called. They want to meet. They're going to meet on Wednesday. Secretary Pompeo is going to be at the meeting, along with a few others that are very good at this. And we are going to see if we can do something. But I think it's more likely that the tariffs go on. And we will probably be talking during the time that the tariffs are on and they're going to be paid.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: You know, one of the big issues that was going on in talks between the United States and Britain, particularly this morning, when the president was sitting down with Theresa May, was Britain's plans to use Huawei equipment made in China as part of its new 5G system.</p><p>Originally, Britain wanted to use Huawei equipment in its 5G core, because basically they're selling it for pennies on the dollar against equipment from other countries. And there's a reason for that, many American officials believe, because China wants to get into the core of the new 5G systems because everything that flows through there can be sucked out and sent back to China.</p><p>So I'm told by national security officials that they have convinced Britain not to use Huawei in the core. But Britain, not wanting to really upset China, still wanted to use some Huawei equipment. But the president suggesting at the press conference with Theresa May earlier today that they do have an agreement on Huawei, though he wouldn't say exactly what it was.</p><p>Listen here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We're going to have absolutely an agreement on Huawei and everything else. We have an incredible intelligence relationship and we will be able to work out any differences. I think we're not going to have -- but we did discuss it. I see absolutely no limitations. We have never had limitations.</p><p>This is a truly great ally and partner, and we will have no problem with that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: And British officials suggest that there is some sort of an agreement. They didn't want to talk to us about the details before it goes to Parliament.</p><p>But the president was suggesting that, if the Britain was to use 5G equipment from Huawei in their systems, that that might kind of upset the apple cart in terms of intelligence-sharing with the United States. And that's clearly something that Britain doesn't want to broach -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, John Roberts traveling with the president in London right now.</p><p>Now, you might hear this back and forth on trade, and now the issues with the Mexicans and the Chinese and the slowdown that could follow. Well, why would start to rise in that environment? Precisely because the Federal Reserve said it has everybody's back in case that does happen.</p><p>To Susan Li on that.</p><p>Hey, Susan.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, you're exactly right, Neil, so the Federal Reserve providing cover today, telling the markets if trade wars hurt economic growth, we can adjust and cut interest rates, and that sent the stock market into rally mode.</p><p>Wall Street pricing in a near certainty that interest rates will be cut this year. That's close to 100 percent, the probability sitting at 97 percent. Big tech names were the main drags yesterday on concerns they will be broken up or at least investigated over antitrust concerns, coming back today, so recovery for Amazon, Google, parent to Alphabet, as well as, as you see, Apple, Netflix and Microsoft.</p><p>And when these heavyweight stocks move, they tend to take the broader markets along with them. Now, we do have the Mexican foreign minister, along with the Mexican economic minister, in Washington, D.C., right now. They are meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, but the Mexican side have threatened to retaliate if President Trump does go through with these tariffs on all Mexican goods that come into the U.S.</p><p>And President Trump did say this morning in that London press conference that tariffs will likely go up. Now, will that impact the U.S. economy? That really depends on how long tariffs stay on and how high they eventually get -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Susan, thank you very, very much.</p><p>With the Dow surge today, about 512.5 points, that is the best performance of the year for the Dow on this, after getting just clubbed on concerns about trade.</p><p>So what are we really looking at here?</p><p>Let's get the read from George Seay of Annandale Capital. He's the CEO there. We have also got Jackie DeAngelis with us, of course, FOX Business Network.</p><p>Jackie, a weird reaction, and then you can understand, yes, if rates come down, that will weather this. But obviously the Fed is prepared for something.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, the Fed changed the game today, Neil, I mean, basically coming out and telling President Trump that he's got their back and that a rate cut is definitely in the cards.</p><p>And that's something that investors wanted to hear. They thought it was on the table, but they didn't get the confidence or the language from the Fed that they wanted to hear. Today, that's what they got. So nothing's changed in terms of trade. In fact, the president said, come Monday, those 5 percent tariffs on Mexico will probably go into place.</p><p>That's what he told us today. But the market feels more confident that there's support for economic growth and that Jerome Powell is going to step up and do the right thing.</p><p>He made two mistakes. Basically, there was a communication mistake at the end of last year. He corrected that. Correcting the policy mistake, as the market sees it, would be implementing a cut.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>You know, the president criticized the rate hikes, as you know, George, saying that they were a little bit more than was needed. The latest talk is that maybe we could unwind two of the 10 rate hikes we have seen since this tightening cycle started with the former Federal Reserve chief beforehand.</p><p>Now I'm wondering where this goes, because you could also interpret from that the Fed is worried.</p><p>GEORGE SEAY, ANNANDALE CAPITAL: The Fed has to cut. The Fed went a bridge too far in December, and they have got to roll it back.</p><p>The problem is, Powell stuck his foot in his mouth so many times, that he's going to play the Chinese save face and spread it out a little bit before he starts cutting again. But the economy needs it. The 10-year has already told you he's going to cut because it's dropped about 80 basis points in a matter of months.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right. You're talking to a popular trading note that sort of telegraphs how mortgage rates are going to be. So that could be a good underpinning here, right?</p><p>SEAY: Absolutely. There's no alternative to stocks in the public markets. Bonds are no alternative.</p><p>CAVUTO: On the trade front, we're getting talk -- and you kind of touched on it -- that the U.S. and Mexico are looking to hold talks on this very issue, the better than $300 billion worth of Mexican imports that come in, on which we're going to put a 5 percent tariff anyway.</p><p>They're going to be chaired by the vice president, Jackie, on Wednesday.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Mm-hmm.</p><p>CAVUTO: So how does this all sort out?</p><p>DEANGELIS: Well, a lot of folks, at least market watchers, are saying, basically, they think the Mexicans have come here to make some sort of a deal, that they are willing and open. They don't necessarily want to see these tariffs go into place, even if the 5 percent does.</p><p>Remember, President Trump threatened that it could be 25 percent by October. So the feeling is that the Mexicans have come to the negotiating table. They are ready, willing and able, much more so, for example, than China.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we forget that a lot of these increases that we would likely see with the tariffs on Mexico would be immediate. In other words, they literally go from country to table in this case or grocery store.</p><p>So we would feel that 5 percent hike, but we would start feeling it more got to be more of a hike, right?</p><p>SEAY: Absolutely.</p><p>And we in Texas are very fond of trade with Mexico. And I thought we learned from the Germans in World War II you don't find a two-front war at one time. So I would like to see us get the Mexican distraction off the table as soon as possible and pivot to China, which is the real problem.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you worry, though, that it also could jeopardize the -- just how we go about future trade relations? We already have a deal with the Mexicans and the Canadians.</p><p>It was something that Rob Portman, the senator from Ohio, was concerned about when I talked to him earlier. I don't know if we have that. But he is -- he's worried. He's worried.</p><p>Take a look.</p><p>No, I apologize.</p><p>So, one of the things he had raised was this notion that you are jeopardizing a deal you fought hard to get. And now he's worried that this could leave some pretty muddy waters.</p><p>Do you agree?</p><p>SEAY: Well, the president's fearless, but he's also reckless and ad hoc. And that's a dangerous way to go about your business.</p><p>And I think that's what Senator Portman is getting it. And I think we need to tighten up the process a little more and be a little more methodical about how we lay out U.S. policy. It's a little bit too reflexive and knee-jerk.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>What do you mean -- Jackie, I was looking at a lot of U.S. companies that were concerned about China moved their operations to Mexico. Guadalajara was a popular location. And the irony now is that they're stuck behind the eight ball again.</p><p>DEANGELIS: It is. It is an irony.</p><p>And the market basically looked at this and said we had made progress with USMCA, and now we're talking about another tariff here that's not related to trade, per se, but it's related to the border. And it's related to immigration.</p><p>Let me give you an example, Neil. If the tariffs on Mexico went up to 25 percent by October, and you still had the 25 percent tariffs on China in place, for automakers, they're going to suffer as result of this because they're bring in the steel and the aluminum.</p><p>So a car that's made here, for example, could be almost $2,000 higher. A car that's imported from one of those places could be almost $5,000 higher. So there's going to be an impact on the consumer, on American companies. Somebody is going to have to figure out who's going to absorb it or how they're going to pass it along.</p><p>But, again, with Powell stepping up today, the market sort of took a sigh of relief. I will just add one final point, that we have seen the pendulum swing here, so I need to see more than one day of a rally to believe that everybody's comfortable with this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>Yes, we forgot the prior snapshots there.</p><p>Guys, I want to thank you both very, very much.</p><p>All right, you have Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple all being targeted right now by the United States government in one way, shape, or form. At first, when I heard about this, I thought it was the Europeans pouncing on these guys. It is us pouncing on these guys -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, if you think about it, they are some of the biggest names in technology. And right now, in Washington, D.C., they're all targets.</p><p>I'm talking about Google and Amazon, Facebook and Apple, which, for various reasons, have the attention of the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission, on everything from privacy violations to simply getting too big for their britches.</p><p>But is there a legal case to be made for breaking them up, or, worse, really, really breaking them up and giving them grief?</p><p>Judge Andrew Napolitano on all of that.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS JUDICIAL ANALYST: Well, it's very unusual, Neil, for the government to announce an investigation, an antitrust investigation, before it actually starts one.</p><p>Usually, it starts very quietly. It begins looking at public documents, and then it subpoenas documents behind the public documents. But, for some reason, this Justice Department, with a president -- a pro-business president, is doing something that even the Obama Justice Department never did, which is basically saying to those four tech giants, are you guys so big that you can't be trusted, and it's time for us, the government, to regulate you?</p><p>Now, what are they looking for? They're probably looking for predatory behavior. That is behavior that elbows out competition, so charging different price levels, punishing a customer because the customer also sells to somebody who doesn't sell through you.</p><p>All of that is potentially antitrust activity, providing -- that's the bottom line for all but one antitrust-type actions -- providing the consumer is hurt. So if there's predatory activity, if they're pricing themselves so low that their competition dies, but the consumer benefits from that by getting the same service at a lesser cost, the government...</p><p>CAVUTO: Right, or for free.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Correct. The government won't get involved.</p><p>The only time they don't have to prove that the consumer was harmed is price-fixing, if there's an actual agreement between them to fix prices. These four don't basically compete against each other. They're each in different fields.</p><p>So I don't think price-fixing is the goal here.</p><p>CAVUTO: But I'm old enough to remember when the government was going after Netscape, right?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Remember, you would separate your browser from your Internet product. Netscape is now long gone.</p><p>And it was market forces that made it go long gone, not scrutiny, government scrutiny.</p><p>And I'm just wondering if the markets can't correct whatever they're talking about. Or is the fear, they have got to address this because they will get so big for their britches, they can't be reined in?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Here's the -- here's the government's argument. I don't necessarily buy this, but here's the government's argument.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You are so big and so powerful, and you have so many customers, that the barriers to entry, the cost of competing with you is nearly impossible to amass. So nobody can effectively compete with you. Therefore, you...</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, that was the Amazon argument, right?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Correct. Correct.</p><p>CAVUTO: Retailers and others go out of business because you big-footed...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Correct. The argument...</p><p>CAVUTO: So, if the solution is then break it up, who determines that?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: A federal -- unless they agree to it, a federal judge.</p><p>I can't imagine that there would actually be a trial on this case. Normally, these cases end up with both sides claiming a victory. The Justice Department will get something. There will be a spinoff or something like that. And Amazon and Facebook and Google will say, see, they didn't touch us, we're still basically the same.</p><p>And guess who wins? This is for our buddy Stuart Varney. The lawyers win. You're talking about millions in legal fees over the course of many years of investigation.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, a lot of them have been working the Hill in the last year or so making sure they're funneling money to those in power to get their case known. They're going to be funneling some more, yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes. Yes.</p><p>I mean, it is surprising that a conservative Republican businessman, pro- business president, it is his Justice Department doing this. If we were talking about this three years ago, I wouldn't be surprised at all.</p><p>But I am surprised at this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I'm also surprised that they sent so many signals out before they started the investigation.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, that is weird.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: They like to catch people -- be careful -- unawares.</p><p>Everybody's aware.</p><p>CAVUTO: But you know, honestly, this, Judge. I know we have to go. But the breakup at AT&amp;T started under the Reagan administration Justice Department and the FTC.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes, it did. Yes, it did.</p><p>CAVUTO: Not that he had any direct role in it. But things can start under weird conditions.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You never know. And it spawned a revolution in telecommunications.</p><p>CAVUTO: Absolutely.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: That's not to say I'm in favor of the way it happened, but it did spawn that revolution.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right. That's a very good argument.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Those cell phones that used to be a brick in size and weight and cost $500, you now get it for free.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right. I'm too young to remember that. You keep telling me these stories.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Judge, thank you very, very much.</p><p>In the meantime, Hillary Clinton is warning 2020 Democrats they can lose the White House to hacking, that it could happen all over again.</p><p>Former DNC Chair Donna Brazile was saying that history could be repeating itself, but repeating what?</p><p>After this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Hillary Clinton would be president right now if it were not for Russia? It seems to be what she's implying, as the former first lady warns 2020 Democrats this week to be on the lookout for hacking yet again.</p><p>And it sure seems to be what the DNC Chair, now FOX News contributor Donna Brazile is saying. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CAVUTO: You had said that Russia is the reason Hillary Clinton isn't president. In other words, are you saying that Donald Trump is an illegitimate president?</p><p>DONNA BRAZILE, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I'm saying that Russia played a role in 2016.</p><p>And I say, while there are other factors that also led to Secretary Clinton fallen short of the 270 electoral votes, yes, I do believe that Russia was a major factor in the debacle in 2016.</p><p>CAVUTO: But you said Russia's the reason why she was denied the White House. Don't you think that that fuels an impression that, if not for Russia, Donald Trump would never have gotten to the White House?</p><p>BRAZILE: You know, before he deleted the tweet he put out about Russia's help, I do believe that the Russians sought to help Donald Trump and to defeat Hillary Clinton.</p><p>And there were other factors that led to Secretary Clinton not getting 270 electoral votes.</p><p>You know, Neil, here's what I push back on. I push back on those who don't believe that the interference caused havoc and created chaos and sowed discord. I push back on notion that a foreign country that sought to influence the election, they should have been reported.</p><p>I became chair of the Democratic Party for the second time in my life, interim chair, as a result of the hacking. And I think it's time that we put our Constitution, defend our democracy, ahead of partisan politics.</p><p>What are we going to do now?</p><p>CAVUTO: No, and I agree.</p><p>And we should both keep our eyes, both parties, on what happens in 2020 and whether the Russians try this again. They likely will.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRAZILE: Some other nation, Neil. Some other nation.</p><p>CAVUTO: No, but you're a powerful person in the Democratic Party as well. When you are all but saying, if not for Russia, Hillary Clinton would be in the White House, that addresses nothing about her lousy campaign or refusal to go to these big manufacturing states, right?</p><p>BRAZILE: Neil, can I say something?</p><p>CAVUTO: Sure.</p><p>BRAZILE: When I talk, I speak for myself. I don't need you to interpret or anyone else to interpret what I said.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: No, no, I'm quoting you. Donna, I'm quoting you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Donna, I'm quoting you. Russia is the reason Hillary Clinton isn't president.</p><p>BRAZILE: I do believe that Russia is one of the major factors why she's not in the White House. But there are other mitigating factors. And I said that as well.</p><p>Unfortunately, some people take the period and end, and not the comma, which I continued when I had that interview on Saturday.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. So you're saying now that, regardless of your concerns about Russia or anything, do you -- because I have talked to some Democrats on this show who do not think that Donald Trump is the legitimately elected president of the United States.</p><p>It's amazing to me after all this time, but do you believe that?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRAZILE: Neil, let me say something.</p><p>I have worked on a lot of campaigns. And I accept the fact that Donald Trump is the president of the United States. I'm not litigating what happened in 2016.</p><p>What I do believe is that, if we don't work today to protect our elections, we're going to have another repeat of 2016. And, yes, when a foreign country comes to help your campaign, you should report it, and not have more than 100 contacts with a hostile foreign nation just because you want to get the -- quote, unquote -- \"dirt.\"</p><p>Well, if you want dirt, go to Home Depot and Lowe's and buy it by the 40- pound bag that I do. But don't utilize that information to sow discord, create chaos and false political narratives, which I do believe hurt Hillary Clinton's ability to get her message out.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CAVUTO: But let's be clear.</p><p>Donna Brazile, like her a lot. That's fine. And she is a contributor here. That's great. She did say, if not for Russia, Hillary Clinton would be in the -- in the White House. And like I also said, many Democrats harbor that view that Donald Trump wasn't the duly elected, legitimate president of the United States.</p><p>They will not let go of this. It's time to debate this -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: If China is saying that it's willing to talk the United States and get back to the trade discussions, then why is it urging its citizens not to come to this country and spend their tourism dollars?</p><p>Something's up. What?</p><p>After this.</p><p>CAVUTO: That little chat got a lot of reaction from a lot of viewers.</p><p>One that I really liked concerning Donna Brazile and I talking about whether the president is the duly elected leader of this country, saying: \"Cavuto, you like the sound of your own voice, but face it. Donald Trump is not the duly elected president of the United States.\"</p><p>And the back and forth goes.</p><p>Let's get reaction from GOP strategist Noelle Nikpour. We got Catalina magazine publisher Cathy Areu, and last, but not least, Kat Timpf.</p><p>On the weekend, a lot of you have been always kind to help out with the \"Cavuto Live\" show on Saturday. And how many times have we had -- in your case, Cathy, a lot of times -- I will ask Democrats directly, do you think Donald Trump is the duly elected, legitimate president of the United States?</p><p>And with the exception I think of Eric Swalwell, who said, no, not really, I think, they bounce around it. What do you make of it?</p><p>KATHERINE TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think that whenever you're going through something tough, it's always easier to blame somebody else.</p><p>I think that people do that all the time in all areas of life. And I think we certainly saw Hillary Clinton do that and the Democrats do that. But there are so many other reasons that you could -- if you looked at yourself, why you would have lost that election.</p><p>Hillary was a terrible candidate, for example. People wanted to shake things up, for example. You can explain it so many ways, that I feel like blaming Russia is a cop-out. People use cop-outs all the time. So I'm not completely shocked by this. But it's a cop-out.</p><p>CAVUTO: The line was that Russia is the reason Hillary Clinton isn't president.</p><p>Cathy, do you think that's true?</p><p>CATHY AREU, PUBLISHER, CATALINA: Russia interfered with our elections. That was in the Mueller report.</p><p>CAVUTO: No doubt. No one has debated that.</p><p>AREU: No doubt.</p><p>CAVUTO: Did it change the outcome?</p><p>AREU: We will never know.</p><p>CAVUTO: Oh, for God's sakes. All right.</p><p>AREU: Three million more people voted for Hillary Clinton. That's a fact. We have the Electoral College. Donald Trump, President Trump, wasn't for the Electoral College.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: That's not my question.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: No, wait.</p><p>No matter how you feel about the president -- and God knows many of his fans are not fans of mine.</p><p>AREU: Our system elected him and made him president.</p><p>CAVUTO: The Electoral College. Did the Russians affect the Electoral College, yes or no?</p><p>AREU: The Electoral...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: See?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: This is me like blaming my weight on a thyroid issue. Stop it.</p><p>AREU: They interfered with our elections.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Noelle, what do you think?</p><p>NOELLE NIKPOUR, REPUBLICAN FUND-RAISER: I think we have two different Americas.</p><p>I think that we have an America that believes that the election was stolen. And I think that you have an America...</p><p>CAVUTO: And then never the two shall meet, right?</p><p>NIKPOUR: No. And I think you have an America that believes for once that their needs have been heard, meaning the working-class men and women, a lot of the union voters.</p><p>So I think that you have these two divisions, and they don't ever seem to be coming together. And I think that the narrative coming from the people that feel like the election was stolen are never going to get in and accept Trump.</p><p>CAVUTO: I just think that if you can't let go of this, and you're going to question the legitimacy of this president for forever long, no matter how you feel about him, that's not helping anyone, is it?</p><p>TIMPF: No, I think it's hurting actually. I think it's hurting because if you don't acknowledge your mistakes, you can never learn from them.</p><p>AREU: We're talking about President Trump acknowledging mistakes, a man who doesn't apologize acknowledging...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Cathy, you're going off-topic.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: No matter how you feel about him, you cannot just recognize him with his Electoral College vote win as the legitimate president of the United States.</p><p>AREU: He doesn't act presidential.</p><p>CAVUTO: That's -- for God's sakes!</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TIMPF: That's not what we're talking about. We're not asking, what do you think about his hair? We're not asking, what do you think about everything he said?</p><p>We're talking about this very specific issue. Was he or was he not elected...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AREU: Well, it's a divided country and the Russians interfered.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: OK. You just said that Hillary Clinton won by three million votes in the popular vote.</p><p>AREU: Right. Every vote counts. We're Americans, right?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Fine. Fine. Fine.</p><p>But our system is electoral vote, P.S., OK?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AREU: Yes. Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, if he won in the system that counted, the electoral vote -- we would all campaign differently if it was just based on popular vote -- can you at least acknowledge that the Russians didn't affect that electoral vote? Or do you think they did?</p><p>NIKPOUR: Yes, it was proven. It was proven.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Maybe she was a lousy campaigner. Maybe she should have gone to states...</p><p>AREU: Three million more people liked her.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: You never answer my question.</p><p>Maybe she should have gone to Pennsylvania more, should have gone to some of these other crucial battleground states more. And she didn't.</p><p>AREU: At the end of the day, more people wanted her to be president than the other guy.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: The system is the electoral vote.</p><p>AREU: That's America. Everyone believes that their vote counts.</p><p>CAVUTO: So let me ask. If it flipped around, all right, and Donald Trump loses the electoral vote, but wins the popular vote, and let's say he wins it by three million, would you say, way to go?</p><p>AREU: Yes, because...</p><p>CAVUTO: You would not!</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AREU: I absolutely would. I would.</p><p>CAVUTO: Stop it.</p><p>AREU: I would too.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Noelle.</p><p>AREU: And I stand by that. I stand by that.</p><p>NIKPOUR: Oh, my gosh.</p><p>I mean, you have got to look at how desperate Hillary was anyway. Bernie Sanders, look what the Democratic Party did within Bernie Sanders to disqualify him.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, you're going off-topic now.</p><p>What I'm saying -- see, fair and balanced off-topic.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: What I'm just saying is that it's two plus-years after this, people still pointing the fingers that this guy, if not for the Russians, he wouldn't be president, if not for the Russians, he would never have gotten there.</p><p>And he won fair and square. But I find it very hard.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AREU: He keeps talking about the darn election and reminding all of us.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: You're talking about it. You can't let go. He won it. And maybe you beat him this time in 2020.</p><p>AREU: Maybe he knows he stole it, and that's why he keeps bringing it up.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: He knows he stole it.</p><p>TIMPF: I won a spelling bee in the third grade, and I still bring that up, so sometimes wins mean a lot.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, that's actually a very good point.</p><p>TIMPF: I did win that spelling bee.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes. Yes.</p><p>AREU: I didn't win mine.</p><p>TIMPF: I know you did, girl.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: I think you all have issues that need addressing.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: But, seriously, guys, thank you very, very much. But I think we just got to move on here, folks. I mean, the more we go back in the past and say, oh -- it's time to move on.</p><p>We will have more to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX BAUCUS, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO CHINA: Joe knows that China is a real threat. Joe spent a lot of time in China and with Xi Jinping when he was vice president.</p><p>I might add that he knows more about China than most Americans do.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: But do you agree with that sentiment, that it's not competition?</p><p>BAUCUS: Oh, clearly, it's competition. There's no question it's competition.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: So, did he misspeak? Do you he think he just misspoke?</p><p>BAUCUS: He knows there's competition with China. That's not an issue.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Max Baucus is a close personal friend of the former vice president, Max Baucus, of course, our former ambassador to China.</p><p>He thinks that the vice president was just misunderstood, that essentially China, despite the vice president arguing at the time that it wasn't competition for us, it is competition for us, and Joe Biden knows it.</p><p>Anyway, I was confused, but I want to get the read from Gordon Chang, author of \"The Coming Collapse of China,\" other great reads, prescient reads, at that, on the threat that the China faces here.</p><p>I think that was the ambassador's way of sort of walking back or trying to walk back what could be one of the more significant verbal miscues from the former vice president, China's not competition for us. What did you make of that?</p><p>GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA\": Yes, that comment from Vice President Biden was completely indefensible, because, as Senator Baucus noted, China is competition.</p><p>One could say, look, we will prevail in this competition. One could say, we're better. But to say it's no competition at all is just clearly afactual. And I think that this is going to be an important issue.</p><p>People are talking about his son's investments in China and all the rest of it. Put that aside. That comment alone is going to be and one we're going to hear during the campaign if he ends up being the nominee.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, there's no doubt, looking just at the economic numbers, that just how all of a sudden it is has amassed to become the world's second largest economic power, and that it can control its economy to the degree it does, rig the trading system to the degree this president wants to address that, whether you agree with his approach or not.</p><p>But to say that it is not the competition? I don't know. I think that's something that, whether you like the former vice president or not, that it's going to come back to bite him. I mean, again and again, that's going to come up.</p><p>CHANG: Yes, China is a multifaceted challenge to us. It's across the board. It's military, diplomatic, ideological, technological.</p><p>And China's threat is actually existential, because just in the middle of last month, Neil, People's Daily, the most authoritative source in China, said, look, we're in a people's war with the United States. They branded us an enemy.</p><p>We have got to understand the consequences of that, because we Americans, we don't think very much of propaganda because we have a legitimate government. But when you have an illegitimate government, like China's, propaganda is absolutely critical.</p><p>CAVUTO: Let me ask you, then, about some of these other things that the Chinese are saying that don't jibe with things they're actually doing.</p><p>One is that they're ramping up their own chip industry, which seems to be bracing for the possibility they won't be dealing with ours, then that is warning citizens against traveling to the U.S. What do you make of all that?</p><p>CHANG: You know, this travel warning is irrational from an economic point of view. They're the smaller economy, and actually much smaller. They claim a $13.82 trillion economy last year. That's probably exaggerated.</p><p>We had about $20.5 trillion of gross domestic product last year. And, also, they are the far weaker economy because we are in reality growing faster than they are. And we're just not trade-dependent like they are. And for them to say that, that is just irrational, unless you view it in the context of political problems inside of Beijing, where that then starts to make sense.</p><p>And we need to start to understand what's going on with Xi Jinping, what's going on in the senior leadership, because it is looking really scary dangerous, when they say things like that really are not in China's interests.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we will see what happens.</p><p>Gordon Chang, \"The Coming Collapse of China\" and many, many other prescient reads on the threat that China proposes, competitive and otherwise, thank you, Gordon.</p><p>CHANG: Thanks, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: In the meantime, should the government be taking care of all of your college loans and responsibilities? There is a company way to fix this -- after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Universal public, technical school, community college and four-year college for every kid in America.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Free community college.</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Debt-free college.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We should make public colleges and universities tuition-free.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, it sounds good. You would have to foot the bill for that, of course, but there is sort of a private industry way to address this. And doesn't Wal-Mart know?</p><p>We got Scott Martin here, Wall Street watcher extraordinaire.</p><p>Scott, explain what Wal-Mart wants to do.</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT: It's an interesting one -- interesting one, Neil.</p><p>I think what I like about what they want to do vs. what we heard in the sound there was that there's actually an investment being made here in the worker, Neil, where they will help folks, kids especially at a high school, with SAT prep, and certainly college debt that they may incur, provided they work at Wal-Mart.</p><p>And instead of just, say, handing out $1,000, as Cory Booker has talked to, about every baby born in this country, or New Jersey, certainly, that needs to go to college, you actually have to do something to get that reward.</p><p>And you actually have to perform, let's say, in your job for Wal-Mart to help you out. So, therefore, there's a little bit more of a measurable, say, tangible return that one is to get, in Wal-Mart's case theirs, to get on this layout that they're going to give, vs., say, just giving folks money and saying, hey, do what you will with it.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, now, this dollar day plan -- and there are other features to it -- I mean, where they're going to pay $1 a day and something that goes forward to that, I mean, that's a long way to pay off what is $30,000 to $50,000 to $75,000 a year for tuition and room and board at some colleges.</p><p>But their approach is, start early and often, and we have got your back. It seems that they're bearing that and not the U.S. government.</p><p>MARTIN: Correct.</p><p>And I think what they also do, Neil, is, you have a kid or guy or gal in high school that starts out at Wal-Mart as, you know, an entry-level employee, minimum wage, which, as we know, the left, Bernie Sanders recently going after Wal-Mart about minimum wage changes needing to happen.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>MARTIN: But you start out as an entry-level employee, but you're getting some schooling along the way, you're getting some SAT test prep.</p><p>And so you're -- in theory, you're starting to improve your mental capacity. And, therefore, the theory is, as it's worked over the course of Wal-Mart's history, those folks rise up in the company, being Wal-Mart, the nation's largest employer, over a million-plus employees, 1.5 million.</p><p>So you have an ability that these kids, these entry-level employees with the school that you're going to help them pay for, will help -- help them rise up in the company and make more of themselves, provided that they stay at work there.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, I was reading somewhere -- I don't know if the figures are exact. So I will just say that with also $4 prescription drug plans and the like, Wal-Mart has done more to address medical and drug-related inflation than almost any company on the planet.</p><p>But, having said that, I'm not as pro- or anti-Wal-Mart, but there are private industry solutions to a lot of this that wouldn't rely on the U.S. government making it happen.</p><p>MARTIN: That's true.</p><p>And let's face it. As a publicly traded, shareholder-based employer, as Wal-Mart is, they look at the books. They actually have the X's and O's and profit and loss that they take into consideration when they have to do this, unlike the government, which I know is trying to help people and they're trying to do the right thing.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>MARTIN: But when you have the lender of the last resort, who is you and me and the folks at home, and the money keeps coming in no matter what, maybe you're not so careful with that money.</p><p>I guarantee you at Wal-Mart is, and that's why they're making the investments in their people, the prescription drug things that you mentioned, because they know that it's going to pay off and reward an investment return. And that's why I think this is an important development.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, it is an alternative.</p><p>Scott Martin, always good catching up with you, my friend. Thank you.</p><p>MARTIN: See you.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, you think the president is having problems with the Mexicans with the latest tariffs against Mexico he's proposing, you should see the grief he's getting from many in his own party.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ROB PORTMAN (R-OH): It looks like the statute that he's using to invoke these tariffs, which never have been used before for tariffs, by the way, probably would end up with a vote here in Congress. And that's a bad thing too. Let's not go through that process again.</p><p>We already voted wants to disapprove the president on the national security issue of the -- of the national emergency at the border. He then vetoed that. And then it wasn't overridden. Why go through that again?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: And Rob Portman vows, as do quite a few other Republican senators, Rand Paul, Mitch McConnell, a host of others, that this will not play out well, by all of a sudden using trade as a lever to go after what's the president argues, probably rightly, is going on at the border, and the Mexicans aren't doing anything about it.</p><p>But we already have a trade deal with Mexico. And they're concerned that the president is going to ruin the odds of getting that thing ultimately ratified.</p><p>Republican pollster Lee Carter is here.</p><p>I'm just wondering how big a tempest in a teapot this is.</p><p>LEE CARTER, REPUBLICAN POLLSTER: You know, this is Donald Trump. And this is the way that he does things. He negotiates hard and strong. And we all look at it like it's a game of chicken.</p><p>And it's terrifying to all of us, because we're looking at what he's actually doing and saying, oh, my gosh, here's the impact of these tariffs. It's going to be terrible.</p><p>What ends up happening is, Trump puts something on the table to take it off the table. And we're all reacting.</p><p>Now, what should the GOP do as a result? Because the tariffs are not in our best interest as Americans. We look at what might be happening to Chipotle, for example. They say it's going to cost them $15 million if the tariffs go in, that the price of a burrito is going to go up.</p><p>If we look at Jeeps, all kinds of things, there's going to be a huge impact.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm worried about the tequila thing. That one worries me.</p><p>CARTER: I am very, very worried about the tequila thing.</p><p>But I don't know as though it's ever going to become an issue, because when you look at what the president does...</p><p>CAVUTO: So it won't come to that?</p><p>CARTER: I don't think it's going to come to that.</p><p>But I think that the Republican lawmakers have to get out there and say that they oppose this just because it is -- if it does go through, they're going to have to go on record and say, we did oppose this, because it's going to have a huge impact on the American consumer.</p><p>CAVUTO: And we have a deal with the Mexicans and the Canadians. The Canadians are saying they're going to go through with the ratification process there, assuming that this will ultimately be passed here.</p><p>But this is a big monkey wrench here. And that's, I think, the concern these Republicans are raising. Or is it, like you said, just sort of theater to get what the president wants on the border? After all, the finance minister rushed here. We're learning that talks will ensue tomorrow 3:00-4:00 p.m. at the White House, the vice president overseeing them.</p><p>So maybe they get what they want.</p><p>CARTER: Let's hope that they get what they want, because, in the end, this could be a disaster for the American consumer.</p><p>And I think that we have seen the president do this kind of thing. He did it with China. He's done this kind of thing before. He puts crazy things out there that we're all terrified of. In the end, it's not what happens.</p><p>So, hopefully, we end up with a win-win for everybody. But who knows? And I think the Republican lawmakers have to go on record and say, don't do it, because...</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>Could I ask you now, how is the trade thing polling now? The president's poll numbers have ticked up. I know this is a day-by-day kind of a thing here. He's got undisputed loyalty among Republican voters. So what is your sense now, especially today, where we got the Federal Reserve saying, we have your back, if this really slows things down, and we will cut interest rates?</p><p>That's my impression of it at least. What do you think?</p><p>CARTER: Right.</p><p>What do I think about -- look, I think the president is actually much stronger than everybody likes to say out there. I have seen all kinds of the media covering right now that he is weaker than he has been.</p><p>He's not. He's got a very strong base. I don't think that any Democrat that's running right now could beat him today.</p><p>CAVUTO: Really?</p><p>Who would have the best chance? Everyone talks about Joe Biden, but I'm not so sure he even gets the nomination.</p><p>CARTER: Look, I always say at this stage in the game, the person that's going to win is the person you can't keep your eyes off of. It's the one that you just are so enamored with that you have got to know more about.</p><p>Joe Biden doesn't do that for people. Donald Trump does. We can't help but look at him and focus and react to him. We're not reacting to Joe Biden. Joe Biden put out -- he's a terrible candidate when he runs. It's very, very sad, because a very likable guy most the time, and then he goes out there and puts himself out there.</p><p>He puts this Green New Deal out there, for example. His messaging is terrible. It's boring. It makes you want to snore. And that is a big problem for him.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, that's because you're anti-Green New Deals, maybe. I don't know.</p><p>CARTER: I don't know.</p><p>CAVUTO: And $1.7 trillion over 10 years.</p><p>CARTER: I think that that could be a messaging land mine, if they would just let it be.</p><p>Instead of talking about the green part, they should be talking about the jobs and the economy -- economic benefits.

There is a possibility in a little bit we could be hearing from individual participants, maybe the president a little bit later in the dinner.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the pool spray that they like to call it of the room is done. And, of course, the feast is on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the feast was on at the corner of Wall and Broad? See what I did there. The feast was on the corner of Wall and Broad.</p><p>Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto.</p><p>So let's talk about stocks. Let's talk about the president, because what's going on over here is something that was really reflective of what was going on over there, partly, the president not backing down on his trade fight with Mexico now, amid tensions that are still high with China.</p><p>But those two were linked by the Federal Reserve, and the chairman, Jerome Powell, saying that the Central Bank is prepared to act to protect the economy if, in fact, things get much worse on the trade front, in other words, if things slow down.</p><p>The markets immediately pounced on that as a sign that the Fed has the president's back and has our back just in case things slip, slide away on the trade front, the Dow up about 511 points today. The Nasdaq, which had entered a correction territory, down about 10 percent, or a little bit more from its highs, coming back today.</p><p>We have got a lot going on here. We have got FOX team coverage with John Roberts in London, where the president is not letting Mexico off the hook. We have also got FOX Business Network's Susan Li on a Fed chief who doesn't want to be on the hook.</p><p>We begin with John.</p><p>Hey, John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Hey. Good evening to you, Neil.</p><p>The stock market didn't seem to care a whole lot about what the president said regarding Mexico. We should point out that one of the guests at that dinner at the ambassador's residence at Winfield House has got an early flight tomorrow morning.</p><p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be leaving it first light head back to the United States because he will be leading negotiations with the Mexican delegation in Washington, D.C., to see if they will do something, if they're willing to do something more to stop Central American migrants from moving through Mexico toward the U.S. border.</p><p>The president today, seemingly unimpressed with recent Mexican claims that they have stepped up apprehensions and deportations of Central American migrants who are in Mexico illegally, the president suggesting that those tariffs that are scheduled to go into effect on Monday at 5 percent are going to go into effect.</p><p>And the president also dismissing some talk about some Republicans in Congress that they may move to block those tariffs before they go into effect. Listen to what the president said earlier today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't think they will do that. I think, if they do, it's foolish. There's nothing more important than borders. I have had tremendous Republican support.</p><p>And, as you know, Mexico called. They want to meet. They're going to meet on Wednesday. Secretary Pompeo is going to be at the meeting, along with a few others that are very good at this. And we are going to see if we can do something. But I think it's more likely that the tariffs go on. And we will probably be talking during the time that the tariffs are on and they're going to be paid.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: You know, one of the big issues that was going on in talks between the United States and Britain, particularly this morning, when the president was sitting down with Theresa May, was Britain's plans to use Huawei equipment made in China as part of its new 5G system.</p><p>Originally, Britain wanted to use Huawei equipment in its 5G core, because basically they're selling it for pennies on the dollar against equipment from other countries. And there's a reason for that, many American officials believe, because China wants to get into the core of the new 5G systems because everything that flows through there can be sucked out and sent back to China.</p><p>So I'm told by national security officials that they have convinced Britain not to use Huawei in the core. But Britain, not wanting to really upset China, still wanted to use some Huawei equipment. But the president suggesting at the press conference with Theresa May earlier today that they do have an agreement on Huawei, though he wouldn't say exactly what it was.</p><p>Listen here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We're going to have absolutely an agreement on Huawei and everything else. We have an incredible intelligence relationship and we will be able to work out any differences. I think we're not going to have -- but we did discuss it. I see absolutely no limitations. We have never had limitations.</p><p>This is a truly great ally and partner, and we will have no problem with that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: And British officials suggest that there is some sort of an agreement. They didn't want to talk to us about the details before it goes to Parliament.</p><p>But the president was suggesting that, if the Britain was to use 5G equipment from Huawei in their systems, that that might kind of upset the apple cart in terms of intelligence-sharing with the United States. And that's clearly something that Britain doesn't want to broach -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, John Roberts traveling with the president in London right now.</p><p>Now, you might hear this back and forth on trade, and now the issues with the Mexicans and the Chinese and the slowdown that could follow. Well, why would start to rise in that environment? Precisely because the Federal Reserve said it has everybody's back in case that does happen.</p><p>To Susan Li on that.</p><p>Hey, Susan.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, you're exactly right, Neil, so the Federal Reserve providing cover today, telling the markets if trade wars hurt economic growth, we can adjust and cut interest rates, and that sent the stock market into rally mode.</p><p>Wall Street pricing in a near certainty that interest rates will be cut this year. That's close to 100 percent, the probability sitting at 97 percent. Big tech names were the main drags yesterday on concerns they will be broken up or at least investigated over antitrust concerns, coming back today, so recovery for Amazon, Google, parent to Alphabet, as well as, as you see, Apple, Netflix and Microsoft.</p><p>And when these heavyweight stocks move, they tend to take the broader markets along with them. Now, we do have the Mexican foreign minister, along with the Mexican economic minister, in Washington, D.C., right now. They are meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, but the Mexican side have threatened to retaliate if President Trump does go through with these tariffs on all Mexican goods that come into the U.S.</p><p>And President Trump did say this morning in that London press conference that tariffs will likely go up. Now, will that impact the U.S. economy? That really depends on how long tariffs stay on and how high they eventually get -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Susan, thank you very, very much.</p><p>With the Dow surge today, about 512.5 points, that is the best performance of the year for the Dow on this, after getting just clubbed on concerns about trade.</p><p>So what are we really looking at here?</p><p>Let's get the read from George Seay of Annandale Capital. He's the CEO there. We have also got Jackie DeAngelis with us, of course, FOX Business Network.</p><p>Jackie, a weird reaction, and then you can understand, yes, if rates come down, that will weather this. But obviously the Fed is prepared for something.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, the Fed changed the game today, Neil, I mean, basically coming out and telling President Trump that he's got their back and that a rate cut is definitely in the cards.</p><p>And that's something that investors wanted to hear. They thought it was on the table, but they didn't get the confidence or the language from the Fed that they wanted to hear. Today, that's what they got. So nothing's changed in terms of trade. In fact, the president said, come Monday, those 5 percent tariffs on Mexico will probably go into place.</p><p>That's what he told us today. But the market feels more confident that there's support for economic growth and that Jerome Powell is going to step up and do the right thing.</p><p>He made two mistakes. Basically, there was a communication mistake at the end of last year. He corrected that. Correcting the policy mistake, as the market sees it, would be implementing a cut.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>You know, the president criticized the rate hikes, as you know, George, saying that they were a little bit more than was needed. The latest talk is that maybe we could unwind two of the 10 rate hikes we have seen since this tightening cycle started with the former Federal Reserve chief beforehand.</p><p>Now I'm wondering where this goes, because you could also interpret from that the Fed is worried.</p><p>GEORGE SEAY, ANNANDALE CAPITAL: The Fed has to cut. The Fed went a bridge too far in December, and they have got to roll it back.</p><p>The problem is, Powell stuck his foot in his mouth so many times, that he's going to play the Chinese save face and spread it out a little bit before he starts cutting again. But the economy needs it. The 10-year has already told you he's going to cut because it's dropped about 80 basis points in a matter of months.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right. You're talking to a popular trading note that sort of telegraphs how mortgage rates are going to be. So that could be a good underpinning here, right?</p><p>SEAY: Absolutely. There's no alternative to stocks in the public markets. Bonds are no alternative.</p><p>CAVUTO: On the trade front, we're getting talk -- and you kind of touched on it -- that the U.S. and Mexico are looking to hold talks on this very issue, the better than $300 billion worth of Mexican imports that come in, on which we're going to put a 5 percent tariff anyway.</p><p>They're going to be chaired by the vice president, Jackie, on Wednesday.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Mm-hmm.</p><p>CAVUTO: So how does this all sort out?</p><p>DEANGELIS: Well, a lot of folks, at least market watchers, are saying, basically, they think the Mexicans have come here to make some sort of a deal, that they are willing and open. They don't necessarily want to see these tariffs go into place, even if the 5 percent does.</p><p>Remember, President Trump threatened that it could be 25 percent by October. So the feeling is that the Mexicans have come to the negotiating table. They are ready, willing and able, much more so, for example, than China.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we forget that a lot of these increases that we would likely see with the tariffs on Mexico would be immediate. In other words, they literally go from country to table in this case or grocery store.</p><p>So we would feel that 5 percent hike, but we would start feeling it more got to be more of a hike, right?</p><p>SEAY: Absolutely.</p><p>And we in Texas are very fond of trade with Mexico. And I thought we learned from the Germans in World War II you don't find a two-front war at one time. So I would like to see us get the Mexican distraction off the table as soon as possible and pivot to China, which is the real problem.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you worry, though, that it also could jeopardize the -- just how we go about future trade relations? We already have a deal with the Mexicans and the Canadians.</p><p>It was something that Rob Portman, the senator from Ohio, was concerned about when I talked to him earlier. I don't know if we have that. But he is -- he's worried. He's worried.</p><p>Take a look.</p><p>No, I apologize.</p><p>So, one of the things he had raised was this notion that you are jeopardizing a deal you fought hard to get. And now he's worried that this could leave some pretty muddy waters.</p><p>Do you agree?</p><p>SEAY: Well, the president's fearless, but he's also reckless and ad hoc. And that's a dangerous way to go about your business.</p><p>And I think that's what Senator Portman is getting it. And I think we need to tighten up the process a little more and be a little more methodical about how we lay out U.S. policy. It's a little bit too reflexive and knee-jerk.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>What do you mean -- Jackie, I was looking at a lot of U.S. companies that were concerned about China moved their operations to Mexico. Guadalajara was a popular location. And the irony now is that they're stuck behind the eight ball again.</p><p>DEANGELIS: It is. It is an irony.</p><p>And the market basically looked at this and said we had made progress with USMCA, and now we're talking about another tariff here that's not related to trade, per se, but it's related to the border. And it's related to immigration.</p><p>Let me give you an example, Neil. If the tariffs on Mexico went up to 25 percent by October, and you still had the 25 percent tariffs on China in place, for automakers, they're going to suffer as result of this because they're bring in the steel and the aluminum.</p><p>So a car that's made here, for example, could be almost $2,000 higher. A car that's imported from one of those places could be almost $5,000 higher. So there's going to be an impact on the consumer, on American companies. Somebody is going to have to figure out who's going to absorb it or how they're going to pass it along.</p><p>But, again, with Powell stepping up today, the market sort of took a sigh of relief. I will just add one final point, that we have seen the pendulum swing here, so I need to see more than one day of a rally to believe that everybody's comfortable with this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>Yes, we forgot the prior snapshots there.</p><p>Guys, I want to thank you both very, very much.</p><p>All right, you have Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple all being targeted right now by the United States government in one way, shape, or form. At first, when I heard about this, I thought it was the Europeans pouncing on these guys. It is us pouncing on these guys -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, if you think about it, they are some of the biggest names in technology. And right now, in Washington, D.C., they're all targets.</p><p>I'm talking about Google and Amazon, Facebook and Apple, which, for various reasons, have the attention of the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission, on everything from privacy violations to simply getting too big for their britches.</p><p>But is there a legal case to be made for breaking them up, or, worse, really, really breaking them up and giving them grief?</p><p>Judge Andrew Napolitano on all of that.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS JUDICIAL ANALYST: Well, it's very unusual, Neil, for the government to announce an investigation, an antitrust investigation, before it actually starts one.</p><p>Usually, it starts very quietly. It begins looking at public documents, and then it subpoenas documents behind the public documents. But, for some reason, this Justice Department, with a president -- a pro-business president, is doing something that even the Obama Justice Department never did, which is basically saying to those four tech giants, are you guys so big that you can't be trusted, and it's time for us, the government, to regulate you?</p><p>Now, what are they looking for? They're probably looking for predatory behavior. That is behavior that elbows out competition, so charging different price levels, punishing a customer because the customer also sells to somebody who doesn't sell through you.</p><p>All of that is potentially antitrust activity, providing -- that's the bottom line for all but one antitrust-type actions -- providing the consumer is hurt. So if there's predatory activity, if they're pricing themselves so low that their competition dies, but the consumer benefits from that by getting the same service at a lesser cost, the government...</p><p>CAVUTO: Right, or for free.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Correct. The government won't get involved.</p><p>The only time they don't have to prove that the consumer was harmed is price-fixing, if there's an actual agreement between them to fix prices. These four don't basically compete against each other. They're each in different fields.</p><p>So I don't think price-fixing is the goal here.</p><p>CAVUTO: But I'm old enough to remember when the government was going after Netscape, right?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Remember, you would separate your browser from your Internet product. Netscape is now long gone.</p><p>And it was market forces that made it go long gone, not scrutiny, government scrutiny.</p><p>And I'm just wondering if the markets can't correct whatever they're talking about. Or is the fear, they have got to address this because they will get so big for their britches, they can't be reined in?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Here's the -- here's the government's argument. I don't necessarily buy this, but here's the government's argument.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You are so big and so powerful, and you have so many customers, that the barriers to entry, the cost of competing with you is nearly impossible to amass. So nobody can effectively compete with you. Therefore, you...</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, that was the Amazon argument, right?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Correct. Correct.</p><p>CAVUTO: Retailers and others go out of business because you big-footed...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Correct. The argument...</p><p>CAVUTO: So, if the solution is then break it up, who determines that?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: A federal -- unless they agree to it, a federal judge.</p><p>I can't imagine that there would actually be a trial on this case. Normally, these cases end up with both sides claiming a victory. The Justice Department will get something. There will be a spinoff or something like that. And Amazon and Facebook and Google will say, see, they didn't touch us, we're still basically the same.</p><p>And guess who wins? This is for our buddy Stuart Varney. The lawyers win. You're talking about millions in legal fees over the course of many years of investigation.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, a lot of them have been working the Hill in the last year or so making sure they're funneling money to those in power to get their case known. They're going to be funneling some more, yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes. Yes.</p><p>I mean, it is surprising that a conservative Republican businessman, pro- business president, it is his Justice Department doing this. If we were talking about this three years ago, I wouldn't be surprised at all.</p><p>But I am surprised at this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I'm also surprised that they sent so many signals out before they started the investigation.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, that is weird.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: They like to catch people -- be careful -- unawares.</p><p>Everybody's aware.</p><p>CAVUTO: But you know, honestly, this, Judge. I know we have to go. But the breakup at AT&amp;T started under the Reagan administration Justice Department and the FTC.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes, it did. Yes, it did.</p><p>CAVUTO: Not that he had any direct role in it. But things can start under weird conditions.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You never know. And it spawned a revolution in telecommunications.</p><p>CAVUTO: Absolutely.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: That's not to say I'm in favor of the way it happened, but it did spawn that revolution.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right. That's a very good argument.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Those cell phones that used to be a brick in size and weight and cost $500, you now get it for free.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right. I'm too young to remember that. You keep telling me these stories.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Judge, thank you very, very much.</p><p>In the meantime, Hillary Clinton is warning 2020 Democrats they can lose the White House to hacking, that it could happen all over again.</p><p>Former DNC Chair Donna Brazile was saying that history could be repeating itself, but repeating what?</p><p>After this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Hillary Clinton would be president right now if it were not for Russia? It seems to be what she's implying, as the former first lady warns 2020 Democrats this week to be on the lookout for hacking yet again.</p><p>And it sure seems to be what the DNC Chair, now FOX News contributor Donna Brazile is saying. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CAVUTO: You had said that Russia is the reason Hillary Clinton isn't president. In other words, are you saying that Donald Trump is an illegitimate president?</p><p>DONNA BRAZILE, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I'm saying that Russia played a role in 2016.</p><p>And I say, while there are other factors that also led to Secretary Clinton fallen short of the 270 electoral votes, yes, I do believe that Russia was a major factor in the debacle in 2016.</p><p>CAVUTO: But you said Russia's the reason why she was denied the White House. Don't you think that that fuels an impression that, if not for Russia, Donald Trump would never have gotten to the White House?</p><p>BRAZILE: You know, before he deleted the tweet he put out about Russia's help, I do believe that the Russians sought to help Donald Trump and to defeat Hillary Clinton.</p><p>And there were other factors that led to Secretary Clinton not getting 270 electoral votes.</p><p>You know, Neil, here's what I push back on. I push back on those who don't believe that the interference caused havoc and created chaos and sowed discord. I push back on notion that a foreign country that sought to influence the election, they should have been reported.</p><p>I became chair of the Democratic Party for the second time in my life, interim chair, as a result of the hacking. And I think it's time that we put our Constitution, defend our democracy, ahead of partisan politics.</p><p>What are we going to do now?</p><p>CAVUTO: No, and I agree.</p><p>And we should both keep our eyes, both parties, on what happens in 2020 and whether the Russians try this again. They likely will.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRAZILE: Some other nation, Neil. Some other nation.</p><p>CAVUTO: No, but you're a powerful person in the Democratic Party as well. When you are all but saying, if not for Russia, Hillary Clinton would be in the White House, that addresses nothing about her lousy campaign or refusal to go to these big manufacturing states, right?</p><p>BRAZILE: Neil, can I say something?</p><p>CAVUTO: Sure.</p><p>BRAZILE: When I talk, I speak for myself. I don't need you to interpret or anyone else to interpret what I said.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: No, no, I'm quoting you. Donna, I'm quoting you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Donna, I'm quoting you. Russia is the reason Hillary Clinton isn't president.</p><p>BRAZILE: I do believe that Russia is one of the major factors why she's not in the White House. But there are other mitigating factors. And I said that as well.</p><p>Unfortunately, some people take the period and end, and not the comma, which I continued when I had that interview on Saturday.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. So you're saying now that, regardless of your concerns about Russia or anything, do you -- because I have talked to some Democrats on this show who do not think that Donald Trump is the legitimately elected president of the United States.</p><p>It's amazing to me after all this time, but do you believe that?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRAZILE: Neil, let me say something.</p><p>I have worked on a lot of campaigns. And I accept the fact that Donald Trump is the president of the United States. I'm not litigating what happened in 2016.</p><p>What I do believe is that, if we don't work today to protect our elections, we're going to have another repeat of 2016. And, yes, when a foreign country comes to help your campaign, you should report it, and not have more than 100 contacts with a hostile foreign nation just because you want to get the -- quote, unquote -- \"dirt.\"</p><p>Well, if you want dirt, go to Home Depot and Lowe's and buy it by the 40- pound bag that I do. But don't utilize that information to sow discord, create chaos and false political narratives, which I do believe hurt Hillary Clinton's ability to get her message out.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CAVUTO: But let's be clear.</p><p>Donna Brazile, like her a lot. That's fine. And she is a contributor here. That's great. She did say, if not for Russia, Hillary Clinton would be in the -- in the White House. And like I also said, many Democrats harbor that view that Donald Trump wasn't the duly elected, legitimate president of the United States.</p><p>They will not let go of this. It's time to debate this -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: If China is saying that it's willing to talk the United States and get back to the trade discussions, then why is it urging its citizens not to come to this country and spend their tourism dollars?</p><p>Something's up. What?</p><p>After this.</p><p>CAVUTO: That little chat got a lot of reaction from a lot of viewers.</p><p>One that I really liked concerning Donna Brazile and I talking about whether the president is the duly elected leader of this country, saying: \"Cavuto, you like the sound of your own voice, but face it. Donald Trump is not the duly elected president of the United States.\"</p><p>And the back and forth goes.</p><p>Let's get reaction from GOP strategist Noelle Nikpour. We got Catalina magazine publisher Cathy Areu, and last, but not least, Kat Timpf.</p><p>On the weekend, a lot of you have been always kind to help out with the \"Cavuto Live\" show on Saturday. And how many times have we had -- in your case, Cathy, a lot of times -- I will ask Democrats directly, do you think Donald Trump is the duly elected, legitimate president of the United States?</p><p>And with the exception I think of Eric Swalwell, who said, no, not really, I think, they bounce around it. What do you make of it?</p><p>KATHERINE TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think that whenever you're going through something tough, it's always easier to blame somebody else.</p><p>I think that people do that all the time in all areas of life. And I think we certainly saw Hillary Clinton do that and the Democrats do that. But there are so many other reasons that you could -- if you looked at yourself, why you would have lost that election.</p><p>Hillary was a terrible candidate, for example. People wanted to shake things up, for example. You can explain it so many ways, that I feel like blaming Russia is a cop-out. People use cop-outs all the time. So I'm not completely shocked by this. But it's a cop-out.</p><p>CAVUTO: The line was that Russia is the reason Hillary Clinton isn't president.</p><p>Cathy, do you think that's true?</p><p>CATHY AREU, PUBLISHER, CATALINA: Russia interfered with our elections. That was in the Mueller report.</p><p>CAVUTO: No doubt. No one has debated that.</p><p>AREU: No doubt.</p><p>CAVUTO: Did it change the outcome?</p><p>AREU: We will never know.</p><p>CAVUTO: Oh, for God's sakes. All right.</p><p>AREU: Three million more people voted for Hillary Clinton. That's a fact. We have the Electoral College. Donald Trump, President Trump, wasn't for the Electoral College.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: That's not my question.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: No, wait.</p><p>No matter how you feel about the president -- and God knows many of his fans are not fans of mine.</p><p>AREU: Our system elected him and made him president.</p><p>CAVUTO: The Electoral College. Did the Russians affect the Electoral College, yes or no?</p><p>AREU: The Electoral...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: See?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: This is me like blaming my weight on a thyroid issue. Stop it.</p><p>AREU: They interfered with our elections.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Noelle, what do you think?</p><p>NOELLE NIKPOUR, REPUBLICAN FUND-RAISER: I think we have two different Americas.</p><p>I think that we have an America that believes that the election was stolen. And I think that you have an America...</p><p>CAVUTO: And then never the two shall meet, right?</p><p>NIKPOUR: No. And I think you have an America that believes for once that their needs have been heard, meaning the working-class men and women, a lot of the union voters.</p><p>So I think that you have these two divisions, and they don't ever seem to be coming together. And I think that the narrative coming from the people that feel like the election was stolen are never going to get in and accept Trump.</p><p>CAVUTO: I just think that if you can't let go of this, and you're going to question the legitimacy of this president for forever long, no matter how you feel about him, that's not helping anyone, is it?</p><p>TIMPF: No, I think it's hurting actually. I think it's hurting because if you don't acknowledge your mistakes, you can never learn from them.</p><p>AREU: We're talking about President Trump acknowledging mistakes, a man who doesn't apologize acknowledging...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Cathy, you're going off-topic.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: No matter how you feel about him, you cannot just recognize him with his Electoral College vote win as the legitimate president of the United States.</p><p>AREU: He doesn't act presidential.</p><p>CAVUTO: That's -- for God's sakes!</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TIMPF: That's not what we're talking about. We're not asking, what do you think about his hair? We're not asking, what do you think about everything he said?</p><p>We're talking about this very specific issue. Was he or was he not elected...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AREU: Well, it's a divided country and the Russians interfered.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: OK. You just said that Hillary Clinton won by three million votes in the popular vote.</p><p>AREU: Right. Every vote counts. We're Americans, right?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Fine. Fine. Fine.</p><p>But our system is electoral vote, P.S., OK?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AREU: Yes. Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, if he won in the system that counted, the electoral vote -- we would all campaign differently if it was just based on popular vote -- can you at least acknowledge that the Russians didn't affect that electoral vote? Or do you think they did?</p><p>NIKPOUR: Yes, it was proven. It was proven.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Maybe she was a lousy campaigner. Maybe she should have gone to states...</p><p>AREU: Three million more people liked her.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: You never answer my question.</p><p>Maybe she should have gone to Pennsylvania more, should have gone to some of these other crucial battleground states more. And she didn't.</p><p>AREU: At the end of the day, more people wanted her to be president than the other guy.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: The system is the electoral vote.</p><p>AREU: That's America. Everyone believes that their vote counts.</p><p>CAVUTO: So let me ask. If it flipped around, all right, and Donald Trump loses the electoral vote, but wins the popular vote, and let's say he wins it by three million, would you say, way to go?</p><p>AREU: Yes, because...</p><p>CAVUTO: You would not!</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AREU: I absolutely would. I would.</p><p>CAVUTO: Stop it.</p><p>AREU: I would too.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Noelle.</p><p>AREU: And I stand by that. I stand by that.</p><p>NIKPOUR: Oh, my gosh.</p><p>I mean, you have got to look at how desperate Hillary was anyway. Bernie Sanders, look what the Democratic Party did within Bernie Sanders to disqualify him.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, you're going off-topic now.</p><p>What I'm saying -- see, fair and balanced off-topic.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: What I'm just saying is that it's two plus-years after this, people still pointing the fingers that this guy, if not for the Russians, he wouldn't be president, if not for the Russians, he would never have gotten there.</p><p>And he won fair and square. But I find it very hard.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>AREU: He keeps talking about the darn election and reminding all of us.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: You're talking about it. You can't let go. He won it. And maybe you beat him this time in 2020.</p><p>AREU: Maybe he knows he stole it, and that's why he keeps bringing it up.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: He knows he stole it.</p><p>TIMPF: I won a spelling bee in the third grade, and I still bring that up, so sometimes wins mean a lot.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, that's actually a very good point.</p><p>TIMPF: I did win that spelling bee.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes. Yes.</p><p>AREU: I didn't win mine.</p><p>TIMPF: I know you did, girl.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: I think you all have issues that need addressing.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: But, seriously, guys, thank you very, very much. But I think we just got to move on here, folks. I mean, the more we go back in the past and say, oh -- it's time to move on.</p><p>We will have more to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX BAUCUS, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO CHINA: Joe knows that China is a real threat. Joe spent a lot of time in China and with Xi Jinping when he was vice president.</p><p>I might add that he knows more about China than most Americans do.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: But do you agree with that sentiment, that it's not competition?</p><p>BAUCUS: Oh, clearly, it's competition. There's no question it's competition.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: So, did he misspeak? Do you he think he just misspoke?</p><p>BAUCUS: He knows there's competition with China. That's not an issue.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Max Baucus is a close personal friend of the former vice president, Max Baucus, of course, our former ambassador to China.</p><p>He thinks that the vice president was just misunderstood, that essentially China, despite the vice president arguing at the time that it wasn't competition for us, it is competition for us, and Joe Biden knows it.</p><p>Anyway, I was confused, but I want to get the read from Gordon Chang, author of \"The Coming Collapse of China,\" other great reads, prescient reads, at that, on the threat that the China faces here.</p><p>I think that was the ambassador's way of sort of walking back or trying to walk back what could be one of the more significant verbal miscues from the former vice president, China's not competition for us. What did you make of that?</p><p>GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA\": Yes, that comment from Vice President Biden was completely indefensible, because, as Senator Baucus noted, China is competition.</p><p>One could say, look, we will prevail in this competition. One could say, we're better. But to say it's no competition at all is just clearly afactual. And I think that this is going to be an important issue.</p><p>People are talking about his son's investments in China and all the rest of it. Put that aside. That comment alone is going to be and one we're going to hear during the campaign if he ends up being the nominee.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, there's no doubt, looking just at the economic numbers, that just how all of a sudden it is has amassed to become the world's second largest economic power, and that it can control its economy to the degree it does, rig the trading system to the degree this president wants to address that, whether you agree with his approach or not.</p><p>But to say that it is not the competition? I don't know. I think that's something that, whether you like the former vice president or not, that it's going to come back to bite him. I mean, again and again, that's going to come up.</p><p>CHANG: Yes, China is a multifaceted challenge to us. It's across the board. It's military, diplomatic, ideological, technological.</p><p>And China's threat is actually existential, because just in the middle of last month, Neil, People's Daily, the most authoritative source in China, said, look, we're in a people's war with the United States. They branded us an enemy.</p><p>We have got to understand the consequences of that, because we Americans, we don't think very much of propaganda because we have a legitimate government. But when you have an illegitimate government, like China's, propaganda is absolutely critical.</p><p>CAVUTO: Let me ask you, then, about some of these other things that the Chinese are saying that don't jibe with things they're actually doing.</p><p>One is that they're ramping up their own chip industry, which seems to be bracing for the possibility they won't be dealing with ours, then that is warning citizens against traveling to the U.S. What do you make of all that?</p><p>CHANG: You know, this travel warning is irrational from an economic point of view. They're the smaller economy, and actually much smaller. They claim a $13.82 trillion economy last year. That's probably exaggerated.</p><p>We had about $20.5 trillion of gross domestic product last year. And, also, they are the far weaker economy because we are in reality growing faster than they are. And we're just not trade-dependent like they are. And for them to say that, that is just irrational, unless you view it in the context of political problems inside of Beijing, where that then starts to make sense.</p><p>And we need to start to understand what's going on with Xi Jinping, what's going on in the senior leadership, because it is looking really scary dangerous, when they say things like that really are not in China's interests.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we will see what happens.</p><p>Gordon Chang, \"The Coming Collapse of China\" and many, many other prescient reads on the threat that China proposes, competitive and otherwise, thank you, Gordon.</p><p>CHANG: Thanks, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: In the meantime, should the government be taking care of all of your college loans and responsibilities? There is a company way to fix this -- after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Universal public, technical school, community college and four-year college for every kid in America.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Free community college.</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Debt-free college.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We should make public colleges and universities tuition-free.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, it sounds good. You would have to foot the bill for that, of course, but there is sort of a private industry way to address this. And doesn't Wal-Mart know?</p><p>We got Scott Martin here, Wall Street watcher extraordinaire.</p><p>Scott, explain what Wal-Mart wants to do.</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT: It's an interesting one -- interesting one, Neil.</p><p>I think what I like about what they want to do vs. what we heard in the sound there was that there's actually an investment being made here in the worker, Neil, where they will help folks, kids especially at a high school, with SAT prep, and certainly college debt that they may incur, provided they work at Wal-Mart.</p><p>And instead of just, say, handing out $1,000, as Cory Booker has talked to, about every baby born in this country, or New Jersey, certainly, that needs to go to college, you actually have to do something to get that reward.</p><p>And you actually have to perform, let's say, in your job for Wal-Mart to help you out. So, therefore, there's a little bit more of a measurable, say, tangible return that one is to get, in Wal-Mart's case theirs, to get on this layout that they're going to give, vs., say, just giving folks money and saying, hey, do what you will with it.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, now, this dollar day plan -- and there are other features to it -- I mean, where they're going to pay $1 a day and something that goes forward to that, I mean, that's a long way to pay off what is $30,000 to $50,000 to $75,000 a year for tuition and room and board at some colleges.</p><p>But their approach is, start early and often, and we have got your back. It seems that they're bearing that and not the U.S. government.</p><p>MARTIN: Correct.</p><p>And I think what they also do, Neil, is, you have a kid or guy or gal in high school that starts out at Wal-Mart as, you know, an entry-level employee, minimum wage, which, as we know, the left, Bernie Sanders recently going after Wal-Mart about minimum wage changes needing to happen.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>MARTIN: But you start out as an entry-level employee, but you're getting some schooling along the way, you're getting some SAT test prep.</p><p>And so you're -- in theory, you're starting to improve your mental capacity. And, therefore, the theory is, as it's worked over the course of Wal-Mart's history, those folks rise up in the company, being Wal-Mart, the nation's largest employer, over a million-plus employees, 1.5 million.</p><p>So you have an ability that these kids, these entry-level employees with the school that you're going to help them pay for, will help -- help them rise up in the company and make more of themselves, provided that they stay at work there.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, I was reading somewhere -- I don't know if the figures are exact. So I will just say that with also $4 prescription drug plans and the like, Wal-Mart has done more to address medical and drug-related inflation than almost any company on the planet.</p><p>But, having said that, I'm not as pro- or anti-Wal-Mart, but there are private industry solutions to a lot of this that wouldn't rely on the U.S. government making it happen.</p><p>MARTIN: That's true.</p><p>And let's face it. As a publicly traded, shareholder-based employer, as Wal-Mart is, they look at the books. They actually have the X's and O's and profit and loss that they take into consideration when they have to do this, unlike the government, which I know is trying to help people and they're trying to do the right thing.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>MARTIN: But when you have the lender of the last resort, who is you and me and the folks at home, and the money keeps coming in no matter what, maybe you're not so careful with that money.</p><p>I guarantee you at Wal-Mart is, and that's why they're making the investments in their people, the prescription drug things that you mentioned, because they know that it's going to pay off and reward an investment return. And that's why I think this is an important development.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, it is an alternative.</p><p>Scott Martin, always good catching up with you, my friend. Thank you.</p><p>MARTIN: See you.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, you think the president is having problems with the Mexicans with the latest tariffs against Mexico he's proposing, you should see the grief he's getting from many in his own party.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ROB PORTMAN (R-OH): It looks like the statute that he's using to invoke these tariffs, which never have been used before for tariffs, by the way, probably would end up with a vote here in Congress. And that's a bad thing too. Let's not go through that process again.</p><p>We already voted wants to disapprove the president on the national security issue of the -- of the national emergency at the border. He then vetoed that. And then it wasn't overridden. Why go through that again?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: And Rob Portman vows, as do quite a few other Republican senators, Rand Paul, Mitch McConnell, a host of others, that this will not play out well, by all of a sudden using trade as a lever to go after what's the president argues, probably rightly, is going on at the border, and the Mexicans aren't doing anything about it.</p><p>But we already have a trade deal with Mexico. And they're concerned that the president is going to ruin the odds of getting that thing ultimately ratified.</p><p>Republican pollster Lee Carter is here.</p><p>I'm just wondering how big a tempest in a teapot this is.</p><p>LEE CARTER, REPUBLICAN POLLSTER: You know, this is Donald Trump. And this is the way that he does things. He negotiates hard and strong. And we all look at it like it's a game of chicken.</p><p>And it's terrifying to all of us, because we're looking at what he's actually doing and saying, oh, my gosh, here's the impact of these tariffs. It's going to be terrible.</p><p>What ends up happening is, Trump puts something on the table to take it off the table. And we're all reacting.</p><p>Now, what should the GOP do as a result? Because the tariffs are not in our best interest as Americans. We look at what might be happening to Chipotle, for example. They say it's going to cost them $15 million if the tariffs go in, that the price of a burrito is going to go up.</p><p>If we look at Jeeps, all kinds of things, there's going to be a huge impact.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm worried about the tequila thing. That one worries me.</p><p>CARTER: I am very, very worried about the tequila thing.</p><p>But I don't know as though it's ever going to become an issue, because when you look at what the president does...</p><p>CAVUTO: So it won't come to that?</p><p>CARTER: I don't think it's going to come to that.</p><p>But I think that the Republican lawmakers have to get out there and say that they oppose this just because it is -- if it does go through, they're going to have to go on record and say, we did oppose this, because it's going to have a huge impact on the American consumer.</p><p>CAVUTO: And we have a deal with the Mexicans and the Canadians. The Canadians are saying they're going to go through with the ratification process there, assuming that this will ultimately be passed here.</p><p>But this is a big monkey wrench here. And that's, I think, the concern these Republicans are raising. Or is it, like you said, just sort of theater to get what the president wants on the border? After all, the finance minister rushed here. We're learning that talks will ensue tomorrow 3:00-4:00 p.m. at the White House, the vice president overseeing them.</p><p>So maybe they get what they want.</p><p>CARTER: Let's hope that they get what they want, because, in the end, this could be a disaster for the American consumer.</p><p>And I think that we have seen the president do this kind of thing. He did it with China. He's done this kind of thing before. He puts crazy things out there that we're all terrified of. In the end, it's not what happens.</p><p>So, hopefully, we end up with a win-win for everybody. But who knows? And I think the Republican lawmakers have to go on record and say, don't do it, because...</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>Could I ask you now, how is the trade thing polling now? The president's poll numbers have ticked up. I know this is a day-by-day kind of a thing here. He's got undisputed loyalty among Republican voters. So what is your sense now, especially today, where we got the Federal Reserve saying, we have your back, if this really slows things down, and we will cut interest rates?</p><p>That's my impression of it at least. What do you think?</p><p>CARTER: Right.</p><p>What do I think about -- look, I think the president is actually much stronger than everybody likes to say out there. I have seen all kinds of the media covering right now that he is weaker than he has been.</p><p>He's not. He's got a very strong base. I don't think that any Democrat that's running right now could beat him today.</p><p>CAVUTO: Really?</p><p>Who would have the best chance? Everyone talks about Joe Biden, but I'm not so sure he even gets the nomination.</p><p>CARTER: Look, I always say at this stage in the game, the person that's going to win is the person you can't keep your eyes off of. It's the one that you just are so enamored with that you have got to know more about.</p><p>Joe Biden doesn't do that for people. Donald Trump does. We can't help but look at him and focus and react to him. We're not reacting to Joe Biden. Joe Biden put out -- he's a terrible candidate when he runs. It's very, very sad, because a very likable guy most the time, and then he goes out there and puts himself out there.</p><p>He puts this Green New Deal out there, for example. His messaging is terrible. It's boring. It makes you want to snore. And that is a big problem for him.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, that's because you're anti-Green New Deals, maybe. I don't know.</p><p>CARTER: I don't know.</p><p>CAVUTO: And $1.7 trillion over 10 years.</p><p>CARTER: I think that that could be a messaging land mine, if they would just let it be.</p><p>Instead of talking about the green part, they should be talking about the jobs and the economy -- economic benefits. That's not what they're doing.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: But the hard left, they're not pleased with his plan. They said it's too moderate at $1.7 trillion over 10 years.</p><p>CARTER: Well, they're all running against each other right now. So let's see how that plays out.</p><p>CAVUTO: But, normally, a strong economy would benefit the incumbent.</p><p>Are you surprised that the president, with this -- no one could debate the strength of this economy.</p><p>CARTER: Nobody could debate that.</p><p>CAVUTO: But he's not doing that well. He's fine, don't get me wrong, but what's holding it back? All the other stuff?</p><p>CARTER: All the other stuff.</p><p>I mean, people can't help but -- you can't separate the person from the policy. You can't separate the personality from the problems.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>CARTER: And so people have a lot of problems with his personality, even if they're feeling that they're -- that...</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>CARTER: And it's almost like they're having trouble giving him credit for it. It's like, I can't say I feel better about the economy and it's Trump's.</p><p>CAVUTO: Not happening.</p><p>CARTER: Yes, not going to happen.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, it's weird.</p><p>Lee Carter, great seeing you again.</p><p>CARTER: Good to be here.</p><p>CAVUTO: Of course, that big powwow with the Mexican finance minister at the White House, all that slated for tomorrow. We will see what happens there.</p><p>Here comes \"The Five\" right now.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

How should the system be cleaned up?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Paris-based court in July ruled against the French government and in favour of Google declaring that the tech titan did not have to pay $ubn in back taxes made by channelling sales through Ireland. The legal reasoning hinged on highly technical points about the tax status of Google's French operations, which had been raided months earlier by police.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At first, it looked as if the French government would tamely accept this. But, in a surprise move reflecting widespread frustration, the new Macron government came up with a bold riposte early in September.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Finance minister Bruno Le Maire announced that Paris and Berlin were mounting a joint offensive to tax internet giants, by in future taxing the likes of Amazon, Google and Facebook on their massive revenues rather than the meagre profits they declared.</p><p>The snag is that, under EU treaties, tax measures require all members to back change, hence the question becomes whether countries such as Luxembourg and Ireland with low-tax regimes favouring the behemoths would be forced to buckle and shift policy.</p><p>There has long been confusion among governments trying to wring more tax out of recalcitrant international corporates. States are united in their desire to remedy a situation where the world's biggest companies get away with paying close to zero taxes, thereby eroding their countries' fragile tax bases. However, they also compete with each other to offer firms favourable tax treatments, disagree about how best to make progress and are mired in their own tax legislation, a thicket of fiendishly complex and sometimes obsolete tax rules that are wide open to abuse. With no one contemplating upending the entire global tax regulations and starting afresh, meaningful reform has proved slow and difficult.</p><p>According to the European Commission, between \u20ac5obn and \u20ac7obn a year is lost by EU states through tax avoidance. The battle over international tax is being fought on the one side by states, operating individually and through multilateral organisations, notably the EU, the OECD and G20 countries and the UN. On the other side are corporates backed by legions of professional tax specialists; the latter, who sometime advise governments too, have created an industry seeking out loopholes, exemptions and other means to minimise tax bills. Meanwhile in the UK, an All-Party Parliamentary Group on Responsible Tax has been set up. The chair, veteran MP Margaret Hodge, describes this as a \"unique forum\" bringing together people with views from across the spectrum.</p><p>Looking on are the public whose growing ire against big companies' failure to contribute is reportedly one of the wellsprings of populism. And the debate is regularly jolted by wholesale leaks, such as the Panama Papers, which reveal the eye-popping scale of dealings through shell companies and other devices.</p><p>The framework of international tax law dates back to early last century; debate over how multinational companies use the system is doubtless as old. One perennial problem has been the treatment for tax purposes of cross-border activities within a company, so-called transfer pricing. For example, what would be the market \"price\" for a UK subsidiary to pay for an engine part design pioneered by its parent car company in Detroit if the two were not connected? And how do you prevent manipulation of the figures simply to minimise the tax liability?</p><p>With the arrival of the digital economy in the past 20 years, these issues have become exacerbated, with \"digitalisation posing serious challenges to the existing international tax framework\", according to Mannheim University's Marcel Olbert and Christoph Spengel, writing in World Tax Journal. Unlike traditional bricks and mortar businesses, the digital world tends to operate seamlessly across borders and relies to an unprecedented extent on intangibles such as technical knowledge or databases. If you want to put a couple of items in your Amazon basket, you can do so even if you are on a safari trip to South Africa.</p><p>\"Taxation of e-commerce is problematic due to anonymity, difficulty in determining the amount of tax, lack of paper trails, tax havens, companies incurring liability in multiple countries and tax administrations' lack of capacity,\" says Eli Hadzhieva of think-tank Dialogue for Europe, in a paper issued by the European Parliament.</p><p>A specific digital problem is that a standard internet model is to give away a service (such as internet searching) while deriving revenues from the extensive data provided for free by users, which makes it hard to determine in which tax jurisdiction value is created.</p><p>Critics argue that every transnational business relies on the activities of the state, not least for the enforcement of their contracts. Yet they can make themselves virtually stateless. (When one told Margaret Hodge two years ago that it would be moving its headquarters to the UK, it admitted shamefacedly that this would create fewer than a dozen jobs.)</p><p>In addition, there are at least two issues associated particularly with Big Tech. First, owing largely to so-called network effects, the tech industry tends towards monopoly, with a few massive players such as Amazon, Facebook and Google dwarfing their competitors. Second, these companies are adept at exploiting opportunities to get around regulations in a way not directly related to their digital origins. So Uber's business model relies not simply on its network and slick apps, but also on its treatment of drivers as self-employed, which means the company is exempt from providing them with many employee benefits. Similarly, up to one-third of the price gap between Airbnb and hotel rooms is due to the more lenient tax treatment.</p><p>In international tax matters, the devil is in the most granular detail. However, some general moves would improve matters. One is to increase transparency. Clearer rules on where value is created and tighter rules defining where a business operates would also help.</p><p>Aside from the EU - where the new French-led initiative has shaken things up - the most active efforts to reform the international system have been by the OECD and G20 countries. While their remit has been far broader than the EU's, they have painstakingly built a consensus. In 2012, the G20 tasked the OECD to develop an action plan, which it duly did the following year. Its base erosion and profit sharing (BEPS) package, designed to be implemented by governments domestically and through tax treaty, was agreed in 2015. Featured among the 15 actions were mandatory disclosure rules, guidelines on permanent establishment (defining where a firm is resident) and addressing the tax challenges of the digital economy.</p><p>Many commentators have urged that specific measures should be created for the mighty tech sector. But this idea has lost favour. Olbert explains: \"Some individual nations have enacted tax laws targeting digital transactions. Yet the OECD/G20 and EU members share the view that a special tax regime is neither feasible nor effective.\"</p><p>As OECD tax expert Pascal Saint-Amans says: \"The findings are that there is no such thing as digital companies rather than digitalisation of the economy. There may not therefore be a solution for the digital economy but we will need to draw on features of the digital economy when we revise the system.\"</p><p>The OECD and G20 have given countries another three years to negotiate, with an interim report by the OECD taskforce due next spring. The OECD is also considering expanding the definition of permanent establishment and developing an interim measure called alternative tax on e-sales.</p><p>Olbert adds: \"Everyone is aware of the need for action. However, little information is published as there are no binding official statements on whether the tax principles will be revised to meet the challenges of the digital economy.\"</p><p>Put simply, countries are not progressing determinedly with a common purpose towards tax reform. While they are lending their weight to the OECD plans, they simultaneously have an eye out for their own narrow interests. Ireland exploited the notorious double Irish tax device, which allowed companies to take advantage of its low tax jurisdiction, until 2015, and Luxembourg has favourable rules, which explain why so many routine internet transactions are charged there.</p><p>Countries famously negotiate sweetheart deals with big corporates and are also competing over tax rates and making it easy to set up business. As Rita Cunha, policy researcher for the APPG on Responsible Tax at the Policy Institute at King's College London, explains: \"Countries are making progress tackling BEPS but it is slow. Some countries are a little bit half-hearted. Everyone seems to be competing to attract investment. So there is always a tension there. I don't think that will disappear - I think of it as a game.\"</p><p>Asked if the UK is beyond reproach, Hodge declares flatly: \"No.\" She says: \"Governments are facing both ways. The UK could very easily use its powers over our overseas territories and crown dependencies to force strong transparency so you know who owns what. These are really important jurisdictions that facilitate aggressive tax avoidance and evasion, and money laundering.\" And she characterises the prime minister's fear of offending any of these jurisdictions as \"pathetic\".</p><p>So what of Brexit? It surely will be tempting for the UK, as it scours the world for valuable trade deals, to start to offer tempting tax treatments once it is no longer bound by EU rules from 2019, especially if the EU tightens its rules. Hodge thinks this - the \"Singapore option\" - is possible but unlikely. Apart from anything else, she believes the UK would face swift retaliation from the remainder of the EU and that the Treasury would be reluctant to forego the revenue. \"I think they are crying wolf, but I may have to change my mind on that,\" she admits.</p><p>Behind the debate about international tax lies one fundamental unanswered question: do corporates face a moral duty in paying tax or is it rather simply a matter of adhering to the law and rules?</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Hodge insists there is a moral dimension. Paying a fair proportion of taxes chimes with companies' now ubiquitous corporate social responsibility programmes, for example. And there is a more pragmatic reason: failing to be seen to pay your fair share can make a company's reputation toxic, especially among the young.</p><p>She has another argument too. \"It will always be impossible to devise a tax system without ambiguity. No system can be black and white in every instance.\"</p><p>So if the tax system is not to become an interminable game where the corporates simply stay one jump ahead of the tax authorities as they close one loophole after another, there has to be some moral component.</p><p>It's a persuasive argument. But, as Hodge concedes, she has never met a corporate representative or tax adviser who agrees with her. ?</p><p>'Everyone seems to be competing \u00eeo attract investment. So there is always a tension there. I don't think that will disappear - I think of it as a game</p><p>Rita Cunha, King's College London</p><p>Some nations have tax laws targeting digital transactions.

And a ruling against the U.S. may have far-reaching implications on both tax and trade policy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It s known as the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income provision, or FDII. The provision, in theory, would provide a low tax rate for U.S. companies with overseas profits from intangible assets such as patents, licenses, or trademarks. It s an incentive for multinationals that rely on easily transferable intellectual property, like Apple, Inc., to locate their assets and profits in the U.S. rather than a low-tax jurisdiction or tax haven.</p><p>But the new tax break has run afoul of European trade ministers who say it amounts to a subsidy on exports under WTO rules. The tax bill is only a few months old, but it has led many to prepare for a challenge from the international trade regulator and to consider how Congress and the administration would react.</p><p> If I was a betting man and I don t bet on anything, but this would be one bet that I would take that it s almost certain that a challenge is going to come,  said Douglas Stransky, a tax partner at Sullivan &amp; Worcester in Boston.</p><p>That feeling among international tax professionals stems from the fact that the European Union has a successful history of challenging similar U.S. tax provisions going back three decades.</p><p>Export provisions like the FDII have been enacted, and then scrapped, because of challenges in international trade bodies. It started in 1971 with the Domestic International Sales Corporation, or DISC, export-tax benefit, then came the Foreign Sales Corporation in 1984, and then an extraterritorial-income-exclusion provision, or ETI, in 2000.</p><p>Those provisions met resistance from U.S. trade partners, and Congress replaced one with another successive version. In 2004, Congress eliminated the ETI, replacing it with a deduction for domestic manufacturers without running afoul of the WTO because it wasn t contingent on exports. Congress repealed that tax break, known as Section 199, in last year s tax-code overhaul.</p><p>The new provision would offer U.S.-based C-corporations an effective tax rate of 13.125 percent until 2025 on foreign royalties from assets like patents, licenses, and trademarks. After 2025, the rate rises to 16.4 percent. That s still a big break, considering that companies previously would have had to pay the full corporate tax rate, which currently sits at 21 percent, down from 35 percent before the tax overhaul.</p><p>The FDII tax break comes as countries on both sides of the Atlantic go through major changes in their international tax policy. Ireland, once a popular jurisdiction for multinational tech and pharmaceutical companies to park their foreign subsidiaries, is set in 2020 to scrap its so-called  double-Irish  tax maneuver, which allowed companies to lower their taxable income by setting up an Irish-registered entity in a tax haven that housed their intellectual property and a second Irish-based company that licensed those assets. </p><p>But even before Congress passed the tax bill in December, European trade ministers were already up in arms over the provision. Five European officials sent a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/366895201/Letter-from-six-EU-finance-ministers-to-US-Treasury-Secretary\"> letter </url> to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin arguing that the bill s treatment of international intangible income was an export subsidy that violated WTO rules.</p><p> The design of the regime is notably different from accepted IP regimes by providing a deduction for income derived from intangible assets other than patents and copyright software, such as branding, market power, and market-related intangibles,  the letter said.</p><p>Stransky said the U.S. could argue that since the provision covers only C-corporations, not other entities like S-corporations and partnerships, its effect is limited. More so, foreign companies could always establish a U.S. subsidiary and take advantage of the tax break, he said.</p><p>An aide to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said in an email that the committee is confident the tax provisions are compatible with international tax rules and standards.</p><p>But if European officials lodge a complaint and the WTO agrees, Congress and the administration would have to make a choice about how to react. In the past, when the U.S. lost fights over the export provisions, Congress simply repealed them. But the Trump administration may not react the same way as the Bush administration and the Bush-era Congress did with the ETI, for example. </p><p>If a decision comes down after President Trump leaves office, or if there is a Democratic majority in Congress, the calculus may change. Democrats may wish to simply repeal the provision, though that may pose its own problems as it could remove the incentive for companies to keep intellectual property in the country, again raising the spectre of multinationals shifting profits overseas.</p><p>The WTO dispute-settlement body may allow retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods, but the Trump administration may just accept that cost and continue implementing the tax break.
